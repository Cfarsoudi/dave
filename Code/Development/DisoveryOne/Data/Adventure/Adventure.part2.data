          OVER BLACK:
                         
          In the darkness, we hear the solitary sound of a HEARTBEAT,
          resounding like a drum.
                         
           NARRATOR (V.O)
           In between the years when the
           oceans drank Atlantis and the rise
           of the Sons of Aryas, there was an
           age undreamed of, when shining
           kingdoms lay spread across the
           world like blue mantles under the
           stars. Hither came Conan, the
           Cimmerian: a thief, a slayer, a
           king born of battle.
                         
          Muffled sounds, as if underwater, echo: CLANGING swords, the
          guttural CRIES of combat.
                         
                         UNBORN BABY
                         
          Eyes closed, floating at peace within red glow of the womb.
                         
          Suddenly, a flash of steel, as a sword pierces the womb, its
          tip not an inch from the baby's head.
                         
          As the sword is ripped out, light streams in from outside, we
          travel with it, into the DIN of BATTLE.
                         
                         
          EXT. CIMMERIA - MUDDY FIELD - DAY
                         
          A blonde-haired, armored AESIR RAIDER withdraws the bloody
          sword from the stomach of ISLENE, a wild-maned Cimmerian
          beauty, many months pregnant, now clutching her bloody
          stomach.
                         
          Across a muddy battlefield, the air a maelstrom of falling
          snowflakes and embers from trees aflame, the powerfully built
          CORIN rallies his fellow CIMMERIANS, until he spots Islene.
                         
                          CORIN
           Islene!!!
                         
          Wielding a broadsword, runes etched into its surface, Corin
          cuts a bloody path through his enemies, his eyes never
          leaving Islene.
                         
          The Aesir standing over Islene LAUGHS as she claws at the
          earth behind her, trying to pull herself away.
                         
                          AESIR
           Now, now little whore. Did I get
           you or your little one?
           2.
                         
                         
          Islene's hand reaches back once again -- and it finds a
          fallen warrior's SWORD. In one fluid motion she swings the
          sword around her body and drives it into the gap in the
          Aesir's armor -- at his groin.
                         
                          ISLENE
           I'd ask you the same.
                         
          The Aesir HOWLS in agony, raising his sword to deliver the
          killing blow -- when another sword pierces his chest. The
          Aesir falls, revealing Corin standing behind him.
                         
          Corin throws aside his horned helmet, and falls to his knees
          beside Islene, checking her wound. When he pulls his hands
          back they are coated in blood.
                         
          Their eyes meet. Torment. Loss. They both know. She pulls a
          knife from the folds of her pelts, puts it in his hand.
                         
                          ISLENE (CONT'D)
           Take your child.
                         
                          CORIN
           I cannot.
                         
          Islene looks to her naked belly. The baby inside presses
          against its womb, a visible impression on her flesh.
                         
                          ISLENE
           There is no time, husband. I would
           see my child's face.
                         
          Islene's eyes flutter as she struggles. Corin lowers the
          knife. Islene's eyes lock with Corin's as he puts the knife
          to use. Never once does she scream.
                         
          A moment later, Corin lifts the crying, blood-covered BOY up
          through the falling snowflakes to Islene's lap.
                         
                          ISLENE (CONT'D)
           A boy. He will be strong. A warrior
           with no equal.
                         
                          CORIN
           Do not speak, love.
                         
                          ISLENE
           You have never been able to still
           my tongue, and you will not this
           day. He will be wild, Corin. You
           must temper him.
                         
          She shares one kiss with her child, its first taste not of
          mother's milk, but of her blood.
           3.

                         CONAN
                         
          The boy's eyes are as deep and blue as the Eastern Sea.

          EXT. CIMMERIAN VILLAGE - DAY
                         
          A small Cimmerian village lies in a heavily forested valley,
          a redoubt from the icy mountains surrounding it.
                         
          Round wooden huts surround a stone-lined pit, where young
          CIMMERIAN BOYS, ages 12-15 stand. Pollen drifts through the
          air, giving it an ethereal haze.
                         
          At the center of the pit URAN, an elder Cimmerian warrior
          speaks.
                         
                          URAN
           A Cimmerian warrior is like any
           other man. A Cimmerian warrior
           feels hunger. He feels cold. Like
           other men he may lie and cheat.
           (stares the boys down)
           But when a Cimmerian warrior
           hungers, he hungers only for the
           blood of his enemy. When he feels
           cold, it is the cold steel of his
           sword. When he lies, he lies in
           wait for his enemy. And when he
           cheats, he cheats death itself!
                         
          Uran stops at the end of the line, where a boy stands a good
          two heads smaller than the rest. He is no more than eight,
          but his face is as stoic, driven.
                         
                          URAN (CONT'D)
           Conan! You are too young to be
           here. Withdraw.
                         
          CONAN, determined, doesn't move an inch. The LARGEST TEEN
          menacingly steps up to the smaller boy.
                         
                          LARGEST TEEN
           He said leave, motherless whelp.
           4.
                         
                         
          The hulking teen goes to shove Conan, but Conan pulls his arm
          towards him, lashing out with his other hand, punching the
          teen in the throat.
                         
          The large boy goes down hard, hands and knees, gasping for
          air.
                         
          A smattering of LAUGHS erupt from the boys, quickly silenced
          by Uran's stare. Uran hands out RIVER STONES to each boy,
          ending with Conan. The boys know what to do: they put the
          large stones in their mouths.
                         
                          URAN
           In the black crag in the high pass
           stands a wooden training sword. The
           one who claims it, with stone still
           in his mouth, will have earned the
           right to train with the warriors.
                         
          The boys look at each other, sizing up the competition.
                         
                          URAN (CONT'D)
           Well? What are you waiting for?!
                         
          And off they run. They knock each other down, punching the
          other's stomachs, each trying to force the other to expel
          their stones. One or two succeed.
                         
          Most of the remaining boys run for the trail that winds high
          into the mountains. But a few head right for the sheer cliff
          face.
                         
          Conan follows the ones headed to the cliff.
                         
                         CLIFF FACE
                         
          And when the Cimmerian boys climb, it is a sight to behold.
          They find cracks we can barely see and scale the smooth rock
          face as though it were a ladder.
                         
          The hulking teen reaches for the same handhold as Conan,
          trying to knock him off. Conan swings with one hand and finds
          another path. In moments he is ahead.
                         
                         
          EXT. FOREST - DAY
                         
          Conan is in the lead as he crests the cliff top, the bigger
          boys right behind him.
                         
          They race through the forest, heading uphill --
                         
          When Conan spots movement ahead. He pauses --
           5.
                         
                         
          And the largest teen elbows past Conan, into the lead. The
          boy runs two paces more and suddenly flies off his feet, an
          AXE lodged squarely in his forehead.
                         
          All the boys stop. Out of the dense forest come
                         
          FOUR PICTISH SAVAGES
                         
          Covered with fearsome war paint and armed with dual hand
          axes, the rotting heads of their enemies are slung at their
          waist.
                         
          The boys spit out the rocks in their mouths and YELL. They
          turn and run in the opposite direction.
                         
          Only Conan doesn't move, even as another boy pulls at him.
                         
                          CIMMERIAN BOY
           Conan! Run!
                         
          But Conan simply pulls the axe from his large boy's skull. He
          turns to face the Picts, his eyes burning.
                         
          The Picts LAUGH and CHARGE CONAN.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         LATER
                         
          Corin arrives with Uran and other armed CIMMERIAN WARRIORS.
          They get a brief glimpse of a single PICT, escaping in the
          other direction. One of the Cimmerians takes off in pursuit.
          Corin desperately searches for his son.
                         
                          CORIN
           Conan? Conan?!
                         
          Conan steps forward from out of a thicket, his body covered
          in Pict blood. Three PICTS lie massacred, the bodies hacked
          to pieces.
                         
                          CORIN (CONT'D)
           What have you done, boy?
                         
          Conan walks past the other stunned Cimmerians, up to his
          father. Conan SPITS OUT the bloody stone from his mouth.
                         
                          CONAN
           They killed one. I killed three. I
           am a warrior now.
                         
          Uran and the other Cimmerian men exchange worried glances.
          Looking at the carved up bodies of the Picts, they are
          aghast. Conan looks confused. Why aren't they happy?
           6.
                         
                         
                          CORIN
           A warrior? What you have done a
           jackal would do. Never a warrior.
                         
                          CONAN
           They would have done the same --
                         
                          CORIN
           As I said, jackals.
                          (TO URAN)
           He is not ready. I will forge him
           myself.

          Conan is tested under Corin's watchful eye:
                         
          - Forced to sleep in the snow, while his father keeps warm
          inside.
                         
          - A heavy boulder on his shoulder blades while he balances on
          wet river rocks.
                         
          - Climbing a cliff face, his bare hands leaving blood behind
          on the jagged rocks.
                         
                         
          INT. CIMMERIAN FORGE - DAY
                         
          Flames reflect in the blue eyes of Conan as he works the
          bellows of the forge. Sparks buzz like angry fireflies as he
          stokes the blaze.
                         
          Corin sharpens a sword, perfecting it. Conan cannot take his
          eyes off it, stepping away from the bellows.
                         
                          CORIN
           Stoke your fire, boy.
                         
          Conan slams the bellows closed, anger rising.
                         
                          CONAN
           "Stoke your fire, chop your wood."
           I have slept where wolves dare not.
           I have balanced a thousand river
           stones. When will you teach me the
           sword?
                         
          Corin stares his son in the eyes. Judging.
           7.
                         
                         
                          CORIN
           Think you're ready? Then tell me:
           what is a sword's purpose?
                         
                          CONAN
           To slay ones enemies.
                         
                          CORIN
           No. That is what it does. Its
           purpose is why you use it.
                         
          He tosses Conan two lumps of ore.
                         
                          CORIN (CONT'D)
           Tell me, which makes the best
           sword?
                         
          Conan takes the two lumps, testing them. He hands his father
          back one.
                         
                          CORIN (CONT'D)
           The stronger ore, eh? Then we shall
           make a sword of it, and tomorrow
           you will show me what brute
           strength yields.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. FIELD - DUSK
                         
          With a setting sun silhouetting the two, Conan attacks Corin.
          Conan attacks with fury. Corin defends with grace. Until the
          boy overextends and Corin slashes down a counterattack that
          SHATTERS CONAN'S SWORD.
                         
          Corin simply turns and walks away, leaving Conan to puzzle
          what happened.
                         
          Corin lowers his sword and walks away, leaving Conan to
          puzzle what happened.
                         
                         
          INT. CORIN'S FORGE - NIGHT
                         
          Conan works the bellows, putting his back into it. Corin
          places both ores in the furnace where they begin to melt.
                         
                          CONAN
           Why did it break?
           8.
                         
                         
                          CORIN
           Because it had no life.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          Sparks fly as Corin pounds on the glowing edge of the sword
          with hammer. Corin nods at Conan, who sprinkles the glowing
          blade with ash.
                         
           CORIN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
           The strongest blade isn't made of
           the hardest steel, boy. The hardest
           ore is what a man will die for. It
           is strong and unyielding. It
           neither cowers nor concedes. But
           without the softer ore, it can be
           shattered like glass.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          Steam rises as Corin lowers the blade into a freezing slack
          tub, only to place it right back into the flames.
                         
                          CORIN (CONT'D)
           The softer ore is what a man lives
           for. It is flexible and lasting. It
           survives, even against the greatest
           of foes. But too much of the soft
           ore, the blade will not cut deep
           enough when it must.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          Corin fashions the blade's hilt, engraving the guard and
          pommel. It is a work of art.
                         
                          CORIN (CONT'D)
           A sword must be tempered, the two
           ores united through fire and ice.
           Through its suffering the sword
           comes to hold both life and death.
                         
          Corin hands Conan the sword.
                         
                          CORIN (CONT'D)
           Now tell me, what is this sword's
           purpose?
                         
          Conan furrows his brow, trying to puzzle the answer. He
          can't. Corin's disappointment shows. He takes the sword from
          Conan's hands.
                         
                          CORIN (CONT'D)
           This one is not ready yet.
           9.
                         
                         
          Blood rushes to Conan's face but he says nothing. He rushes
          out.
                         
                         
          EXT. MOUNTAIN LAKE - DAY
                         
          Frustrated, Conan slashes through a field of reeds, cutting
          everything within reach of him, expending his rage.
                         
          Behind him something moves in the forest. We catch just a
          glimpse of the PICT, the same one that escaped Conan in the
          earlier scene.
                         
          Conan's instincts cause him to spin around -- but then
          there's nothing there.
                         
                         
          INT. CIMMERIAN SCOUT POST - DAY
                         
          Built into the side of a huge tree, fifty feet up, this
          wooden structure houses two CIMMERIAN SENTRIES. A BIRD CRIES
          in the woods, causing one of the sentries to investigate.
                         
          THWICK! He suddenly stands up straight, unmoving. The one
          still sitting in the structure notices.
                         
                          CIMMERIAN SENTRY
           See something?
                         
          The standing sentry falls backwards, revealing an ARROW
          piercing his right eye. Shocked, the remaining sentry reaches
          for the WARNING HORN mounted on the wall.
                         
          But as he reaches for it, his shadow becomes three
          dimensional, MORPHING into
                         
          A SHADOW SCOUT
                         
          A thin, feral humanoid, bodies covered in tattoos, from the
          deepest jungles of Zingara. The scout lashes out with his
          black sword and cuts straight across the sentry's throat.
                         
          This Shadow Scout's name is REMO.
                         
                         
          EXT. SCOUT POST - DAY
                         
          Remo exits and stares down at CHEREN, a BLIND ARCHER clad in
          lamellar armor and a conical sedge hat. Cheren has an arrow
          notched and ready, but somehow he knows not to fire.
                         
          Cheren lowers his bow and lets out a BIRD WHISTLE --
           10.
                         
                         
          And the forest comes alive. The forces are an odd
          combination; massive KUSHITE TRIBESMEN, dark-skinned savages
          from the savannahs of Kush, and a LEGION OF AQUILONIAN
          MERCENARIES, heavily armored knights drawn from the cities of
          Aquilonia.
                         
          Their leaders, respectively, are the six foot-five Kushite
          chief UKAFA, gold-toothed, his body painted for battle, and
          the handsome, silver-armored Aquilonian LUCIUS.
                         
                          UKAFA
           That's the last of their guard
           towers.
                         
                          LUCIUS
           All this sneaking around for a
           lowly tribe of barbarians.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (O.S.)
           This lowly tribe of barbarians have
           buried every warrior ever to set
           foot on this land, Lucius.
                         
          KHALAR SINGH, a warlord atop a black horse, rides through the
          fog-shrouded trees.
                         
          He bears a nomadic visage, with tanned skin and almond-shaped
          eyes. While his voice is calm, his eyes burn with malice.
                         
                          LUCIUS
           That is only because they have
           never faced my legion.
                         
          Khalar regards Lucius with amusement.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Then show us. But should you fail,
           remember the plan.
                         
          Lucius scowls as he delivers a bow to Khalar Singh.
                         
                         
          EXT. CIMMERIAN VILLAGE - DAY
                         
          Corin walks out of the forge, looking around for Conan.
          Various other Cimmerians go about the daily routine, but
          Conan is nowhere to be seen.
                         
                          CORIN
           Conan?
           11.
                         
                         
          Corin looks to the ridge above the village, noticing a thick
          fog creeping in. The fog curls and eddies, something is out
          there.
                         
          Suddenly, Lucius and his legion of silver-armored warriors
          burst out of the fog, attacking with speed and strength.
                         
          But the Cimmerians are hardly caught flat footed. In seconds
          they are armed, and they counter the charge with a furious
          charge of their own.
                         
          SLAM! Sword and bone collide as the two enemy fronts smash
          into each other. And the battle devolves into one-on-ones --
                         
          Where the barbarians have the upper hand. Uran and Corin lead
          the main push of battle-frenzied barbarians as they swing
          their huge broadswords, extending their reach advantage over
          the Aquilonian's shorter weapons.
                         
          And quickly, the Aquilonian's numbers are cut in half. Corin
          squares off against Lucius himself. Lucius is sweating.
          Worried. It wasn't supposed to be this hard.
                         
                          LUCIUS
           Retreat!
                         
          As a unit, the Aquilonians race back into the woods. In
          seconds, the Cimmerians give chase in wild pursuit.
                         
                          CORIN
           Wait! Hold your ground!
                         
          But it's too late, nearly half the Cimmerian warriors are
          gone on the chase.
                         
                         
          EXT. CLIFF FACE - DAY
                         
          Lucius and the Aquilonians race up to a sheer cliff face.
          Nowhere left to run. They turn to see the Cimmerians
          gathering in front of them.
                         
                          URAN
           Death is in the air, invaders. Can
           you taste it?
                         
                          LUCIUS
                          (SMILES)
           Indeed. I savor it.
                         
          Uran notices something is wrong. His eyes go skyward. Atop
          the cliff stand Cheren and a dozen more of his blind archers,
          bows at the ready with FLAMING ARROWS.
           12.
                         
                         
          They let the arrows fly, streaking balls of flame heading
          right for the Cimmerians. But they do not hit them. They hit
          the tree trunks beside them.
                         
          And for a moment, the Cimmerians look relieved, until they
          notice small bags of a black substance tied to the arrows.
          The flames lick at the substance --
                         
          KABOOM! The forest erupts into flames as the Cimmerian
          warriors are burned alive.
                         
                         
          EXT. MOUNTAIN LAKE - DAY
                         
          Conan spins, started by the sound of the explosion. He sees
          flames rising above the treetops beyond.
                         
          He races back home.
                         
                         
          EXT. CIMMERIAN VILLAGE - DAY
                         
          Corin sees the flames in the distance as well. Suddenly,
          Ukafa and his Kushite warriors erupt out of the forest. Armed
          with fearsome barbed spears they charge the remaining
          Cimmerians, savage against savage.
                         
          But the Kushites are not alone. From behind the Cimmerians
          comes, AKHUN, a massive four hundred pounds of flesh, wearing
          loops of chains like armor, leads his turbaned TURANIAN
          HORSEMEN into the village.
                         
          The Cimmerian WOMEN arm themselves, but the Horsemen attack
          with NINE TAILED WHIPS pulling their swords from their hands
          and dragging them to the ground.
                         
          The Horsemen quickly gather up the women while Ukafa and his
          men keep the Cimmerian warriors all too occupied.
                         
                         CONAN
                         
          Conan rushes through a river, now tinged red with blood, and
          reaches the far end of the village.
                         
          Huts burn, women are chained, only a handful of Cimmerians
          still stand. Lucius and his Aquilonian mercenaries are
          helping the Spearmen slay the wounded.
                         
          Conan grabs a fallen sword and rushes for the nearest
          Aquilonian and RUNS HIM THROUGH. A ZINGARAN spots him and
          rushes him with his spear. Conan readies himself for the
                         CHARGE --
           13.
                         
                         
          When the Zingaran loses his head, lopped off by Corin's
          blade.
                         
                          CONAN
           Father!
                         
                          CORIN
           Come.
                         
          Corin, sporting a deep gash to his abdomen, pulls a reluctant
          Conan from the battle, back toward the forge.

          The flames of the forge still burn as Corin pushes Conan into
          the room. He bolts the door behind him.
                         
                          CONAN
           Do we need more weapons?
                         
          Corin drops his sword, then struggles to lift a heavy grating
          in the dirt floor. Beneath it a trough of cooling water leads
          under the hut and away from the village.
                         
                          CORIN
           Go. There is a hunting lodge in the
           North Pass with provisions.
                         
                          CONAN
           No! I will fight!
                         
          Corin grabs Conan by his tunic, pulling him up to his face.
          Corin's eyes are half-crazed.
                         
                          CORIN
           This fight is over, but yours has
           just begun. You wanted to be a
           warrior of the tribe, Conan--now
           you must be its last.
                         
                          CONAN
           Father, I am not afraid to die.
                         
                          CORIN
           Good. Make your death have purpose.
                         
          BOOM. Something slams at the door. It does not budge. Again,
          BOOM.
                         
          A shadow appears under the door, sliding into the forge, and
          MATERIALIZING into the form of Remo. Remo quickly slides away
          the bolt.
           14.
                         
                         
          In rush enter Lucius and Ukafa. Corin and Conan face their
          attackers, fighting in close quarters. Lucius rushes at
          Conan, only for Conan to duck under his attack and --
                         
          THROW HIM IN THE FIERY FORGE. Lucius SCREAMS in agony, rising
          up to reveal half of his formerly handsome face burned to a
          crisp.
                         
          Corin fights Ukafa to a standstill, until Remo emerges from
          the shadows behind him and drives a short sword into his
          back.
                         
          Corin falls to his knees.
                         
                          CONAN
           No!
                         
          Lucius delivers a massive backhand, sending Conan flying
          backwards -- and demolishing one of the Forge's main support
          beams.
                         
          Half of the forge comes crashing down on top of Conan,
          pinning his bleeding form to the ground, just a few feet from
          his fallen father.
                         
          Enraged, Lucius turns his anger to Corin, raising his sword
          to deliver the killing blow.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (O.S.)
           I said I wanted a word with him.
                         
          Lucius stays his hand as Khalar Singh steps into the forge.
          Beside him stands the PICT who escaped from Conan earlier,
          grinning from ear to ear.
                         
          Khalar Singh hands him a bag of gold.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           As promised.
                         
                          PICT
           (strange dialect -
                          SUBTITLED)
           Their heads. You promised me their
           heads.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           All you wish, once we are gone.
                         
          The Pict nods and heads off, drawing his knife. Khalar Singh
          stares down at Corin, sizing him up.
                         
          Corin lifts up into a sitting position, back to the forge.
           15.
                         
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           I take no pleasure in this day,
           barbarian. Your people are fierce
           warriors, deserving of every story
           told of them. But now you must
           choose the story for yourself. I am
           Khalar Singh. My army is handpicked
           from the best Hyboria. My second,
           Ukafa, and his Kushite horde. Remo
           and his Shadow Scouts from the
           jungles of Zingara. And countless
           others. They all had a day like
           this one. They all chose a way
           forward.
                         
          Into the forge walks Cherin and Akhun. The lieutenants stand
          behind Corin, eyeing Corin with malice.
                         
          Corin catches a glimpse of Conan, buried but staring back at
          him, unable to move. Corin quickly turns away, careful not to
          give his son away.
                         
                          CORIN
           What is it you want?
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           I seek neither gold nor steel, but
           flesh and blood. The last of a
           royal line that goes back three
           thousand years.
                         
          Corin LAUGHS.
                         
                          CORIN
           Royalty in Cimmeria? Never. Each
           man is free here.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           But I seek a woman.
                         
          Khalar looks outside the door of the forge. The Cimmerians
          women are being herded by the slavers.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           A queen in hiding. Point her out
           and you'll spare the lives of your
           own. Perhaps even your wife?
                         
                          CORIN
           My wife was killed, long ago, by
           swine such as you.
                         
          Khalar nods, understanding.
           16.
                         
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Then our stories began in the same
           place, Cimmerian. I too lost my
           wife to marauders. How many men, in
           how many lands have suffered so?
           The only answer is power, strength
           unfettered, the kind of which can
           unite all Hyboria under a single
           crown. That is the legacy I seek.
           Will you join me?
                         
          It's a powerful, convincing speech. But Corin holds his
          tongue, unmoved.
                         
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           Very well. Then death will be your
           story. Your men will die. And your
           women too, when I am done with
           them. None will survive to carry
           your name forth, and over time,
           even your enemies will forget you
           ever were. You will be wiped from
           the pages of history.
           (to his men)
           Take your blood, but leave the
           kill.
                         
          One by one, the lieutenants beat and stab Corin, taking
          pleasure in his pain.
                         
          Conan struggles, trying to move, to yell, to do anything
          other than lie there. But a huge timber lies upon his back,
          pinning him to the ground.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           Fariq! Come!
                         
          Entering the wrecked forge is FARIQ, the six year old son to
          Khalar Singh. He stares at Corin's bleeding form with the
          dispassion of a sociopath.
                         
          Khalar picks up THE SWORD Corin and Conan had forged
          together, the one Corin took away. He admires it, then hands
          it to his son. He keeps a hand on it as it is too heavy for
          his son to lift alone. He instructs his son as if teaching
          him multiplication.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           Before you lies our enemy. His
           tribe waits for him in the beyond.
           What would you do?
           17.
                         
                         
                          FARIQ
           I would cut out his eyes, father,
           so that he will not find them. So
           he will wander the afterlife
           forever.
                         
          Khalar smiles.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Show me your strength, Fariq.
           Without it, you will never rule.
           With it, you will never be
           forgotten.
                         
          Fariq DRIVES THE SWORD INTO CORIN'S EYE. Corin doesn't make a
          sound. Once Fariq has ripped out Corin's eyes, Khalar runs
          Corin through.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           You have your desire. Death has
           found you.
                         
          Corin spits out his last words, also meant for Conan.
                         
                          CORIN
           Soon -- it comes for you.
                         
                         CONAN'S POV
                         
          Conan glimpses around the faces of Khalar and his men, each
          image seared into his memory as if ablaze.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Burn this place. It no longer
           exists.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. CIMMERIAN VILLAGE - DAY
                         
          The forge is lit afire from a half dozen torches, thrown onto
          its roof and inside its windows. Khalar and the other watch
          as the building roars into flame.
                         
                         
          INT. FORGE - DAY
                         
          Smoke fills the air. Conan struggles, still unable to move.
          He COUGHS, dying.
                         
          But then the fire collapses more of the forge, and the
          falling beams shatter the one that pins Conan to the ground.
           18.
                         
                         
          Slowly, painfully, Conan drags himself into the cooling
          trough that runs beneath the hut.
                         
           FADE TO BLACK.
                         
                         
          EXT. CIMMERIAN VILLAGE - DAY
                         
          Conan exits the forge only to see the entire village burning.
          The bodies of everyone he has ever known litter the
          landscape. Nothing stirs. Until he hears a strange CHOPPING
          SOUND.
                         
                         THE PICT
                         
          Conan spots the Pict, who is decapitating a dead Cimmerian
          warrior, adding to the collection of heads at his tattooed
          waist.
                         
          The Pict doesn't notice as Conan slips up behind him, then
          RUNS HIM THROUGH.
                         
          As the wide-eyed Pict dies, Conan takes the sword and CUTS A
          NOTCH into his arm.
                         
                          DISSOLVE TO:
                         
                         
                         NOTCHED ARM
                         
          Where there was once a single notch, there are now FIVE such
          notches, on a much broader arm that struggles to pin another
          powerful looking arm.
                         
                         
          INT. BAR - MESSANTIA - NIGHT
                         
          A raucous bar on the Argossean waterfront. Out the window we
          see a port lined with Shemish galleys and junks from Kush.
                         
          The bar is filled with the hearty sailors and merchants of
          those ships, and those who desire to part them from their
          hard-earned money; Zamoran thieves, Hyborean mercenaries and
          Brythunian whores. Most of them watch the arm wrestling match
          taking place at the back of the bar.
                         
          A pair of CITY GUARDS, short swords sheathed at their sides,
          enter the bar and are immediately summoned over by the
          harried BARKEEP.
                         
                          BARKEEP
           He's back there.
                         
          The barkeep motion to the arm wrestlers.
           19.
                         
                         
                          CITY GUARD #1
           What's this one done?
                         
                          BARKEEP
           What's he done?! What hasn't he
           done? He's bedded six of my whores
           and finished off three casks of
           mead--and he hasn't paid so much as
           a silver piece for it.
                         
                          CITY GUARD #1
           So have your men deal with him.
                         
                          BARKEEP
           I did.
                         
          Behind the bar, six men each hold down two HULKING MEN
          YELLING in agony as their horribly broken arms are snapped
          back into place.
                         
                          CITY GUARD #2
           Sounds like a real problem. Too bad
           we have other places to be right
           now.
                         
          The Barkeep shakes his head, knowing the routine. He slips a
          pair of silver pieces into the soldier's hand.
                         
                          BARKEEP
           Just get that behemoth out of here.
                         
          The two City Guards make their way to the back of the bar.
          His back to them, the DRUNKEN MAN they're after struggles to
          pin his opponent, cobras beneath each of their wrists, ready
          to strike at the loser. A pair of voluptuous WHORES watch,
          caressing the Drunken Man's sinewy back.
                         
          The Drunken Man YELLS in fury as he SLAMS the other man's
          hand down upon the cobra, which immediately bites its prey.
                         
          As the soldiers arrive, the drunken victor throws his tankard
          of ale at the Barkeep, who's now back behind the bar.
                         
                          DRUNKEN MAN
           Piss-water! You'll serve my friends
           and I your best, barman, or you'll
           taste steel!
                         
                          CITY GUARD #1
           Time to leave, northerner.
                         
          The Drunken Man turns as the City Guard puts a hand on his
          shoulder.
           20.
                         
                         
                         CONAN
                         
          The gangly fifteen year old boy has grown into a powerfully
          built man, broad-shouldered with sun browned skin lined with
          battle scars. Only the piercing blue eyes and square cut
          black mane remain from the boy we last saw.
                         
          Conan stands to his full height, looming over the smaller
          City Guards, who instinctively take a step back.
                         
                          CONAN
           No, my small friends. It's time to
           die. Now--
                         
          Conan sways. The room spins. He falls on his face.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           Who's first --
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. STREET - NIGHT
                         
          Conan, unconscious, is dragged down the street by the two
          City Guards.
                         
                          CITY GUARD #1
                          (STRUGGLING)
           By the gods, he's as heavy as a
           horse.
                         
                          CITY GUARD #2
           Even a dead horse smells better
           than this.
                         
                         
          EXT. PRISON YARD - NIGHT
                         
          The City Guards drag Conan into a broad prison yard. Many of
          the INMATES are shackled together, hacking with picks at the
          rock walls on their work detail. Those in no condition to
          break rock are left in their own filth to rot. Some are even
          dead already, the rats gnawing at the remains.
                         
                         
          INT. PRISON GUARDHOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          The two City Guards drag Conan into the guardhouse, where a
          LIEUTENANT sits eating his dinner.
                         
          The Lieutenant doesn't even bother to look up from his meal.
           21.
                         
                         
                          LIEUTENANT
           What's the charge?
                         
                          CITY GUARD #2
           Public drunkenness. Another damn
           hill ape who can't handle his
           liquor.
                         
                          LIEUTENANT
           Is that so, boy? How do you plead?
                         
          Conan yawns in response. One of the City Guards slaps Conan,
          hard, across the face. Conan slowly opens his eyes.
                         
                          CONAN
           Where's the Captain of the Guard?
                         
          SCREAMS OF PAIN come from down the hall, past a locked door.
                         
                          LIEUTENANT
           In the cells, interrogating a
           prisoner. And you'll get the same
           if you don't answer. You're accused
           of public drunkenness. How do you
           plead?
                         
                          CONAN
           In truth, I've been guilty of much.
           Jewels stolen from the crowns of
           kings, men's heads split in battle
           for the price of a night's drink.
           But through that I've searched and
           waited and hunted my prey.
                         
          Suddenly Conan shifts upright, looking more sober than he did
          a moment ago.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           But drink? Haven't had a drop all
           night.
                         
          The guards holding Conan up by his arms, suddenly find those
          arms wrapped around their heads. Twist, twist. SNAP. SNAP. He
          breaks both their necks in an instant.
                         
          The Lieutenant is horrified. He goes for his sword. Conan
          bats it out of his hand, slamming his head against the back
          wall.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           The key to the cells.
           22.
                         
                         
                          LIEUTENANT
           I don't have it. There's a guard
           inside the door. Only he can open
           it.
                         
          Conan picks up the Lieutenant's sword.
                         
                          LIEUTENANT (CONT'D)
           You can't kill me! He'll only open
           the door for me!
                         
          A FLASH OF STEEL as Conan delivers a blow.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          INT. CELLS - NIGHT
                         
          A GUARD sits on a stool next to a heavy metal door. Behind
          him, the CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD beats a chained ONE-EYED
          PRISONER to a pulpy mess.
                         
          There's a KNOCK at the door.
                         
                          GUARD #1
           What is it?
                         
           MUFFLED VOICE (O.S.)
           Need to see the Captain.
                         
          The Guard exhales, frustrated. He stands up, getting his keys
          out. He stops. Opens the small EYEHOLE to see into the other
          room.
                         
          The Lieutenant stares back at him.
                         
                          GUARD #1
           Fine, fine.
                         
          He opens the door--
                         
          Only to see Conan standing there, holding the decapitated
          head of the Lieutenant.
                         
          The shocked Guard goes for his sword. Conan swings the
          Lieutenant's head, smashing it into the Guard's jaw and
          putting him down for the count.
                         
          That's when the Captain of the Guard turns around. And WE
          RECOGNIZE HIM! He's LUCIUS, the disfigured Aquilionian who
          was one of Khalar Singh's lieutenants.
                         
                          LUCIUS
           Men!
           23.
                         
                         
          From around a corner come five more Guards, drawing their
          weapons. Lucius draws his as well.
                         
                          LUCIUS (CONT'D)
           You've made a huge mistake, ape.
           You'll never make it out of this
           place.
                         
                          CONAN
           I came for you, Lucius.
                         
          Lucius nods to the guards, who advance on Conan.
                         
                          LUCIUS
           You talk as though you know me,
           ape.
                         
                          CONAN
           I do. And I am no ape. I am
           Cimmerian.
                         
          As recognition crosses Lucius' face, Conan springs into
          action. He KICKS the table at the men, sending the knives and
          other torture implements flying right into the first guard.
                         
          The second guard tries leaping over the falling table. Conan
          just grabs him in midair and throws him even faster into the
          iron bands of the prisoner cells.
                         
          Lucius lunges at Conan, Conan steps in on him, grabbing his
          sword hand. In a show of strength, he twists Lucius' own
          sword until points down at the floor, then THRUSTS IT THROUGH
          LUCIUS' FOOT AND DEEP INTO THE WOOD FLOOR BELOW.
                         
          Lucius BELLOWS in pain, pinned to the spot.
                         
          The next three Guards rush forward, forcing Conan to deal
          with three weapons attacks at once.
                         
          The first to strike swings a mace and chain that wraps around
          Conan's sword and he tries to yank it free from Conan's grip.
          Instead, Conan pulls him in a wide circle, sending him flying
          into a wall-mounted torch. The guard burns like dry kindling.
                         
          The second to strike hits Conan on his sword hand, carving a
          deep gash and causing him to drop his sword.
                         
          Conan turns to face him, eyes filled with rage. The guard's
          face goes pale. Conan head butts him with all his might and
          the guard goes down, bleeding from mouth, nose and ears.
           24.
                         
                         
          However, the last Guard is upon Conan before he can react.
          The powerful soldier uses the shaft of his poleax to lift
          Conan off his feet and back against the far wall, pinned by
          the neck.
                         
          Conan struggles to breathe, the polearm shaft driving his
          throat into the wall. The thickness of the Cimmerian's neck
          gives him time to reach into his bracer, pulling out a hidden
          knife which he buries into the Guardsman's eye.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          Lucius SCREAMS in pain as Conan pours water on the burning
          guard, and lifts the table back onto its legs. Then he pulls
          the sword out of the floor, a thick plume of blood rising out
          of Lucius' now liberated foot.
                         
          Conan takes Lucius' face and smashes it against the table.
          Lucius looks, aghast, as Conan takes his injured hand and
          places it over the torch flame, searing the wound closed. The
          Cimmerian never even bats an eye.
                         
                          LUCIUS
           What do you want? Who are you?
                         
          Conan turns his face to the burnt side.
                         
                          CONAN
           I'm the one who made you pretty.
                         
                          LUCIUS
           Impossible! You're dead!
                         
          Conan shows Lucius the FIVE SCARS running down his forearm.
                         
                          CONAN
           No. I am death. And I came a long
           way for you.
                         
          Conan lifts the sword.
                         
                          LUCIUS
           Wait!! Wait!!
                          (CONAN PAUSES)
           I can tell you where the rest are.
                         
                          CONAN
           Where?
                         
                          LUCIUS
           The end of the earth. You kill me,
           and you'll never find them.
           25.
                         
                         
                          CONAN
           Who are you offering?
                         
                          LUCIUS
           Who do you think? All of them.
           Ukafa, Remo, Cheren, Akhun -- and
           Khalar Singh himself. But you have
           to swear you won't kill me.
                         
          Conan thinks about it.
                         
                          CONAN
           You have my word. You tell me where
           I will find Khalar Singh, and I
           will not kill you.
                         
          Conan lets Lucius go. Lucius hobbles to his chair.
                         
                          LUCIUS
           He is in a city called on the edge
           of the Eastern Sea. On the edge of
           Hyboria. Khor Khalba.
                         
          Conan looks him in his eyes, sizing him up. He likes what he
          sees. In a flash, Conan grabs Lucius' head again, yanking it
          back, exposing his throat.
                         
                          LUCIUS (CONT'D)
           You gave your word!
                         
          Conan rips a SMALL KEY from a large keyring. He drops it in
          Lucius' throat. The big man chokes instantly. A second later,
          Conan pours ale from a flagon down his throat as well.
                         
          Lucius swallows the key, gasping for breath as Conan releases
          him.
                         
                          LUCIUS (CONT'D)
           What are you doing?!
                         
                          CONAN
           Toasting, to our deal.
                         
          Conan swings his sword and cuts the One Eyed Prisoner from
          the wall.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           Go. You are free.
                         
          One-Eye looks at his wrists and ankles, still hobbled by
          shackles.
                         
                          ONE-EYED PRISONER
           I won't get far like this.
           26.
                         
                         
          Conan hands him a fallen Guardsmen's sword.
                         
                          CONAN
           The key to your shackles sits in
           the Captain's gut. Happy hunting.
                         
          The One-Eyed Prisoner grins with malice. As he closes in on
          the terrified Lucius, Conan heads for the door.
                         
                          LUCIUS
           Barbarian! I had your word! You
           said you would spare my life!
                         
                          CONAN
           No. I said I wouldn't kill you.
                         
          We hear Lucius SCREAMS OF PAIN as Conan walks out into the
          night, cutting another notch into his arm.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. DESERT SANDSTORM - DAY
                         
          KHALAR SINGH looks older. Worn. He squints as he stares into
          a howling sandstorm.
                         
          UKAFA trudges through the deep sand to reach him. The
          sandstorm is so blinding we don't see him until he is less
          than five feet away.
                         
                          UKAFA
           Khalar Singh, we've lost half our
           cavalry legion, and still Fariq
           presses on! We must turn back!
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           He says the Queen is here.
                         
                          UKAFA
           He leads us in circles. He knows
           nothing of leading an army --
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Take care, Ukafa. You hold a
           special place in my kingdom, but
           blood you are not.
                         
                          UKAFA
           My apologies, Khalar Singh. I am
           simply concerned for your army.
           27.
                         
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           And I would gladly sacrifice every
           last man to get my hands on the
           Queen. And in that respect, Fariq
           has my confidence. He knows more of
           the legends of Acheron than anyone.
                         
          Suddenly, two forms race at them from the blinding sand. REMO
          and FARIQ. No longer a child, Fariq is now a man in his
          twenties, but he is hardly the strong warrior his father is.
          His frame is slight, his eyes beady.
                         
                          FARIQ
           Father, they are here! The hidden
           oasis, just as it was written.
                         
          Khalar Singh looks to Remo for confirmation. The misshapen
          and shadowy Remo nods.
                         
                         
          EXT. CAVE TUNNEL - DAY
                         
          Remo and Fariq lead Khalar and Ukafa into a natural tunnel
          carved out of rock. Inside, the sandstorm no longer rages.
                         
          And on the other side of the tunnel --
                         
                         
          EXT. OASIS - CONTINUOUS
                         
          A protected rock oasis, heavy vegetation crawling up the
          encircling cliff walls, herds of sheep grazing on fields of
          grass. At its far end, beyond a deep blue pond, lies a Greek-
          influenced monastery and several tiled-roof, mud-brick
          houses.
                         
          And moving between the pools are MEN and WOMEN going about
          their simple chores. They wear long flowing white linen robes
          and turbans.
                         
          The air and sand are perfectly still within the perimeter of
          the oasis. But beyond it, the sandstorm rages all around,
          sand hurled violently hundreds of feet into the air, swirling
          around the oasis as though it were the eye of some mystical
          hurricane, protected by an unseen force.
                         
          A row of robed YOUNG WOMEN kneel in front of one of the
          reflecting pools, quietly reading from prayer books and
          softly striking their right breast with a left hands wrapped
          in thorns.
                         
          One girl, ILIRA, mischievously taps the shoulder of the girl
          next to her with her thorn. The girl, TAMARA, squeals in
          pain, angry her prayer was interrupted.
           28.
                         
                         
          Ilira is the fun-loving dilettante of the relationship.
          Tamara the studious good girl.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Stop it! I'm trying to pray!
                         
                          ILIRA
           I'm bored.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Then hit yourself.
                         
          Tamara hits Ilira back with her thorn. Ilira SQUEALS, then
          hits a grinning Tamara back. Tamara grabs her, but as they
                         TUSSLE--
                         
           FASSIR (O.S.)
           Is that how one shows penitence?
                         
          Both girls instantly stop as FASSIR appears behind them.
          Fassir is an elder monk and leader of the monastery. He
          shakes his head, both out of fondness and disappointment.
                         
                          FASSIR (CONT'D)
           I expect more from a queen.
                         
                          ILIRA
           I'm sorry, Fassir. I just tire of
           saying the same prayer every day.
                         
                          FASSIR
           Then you should be able to
           translate it from its original
           Acheronian.
                         
          Ilira's face scrunches, unsure. Tamara steps in to help Ilira
          save face.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Of course she can. She even taught
           it to me. "Never again."
                         
                          FASSIR
           Go on.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Never again will we stand by as
           darkness consumes the world. Never
           again will innocents suffer for
           others' power. Never again will the
           Queen suffer so Acheron may rise.
           29.
                         
                         
                          FASSIR
           Very good, Tamara. You must have
           taught her very well indeed, Ilira.
                         
          A smile on Fassir's face confirms he knows the truth.
                         
          Suddenly, the monastery's BELL RINGS OUT. A moment later, a
          temple EXPLODES in flames.
                         
          Pouring out from the swirling sands come Khalar Singh's army.
          Cheren and his archers stand atop Khalar's
                         
          MAN OF WAR
                         
          A massive siege engine atop which CHEREN and his archers fire
          FLAMING ARROWS. The arrows arc down and explode as they
          impact the tiled roofs.
                         
          Sitting at the highest point of the Man Of War, Khalar Singh
          likes what he sees.
                         
                         CHAOS
                         
          The monks scatter in every direction, but wherever they turn,
          more troops burst out of the swirling sand.
                         
          A small handful of armed MONKS display acrobatic martial arts
          prowess as they battle with Khalar's heavily armed forces,
          but they are vastly outnumbered.
                         
          Fassir grabs Tamara.
                         
                          FASSIR (CONT'D)
           The Queen must not be captured.
           Take her out the North Gate.
           Quickly!
                         
          Tamara grabs Ilira and pulls her through the flaming
          battleground. Zingaran warriors cut down the monks while
          Turanian horsemen concentrate on the women.
                         
                          ILIRA
           We can't leave them.
                         
                          TAMARA
           If you are caught, everything we
           live for is lost!
                         
          WHIP! A whip encircles Ilira's waist. A massive TURANIAN
          pulls her to him. Tamara grabs the whip, pulling Ilira the
          other way. But she is no match for the huge slaver. He yanks
          on the whip pulling both of them to him --
           30.
                         
                         
          Only then does he notice Tamara's unsheathed knife which she
          plunges into his throat.
                         
          She frees Ilira and they run.
                         
                         
          INT. NORTH PASSAGE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          A thin alleyway at the rear of the monastery, leading away
          from the din of battle, towards a rear gate of the oasis.
                         
          Tamara and Ilira run for the gate, only for the shadows of
          the alleyway to move and shift -- REMO and three of his
          shadow scouts.
                         
          They advance on the women, drawing dark shortswords.
                         
                          REMO
           No swords. Khalar needs them alive.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Good to know.
                         
          Tamara lunges for the nearest shadow scout with her knife,
          but when she strikes, she hits nothing but shadow. It reforms
          behind her and grabs her.
                         
          Another grabs Ilira. Tamara launches her body into the air,
          executing a backflip that puts her behind the shadow scout. A
          quick knife strike and he goes down.
                         
          And with one continuous motion, she vaults over the shadow
          scout holding Tamara, cutting his throat as well.
                         
          Remo and the remaining scout give chase, blending in and out
          of shadows. But each time they strike, Tamara defends Ilira.
          They near the far end of the alleyway, the North gate looming
          ahead with the desert beyond.
                         
          Remo blends into another shadow --
                         
                         
          EXT. MAN OF WAR - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Remo materializes out of a shadow atop the Man Of War, next
          to Cheren, the archer.
                         
                          REMO
           The north gate. Destroy it.
                         
          Cheren and the other archers turn their fire to the gate at
          the end of the passage. They fire a volley of fiery arrows.
           31.
                         
                         
          INT. NORTH GATE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Tamara and Ilira run for the whirling sands just ahead --
          when the flaming arrows land before them.
                         
          Ilira hesitates.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Run!
                         
                          ILIRA
           We'll die!
                         
                          TAMARA
           We'll die if we stay!
                         
          She locks eyes with Ilira, who nods. Together they run right
          for the arrows.
                         
          But at the last minute, Ilira falters. She falls to the
          ground.
                         
          Tamara turns to see Ilira lying in the gateway a moment too
          late.
                         
          THE ARROWS EXPLODE causing a cave in that closes the gateway.
                         
                         
          EXT. SANDSTORM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Tamara falls to the sand as the gate collapses behind her.
          She looks back, only to see that Ilira didn't make it.
                         
                          TAMARA
           NO!!!
                         
                         
          EXT. MAN OF WAR - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Khalar Singh stares at the cloud of destruction at the north
          tunnel.
                         
          There, one form hurries into the swirling sandstorm.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Who was guarding that gate?
                         
                          REMO
           It was I, Lord.
           32.
                         
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Take four legions. Hunt her. Before
           I hunt you.

          Tamara stumbles through a stretch of barren wasteland, the
          plumes of the oasis' sandstorm now off in the distance behind
          her.
                         
          The sun mercilessly beats down upon her face, her lips are
          already chapped. She falls to her knees, unable to go on.
                         
          She looks up, as the heat streams off the desert floor,
          creating a swirling mirage. Through which the silhouette of a
          rider appears, followed by others.
                         
                         SLAVER CARAVAN
                         
          The horse-drawn carts of the caravan are lined with iron
          bars, and behind the bars are a bevy of young women, mostly
          looking worse for wear.
                         
          The HEAD SLAVER rides ahead, and walks up to the heap of
          white cloth that is Tamara.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Water -- please --
                         
          He lifts her barely conscious head, eyeing her features, a
          greasy paw examining her body. He smiles.
                         
                          HEAD SLAVER
           The gods are good.
           (to the other slavers)
           Chain this one in my cage. She'll
           be the prize of the auction in Khor
           Kalba.

          EXT. OASIS - NIGHT
                         
          The Man of War dominates the center of the oasis, its torches
          illuminating the scene before it. Akhun and the Turanians
          hold chains connected to the twenty women monks, kneeling,
          with their wrists chained to their neck collars.
                         
          In front of them kneels Fassir, beaten and bloodied.

          Khalar Singh, Fariq, and Ukafa step down from the Man of War.
          Fariq carries with him a large iron box with ornate carvings
          on it.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           All these years searching the ends
           of the earth. And here you are.
           Just a two day ride from Khor
           Kalba. I can scarcely believe it.
                         
                          FASSIR
           (in Acheronian, to monks)

                          (IN ACHERONIAN)
           Yes. Say nothing. Maybe he doesn't
           know who we are. Maybe he's not
           looking for the Queen.
                         
          Several of the women look up at him, shocked.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           That's right, my brethren, you have
           been lied to all your lives. Told
           you must hide yourselves, told you
           were alone. I want you to look at
           me, and see me for what I am. A
           brother. A friend. I have come not
           to hurt you, but liberate you.
                         
                          FASSIR
           You come for your own dark
           purposes, to raise Acheron.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Yes. I come to resurrect the
           greatest empire Hyboria has ever
           known.
                         
                          FASSIR
           An empire of evil, soaked in blood
           sacrifice and the blackest of
           magic.
                         
          Khalar Singh becomes infuriated, eyes blazing.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Have you hidden from the world so
           long that you cannot to see? Blood,
           magic, death: it is everywhere.
           Acheron is no different than any
           other kingdom, but for its glory.

           And in place of that glory, you
           offer shame? I knew shame, but that
           was before I was shown my true
           lineage.
                         
          Khalar draws closer to the women, looking them each in the
          eye.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           When I was but a child, raiders
           destroyed my village, cut our
           fathers to ribbons, and burned our
           women as sacrifice to foreign gods.
           Those few who survived, we ran for
           our lives, chased into caves at the
           edge of the Eastern Sea, left with
           nothing to live for. But then we
           discovered it. Acheron. The temple
           that spawned an empire. We learned
           that we were not broken goat-
           herders on a desolate coastline. We
           were the sons and daughters of
           kings.
           (stares in Ilira's eyes)
           And queens.

           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           For thirty years I have searched
           for you. In that time I built both
           an army and empire, but they are
           nothing compared to what we can
           create together. We can raise
           Acheron again. Never again will we
           hide like rats. Never again will we
           watch as our loved ones are
           slaughtered. I call forth the
           Queen. Stand and join me, and this
           day will have a joyous end.
                         
          No one moves.
                         
                          FASSIR
           You would have all the world
           suffer, as you have suffered. We
           will die before we help you.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Yes. You will.
                         
          He nods to his son. He paces in front of the female monks,
          the box in front of them.

           The caves beneath Khor Khalba
           contain all manner of creature,
           many -- altered -- by centuries of
           blood magic. But one, in
           particular, has developed a special
           connection to the blood. A thirst.
           It is said that only the Queen of
           Acheron itself can resist its
           embrace.

           lucky one, or will you tell me who
           is?
                         
          A tear falls down her face, but she stays silent. There's the
          sound of SLITHERING as Fariq opens the box. She stares down
          inside the box --
                         
          AND SCREAMS.

          EXT. DESERT - DAY
                         
          Tamara's eyes are met by a dozen others, SLAVES of every
          color, chained together with her in a CAGED WAGON. The SLAVE
          TRADER swings his whip twice more, hitting the cowering women
          in the cage.
                         
                          SLAVE TRADER

          Tamara makes eye contact with the Slave Trader.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Let me go. I promise you'll be
           rewarded.
                         
          The Trader just laughs, leering at her.
                         
                          SLAVE TRADER
           And I would sample that reward,

          He eyes her lasciviously. Tamara turns away and does not
          answer.
                         
           SLAVE TRADER (CONT'D)
           No matter. I'll know soon enough.

           Good day, sir! A lone rider in a
           desolate land. The perfect customer
           for what I sell.
                         
                         CONAN
                         
          Rides out of the sun, his massive form silhouetted by the
          bright desert sky. He stares at the slave wagons.
                         
                          SHEMISH WOMAN
           Please, master! Your gold can free
           me from this hole! I can bring you
                          PLEASURE--
                         
          The Slave Trader immediately WHIPS her, incensed.
                         
                          SLAVE TRADER
           Silence whore!
                         
          The Slaver goes to whip her again, but before the blow can
          fall, Conan grabs his arm. The Slave Trader looks furious,
          but Conan's size holds him back.
                         
                          CONAN
           Khor Kalba. Which way?
                         
                          SLAVE TRADER
           This is the road to Khor Kalba.
           Ahead. Past the Great Wall.
                         
          The Slaver nods to the east and Conan releases his arm.
                         
          The Slaver continues whipping the slave. Conan just rides on -
          - not his problem.
                         
          But as Conan passes Tamara, for a brief moment their eyes
          meet. Something about her. Conan stares a moment, then spurs
          his horse on.
                         
          Just then, the ground around them RUMBLES. Horses rear, the
          women SCREAM. Conan turns and looks up. His eyes go wide.
                         
                         ENORMOUS BOULDERS

          Coming thundering down the hills on all sides. The SLAVERS
          see them a moment to late.
                         
          SLAM. Several of the horses and carts are smashed by the
          rolling boulders.
                         
          Conan kicks his horse, trying to outrace the boulders. But
          when the wagon next to him is hit, its axle spears his horse
          in its side, and Conan goes down.
                         
          Pissed, he draws his sword. The Slavers scramble around the
          broken wagons, in chaos.
                         
          Only a pair of wagons still stands. One of them holds Tamara.
                         
                          CONAN
           Use your whips on the horses' legs!
                         
          The Slavers are confused. Then they notice
                         
                         TURANIAN HORSEMEN
                         
          racing down the hill, behind the boulders.
                         
          As the riders bear down upon the slavers, the Slavers do as
          they're told, entangling the legs of the first wave of
          horses, throwing their riders.
                         
          More than a few riders SNAP their necks as they're driven
          into the desert floor. The remainder fight hand to hand, and
          are cut down by either Conan's blade or the slavers' tulwars.
          But their victory is short lived --
                         
          As a SECOND WAVE OF RIDERS comes thundering towards them,
          before the Slavers can re-establish their perimeter. The
          riders start cutting the slavers down where they stand.
                         
                         CONAN
                         
          Conan lodges his sword in a still-rolling boulder. As it
          rolls, it pulls him up on top of it. From this height, Conan
          launches himself down at the horsemen below.
                         
          WHAM! He knocks a rider off his horse, Conan landing square
          in the saddle. He kicks the horse straight at the other
          riders. They don't see him coming until it's too late. He
          cuts them down where they sit.
                         
          The last remaining CARAVAN DRIVER whips his horse team,
          trying to pull his wagon out of the fight. Conan spins to see
          a FLASH of steel and the rider's neck plumes in blood as he's
          decapitated.
           38.
                         
                         
          Which is strange since the cavalry are nowhere near the
          wagon.
                         
                         REMO
                         
          The explanation comes as the shadow behind the driver MORPHS
          into Remo, the spindly Shadow Scout. He takes the reins,
          stopping the wagon.
                         
          Conan spots him, recognition in his eyes.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           You!
                         
          There's a SCREAM. Conan turns to see the other two SHADOW
          SCOUTS already hacking their way through the slaves on one of
          the caged wagons. A Shadow Scout gets to Tamara, only to have
          her FIGHT BACK.
                         
          Tamara kicks the first Scout in the face, slamming his head
          into the bars. However, the second one clubs her unconscious
          from behind.
                         
                         CONAN
                         
          Leaps from his horse, launching his body at Remo. Remo dives
          and rolls away. Small and misshapen, he is nonetheless very
          fast.
                         
          Conan strikes again. Again Remo dodges out of the way.
                         
          The Shadow Scouts draw swords, but Remo waves them off,
          speaking in the broken language of a savage.
                         
                          REMO
           The girl! Bring her to Khalar!
                         
          Conan launches an all out attack. Remo leaps over his sword
          and vaults Conan, landing on his back. He draws his sword,
          preparing to cut Conan's throat --
                         
          When Conan hurls his body backwards, into one of the huge
          rolling boulders. The impact crushes Remo and he loses his
          grip.
                         
          Conan spins to strike again, only to see Remo MELT INTO THE
          SHADOW OF THE BOULDER.
                         
          Conan turns his attention towards the other two Shadow Scouts
          as they drag the unconscious Tamara away.
           39.
                         
                         
          Conan mounts one of the cavalry horses and gallops towards
          the Scouts. They see him coming and let go of Tamara. THEY
          MELT AWAY INTO HER SHADOW AND DISAPPEAR.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         TAMARA
                         
          Dazed, she struggles to her feet. Conan appears beside her,
          his dagger out. Tamara gasps in fear but Conan only reaches
          out and breaks the lock on her chains.
                         
                          CONAN
           Who are you?
                         
                          TAMARA
           I am nobody.
                         
          He cuts the bonds on her feet. Tamara rises up, the battle
          scene revealed to her.
                         
          Dead bodies of the Slavers and Turanian horsemen lie sprawled
          in every direction. Tamara takes in the gruesome sight,
          shocked.
                         
                          CONAN
           Many died to capture nobody.
           (motions to his horse)
           Get up.
                         
                          TAMARA
           And if I don't wish to ride with
           you?
                         
                         
          EXT. DESERT - DAY
                         
          Conan rides his horse, Tamara trailing on foot, wrists
          tethered to Conan's saddle by a long rope. Tamara looks
          exhausted.
                         
          They reach a gallery of broken columns, spires of fossilized
          coral that juts out of the desert.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Stop! I want water.
                         
          Conan just keeps riding.
                         
                          CONAN
           Perhaps the slavers took your
           orders. I don't.
           40.
                         
                         
                          TAMARA
           I never knew men could be so cruel.
           Now I wonder if the world is filled
           with animals such as you.
                         
                          CONAN
           You speak of animals as if they
           were less than men. But animals
           don't stab their brothers in the
           back or steal their mother's only
           possession. And they never lie.
                         
                          TAMARA
           I haven't lied.
                         
          Conan get off his horse, unties Tamara and gives her a water
          sack. Tamara greedily drinks down the water.
                         
                          CONAN
           Very well. Give me your name.
                         
                          TAMARA
           I am Tamara Amelia Karushan. And
           you?
                         
                          CONAN
           I am Conan.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Conan? That's it?
                         
                          CONAN
           What more names do I need?
                         
          Conan then grabs Tamara around her waist, putting her atop
          his horse. He then mounts behind her, their bodies close.
          Conan's mouth is only inches from her ear as he speaks.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           There is only one truth I need from
           you, Tamara Amelia Karushan. Why
           does Khalar Singh want you?
                         
          Tamara looks away, but doesn't respond.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           Then let's hope it's for your
           cooking.
                         
                         
          EXT. CAMPFIRE - NIGHT
                         
          A campfire amidst several large boulders, a line of windmills
          on the horizon.
           41.
                         
                         
          Tamara struggles to manage a cooking pot over a blaze. Conan
          comes over and smells the pot; his face scrunches from the
          odor.
                         
                          CONAN
           Trying to poison me?
                         
          Tamara steps back and gets down on her knees, her hands
          clasped.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           What are you doing?
                         
                          TAMARA
           Before we eat, I must pray.
                         
                          CONAN
           Crom! What would you pray for? That
           a bone may not get stuck in your
           throat? No words nor gods will give
           you one more moment than fate
           allows you.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Then you have no faith. And I am
           sorry for you.
                         
                          CONAN
           I need no pity.
                         
                          TAMARA
           But you do. You live in a world
           that is harsh and short. Where fate
           is unyielding and hope is a cruel
           joke. I live in a world with a
           purpose that guides me, where faith
           sustains me.
                         
          Suddenly, Conan KICKS DIRT PAST TAMARA, ONTO THE FIRE. The
          fire goes out, plunging everything into darkness.
                         
                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           Why did you--
                         
          Suddenly, there's the sound of FIGHTING. Grunting, blows
          being interchanged, then a LOUD SNAP AS BONES ARE BROKEN.
                         
          A moment later, the flames of the fire are stoked up again,
          revealing Conan standing over the groaning REMO. The other
          two SHADOW SCOUTS are dead.
                         
          Tamara instinctively jumps back.
           42.
                         
                         
                          CONAN
           Don't worry. His back is broken. He
           won't be slinking away this time.
                         
          As Tamara gapes at Remo, Conan simply pulls the cooking pot
          off the fire.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           Now, let's eat.
                         
                          TAMARA
           But -- what about him?!
                         
          Remo GROANS in pain.
                         
                          CONAN
           I enjoy a little music with my
           meal.
                         
                          DISSOLVE TO:
                         
                         
          AERIAL SHOT - POV - SOARING
                         
          Across steep valleys and up jagged peaks we race into steep
          and unforgiving mountains. Far off, we hear a pair of
          thunderous booms, almost like the sound of a heartbeat.
          THUMP, THUMP.
                         
          Cresting over a set of peaks, a gorge is revealed below, and
                         BENEATH IT--
                         
                         
          EXT. ACHERON - NIGHT - MOVING
                         
          A city carved out of the purple granite of a mountainous
          gorge. Hundred-foot towers rise up, their pinnacles crafted
          to depict ANGRY, GOD-LIKE FACES.
                         
          As we pass one of the faces, again we hear the sound of a
          thunderous heartbeat, now closer. THUMP, THUMP.
                         
          We GLIDE DOWN past hundred foot high pillars of flames,
          towards the growing sounds of SCREAMING and WAILING.
                         
          The streets of Acheron are lined with thousands of SLAVES,
          young and old, chained together, toiling under the lash of
          their cruel masters, the
                         
                         ACHERONIAN WARRIORS
                         
          Towering over the slaves, the warriors are a fearsome sight.
          Their armor, crafted from the bones of their defeated
          enemies, rises to a mask which covers much of their features.
           43.
                         
                         
          Only the red irises of their eyes peer through. That and
          their pitch black skin.
                         
          The slaves hobble down the main boulevard, their naked feet
          splashing in streams of BLOOD which flow from the
                         
                         ACHERONIAN PYRAMID
                         
          Up ahead looms a colossal pyramid, surrounded in a semi-
          circle by five massive statues. As we grow closer the
          grotesque surface of the pyramid becomes clearer, one hewn
          from cracked bone and empty sockets.
                         
          The thunderous heartbeat seems all around us now. THUMP,
          THUMP.
                         
          The three hundred foot high edifice is made ENTIRELY OF
          THOUSANDS OF HUMAN SKULLS. Many of the skulls still drip with
          blood, pouring down from the pyramid's crest, where stands
                         
          A BLACK THRONE
                         
          Images of snakes gorging themselves on hapless victims are
          carved in bas relief into the throne's surface.
                         
          Standing before the throne, surrounded by BLACK ROBED PRIESTS
          are a man and woman, mere shadows in the silhouette of
          torches.
                         
          The HEAD PRIEST and his ACOLYTE approach with TWO CROWNS. One
          is made of GOLD, the other of IRON.
                         
          The Gold crown goes on the head of the man. For the woman,
          the Iron crown is placed on her head.
                         
          And suddenly, THUMP, THUMP. IRON SPIKES SHOOT OUT OF THE IRON
          CROWN PIERCING THE WOMAN'S FOREHEAD, HER SCREAMS ECHOES
          THROUGHOUT THE CITY.
                         
          Blood streams down the woman's face as she turns toward the
          torchlight.
                         
          IT IS TAMARA.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. CAMPFIRE - NIGHT
                         
          Tamara leaps up, startled. Her face is covered in sweat, her
          eyes as terrified as the victim from her dream.
                         
          Nearby we hear screaming of another type. Remo.
           44.
                         
                         
          EXT. OPEN FIELD - NIGHT
                         
          MUFFLED SCREAMS. We pull out of Remo's wide mouth, stuffed
          with cloth, trying to bellow in uncontrollable agony.
                         
          A hand comes in and pulls out the cloth. It's Conan.
                         
                          REMO
           Please! Mercy!
                         
                          CONAN
           You are more fit to inflict torture
           than to endure it. Your life is not
           nailed to your spine as my peoples
           are.
                         
          We PULL OUT, revealing that Remo arms are spread-eagle,
          attached to ropes pulled taught by opposing tree limbs.
                         
          Conan nudges him with the point of his sword. Remo SCREAMS in
          agony, then speaks in his savage, broken dialect.
                         
                          REMO
           Stop! Stop! I know how make you
           rich! Rich! You hear name Khalar
           Singh? You have what he want. The
           girl, yes? Khalar give you anything
           for her. More!
                         
                          CONAN
           Why would he?
                         
          Remo pauses, not wanting to answer. Conan put the blade back
          to Remo's neck.
                         
                          REMO
           She could be the one.
                         
                          CONAN
           One what?
                         
                          REMO
           The one. The Queen.
                         
          Conan's mind races, remembering Khalar's words from long ago.
                         
                          CONAN
           A queen in hiding.
                         
                          REMO
           Yes! Yes! I sent to find her. Bring
           her. He wait for me now, at Great
           Wall. He pay you anything. More!
           45.
                         
                         
                          CONAN
           So I should ransom her to your
           master? Not exactly loyal -- but
           still, a good idea.
                         
          Conan pulls out a sheet of handwritten paper from Remo's
          tunic.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           You'll help me deliver it.
                         
                         
          EXT. GREAT WALL - NIGHT
                         
          Torchlight dots the heights of a fifty-foot high stone wall,
          erected between giant rock formations, an impassable barrier
          that runs countless miles.
                         
          The wreckage of old siege equipment dots the hillside before
          the wall.
                         
                         
          EXT. CATAPULT - NIGHT
                         
          An aging catapult looks down upon the wall below. Slowly, it
          begins to turn.
                         
          Conan pushes the catapult until it aims towards the Great
          Wall.
                         
          We hear MUFFLED SCREAMS, and find Remo tied to a boulder
          cradled in the catapult. Conan pulls the gag out of Remo's
          mouth.
                         
                          REMO
           Please! Please! I help you! I do
           anything you wish!
                         
          Conan stuffs a parchment in his mouth. He takes out his sword
          and cuts another NOTCH into his arm.
                         
                          CONAN
           Good. Die.
                         
          He then cuts the rope and WHOOSH! The catapult fires tossing
          Remo and the rock he's tied to high into the night sky.
                         
                         
          EXT. GREAT WALL - NIGHT
                         
          BOOM! Patrolling SOLDIERS are crushed beneath the massive
          rock as it reduces a section of wall to rubble.
                         
                          CUT TO:
           46.
                         
                         
                         KHALAR
                         
          Stares down at Remo's broken body. Ukafa and Fariq stand
          beside him.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           He brought a message?
                         
          Ukafa hands him the bloodied parchment. Khalar reads it.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           Gold, for the girl. A ransom, for
           me to deliver in person.
                         
                          UKAFA
           I'll find them -- and come back
           with their heads.
                         
                          FARIQ
           You let the girl escape once,
           Ukafa. What makes you think you can
           do better now?
                         
                          UKAFA
           I did what?
                         
                          FARIQ
           I found the monastery. It was my
           understanding that you were in
           charge of its capture --
                         
          Ukafa's anger grows.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Enough! We will take no chances. We
           will pay this thief what he wants,
           and more.
                         
                         
          EXT. BRIDGE TO NOWHERE - NIGHT
                         
          Conan returns from the nearby hills, carrying a pair of
          rabbits he's hunted and skinned.
                         
          He looks around, surprised not to find Tamara. He hears a
          yelp from nearby and walks to a dirt path beyond the
          clearing.
                         
                         TAMARA
                         
          She's tied up and gagged and she's wormed her way this far,
          muddying and scraping herself all along the way. She lets out
          a frustrated grunt as Conan simply picks her back up and
          carries her back to the outcropping.
           47.
                         
                         
          He pulls the gag from her mouth and drops a skinned rabbit at
          her feet.
                         
                          CONAN
           Here. Eat.
                         
          Tamara squirms away from the carcass, disgusted.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Couldn't you at least cook it
           first?
                         
                          CONAN
           Fire draws attention.
                         
          Conan tears into his rabbit, chewing on the raw meat.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Does it bother you, blood on your
           hands?
                         
                          CONAN
           The only blood on these hands I
           claimed with my own sword.
                         
                          TAMARA
           What does that mean?
                         
                          CONAN
           Clean hands mean nothing. Kings and
           Queens claim more lives than I will
           ever meet, and not a drop is
           spilled in their presence.
                         
                          TAMARA
           What are you talking about? I've
           done no harm to you. I've done no
           harm to anyone.
                         
          Conan confronts her, enraged.
                         
                          CONAN
           You lie. You are the very reason my
           people are dead.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Are you mad? I never met your
           people.
                         
                          CONAN
           But Khalar Singh has. He destroyed
           my people, looking for you.
                         
          Suddenly Tamara understands.
           48.
                         
                         
                          TAMARA
           The one who came for us? His name
           is Khalar Singh?
                         
                          CONAN
           You know this.
                         
                          TAMARA
           We did not know who sought us, only
           that we were sought.
                         
                          CONAN
           You hid from him. And while you
           did, others died in your place.
                         
                          TAMARA
           If we did not hide, countless more
           would have been killed! You do not
           know what purpose he has for our
           queen.
                         
                          CONAN
           And I do not care, for he will not
           live to see it bear fruit!
                         
          Tamara is shocked.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Wait -- you seek to kill this
           Khalar? We have the same aim. He
           takes my queen to Khor Kalba. I
           have sworn an oath to protect her.
           I can help you.
                         
                          CONAN
           Enough lies.
                         
          Conan puts the gag back in her mouth and binds her hands.
                         
                         
          EXT. ROCK RIDGE - NIGHT
                         
          Conan watches the Great Wall silently, absently playing with
          a DAGGER in his hand as he gauges the many guardposts along
          the wall. The archers. The barrels of oil. The cavalry.
                         
          He feels eyes upon him and looks down at Tamara, still bound
          and gagged, her eyes burning holes in his forehead. Conan
          pulls out her gag.
                         
                          CONAN
           You will keep quiet.
           49.
                         
                         
                          TAMARA
           What use is talking? You won't
           believe a word I speak. I only want
           to know this -- how will you kill
           Khalar? You are too big to play the
           assassin.
                         
                          CONAN
           You will be the lure that will draw
           me close. Then I will scale the
           wall and cut him down where he
           stands.
                         
                          TAMARA
           And the archers and cavalry? They
           will be napping?
                         
                          CONAN
           They will not be a problem.
                         
          Tamara thinks about it.
                         
                          TAMARA
           No. Not good enough.
                         
          Conan is shocked by her brazen response.
                         
                          CONAN
           Did I ask?
                         
                          TAMARA
           Should you fail, I'll be left
           without a weapon, helpless in my
           enemies hands. Let me help, Conan.
                         
          Conan responds by putting the gag back in her mouth.
                         
                          CONAN
           I will not fail.
                         
          But still Tamara glares at him -- and we can see the hint of
          Conan's resolve bending.
                         
                          DISSOLVE TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. GREAT WALL - DAY
                         
          Khalar Singh stands atop the wall, awaiting Conan. Fariq
          draws close.
                         
                          FARIQ
           Let me take care of this thief,
           father. He's beneath your notice.
           50.
                         
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           He killed Remo, likely his cavalry
           legion as well. Whatever he is, he
           is more than a mere thief.
                         
          Then, off in the distance, at the far edge of the desert
          clearing, two figures step out from amongst the boulders.
                         
          CONAN AND TAMARA
                         
          Conan holds a squirming, but bound Tamara.
                         
                          CONAN
           Be still!
                         
          Conan thrusts Tamara in Khalar's direction.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           (yelling to Khalar)
           I have what you want! Where's my
           gold?!
                         
                         KHALAR
                         
          Khalar reaches down and lifts a heavy sack of gold coins.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
                          (YELLING BACK)
           Triple your price. Come and claim
           it.
                         
          GATES OF THE WALL - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          The gates open and Khalar strides out into the clearing.
                         
          CONAN AND TAMARA
                         
          stand a hundred feet ahead.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           Send her to me.
                         
                          CONAN
           Send the gold.
                         
          Khalar Singh throws the gold sack. It lands halfway between
          them. He sends Tamara ahead, her mouth gagged.
                         
          But the moment Tamara reaches the gold --
                         
          From out underneath the sand, FOUR HORSEMEN rise up out of
          the desert floor. They each bear weighted nets and spiked
          lances, and they surround Conan.
           51.
                         
                         
          The first rider gallops towards Conan who simply LOPS OFF THE
          HORSES FRONT LEGS. As the beast collapses, Conan crushes the
          rider's skull with his broadsword.
                         
          The next two riders attack together, but Conan dodges their
          nets and rips away one of their spears, only to lodge it into
          the other rider's chest. He dives at and tackles the first
          rider, TOPPLING HIM, ALONG WITH HIS HORSE. He snaps the
          second rider's neck.
                         
          The last rider comes at Conan, who horizontally slashes RIGHT
          THROUGH THE HORSE'S NECK AND THEN THE RIDER'S NECK. Both
          human and animal head tumble to the desert floor.
                         
          All four riders are dead, in a matter of seconds.
                         
                         KHALAR
                         
          Smiles. He's got Tamara by the neck.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           You're fast. But are you fast
           enough?
                         
          Conan's eyes go to the top of the wall, where CHEREN and his
          archer prepare to fire. Conan rushes forward as the flaming
          arrows stream toward him.
                         
          EXPLOSIONS rip through the air where Conan was, throwing up a
          huge dust cloud.
                         
          Conan bursts out of the dust cloud, lunging in an attack.
                         
          But Khalar Singh is not there. He has withdrawn inside the
          gates.
                         
          Baring his teeth, Conan runs at the wall itself.
                         
          Cheren and the archers let loose another volley at Conan, who
          evades and strikes away the falling arrows with his sword.
                         
          Explosions fill the air, but none of them scorch Conan as he
                         REACHES
                         
          THE GREAT WALL
                         
          Conan hits the base of the wall at full stride, like a
          mountain lion. Reaching out, he launches himself up, taking
          half the vertical of the wall in a single leap.
                         
          Digging his hand into the seam of the wooden beams, he stops
          only to vault up again, taking the forty foot wall in two
          upward bounds.
           52.
                         
                         
                         WALL WALK
                         
          Conan leaps upon wall walk, the passageway atop the Great
          Wall.
                         
                         FARIQ
                         
          Tries to hide his surprise. Even as he draws his sword, Conan
          takes out the four SOLDIERS in his way.
                         
                          FARIQ
           You should have run, while you
           could.
                         
          Conan looks at the sword. It strikes a chord in him. IT IS
          THE SWORD HIS FATHER FORGED! Enraged, Conan charges the
          slight Fariq.
                         
          Fariq partially parries the attack. He's obviously well-
          trained, but he's no match for Conan. The tip of Conan' blade
          cuts a large gash in Fariq's cheek.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Fariq!
                         
          Khalar Singh arrives, grabbing his son by his collar and
          flinging him away from the barbarian. Fariq struggles to
          stand, trying in vain to hide his embarrassment.
                         
          Conan and Khalar Singh size each other up on the narrow wall
          walk.
                         
                          CONAN
           I was wondering what it would take
           for you to stop cowering.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           I wasn't cowering. I was studying.
           You're quite gifted with a sword,
           but it's not from schooling. Your
           speed and power makes up for a lack
           of -- finesse. I've seen such
           fighting before -- Cimmerian.
                         
          Enraged, Conan charges Khalar Singh. He swings down on Khalar
          Singh's head, only when the sword reaches it, it finds
          nothing but air. Khalar is fast.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           Cimmerian it is. Now it makes
           sense. You came for blood, not
           gold.
           53.
                         
                         
          Conan responds by lunging in, swinging his broadsword in a
          broad arc, with all his might. Even in the small space,
          Khalar's lateral speed is dizzying. He sidesteps Conan's
          attack and backhands Conan's face with the flat of his
          tulwar.
                         
          Conan's resolve wavers momentarily, knowing Khalar could have
          just as easily sliced his throat.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           Your people barely afforded me a
           challenge. You're little more than
           beasts.
                         
          Conan comes at Khalar with twice as much fury, smashing
          entire posts as he hacks at the warlord, who simply evades
          the attack.
                         
          Down the wall walk they move, Conan attacking while Khalar
          seems complacent enough just to defend.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           You've come a long way, barbarian,
           only to fail.
                         
          Khalar ducks Conan's last wild swing and gashes Conan twice,
          both deeply in his midsection. Khalar then KICKS Conan,
          sending the Cimmerian slamming onto the rock parapet.
                         
          CRUNCH. Conan lands directly on his back, his sword
          clattering away from him. Khalar's men back away into a
          circle. Conan struggles to get on all fours.
                         
          Khalar KICKS Conan in his shattered chest, lifting Conan off
          the ground with his might. He follows up with a devastating
          punch to Conan's face, one which lands like a piledriver.
          CRUNCH.
                         
          Conan can only bleed as Khalar looms over him.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           So much for vengeance.
           (to his soldiers)
           Get me oil -- and a torch.
                         
          Soldiers quickly bring over a bucket of oil and a lit torch.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           Is that really the best you could
           do? Is that as far as you could
           think ahead? Just rush in and kill
           me?
           54.
                         
                         
          Behind Khalar Singh, Conan spots Tamara being brought up, her
          hands bound. Her eyes show an intense fear, but resolve as
          well.
                         
                         TAMARA' HANDS
                         
          Between the bonds she slips down a blade. It's CONAN'S
          DAGGER. She quickly cuts her bonds.
                         
          With all the attention focused on Conan, no one is quick
          enough to stop her as GRABS THE TORCH FROM THE SOLDIER,
          LIGHTING THE ARROWS IN CHEREN'S QUIVER.
                         
          Cheren spins around, sees the flames reaching his pitched
          arrows.
                         
                          CHEREN
           No!!
                         
          But it's far too late. Tamara hits the floor, beside Conan.
          BOOM.
                         
                         EXPLOSION
                         
          The blast sends parts of Cheren flying in every direction.
          Ukafa, Fariq, and the wall guards are flattened by the
          concussion.
                         
          Khalar Singh, who was standing closer to the explosion, is
          THROWN AGAINST THE WALL!
                         
                         KHALAR SINGH
                         
          The warlord slowly rises, his head pounding from the
          explosion. He looks up. The entire parapet is on fire.
                         
          He grits his teeth and climbs the wall.
                         
          ATOP THE WALL
                         
          A thick wall of flame rages before Khalar. Conan and Tamara
          are gone. He looks over the far side of the wall, where two
          figures on horseback ride off into the distance, Tamara
          holding Conan atop the horse.
                         
          Ukafa and Fariq rise and see what Khalar Singh sees.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Ukafa, you will take half our
           forces North, to the Sea. I will
           take the rest South.
                         
                          FARIQ
           What of me, father?
           55.
                         
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           You will return to Khor Kalba. You
           will feed the women to the beast
           until you find our Queen.
                         
                          FARIQ
           I will not. I will track the
           barbarian with you --
                         
          Enraged, Khalar Singh grabs him by the back of his head,
          pulling him in close.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           You think I care what you wish?!
           You want to play warrior? It is not
           in you. One day you will be king,
           but warlord, never.
                         
                          FARIQ
           I can. Let me prove it to you!
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           You will not risk your life again.
           You are my line, my successor. You
           will not throw away all that I have
           worked for.
                         
          A smile creeps up on Ukafa's face, watching Fariq's
          embarrassment. He withdraws hastily, all eyes on him.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           (without looking at Ukafa)
           If I find you smiling before you
           bring me the girl, I will take
           every tooth I see.
                         
          Ukafa buries the smile as Khalar turns to the wall of flames
          left in Conan's wake.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          INT. CORIN'S FORGE - NIGHT
                         
          The flames become the blaze of the forge.
                         
           CORIN (O.S.)
           More wood boy! We must test the
           steel with our fire.
                         
          Conan, a young boy again, kneels beside the woodpile, pulling
                         OUT LOGS--
           56.
                         
                         
          But when he hands them to his father, he notices his father
          is covered with sword wounds, cut and bleeding.
                         
                          CORIN (CONT'D)
           What are you waiting for? The fire
           is dying.
                         
          Conan turns back to the wood pile. Instead of wood, the pile
          is full of the bodies of those he recently killed: Lucius,
          Remo, etc.
                         
          The young Conan struggles to push the first body onto the
          forge. Still the fire diminishes.
                         
          Conan turns and there is no more wood. And no more bodies.
                         
                          CONAN
           It's not enough. I've failed you
           father.
                         
                          CORIN
           It will never be enough, Conan.
                         
                          CONAN
           I don't understand --
                         
          He spins. Behind him TAMARA stands, a look of sadness on her
          face.
                         
                          CORIN
           Through suffering, you will learn
           your purpose, boy. And you have not
           begun to suffer yet.
                         
                         
          INT. ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Conan's eyes pop open. He inhales sharply, gripped by the
          dream.
                         
          The room is dark, surrounded by thick draperies. Conan lies
          on a straw bed with white sheets, soaked through with his
          sweat. He looks to his wounds, all bandaged.
                         
          He rises--a bit too fast because he falls back to his bed.
                         
                          TAMARA
           I wouldn't move so fast. I bound
           your wounds as best I could, but
           I'm no healer.
                         
          Conan looks over to discover Tamara sitting nearby.
           57.
                         
                         
                          CONAN
           Where am I?
                         
                          TAMARA
           On the Wasp. You told me where it
           laid, just before you passed out.
           Though I can't say as I feel much
           safer here.
                         
          Conan's response is to rise again, his face contorting in
          pain.
                         
                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           Don't embarrass me with thanks, I
           only saved your life.
                         
                          CONAN
           You were -- adequate.
                         
          Conan pulls aside one of the thick draperies that surround
          his bed. Behind it lies a staircase, which he ascends.
                         
                         
          EXT. ZINGARAN GALLEY - NIGHT
                         
          Conan steps out onto the deck of a sixty-foot djunk,
          traveling quickly down a wide and powerful river.
                         
                          ARTUS
           Look what we have here. A hill ape
           in over his head.
                         
          Conan spins to see the rough, brightly dressed Zamoran pirate
          ARTUS leaping down from the quarterdeck, his sword out.
                         
          The other ZAMORAN PIRATES draw near as well. Tamara sees the
          scene, suddenly uncomfortable.
                         
                          CONAN
           I was just wondering what that
           smell was.
           (sniffs near Artus)
           Now I know.
                         
                          ARTUS
           We take no stowaways. Only paying
           passengers. You've best be laden
           with gold.
                         
                          CONAN
           If it's metal you seek, perhaps
           you'd settle for steel.
           58.
                         
                         
          In a flash Conan's sword lunges forward. CLANG. It meets
          Artus's, sparking as they collide. Artus LAUGHS.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           Still fast Artus.
                         
                          ARTUS
           Fast, deadly, charming, rakishly
           handsome.
           (to the pirates)
           All hail Conan!
                         
                          PIRATES
           All hail Conan!
                         
          Artus slaps his hand on Conan's back and Conan winces in
          pain.
                         
                          ARTUS
           Sorry, friend. Looks like you've
           had a rough road.
                         
                          CONAN
           It won't get easier. Khalar Singh
           lives. He'll be coming for me and
           the girl.
                         
                          ARTUS
           Good. We're scrapping for a fight
           these days.
                         
                          CONAN
           This one may be more than you wish.
           I need you to get me close to Khor
           Kalba.
                         
          Artus rubs his beard.
                         
                          ARTUS
           Rest up. We'll get you there.
                         
          Conan withdraws to his room.
                         
                         
          INT. ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Conan collapses on the bed as Tamara follows him inside.
                         
                          TAMARA
           We go to Khor Kalba?
                         
                          CONAN
           I do.
           59.
                         
                         
          Conan puts a brawny arm over his tired eyes.
                         
                          TAMARA
           No. We do.
                         
                          CONAN
           Just leave me to sleep.
                         
          But Tamara doesn't leave, forcing Conan to respond.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           You would risk your life for
           royalty? Why?
                         
          Tamara pauses, realizing she must trust Conan to gain his
          help.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Because she represent freedom, not
           just ours but all Hyboria's. What
           do you know of Acheron?
                         
                          CONAN
           A tall tale. Meant to scare
           children.
                         
                          TAMARA
           It is no fable. It's my people's
           history. Acheron was an empire that
           swallowed all of Hyboria, led by
           the King and his legion of demon
           warriors. Unstoppable. Insatiable.
           Immortal. But still it had one
           weakness. For the true power of
           Acheron laid not with its King, but
           the Queen. Every twenty years, a
           new queen from the royal line would
           be coronated with a crown of iron.
           Spikes would pierce her, slowly
           drain her precious blood, and
           through her suffering Acheron would
           remain invincible. Until one of my
           ancestors, an Acheronian himself,
           put a stop to this tyranny. He and
           others spirited the new Queen away,
           hiding her from the empire and all
           those who would raise it again.
                         
                          CONAN
           What care I for queens and empires?
                         
          Conan turns to head back to his bed. Tamara grabs him,
          incensed.
           60.
                         
                         
                          TAMARA
           Didn't you hear me? This evil faces
           us all. All of civilization will
           fall if the army of Acheron is
           raised again.
                         
                          CONAN
           I heard. Only I would happily put
           all of your "civilization" to the
           torch myself.
                         
                          TAMARA
           But -- you owe me a debt, you
           thankless oaf!
                         
                          CONAN
           My only debt is to my people. And
           it still lies unpaid.
                         
                         
          EXT. MAN OF WAR - NIGHT
                         
          The enormous siege vessel lies before a burning PORT CITY.
                         
          A SAILOR, crying, grovels on his knees before Khalar and his
          men.
                         
                          SAILOR
           It was a pirate ship. They left as
           soon as the girl and the large one
           boarded.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Which way did they sail?
                         
                          SAILOR
           North.
                         
          Khalar is surprised.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Are you certain?
                         
                          SAILOR
           Yes, please, I'm telling you the
           truth!
                         
          Khalar nods to one of his men, who slits the Sailor's throat.
                         
          Khalar turns to his FALCONER, with the huge bird of prey on
          his arm.
           61.
                         
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Send word to Ukafa. They come to
           him by sea.
                         
          The Falconer nods and heads off. Khalar looks to his
          soldiers.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           Find me a warship.

          EXT. GALLEY - NIGHT
                         
          The ship sails like a ghost over black water, the stars lit
          up impossibly bright. Artus finds Tamara sitting near the
          bow. He hands her a steaming bowl of food.
                         
                          ARTUS
           Try not to taste it going down
           would be my advice.
                         
                          TAMARA
           You've known Conan long?
                         
                          ARTUS
           We sailed with him for a while. I
           would like to say I know the man.
                         
                          TAMARA
           He is a riddle to me.
                         
                          ARTUS
           Aye, he's that too.
                         
                          TAMARA
           We have the same goal. Why will he
           not trust me?
                         
                          ARTUS
           Why would he? He's a stranger in
           every land he trods. A man with no
           home, no people, none but the
           company of ghosts. And he bears the
           weight of their deaths every moment
           of every day.
                         
                          TAMARA
           That is no way to live.
           62.
                         
                         
                          ARTUS
           He doesn't live. I've seen in him
           great mirth, only to watch it
           smothered by greater melancholy. He
           owes a blood debt, and he can
           entertain no other joy, no other
           cause, until it is fulfilled.
                         
                          TAMARA
           And yet you call him friend, and
           risk death to help him.
                         
                         
                          ARTUS
           Let me tell you something of Conan.
           He will never lie. He will never
           break a trust, once given. And he
           will never, ever give up.
                         
                          TAMARA
           He's a stubborn ass.
                         
          Artus LAUGHS.
                         
                          ARTUS
           He is that, lass. He is that.

          INT. DUNGEON - THE PIT - NIGHT
                         
          AKHUN and his Turanian slavers lead the female monks into a
          large circular chamber, lit by many torches. Before them lies
          a PIT, dark and foreboding, with a bamboo grid placed atop
          it.
                         
          Fariq enters, an AIDE holding the iron box he used earlier.
          Fariq has a bandage on his face where Conan struck him, and
          he looks even more angry and malevolent than before.
                         
                          FARIQ
           Here we stand again. Will the queen
           reveal herself, or must another
           innocent suffer?
                         
          Fariq walks past the row of women, each recoiling. He slaps
          one. Then another, his rage only building.
                         
                          FARIQ (CONT'D)
           My father, he tires of your
           charade. He grows impatient. But I
           have no such haste. I enjoy
           watching you squirm.
           63.
                         
                         
          Fariq passes Ilira, slowing his pace. He closes in on the
          YOUNGEST FEMALE MONK, a true innocent with terrified eyes.
                         
                          FARIQ (CONT'D)
           Perhaps you'd like to see the end
           your sisters faced back at the
           monastery?
                         
          Fariq slowly opens the box before her.
                         
                         ACHERONIAN BOX
                         
          In the darkness of the box slithers a grotesque TENTACLE. The
          tentacle is severed, but still alive, thirsting for blood.
                         
          Terrified as she is, the young monk says nothing. Fariq
          closes the box.
                         
                          FARIQ (CONT'D)
           No? Your fear is not enough yet?
           Let's try harder.
                         
          Fariq nods to the slavers, who unchain her from the rest.
                         
                          FARIQ (CONT'D)
           I've read all there is to know of
           mighty Acheron. Why would true
           Acheronians protect a traitor to
           their own? You once held the entire
           world in your grasp, now you hide
           and cower like pitiful mice.
                         
          He pushes the girl. She falls to the grid, the sound echoing
          down into the pit.
                         
          AN INHUMAN GROWL emits from the darkness. Something comes.
          The girl looks below.
                         
                          FARIQ (CONT'D)
           And mice are meant to be swallowed
           whole.
                         
          Suddenly, a MASSIVE TENTACLE, ten times the size of the one
          in the box, comes hurtling up through the grid. It grabs the
          young monk, its barbs ripping into her, dragging her into the
          darkness below.
                         
          Her SCREAMS echo.
                         
                          FARIQ (CONT'D)
           What was in the box could only
           drink from you one at a time. But
           the beast of Acheron, it will claim
           four of you this night.
                          (MORE)
           64.
                         
                          FARIQ (CONT'D)
           Who will spare the rest and tell me
           which of you is the queen?
                         
          Not a single woman moves, resolved. Ilira catches herself,
          but also stays silent. She looks up to see Fariq staring at
          her.
                         
          CU - ILIRA'S EYES
                         
          Her pupils widen in fear as Fariq's cold stare bores into
          her.
                         
           FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
           I am here, swine.
                         
          Fariq turns -- only it is another FEMALE MONK that glares at
          him.
                         
                          FEMALE MONK
           I am the one you seek.
                         
          Fariq smiles.
                         
                          FARIQ
           At last. Some bravery. But of
           course, you wouldn't expect me to
           take your word, would you?
                         
          As the Fariq reaches for her--
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          INT. GALLEY - ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Tamara awakens with a SCREAM, her body resting against the
          curved hull of the ship.
                         
                          TAMARA
           No!!!
                         
          Tamara looks around with a panicked look, until she realizes
          where she is.
                         
           CONAN (O.S.)
           I hope I awoke with less clamor.
                         
          Their roles reversed, now it is Tamara's turn to see Conan
          sitting nearby, drinking from a flask of mead.
                         
                          TAMARA
           You're drinking? You were near
           death this time yesterday.
           65.
                         
                         
                          CONAN
           Is there a better reason to drink?
                         
          Tamara actually manages to LAUGH.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Do you think--I could try some of
           that? I'm curious of its taste.
                         
                          CONAN
           You've never tasted mead?
                         
          Tamara shrugs, embarrassed. Conan hands her flask. She takes
          a deep swallow, some spilling out over her cheeks. But she
          doesn't cough, and smiles brightly afterwards.
                         
                          TAMARA
           It's good.
                         
          Conan reaches for the flask, but Tamara ignores him, taking
          another swig. It quickly loosens her tongue.
                         
                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           Let me ask you something. Once
           you've killed Khalar and claimed
           your vengeance, then what? You will
           be free from your ghosts. What of
           your future, Conan?
                         
                          CONAN
           I have no future. It died with my
           people, as I should have.
                         
                          TAMARA
           So your life is penance? For what,
           for living? And when you too die,
           what do you believe happens then?
                         
          Conan just shrugs, taking back the mead.
                         
                          CONAN
           Nothing.
                         
          Tamara, her tongue loosened by drink, laughs.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Nothing? I couldn't live without
           some kind of belief in the world
           after this.
                         
                          CONAN
           I believe in the cold of steel, the
           warmth of flesh. All else is fairy
           tales.
           66.
                         
                         
                          TAMARA
           Perhaps. But I still die with faith
           in my heart, belief in something
           greater than one's self. What will
           you die with?
                         
                          CONAN
           Purpose. I die with purpose.
                         
                          DISSOLVE TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. ZINGARAN GALLEY - MORNING
                         
          Tamara steps out onto the deck, grabbing her pounding head.
          Her first hangover. She hears a THUMPING sound, followed by
          ANOTHER, and walks towards the side of the deck.
                         
          Tamara looks overboard, to the water below.
                         
                         TAMARA'S POV
                         
          THE RIVER IS FILLED WITH BODIES! Bloated, they float in blood
          red water as flies buzz around them. One of them hits the
          hull of the boat. THUMP.
                         
          Tamara blinks, unsure if the vision is real -- but then she's
          joined by other PIRATES who gape at the bodies below.
                         
                          PIRATE 1
           To stations! To stations!
                         
          Tamara turns and up ahead spies --
                         
                         BLACK WARSHIP
                         
          The larger warship cuts through the water, manned by a legion
          of rowers. On the deck of the warship, UKAFA and his SPEARMEN
          stand. The SAILORS get the most out of the billowing black
          sails. The ship gains fast.
                         
                         THE GALLEY
                         
          Conan exits his room, sees the danger. Artus appears at his
          side.
                         
                          ARTUS
           What do you think? They have us
           outnumbered, but we might beat
           their speed.
           67.
                         
                         
                          CONAN
           That is what they wish. They drive
           us to another force, approaching
           from the south.
                         
                          ARTUS
           Then we fight?
                         
                          CONAN
           No. We give them what they think
           they want.
           (to the Pirates)
           About ship! Now!
                         
          The pirates leap into action, tacking and turning the galley
          with great speed and efficiency.
                         
                         THE WARSHIP
                         
          Ukafa smiles, his gold teeth shining. The ship's CAPTAIN
          stands beside him.
                         
                          CAPTAIN
           They're turning to run.
                         
                          UKAFA
           Good. We only need stay close.
                         
                         THE GALLEY
                         
          Is turned around now, fleeing. ARCHERS from the Warship fire
          arrows that barely reach the Galley. The Pirates dodge the
          few that land on deck.
                         
          Tamara reaches Conan and Artus. She's worried to say the
          least.
                         
                          ARTUS
           And now?
                         
                          CONAN
           Let us show them why she is called
           the Wasp.
                         
          Artus smiles. He was hoping Conan would say that.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Why is she called the Wasp?
                         
                          ARTUS
           Open astern! Load the stinger!
                         
          The Pirates rush to the back of the ship.
           68.
                         
                         
          THE BLACK WARSHIP
                         
          The Captain stares ahead, confused.
                         
                          CAPTAIN
           They are doing -- something.
                         
          Sure enough, the stern of the ship begins to part, revealing -
                         
          A MASSIVE CROSSBOW
                         
          Mounted with a barbed harpoon, fifteen feet long.
                         
                          CONAN
           Fire!
                         
          They fire the weapon. The harpoon races for the bow of the
          Warship, a thick rope trailing it. It smashes into the wood,
          ripping through it like it was paper.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           Rip her apart!
                         
          The Pirates grab the heavy rope and run, pulling the rope,
          and the harpoon back towards the Wasp.
                         
          As it's pulled out, the barbs of the harpoon rip a wider hole
          in the warship.
                         
                         WARSHIP
                         
          The Captain and crew are in a panic. Men rush to patch the
          gaping hole in the hull.
                         
                          SAILOR
           We're taking on water!
                         
                          CAPTAIN
           Hard to port!
                         
                          UKAFA
           No. Let them fire again!
                         
                          CAPTAIN
           We will sink.
                         
          Ukafa guts the captain with his spear.
                         
                          UKAFA
           So be it.
           (to his spearmen)
           Get below. Be ready.
                         
                         GALLEY
           69.
                         
                         
          The pirates load the harpoon in the crossbow device a second
          time.
                         
                          CONAN
           Fire!
                         
          It fires, smashing again into the wooden hull of the Warship.
                         
          WARSHIP - INSIDE
                         
          The harpoon lodges deep inside the hull -- where Ukafa and
          his spearmen wait.
                         
                          UKAFA
           Now!
                         
          They rush forward and grab onto the harpoon.
                         
                         GALLEY
                         
                          ARTUS
           Bring her back!
                         
          Again, the pirates pull the harpoon back out. It falls into
          the water as they pull on the rope tied to it.
                         
          They do not notice Ukafa and his dozen spearmen clasping the
          very same rope as its pulled toward the Galley.
                         
          Artus looks at the Warship. It's foundering and sinking
          quickly.
                         
                          ARTUS (CONT'D)
           She's dead in the water!
                         
          A CHEER goes up among the pirates --
                         
          And then one PIRATE takes a spear through the chest. All eyes
          turn to the side of the Wasp, where Ukafa and his men climb
          aboard.
                         
          Conan's eyes alight with fury.
                         
                          CONAN
           Good. I was growing weary with
           boredom.
                         
          Conan motions to a pair of pirates.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           Hide her below.
                         
                         BATTLE
           70.
                         
                         
          The Spearmen rush to the attack. The pirates spring to the
          defense of the ship, countering the Spearmen with cutlass and
          dagger. Ukafa marshals his men as a fierce battle rages.
                         
                          UKAFA
           Find the girl!
                         
          The Spearmen quickly make their way to the interior of the
          galley, throwing the dead bodies of the pirates overboard.
                         
                         CONAN
                         
          Conan grabs the nearby jib, swings over, and plants both feet
          in the face of one of the spearmen, knocking him over the
          side.
                         
                         ARTUS
                         
          The sea captain proves dangerous in his own right, grabbing
          the head of one of the Spearmen and violently pulling it down
          to the gunwale of the ship, impaling the Spearman's eye on a
          handspike.
                         
                         UKAFA
                         
          The massive warrior shows incredible speed as well, dodging
          one cutlass attack only to turn the weapon upon another
          pirate.
                         
                         CONAN
                         
          The Cimmerian cuts through a Spearman, his gaze focused on
          Ukafa. Ukafa stares right back as he runs through a pair of
          pirates. Finally, the two warriors stand only feet apart.
                         
          The two warriors eye each other with satisfaction. Ukafa's
          frightening, sharpened gold teeth shine as he smiles.
                         
                          UKAFA (CONT'D)
           We are each the last of our tribe,
           Cimmerian. Yours dies this day.
                         
          Conan responds by lunging forward, swinging his sword in a
          broad arc. Ukafa is just as quick, stepping back and allowing
          his spear to block the swing.
                         
          Ukafa whirls the war spear in great circles, forcing Conan to
          parry, stepping back beyond the spear's reach.
                         
          The two powerful warriors trade blows back and forth, neither
          able to gain the advantage.
           71.
                         
                         
                          UKAFA (CONT'D)
           Your head will top my spear today,
           but know Khalar's pig son will soon
           share your fate.
                         
          Ukafa tries to spear Conan through the chest, and Conan
          decides to drop his sword, grabbing the spear as it passes by
          him.
                         
          Conan then pulls on the spear, throwing Ukafa off his
          balance, towards Conan. Conan then kicks the warrior in the
          chest, hurtling Ukafa backwards.
                         
          Now Conan turns the spear on its master. Ukafa, unarmed, is
          forced to backpedal as Conan thrusts the spear at him. A pair
          of close misses leaves Ukafa with gashes on his chest and
          arm, but he manages to knock the spear from Conan's hands.
                         
          The battle goes to hand-to-hand. It's primal, each of them
          covered in blood. Ukafa bear hugs Conan, then resorts to
          using his teeth to bite into Conan's shoulder.
                         
          Conan YELLS IN PAIN, butting Ukafa's head and knocking him
          back. Conan falls to the stern of the ship, his back against
          the harpoon crossbow.
                         
          Ukafa shakes off the head butt, and sees his spear nearby. He
          picks it up.
                         
                          UKAFA (CONT'D)
           Now finally, you die.
                         
          He raises up to hurl the spear through Conan, only to see
          Conan manning the harpoon, NOW TURNED TO FACE UKAFA.
                         
          The crossbow fires and the harpoon punches a massive hole
          through Ukafa, its momentum throwing him off the galley, into
          the sea beyond.
                         
                         TAMARA
                         
          She hides inside a small compartment of the ship. She hears
          FOOTSTEPS walking past, then returning. An ARM suddenly
          reaches in and grabs her.
                         
          As she's pulled out, Tamara SCREAMS right in Conan's face. He
          doesn't even flinch.
                         
                          CONAN
           Time to go.
           72.
                         
                         
          EXT. GALLEY - NIGHT
                         
          The battle ended, the pirates toss the dead Spearmen into the
          sea and prepare to make sail again.
                         
          Meanwhile, Conan lashes his sword to his back, standing by
          the gunwales with Tamara and Artus, a SMALL DINGHY waiting
          below.
                         
                          ARTUS
           I could get you closer. Another
           half day along the coast --
                         
                          CONAN
           I need you head west, to draw off
           our pursuers. I'll find another
           path to Khor Kalba.
                         
                          ARTUS
           So be it. Swift wind at your backs.
                         
                         
          EXT. DINGHY - DAY
                         
          Conan rows away from the galley with powerful strokes.
                         
                          TAMARA
           So you are taking me with you to
           Khor Kalba.
                         
                          CONAN
           I never said that. But I won't
           leave a virgin onboard a pirate
           ship, alone.
                         
                          TAMARA
           I -- but -- who said I was a
           virgin?
                         
          Conan just shakes his head as a parting fog reveals a large
          Colossus head, the fallen remains of an enormous statue,
          lying agape on the shoreline.
                         
                         
          INT. COLOSSUS HEAD - DUSK
                         
          Conan pulls off his jerkin, revealing a torso rippling with
          muscles.
                         
                          CONAN
           We'll rest here until morning.
           73.
                         
                         
                          TAMARA
           Will I awake alone? Do you intend
           to leave me?
                         
                          CONAN
           I would do you a kindness. Khor
           Kalba will bring only death.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Please, Conan. Artus told me of how
           you lost your tribe. I too had to
           watch as my people were taken from
           me.
                         
          Conan ignores her, gathering wood for a fire.
                         
                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           All I ask is that you let me travel
           with you. I too have a purpose. I
           must get to the queen. I would
           rather you kill me here, than fail
           her again.
                         
          Conan continues collecting, infuriating Tamara.
                         
                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           I was wrong about you. You are no
           fearless warrior. Your heart is
           closed to all but fear -- and hate.
                         
          Conan draws flint, starting the fire. Only once his task is
          complete does he answer Tamara.
                         
                          CONAN
           We leave at dawn. I will not break
           stride for you. Not once. I will
           get you into Khor Kalba. Beyond
           that I have my purpose, and you
           yours.
                         
          Tamara offers a thankful nod, her anger subsiding.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Nice fire. Does it mean you'll
           actually cook the meat this time?
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. KHALAR SINGH'S WARSHIP - DUSK
                         
          Khalar looks at the destruction of Ukafa's warship, the
          bodies filling the water. Khalar spots Ukafa's dead body
          floating there, harpoon still lodged in his chest.
           74.
                         
                         
          The ship's CAPTAIN approaches.
                         
                          CAPTAIN
           The pirate ship sailed to the west.
           Even under full sail it'll be no
           easy task to overtake her.
                         
          Just then, a FALCON approaches. The Falconer retrieves it, a
          parchment tied to its talon. He passes it on to Khalar Singh.
                         
          Khalar Singh reads it, a smile creeping upon his face.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Fariq has done well.
           (to the Captain)
           Head east, back to Khor Kalba.
                         
                          CAPTAIN
           But our chase points the other way.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           The chase is over. They come to me
           now.
                         
                         
          EXT. FOREST - LATE DAY
                         
          Tamara watches Conan from a distance. He silently stalks prey
          with nothing more than a knife.
                         
                         A BOAR
                         
          Its ears listen intently, aware. Suddenly, it bolts.
                         
                         CONAN
                         
          Is just as quick, racing through the forest on a intercepting
          course with the great beast. He leaps over a fallen log,
          throwing his dagger with a sweep of his arm.
                         
          The boar goes down, the blade through its jugular. Conan
          walks up to the struggling beast, showing no satisfaction as
          he mercifully SNAPS its neck.
                         
                         
          INT. COLOSSUS HEAD - NIGHT
                         
          The great haunches of the beast roast over the fire. Conan
          turns the meat.
                         
          Behind him, Tamara approaches. She has cleaned herself up,
          her white robe translucent in light of the fire, her wet hair
          glistening.
           75.
                         
                         
          Conan can't help but notice her supple skin, her curves. He
          stops chewing.
                         
          Tamara notices. Embarrassed, she turns so that he can only
          see her side. Conan returns to his food.
                         
                          TAMARA
           What were the women of your tribe
           like, Conan?
                         
                          CONAN
           They fought beside the men.
                         
                          TAMARA
           So they were equals. And your
           mother?
                         
                          CONAN
           She died in battle, even as I was
           born.
                         
                          TAMARA
           So you never knew her. It was the
           same with me. I've always known
           being a mother was somehow not my
           fate. But--
                         
          Tamara falters, unsure. But Conan's quiet eases her.
                         
                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           You said earlier Khor Kalba will
           bring only death. Were you trying
           to scare me, or do you really
           believe our end lies there?
                         
                          CONAN
           I don't lie.
                         
          Tamara nods, having heard as much about Conan. She turns back
          to face him, no longer hiding her body.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Then we don't have much time. Your
           mother perished too young, but at
           least she died having known the
           touch of one who cared.
                         
          Tamara steps closer to Conan.
                         
                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           So -- do you care, Conan?
                         
          Conan rises to her, his broad form looming over her slight
          build.
           76.
                         
                         
          But Conan shows surprising gentleness as he removes her robe
          and pulls her naked body into his, their mouths meeting in a
          desperate kiss.
                         
                         LOVE SCENE
                         
          Conan lies atop Tamara by the fire, their sinewy limbs
          intertwined, fingers locked together. He thrusts into her,
          causing her face to contort in pleasure and pain.
                         
          The fire grows brighter as Tamara rolls on top, undulating as
          their pace quickens. Tamara CRIES OUT in ecstasy.
                         
                         AFTERMATH
                         
          Tamara stares into the fire, her body wrapped around Conan's.
          She gently caresses the notched scars cut into his arm.
                         
                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           I've only ever heard you speak of
           what you'd die for, Conan. What
           would you live for?
                         
          Conan, his eyes closed, keeps them shut.
                         
                          CONAN
           Do you ever tire of talking? Let me
           rest, woman.
                         
          Tamara reaches down between Conan's legs. His eyes open.
                         
                          TAMARA
           I thought that may work.
                         
          Conan growls and pulls himself atop Tamara. Looking down at
          her face, her hair loose and wild, she's beautiful in the
          soft glow of the firelight.
                         
                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           I see you clearly now, finally,
           after all this time.
           (she kisses him deeply)
           I would be that which you live for,
           Conan, if you would have me. You
           may have faith in nothing, Conan --
           but I have faith in you.
                         
          Conan lowers himself back down upon her.
                         
                          DISSOLVE TO:
           77.
                         
                         
          EXT. MOUNTAIN RIDGE - DAY
                         
          Conan powers his way to the top of a high ridge, spotting
          down in the vista below:
                         
                         KHOR KALBA
                         
          Surrounded on three sides by the coastline, the stone
          fortress of Khalar Singh rests on a plateau, overlooking a
          bustling, tented city below.
                         
          Conan spots a long CARAVAN of packed camels working their way
          towards town, driven by DESERT TRADERS from Shem.
                         
                          CONAN
           We'll slip in, along with those
           traders. But you'll need a change
           of clothes, those monks' robes will
           draw attention.
                         
          Tamara looks down at her loose-fitting robes.
                         
                          TAMARA
           What will I wear?
                         
                         
          EXT. KHOR KHALBA - ENTRANCE - DAY
                         
          The caravan rides up to the walled entrance to the city,
          guarded by Khalar's troops. Blended in amongst the others,
          Conan now wears the elaborate head scarf and clothes of
          Shemish traders, obscuring all but his eyes.
                         
                         TAMARA
                         
          Tamara is dressed like a Shemish serving girl, her taut body
          barely covered by silken drapings. She glares at Conan,
          miserable.
                         
                          TAMARA
           I don't understand why I couldn't
           be dressed as you are. I look like
           a whore.
                         
                          CONAN
           And what better disguise for a
           monk?
                         
          Conan tugs on the rope for the camel to move faster. The
          Camel BRAYS and rears. Conan yanks harder and the camel flies
          forward, its eyes wide.
                         
          Conan meets its eye.
           78.
                         
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           Do not test me, beast.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Is there not a living thing you can
           be at peace with?
                         
          They ride into the city, past the troops.
                         
                         
          EXT. KHOR KHALBA CITY - ENTRANCE - DAY
                         
          Conan and Tamara walk through the town's teeming market, a
          otherworldly bazaar replete with animal sacrifices, veiled
          faces and not a hint of morality.
                         
                         STRANGER
                         
          A FIGURE, his form hidden beneath a cloak, spots Conan and
          Tamara as they enter, and begins to follow them.
                         
                         WOODEN PLATFORM
                         
          The city ends at the sheer cliff wall at the bottom of the
          plateau. There stands a WOODEN PLATFORM that is lowered by a
          massive winch, unloading a cavalry regiment and then raising
          back up to the fortress above.
                         
                          CONAN
           It's probably only way into
           Khalar's fortress. I'm sure it is
           heavily guarded at all times, day
           and night.
                         
                          TAMARA
           So we must try to scale the cliff.
                         
                          CONAN
           And dodge arrows as we do so?
                         
          Conan motions up to the winch. Standing beside it are a half
          dozen of the four-armed ARCHERS.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           During the day, we'd easily be
           spotted on the climb. And it would
           be useless to even attempt at
           night. No, we must find another
           way.
                         
                         STRANGER'S POV
                         
          As Conan continues around the base of the mesa, the Figure
          following Conan is joined by TWO OTHERS.
           79.
                         
                         
                         ALLEYWAY
                         
          Conan and Tamara reach a less crowded area of the village
          when a VOICE rings out behind them.
                         
           VOICE (O.S.)
           Halt.
                         
          Conan spins, sword at the ready. From out of the shadows
          comes a pair of MEN, their beady eyes fixed on Tamara.
                         
                          CONAN
           Thieves. You'll regret finding me.
                         
           VOICE (O.S.)
           I think not.
                         
          From out of the shadows steps the ONE-EYED THIEF, the same
          one who Conan saved from Lucius' beatings. He smiles at
          Conan, lifting a KEY from a rope around his neck
                         
           ONE EYED THIEF
           It took longer than you think to
           cut this out of Lucius' stomach.
           After all that work, I figured I'd
           keep it -- for old times' sake.
                         
                         
          INT. THIEVES' TAVERN - AFTERNOON
                         
          A rundown hall, built beneath the city. Wooden supports hold
          up the buildings of the entire city block overhead.
                         
          And within the hall, a gathering of THIEVES and ROGUES.
          They're a flinty collection, many of them missing fingers or
          even hands, evidence of Khalar's cruel justice.
                         
          They eat and drink, sharing tales and tips, WENCHES and
          SERVING WOMEN their cautious eyes following the Cimmerian
          outsider.
                         
          The One Eyed Thief takes them to an open table, and
          immediately three of the serving women descend upon Conan,
          caressing him.
                         
          Tamara watches this, jaw dropped, and manages a COUGH, even
          as a SERVING GIRL delivers mead to the table.
                         
          Conan just smiles as he enjoys the silky bodies of the nubile
          women, their breasts practically framing his face.
           80.
                         
                         
                          CONAN
           What? Do you wish to join in?
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          Conan cleans mead from his face, scowling at Tamara, as the
          One-Eyed Thief uses the tabletop to explain the fortress.
                         
           ONE EYED THIEF
           --so you were right about the
           platform. You'll be long dead
           before you make it top. Same with
           scaling the cliff. There's no known
           way to break into the fortress.
                         
                          CONAN
           So that's it?
                         
           ONE EYED THIEF
           I didn't say that. I just said
           there's no known way in -- because
           no one has ever tried to. But
           breaking out -- that's another
           story. It's not much easier, but
           it's possible.
                         
          The One Eyed Thief offers the same gap-toothed grin.
                         
           ONE EYED THIEF (CONT'D)
           You just need to find someone crazy
           enough to show you the way.
                         
                         
          INT. SEWERS - NIGHT
                         
          Tamara is the last to follow Conan, the One Eyed Thief and
          the three THIEVES from before down a short ladder. Below lies
          a darkened catacomb, lit only by their torches.
                         
           ONE EYED THIEF
           These catacombs run underneath the
           entire city, even to the cistern
           that drains out from the fortress
           dungeon.
                         
          Tamara's foot drops into knee high water. She immediately
          grabs her nose.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Catacombs? You mean sewers.
                         
           ONE EYED THIEF
           Piss and shit are the last things
           you need to worry about down here.
           81.
                         
                         
          Tamara eyes the muddy water, nothing visible beneath its
          murky surface.
                         
                         
          INT. OTHER SEWERS - NIGHT
                         
          The group wades through the water, single file. Conan notices
          HIEROGLYPHICS and carvings on the wall of the catacomb.
          Massive creatures of the sea, dark sorcery, ritual sacrifice.
                         
                          CONAN
           What is it?
                         
                          TAMARA
           A warning. These catacombs are
           connected to the sea. It says that
           the beasts of Acheron protect its
           secrets.
                         
                          CONAN
           Not from me.
                         
          Conan presses on, into the darkness.
                         
                         
          INT. CISTERN - NIGHT
                         
          The catacomb widens out to a giant circular cistern, its
          walls rising up high into the darkness. As the torches bring
          light to the space, we see HUNDREDS OF DEAD, ROTTING BODIES.
                         
          As Conan and Tamara walk forward, the One Eyed Thief and the
          other stop at the entrance.
                         
           ONE EYED THIEF
           Sorry, friend. We stop here. We've
           heard too much about what lies
           within to go any further.
                         
          Conan simply nods and the thieves depart. Conan raises his
          torch, illuminating the near wall.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Where now?
                         
                          CONAN
           Around. Up.
                         
          Conan heads off one direction, leaving Tamara to navigate the
          other half. Her torch illuminates the grizzly path ahead. She
          inhales deeply and takes her first step.
                         
                         CONAN
           82.
                         
                         
          Following the slick wall, he passes many DEAD BODIES, but
          only one catches his eye. He stops before it.
                         
                         DEAD WARRIOR
                         
          Nothing more than a skeleton, picked clean by the rats. But
          he still bears his leather armor, and a horned helmet that
          resembles his father's own.
                         
          Conan takes the helmet and places it on his head. It fits
          perfectly.
                         
                         TAMARA
                         
          Tamara is gingerly making her way through the knee high
          sewage water and the dead bodies submerged within.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Oh!!!
                         
          Tamara leaps up, swinging the torch down towards the water.
          Conan, nearby, unsheathes his sword.
                         
                          CONAN
           What?
                         
                          TAMARA
           Something touched me. Something
           slimy.
                         
          Conan walks over, the torchlight revealing something on
          Tamara's leg. It's a SLUG, which he flicks off.
                         
                          CONAN
           Crom! Stop wasting time.
                         
          But when Conan steps forward, something ROILS THE WATER right
          before him. He spots a HUGE TENTACLE just before its
          submerges back into the water.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           Crom indeed.
                         
          Then Tamara SCREAMS as another tentacle rises up from the
          water, wrapping around her waist. Tamara grabs hold of the
          wall as the tentacle tries to pull her underwater.
                         
          Conan immediately SLASHES the tentacle, pulling Tamara away.
          The squirming decapitated tentacle squirts black blood
          everywhere, the knee high water seems to come alive with
          roiling intensity.
                         
          Conan spins, finding a circular stone staircase tiled into
          the far cistern wall.
           83.
                         
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           Let's go.
                         
                         
          EXT. CIRCULAR STAIRWAY - CISTERN
                         
          As they work their way up the circular stairwell, towards a
          thin shaft of firelight up ahead.
                         
                         
          INT. DUNGEON - NIGHT
                         
          Carved out of solid black rock, both sides of the broad
          corridor are occasionally punctuated by thick steel doors,
          leading to prison cells.
                         
          Conan and Tamara emerge from a sewer drain, pushing their way
          to the floor of the hallway. The heavy darkness presses in on
          Conan's torch like a sentient, animate thing.
                         
          The floor of the corridor is lined with DEAD BODIES, in
          varying states of decay. There are buckets, filled with
          entrails and feces, upended. Tamara put her hand over her
          mouth.
                         
          Conan continues down the hallway. He and Tamara begin to hear
          the sound of EERIE CHANTING.
                         
                          TAMARA
           What is that?
                         
          Up ahead, the torch-lined dungeon plunges into darkness as
          the torches end. Conan holds up his own torch, struggling to
          peer into the black void.
                         
                          CONAN
           Nothing good.
                         
          Conan takes a step forward when suddenly a POWERFUL WIND
          blows out his torch. A moment later, there's the sound of A
          GATE WHISTLING DOWN AND CRASHING INTO THE GROUND.
                         
          In the darkness, comes a DEEP, EARTHY CHUCKLE.
                         
           VOICE (O.S.)
           Welcome.
                         
          A HOST OF OIL LIGHTS SUDDENLY COME UP, revealing that the
          gate that closed behind them was actually just a door to a
          vast CAGE built around a massive PIT.
           84.
                         
                         
          INT. THE PIT - NIGHT
                         
          The same pit where Fariq sacrificed the female monk, only
          now, a half dozen COMBATANTS stand on the grid above the
          void.
                         
          Hanging high above the pit, in baskets, lie other PRISONERS,
          including Tamara's fellow female monks. Several of them YELL
          out Tamara's name as they see her.
                         
          And watching everything, from an amphitheater above the cage,
          is the massive Akhun and several of his slavers.
                         
                          AKHUN
           Which ever one of you slaves gets
           me the girl, lives.
                         
          The Combatants all close in on Conan and Tamara, each taking
          a different plank way to get to them.
                         
                          CONAN
                          (TO TAMARA)
           Stay behind me.
                         
          Tamara steps behind Conan, who blocks the others' path to
          her.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           Who dies first?
                         
          The first two COMBATANTS attack as one, the first wielding a
          short sword, the other a pike. The pikeman thrusts first,
          Conan deftly stepping aside, then pulling the pike, sending
          the wielder off balance and into the abyss.
                         
          The prisoner with the short sword doesn't fare much better,
          as Conan evades his swipe and decapitates him with a single
          blow.
                         
                         TAMARA
                         
          Tamara sees that the prisoner baskets are suspended by the
          top half of the metallic cage. She begins scaling the cage,
          her eyes set upon the imprisoned monks.
                         
                         CONAN
                         
          Three more COMBATANTS step in to replace the fallen duo.
          Conan readies himself as the first one steps up, only to have
          the combatant suddenly grabbed by a ENORMOUS TENTACLE, much
          like the one Conan cut through earlier.
                         
                         TENTACLED MONSTER
           85.
                         
                         
          Up from the darkness of the pit comes a gargantuan monster; a
          gigantic octopus-like behemoth, with multiple tentacles that
          feed a pulsing black orifice lined with razor sharp teeth.
                         
          The creature reaches out and grabs another SCREAMING
          combatants, lowering him to its mouth and devouring him in
          its gnashing maw.
                         
          The creature reaches for Conan, who ducks underneath the
          tentacle, the slices it off. He immediately turns back to
          check on Tamara -- and he discovers she's not there.
                         
          He looks up to see Tamara scaling the cage, now nearly fifty
          feet directly above him.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           Crom!
                         
                         AKHUN
                         
          The massive warrior spots Tamara getting close to the
          prisoner baskets and motions to his two Jailers.
                         
                          AKHUN
           Get her!
                         
                         TAMARA
                         
          She's reached the base of the chain supporting one of the
          baskets when she spots the two Jailers closing in, climbing
          towards her from either side.
                         
                         CONAN
                         
          Spotting Tamara overhead, Conan tries to keep beneath her,
          evading the swarming tentacles while balancing on the rickety
          planks.
                         
                         TAMARA
                         
          She's scaling down the basket supporting chain when the first
          Jailer reaches out to grab her. She reacts by GASHING his
          eyes, and as he instinctively grabs them, he FALLS TOWARDS
          THE PIT.
                         
                         CONAN
                         
          Conan barely dives out of the way as the fallen Jailer
          SMASHES through the plank he was on, forcing Conan to jump to
          another.
                         
          Just then another COMBATANT comes swinging for the Cimmerian,
          forcing him to defend while still not balanced.
           86.
                         
                         
                         TAMARA
                         
          The next Jailer grabs her, pulling her off the cage. He
          struggles to pull towards a nearby exit hatch when she BITES
          HIS EAR OFF.
                         
          The Jailer drops Tamara, who SCREAMS as she falls.
                         
                         CONAN
                         
          Conan spots Tamara plunging towards him. In one swift move,
          he SLASHES his opponent, ducks underneath a writhing
          tentacle, and reaches out to GRAB TAMARA BY THE ARM AS SHE
          FALLS. His shoulder nearly pops out, but he manages to hold
          onto Tamara.
                         
                         TAMARA
                         
          She swings above the chasm, the gnashing teeth of the monster
          below her. Only a single splintering plank holds her and
          Conan aloft.
                         
                         CONAN
                         
          With a grunt, he swings Tamara and throws her to safety, at
          the edge of the pit.
                         
          But as he gets to his feet, he spots the massive Akhun
          entering the arena.
                         
                         AKHUN
                         
          The giant warrior grins as he boards the same plank as Conan.
          He thrusts his thunderous legs down, causing the plank to
          bend and warp.
                         
          Conan struggle to balance on the undulating plank, but his
          training in Cimmeria serves him well.
                         
          Akhun smiles and step closer, again thrusting down with his
          legs. Conan's balance is thrown, but there's no other plank
          close enough for him to jump to.
                         
                          AKHUN (CONT'D)
           You'll make a nice meal.
                         
          Akhun steps down on the plank one last time, but this time
          Conan uses the momentum to SPRINGBOARD UP INTO AIR.
                         
          Conan soars into the air, his cat-like reflexes keeping him
          focused as he lands right before the stunned Akhun. With one
          great slash of his blade, Conan eviscerates Akhun.
           87.
                         
                         
          Akhun's innards drop out of his belly as he falls into the
          abyss, only to be snapped up by the massive beast.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          INT. ARENA OF THE PIT - LATER
                         
          Conan lowers down the last of the baskets. Tamara use a sword
          to smash open the lock, freeing the prisoners inside.
                         
          Tamara shares hugs of joy with the other monks of her flock.
          The women look worn, but unbroken.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Where is Ilira?
                         
                          FEMALE MONK
           She was taken away by Fariq.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Then I'm too late.
                         
          One of the stronger looking women, an ELDER MONK, steps
          forward.
                         
                          ELDER MONK
           No. She was just taken this
           morning. It's not yet midnight,
           and Khalar still must bring her to
           the cave of Acheron.
                         
          Tamara nods and the women begin to ARM THEMSELVES. Conan
          shakes his head at the rag-tag group.
                         
                          CONAN
           You're going to fight Khalar's
           troops? Just you?
                         
          The Elder Monk grabs and nearby pike and twirls it expertly
          about her body, clearly well versed in it use.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Cimmerians aren't the only women
           who know how to fight. And to kill.
                         
          Tamara looks at the other monks.
                         
                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           Our duty was to keep the queen
           safe. We failed. But if Khalar
           brings her to Acheron, it will rise
           again -- and all our peoples'
           sacrifice is for nothing.
                          (MORE)
           88.
                         
                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           So if the queen is not free by the
           stroke of midnight -- she must be
           already dead.
                         
          The other monks nod and they start to head off. Tamara is the
          last to head off, her eyes burning into Conan's.
                         
                          CONAN
           You want my help again.
                         
                          TAMARA
           No. You kept your word, I'll keep
           mine. I pray you fulfill your debt.
                         
          Tamara kisses Conan's cheek one last time and heads off.
                         
                         
          INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT
                         
          The monk travel in single file, the Elder Monk leading the
          way. Suddenly, she stops, motioning to an entranceway ahead.
                         
                          ELDER MONK
                          (WHISPERING)
           Guard.
                         
                          TAMARA
                          (WHISPERING)
           Don't kill him. We need to find out
           which way Ilira was taken.
                         
          The Elder Monk nods and slips up ahead. We hear a SMASH.
                         
                         
          INT. CATACOMB ENTRANCEWAY - NIGHT
                         
          The stunned GUARD lies before the assembled monks. Tamara
          glares down at him.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Tell us where the last girl was
           taken.
                         
          The Guard just LAUGHS at them through bloody teeth.
                         
           CONAN (O.S.)
           Let me ask.
                         
          The Guard's face drops as Conan steps out from the darkness.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Your debt --
           89.
                         
                         
                          CONAN
           Will be where your queen is.
                         
          Tamara smiles. She knows it is a half truth.
                         
                         
          INT. FORTRESS - THRONE ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          As Conan and the monks enter, the throne room is empty,
          scattered light barely illuminating the expansive chamber.
                         
          Ilira sits on the throne, crown on her slumped head. Tamara
          runs over to her.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Ilira!
                         
          She raises Ilira's head, only to discover lifeless eyes.
          Tamara cradles her best friend's face.
                         
                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           She's dead. It's over.
                         
           VOICE (O.S.)
           Not yet.
                         
          Before the monks can react, ARROWS STREAK OUT FROM THE
          DARKNESS, killing them all. Only Conan is quick enough to
          dodge his arrow by diving aside.
                         
          When he comes up, Khalar has Tamara, his sword at her neck.
          Several ARCHERS stand behind him, at the ready.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           It's only begun. Because that one
           was not the heir to Acheron.
                         
          Khalar smiles down at Tamara.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           She is.
                         
          Slowly, what he's saying dawns on her.
                         
                          TAMARA
           No. It can't be --
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Secretive, the traitors of Acheron.
           It wasn't easy, but Fariq finally
           wrung honesty from the girl. That
           poor innocent was forced to live a
           lie, even as the truth was kept
           from the queen herself.

           90.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
                          (TO CONAN)
           And you did the rest, barbarian. My
           thanks for delivering the Queen to
           me.
                         
                          TAMARA
           No!
                         
          Suddenly, a trap door opens beneath Conan and drops down in
          the darkness, landing with a heavy THUD.
                         
                         
          INT. FORGE - NIGHT
                         
          Conan awakens to the familiar sound of a hot blade SIZZLING
          as it hits the cooling vat.
                         
          But this is no dream of his father's forge -- as he looks up
          to see Fariq holding a sword, its tip still red hot, the
          flames of the fortress's forge behind him.
                         
          Conan's thrusts forward, only to find his armed chained
          around a heavy mortar and stone pillar.
                         
          Fariq strokes his newly acquired scar.
                         
                          FARIQ
           At last you awaken, Cimmerian. It's
           been hours you've made me wait for
           my fun.
                         
          Conan says nothing, but his eyes scan the room, taking in
          everything.
                         
                          FARIQ (CONT'D)
           You made me lose face in front of
           my father. That wasn't wise. But
           what should I expect from a
           Cimmerian?
                         
                          CONAN
           A swift end!
                         
          Conan strains at the chain, ripping the skin beneath his
          shackles -- but a thin wisp of mortar comes loose from the
          pillar.
                         
                          FARIQ
           Hardly. But that is a difference
           between you and me. A swift end
           would be a mercy I do not intend to
           grant. No, you must suffer for your
           transgressions.
                          (MORE)
           91.
                         
                          FARIQ (CONT'D)
           You must beg for your suffering to
           end. Just as your people did.
                         
          He waves the glowing sword tip in front of Conan's face.
                         
                          CONAN
           You lie. I was there. My father
           never uttered a sound.
                         
          Fariq LAUGHS, amused.
                         
                          FARIQ
           You were there? What were you
           doing, warrior? Watching your
           father die, without saying a sound?
           Taking your eyes will be justice
           indeed, coward.
                         
          Fariq pushes the hot tip of the sword against Conan's skin.
          Conan's face reddens with pain, but he doesn't utter a sound.
          But as Conan pulls on his chains -- more mortar falls. As
          Fariq turns back to place the sword in the forge, Conan
          notices one of the bricks the chains are fastened to is
          LOOSE.
                         
                          CONAN
           I saw my father die. Slain by one
           who can only kill men already on
           their knees.
                         
          Fariq turns, his eyes blazing. He glances over at the two
          GUARDS by the door, who try not to listen.
                         
                          FARIQ
           I've killed many in battle, cur.
                         
                          CONAN
           Really? Then why did your father
           not let you face me before, when I
           had sword in hand. He thought you
           unequal to the task.
                         
          Fariq responds by pushing the red hot blade against Conan's
          chest. Conan just YELLS back at him.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           Coward! Prove your strength!
                         
          Again, Fariq pushes the hot blade against Conan's skin.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           Take my eyes, coward -- if you can.
           92.
                         
                         
          Fariq yells and thrust the tip of the sword at Conan's head.
          Conan lifts his manacles, forcing the blade up into the brick
          holding his chain.
                         
          Then Conan pulls on the chains with all his might, loosening
          the heavy brick, which falls to the ground.
                         
          In one powerful movement, Conan begins SWINGING the chain
          with the mortar block on the end, a homemade ball and chain.
                         
          The two Guards come forward, sword drawn, only to meet with a
          CRUNCHING blow by Conan's weapon. Both their heads get caved
          in.
                         
          Fariq rushes Conan, getting in too close for Conan's wide
          swings. Conan simply meets Fariq's sword with the heavy
          chains, then encircles Fariq's neck with the steel bonds.
                         
          Fariq CHOKES, falling to the ground, gasping for air. But
          Conan doesn't kill him -- yet.
                         
                         THE FORGE
                         
          A vat of molten steel bubbles in a cauldron within the forge.
          Conan uses tongs to lift the cauldron out.
                         
                         FARIQ
                         
          Conan kicks him onto his back. Fariq's last vision is that of
          Conan, tipping the cauldron, the hot iron descending toward
          his eyes. Fariq SCREAMS.
                         
          Conan reaches down and picks up Fariq's sword. THE SWORD
          CONAN'S FATHER MADE FOR HIM.
                         
                         
          EXT. SEA PENINSULA - NIGHT
                         
          By torchlight, Khalar Singh leads his black-armored PERSONAL
          GUARD, two dozen men strong, across a rocky peninsula,
          jutting out into the sea. On the back of Khalar's horse,
          bound, rides the helpless Tamara.
                         
          As they round a large rock spire they spy a fearsome and awe
          inspiring sight. A massive SKULL, seemingly a natural rock
          formation, rises over the peninsula.
                         
          As they ride closer, we can make out one more detail -- the
          mouth of the skull is actually a massive door, at least sixty
          feet high, and seemingly made up of jagged bone. It has the
          appearance of teeth, completing the skull illusion.
           93.
                         
                         
          INT. ACHERON CAVE - NIGHT
                         
          It takes the full complement of soldiers to open the enormous
          doors. Khalar Singh rides in. Moonlight from the huge eyes of
          the skull illuminate terrifying faces in the darkness. Faces
          of demonic warrior statues.
                         
          At their feet lie the decaying bones of human skeletons, too
          numerous to count.
                         
                          TAMARA
           This is no empire, only a
           graveyard.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           You see only with your eyes.
                         
          Khalar nods to his men. Two Guardsmen take their torches and
          light other torches set in the walls. It sets off a chain
          reaction. As far as the eye can see torches ignite revealing
          the true scope of this place.
                         
          An enormous cave, the walls lined with monumental columns
          that frame countless bas relief carvings of demonic origin.
                         
          And at the far of the cave, an ALTAR sits beneath a raised
          THRONE, surrounded by a SACRIFICIAL POOL. The pool is empty.
                         
          Khalar turns to his guards.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           Close the gates and stay here. Send
           my son to me when he arrives.
           (motioning to two of them)
           You two, come with me.
                         
                         
                         THE ALTAR
                         
          Khalar dismounts at the sacrificial altar, carved of out of
          purple-shaded rock. Around its edges are deep channels, for
          the blood of its victims. And on its four corners -- shackles
          of bone.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           The Acheronians had a wonderful
           sense of balance, don't you think?
           For one to ascend to royalty,
           another must fall.
                         
          With the flick of a wrist, Khalar cuts Tamara's bonds.
           94.
                         
                         
          Tamara head butts him, struggling to escape, but Khalar
          absorbs the blow effortlessly. He throws Tamara upon the
          altar, his two guards shackling her in place.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           For a hundred generations the kings
           of Acheron were crowned, and the
           queens were sacrificed.
                         
          Khalar snaps his fingers and two guardsmen bring an ornately
          carved BOX MADE OF BONE, laying it before the altar. Like a
          Chinese puzzle box, Khalar manipulates the carvings of
          skulls, sacrifices, and creatures until the box UNLATCHES.
                         
          And from the box he lifts two items. A CROWN OF GOLD and A
          CROWN OF IRON. The crown of gold is magnificent, ornately
          detailed gold that glows in the firelight.
                         
          But the crown of iron is terrifying. Huge rough spikes extend
          from it in every direction. It looks more like a weapon than
          a crown.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           What a day for you. This morning
           you were a handmaiden. Tonight, you
           are a queen giving birth to an
           empire.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. CAVE ENTRANCE - NIGHT
                         
          Bloodied and weary, Conan approaches the Skull Rock. He has
          nothing more than his sword, his loincloth and a small BURLAP
          SACK tied to his hip.
                         
          He stumbles, falling to his knees. His wounds have taken a
          grave toll. Still he stands and presses on.
                         
          He pushes on the doors. They do not budge in the least. He
          puts his shoulder to the doors -- his every muscle straining
          to their utmost. Again -- no movement.
                         
          Conan backs away, taking stock of the surroundings. He climbs
          up the side of the rock.
                         
                         
          INT. ACHERON CAVE - NIGHT
                         
          Khalar Singh CHANTS in Acheronian. Ancient, harsh words, as
          he lifts the two crowns overhead, offering them to the
          statues of dark gods all around.
           95.
                         
                         
                          TAMARA
           Stop. You don't know what you are
           about to do.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           But I do. For thirty years I have
           dreamed of this day. The day our
           people rise from the ashes.
                         
          Khalar Singh continues his chant and places the gold crown
          upon his head. As he does so, the light from the moon
          reflects off the crown, bathing the sacrificial pool in an
          unnatural glow.
                         
          THUMP-THUMP. A deep and foreboding sound echoes throughout
          the cave, shaking everything like an earthquake. It sounds
          like the heartbeat of a giant.
                         
          Khalar next places the iron crown around Tamara's head. She
          thrashes and struggles but to no avail.
                         
          Once the crown is around her head -- THUMP-THUMP! The spikes
          around the iron crown grow shorter AS THE SPIKES DRIVE
          THEMSELVES INTO HER HEAD. She SCREAMS in agony.
                         
          Blood drips from beneath the crown, flowing into channels
          around the edges of the altar.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           It begins. You give birth to an
           empire.
                         
                         
          EXT. THE SIDE OF THE SKULL - NIGHT
                         
          Conan climbs -- muscles straining -- slipping -- hanging on
          by one hand -- and climbing again.
                         
          THUMP-THUMP. The statuary shakes, indeed the whole earth
          does. Conan nearly slips, but keeps his grip.
                         
                          CONAN
           Crom.
                         
          He reaches the eye of the skull.
                         
                         REVERSE ANGLE
                         
          With the moon over his shoulder, Conan stares down at the
          unholy sight before him. We pull back revealing Tamara, her
          blood draining from her body.
           96.
                         
                         
          INT. ACHERON CAVE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Tamara, her face pale from blood loss, begins to pray in
          pained whispers.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           It's good that you pray. Gods will
           be here soon.
                         
          Tamara struggles to speak, her body wracked with pain.
                         
                          TAMARA
           He'll--be---here--sooner.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Who?
                         
           CONAN (O.S.)
           Me!
                         
          Khalar turns to see the outline of Conan, framed by the
          moonlight, looking down at Khalar from atop of one the
          warrior statues. A thick vine dangles nearby, Conan's route
          down from the cave roof above.
                         
          Conan then leaps down to the skeleton covered floor before
          the altar. It is a killing floor.
                         
          The two Guardsmen leap for him, but Conan dispatches them
          with a pair of strikes. Both fall down dead.
                         
          Conan meets Tamara's eyes, a look of determination,
          assurance. He starts toward the altar.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           I will say this for you, barbarian.
           You are hard to kill.
                         
                          CONAN
           Let her go.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           You've faced me before and lost.
           What do you think has changed now?
                         
                          CONAN
           My purpose.
                         
          Conan lunges for Khalar, their swords meeting with a flash of
          sparks. They fight to a brief standstill when ---THUMP,
          THUMP.
                         
                         THE ALTAR
           97.
                         
                         
          Tamara writhes in pain as the spikes drive deeper into her
          head. More blood pours forth. The blood in the channels
          speeds up and finds the channel leading down to the
          sacrificial pool.
                         
          Conan makes another movement toward the altar, but Khalar
          nimbly blocks his path.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           You are strong, Cimmerian, but we
           both know you are not my equal.
                         
          Conan takes the burlap sack wrapped at his hip pulls it off.
                         
                          CONAN
           Once you used my father to teach
           your son a lesson about strength.
           Now let me teach you.
                         
          Conan tosses out what is inside. It falls to the ground,
          rolling to Khalar Singh's feet.
                         
                         FARIQ'S HEAD
                         
          Khalar looks down at the ground -- at the head of his beloved
          son, his eyes gone, replaced by molten metal. Khalar trembles
          in shock and rage.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           No.
                         
          Khalar reaches for the severed head, giving Conan a brief
          window to rush to Tamara's side. Conan tries to lift her off
          the altar, but the bone shackles still pin her down.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           Cimmerian!!!
                         
          Enraged, Khalar CHARGES Conan throwing all his skill and
          force into an all-out attack. Conan simply sidesteps it, then
          shatters the bone shackle holding one of Tamara's wrists.
          Before he can shatter the other, Khalar charges again.
                         
          Khalar swings, Conan spins, his blade catching Khalar's just
          inches from his face. Conan throws Khalar off him, knocking
          the warlord back ten feet. Khalar's attack is feral,
          uncontrolled. He's lost his balance.
                         
          Spinning and striking blindly, Conan smashes the second
          shackle on her wrist. He continues his motion, bringing his
          sword around to meet Khalar's next strike.
           98.
                         
                         
          Now Khalar looks like the enraged amateur, and Conan the more
          polished warrior. Their battle takes them away from the
          altar.
                         
          With her hands free, Tamara struggles to pull the spikes out
          and remove the crown.
                         
          THE KILLING FLOOR
                         
          Conan repels another Khalar attack, this time striking
          Khalar's chest and drawing blood. The Guardsmen arrive from
          the other side of the cave, drawing their swords.
                         
          Khalar waves them off, his fury aimed at the Cimmerian.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           The Queen. Shackle her!
                         
                         THE ALTAR
                         
          In agony, Tamara pulls one of the spikes out, then another.
          She pushes with all her might, lifting the crown of iron off
          her bloodied head --
                         
          When the Guardsmen charge her, pin her down, and force the
          crown back on.
                         
          THUMP, THUMP! The crown spikes imbed themselves even deeper
          as Tamara SCREAMS. The blood now fills the channels of the
          altar.
                         
          WE FOLLOW the trail of blood, down the side of the altar, in
          a spiral channel around the leg, and in a wide circle around
          the altar until reaching the channel's end --
                         
          THE FIRST DROP OF TAMARA'S BLOOD TOUCHES THE SACRIFICIAL
          POOL. It BOILS instantly, multiplying itself exponentially,
          bubbling forth and filling the entire pool.
                         
          AND ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE. A massive earthquake jolts the
          entire cave.
                         
          THE KILLING FLOOR
                         
          As Khalar Singh and Conan battle, the ground beneath them on
          the wide cave floor CRACKS and SPLINTERS.
                         
          THUMP-THUMP! The earthquake intensifies and the entire floor
          of the cave GIVES WAY, tumbling into an incredible abyss.
          Conan and Khalar alike grab onto the only rocks they can
          reach to prevent them from falling further.
           99.
                         
                         
          Conan ends up against one of the walls on the side of the
          cave. Khalar clings to the rocks on the edge of the sacred
          pool.
                         
          Their bodies are illuminated by a fiery glow. They look
          below, searching for the source of the glow.
                         
                         ACHERON
                         
          Another two hundred feet deep lies the golden spired city of
          ancient Acheron. The cave is but a forechamber, the slightest
          taste of the true glory and horror of Acheron.
                         
          And as they stare down into the ancient city, the shadows
          there MOVE.
                         
          Is it a trick of the light? No. Whatever the dark forms are,
          they are coming this way, climbing the tallest demonic spires
          and leaping impossibly far to climb up after Conan and Khalar
          Singh.
                         
          Khalar gazes down at the city with wide eyes.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           Beyond my dreams --
                         
                         THE ALTAR
                         
          Tamara, her body's blood nearly drained, is still shackled to
          the altar, which now teeters over the edge of chasm, poised
          to fall into the fiery depths.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Conan!!!
                         
                         CONAN
                         
          On the other side of the abyss, Conan spots her and scales
          the cave wall, up to a tiered plateau. He moves quickly,
          trying to get to Tamara.
                         
                         KHALAR SINGH
                         
          Khalar watches, entranced, as the first of the creatures
          rises out of the pit. They climb the walls like insects,
          clinging to the walls, their heads swiveling like a praying
          mantis.
                         
                         ACHERONIAN WARRIORS
                         
          The look like the statues above -- a hybrid -- part human,
          part demon. Their skin is a perfect black, armor carved of
          black bone, faces once human but now demonic with blood red
          eyes and gnashing teeth.
           100.
                         
                         
          They advance on Khalar Singh, who is furthest down now that
          Conan climbs upward towards Tamara.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
                          (IN ACHERONIAN)
           I am Khalar Singh, King of Acheron.
           I command you to kneel!
                         
          And this demonic horde advances right for him, their razor
          sharp teeth bared. Unsure, Khalar grips his tulwars tight.
          The demonic creatures draw close, and they -- kneel. They
          climb out of the abyss and immediately lower their heads
          before Khalar Singh.
                         
          Out of the corner of his eye, Khalar spots Conan, drawing
          near.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
                          (IN ACHERONIAN)
           Show him the might of the army of
           Acheron!
                         
          But they do not rush to follow the order. They stir. One of
          them with more ornate bone armor than the rest looks over at
          Khalar's Guardsmen.
                         
                          ACHERONIAN COMMANDER
                          (IN ACHERONIAN)
           First, we feed.
                         
          Its voice is somewhere between a whisper and a hiss.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Fine. Take your fill. I will kill
           him myself.
                         
                         CONAN
                         
          Conan is on an intercept course with Tamara, leaping across
          chasms from statue to statue. Just below him, the first wave
          of Acheronian Warriors reach the Khalar's remaining
          Guardsmen.
                         
                         KHALAR'S GUARDSMEN
                         
          Khalar's Guardsmen, who have been watching the events with
          mouths agape, realize the danger too late. The horde of
          Acheronian Warriors leaps on them and a massive battle ensues
          between the demonic warriors and the soldiers.
                         
                         CONAN
                         
          His climbing is dizzying, reminiscent of his youth scaling
          the cliffs of Cimmeria.
           101.
                         
                         
                         KHALAR
                         
          Intercepts Conan just below the altar, his tulwars at the
          ready.
                         
                          CONAN
           Your story ends here.
                         
          The two warriors square off, fighting even as they cling to
          the statues.
                         
                         ACHERONIAN WARRIORS
                         
          The demon warriors not only slay Khalar's Guardsmen, but rip
          their still living bodies apart, dousing themselves in the
          blood of their victims. It is a violent ritual, both
          Bacchantic and gruesome.
                         
                         KHALAR
                         
          Launches himself at Conan, his tulwars sparking off the stone
          statuary. Conan leaps to another statue, parrying the blows.
          Khalar overextends himself, and Conan's sword just barely
          misses his throat.
                         
          Khalar pulls back, tries to settle himself. Conan's eyes
          narrow, he knows what Khalar is doing.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           Like a woman, Fariq cried and
           begged me to spare him.
                         
          Khalar ROARS in rage, launching an all-out offensive. Conan
          backs up slowly, waiting for his moment.
                         
          And it comes quickly. Conan ducks below the tulwars and CUTS
          Khalar across the stomach. Khalar loses his balance and
          falls, one hand grabbing a protruding statue arm, dangling
          over the abyss.
                         
          Conan raises his sword to finish the job.
                         
           TAMARA (O.S.)
           Conan!!!
                         
          Conan glances down. The Acheronian Commander drank his fill,
          and now moves to the altar itself, his claw stroking Tamara's
          body. With one touch, the shackles open. He and the
          Acheronian Warriors drag her pale body toward the abyss.
                         
          Khalar grins up at him through bloody teeth.
           102.
                         
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           They take her to a place you can
           never follow. Who will you fail,
           Cimmerian? Your father or your
           woman?
                         
          Conan leaps down to the altar. The Acheronian Warriors
          attack. Standing atop the altar, Conan cuts down all comers,
          cutting his way through the enemy, working his way to Tamara.
                         
                          CONAN
           Tamara!!
                         
          They leap on Conan, impossibly fast. They stab him. They cut
          him. But he does not stop. Even wounded, he throws them into
          the abyss.
                         
          And he reaches Tamara, just before the Commander drags her
          below. He grabs her arm. The Commander grabs her other arm,
          baring his shark-like teeth.
                         
          BLAM! Conan punches him in the mouth with his free hand and
          the Commander falls into the abyss.
                         
          The bloody Conan pulls Tamara up into his arms. Only for
          Tamara to scream.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Conan!
                         
          Conan spins just in time as Khalar strikes. Khalar's tulwar
          narrowly misses, and Conan counters. His father's sword runs
          Khalar Singh through.
                         
          Khalar's body falls into the abyss.
                         
          But the Acheronian Warriors surround them. Thousands climb
          out of the abyss, teeth bared, closing in on the wounded
          Conan. Tamara, badly weakened herself, grabs Conan.
                         
                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           Conan, you know what you must do.
           Kill me.
                         
                          CONAN
           No.
                         
                          TAMARA
           It is the only way to end this. My
           death gives others life.
                         
                          CONAN
           I cannot.
           103.
                         
                         
                          TAMARA
           You must. Your parents both
           understood that purpose. Now it is
           yours. Live, Conan.
                         
          A tear falls from Tamara's face. The demonic warriors prepare
          to strike.
                         
          Conan drives his sword into Tamara's heart. The crown spikes
          retract and it falls from her head, tumbling into the abyss.
                         
          BOOM! A seismic explosion shakes everything, an unearthly
          GUST OF WIND pulling the Acheronian Warriors back down into
          the abyss.
                         
                         ACHERONIAN CAVE
                         
          The cave begins to fall, massive sections of the roof
          dropping in to decimate the pyramid and the city below.
                         
                         ALTAR
                         
          Conan pulls Tamara's body away, even as the world descends
          into dust and debris.
                         
                         
          EXT. CAVE ENTRANCE - NIGHT
                         
          Khalar's HORSE stands near the entrance. Conan puts Tamara's
          body carefully atop the horse, then mounts it himself. He
          positions her in front of him, his arms encircling her.
                         
          Conan gives her lifeless body one last kiss, her blood
          staining his lips red, as his mother's did as a child.
                         
                         
          EXT. HIGH PLATEAU - DAWN
                         
          A blazing sun threatens to explode over the nearby mountains.
          Conan holds a single torch in his hand. His look is hard.
          Grim.
                         
          We pull back to reveal a funeral pyre, Tamara's body atop it.
          Conan places the torch to the pyre. It quickly spreads.
                         
          We move in, closer and closer upon Conan's ice blue eyes, a
          blazing fire erupting in them. A fire that will never be
          extinguished.
                         
           TAMARA (O.S.)
           Live, Conan. Live.
                         
           FADE TO BLACK.

          HEAD CREDIT SEQUENCE MYSTERIOUS SEWING ROOM - NIGHT,

          
          A HAUNTING LULLABY plays against a black, star-pricked
          sky when something appears in the distance. A BUTTON-EYED
          DOLL floats towards CAMERA, through the open window of a
          small sewing room where it lands in a pair of WAITING
          HANDS, hands that are made of SEWING NEEDLES.

          
          The doll - which resembles a YOUNG BLACK GIRL in old-
          fashioned clothes, hair fixed with ribbons and braids -
          is placed on a sewing table. An elaborate sewing kit is
          opened, and, in flickering green light, the NEEDLE-HANDS
          go to work. The doll's old clothes are cut away; button-
          eyes torn off; hair pulled out. The doll's stuffing is
          removed and then the empty cloth body is pulled inside
          out, turning from NUT BROWN to PALE PINK.

          
          Sawdust is poured in the NEW DOLL's mouth; facial
          features added; blue yarn hair punched in; and then a
          fresh pair of shiny black button eyes is selected from a
          button drawer.

          
          The transformed doll, in a LITTLE YELLOW RAINCOAT, its
          new button eyes affixed, is released out the window and

          BACK INTO THE NIGHT.

          EXT PINK PALACE, ASHLAND OREGON - DAY

          
          WIDE ANGLE on a rambling old Queen Anne-style house with
          tacked-on outside stairs. It's late winter, the sky a
          damp, grey sponge. A SIGN in the foreground reads "Pink
          Palace, Apartment for Rent".

          
          MR. BOBINSKY - a seven-foot-tall blue-skinned man -
          performs calisthenics on the rooftop, counting in
          Russian.

          

                                 MR. BOBINSKY
                    Dras, dva, tri, chetyri.
                    Dras, dva, tri, chetyri.
                    Dras, dva, tri ...

          

          
          A BEEPING SOUND begins and he pauses. A tired MOVING VAN
          backs into frame and up the muddy driveway. A VW BEETLE -
          suitcases roped to its top - recklessly passes the truck
          and disappears around the side of the house. Bobinsky
          shakes his fist angrily after the car and shouts:

          

                                   MR. BOBINSKY (CONT'D)
                    Mer-sa-vich!

          
          He marches away indignantly. One of the MOVERS, unseen in
          the truck, speaks to his companion.

          

                                 MOVER 2 (O.C.)
                    We're here. Time to muscle up.

          

          
          ANGLE ON moving truck's REAR DOORS as they're wrenched
          open by two men - MOVER 1, tall and bear-shaped, and
          MOVER 2, built like a brick top - to reveal a lot of
          BOXES and BEAT-UP FURNITURE.

          
          They haul out the LOADING RAMP towards CAMERA.

          
          NEW ANGLE, EXTERIOR STAIRS to BASEMENT FLAT. APRIL SPINK,
          a rotund little old English lady with bad legs, surveys
          the MOVERS as they pass by her chair-lift with boxes and
          furniture. The old gal can't wait to tell her flat mate
          below about the young, strapping men.

          

                                 MOVER 2 (CONT'D)

                           (EFFORTS)
                    Got it? Almost there, just a few more.
                    Come on, now, LIFT.

          
          ANGLE ON FRONT PORCH. The job finished, Mover 2 heads
          down the front steps while Mover 1 waits for a signature
          from the unseen-but-for-his-hands new tenant. Papers
          signed, a tip of a single, grubby dollar bill is placed
          in the outstretched hand of the disappointed mover, and
          the door is shut.

          

          

          EXT HOUSE, REAR VIEW - SAME

          
          ANGLE from BACK YARD. Hiding behind shrubs, WE SHARE the
          POV of a MYSTERIOUS SPY. With a CLICK, a close-up lens is
          rotated into place to better see the movers quietly pack
          into the truck and drive away. A MANGY BLACK CAT walks
          right in front of the lens and looks at us with concern.
          OFF-SCREEN, a door bangs open. WE FOLLOW the cat as it
          races up a tree and out a branch towards the BACK PORCH
          to investigate.

          
          CORALINE JONES, 11, steps onto the porch in a YELLOW
          RAINCOAT with a shoulder bag. WE - SPY'S POV - CLICK to a
          CLOSE-UP to find this new tenant has BLUE HAIR and a
          skeptical face.

          
          NEW ANGLE, non-spy reverse, on Coraline as she glances
          furtively over her shoulder, then hops down the steps and
          moves diagonally away from the house.

          
          NEW Angle, SPY POV. We watch Coraline head towards the
          WOODY SHRUB we've hidden ourselves in. We DUCK DOWN.

          
          ANGLE on Coraline, non-spy, shrub by garden gate. She
          reaches into the shrub and breaks off a FORKED BRANCH.
          She removes the stick's red leaves, aims it like a
          DOWSING ROD and heads into the garden.

          
          CAM PUSH IN to shrub as the SPY RISES UP, wearing a three-
          eyed SKELETON MASK on his head and SKELETON GLOVES on his
          hands. The black cat hops into frame, glances at the spy
          and follows the girl.

          

          

          MONTAGE VARIOUS EXT - SAME

          

          AFISH POND IN GARDEN - SAME

          
          Coraline explores the drained, crumbling pond. She finds
          an old TURTLE SHELL in the muck and holds it up. After
          rapping on it to make sure it's empty, she puts the shell
          into her shoulder bag.

          
          ANGLE ON CAROLINE, SPY POV. WE PUSH ASIDE dead vines from
          the railing of the GARDEN BRIDGE for a better look.
          Coraline aims her forked stick once more then follows it
          up from the pond and out the BACK GATE. A gust of WIND
          blows DEAD LEAVES into a swirling eddy WE TRACK high up
          into the air.

          

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

          

          

          ROCKY PATH HIGH ABOVE HOUSE - LITTLE LATER

          
          SPY POV on sky, now dark with GATHERING STORM. Hidden
          behind a NATURAL WALL OF STONES, WE TILT DOWN to view
          Coraline crossing frame on a STEEP HILLSIDE path. She
          steps on an old RAILROAD TIE, and her foot SINKS into the
          rotted wood, stopping her.

          
          WE LEAN OUT for a better view, and DISLODGE some stones
          that roll down past her. WE DUCK as she jerks her head
          our way.

          
          NEW ANGLE, non-spy. Unnerved, Coraline calls out.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Hello?...   Who's there?

          
          She throws a rock over the wall of stones, HITS THE
          UNSEEN SPY, causing a CRY OF PAIN. ANIMAL? HUMAN? Freaked
          out, she GASPS, runs up the trail.

          
          NEW ANGLE, SPY POV. We rise up to watch and the black cat
          hops onto the stone wall.

          

          

          EXT. OVERGROWN ORCHARD - CONT.


          
          Coraline races down past an OLD TRACTOR and into an
          ORCHARD. WIND begins to blow.

          
          NEW ANGLE as we move beside Coraline through the old
          apple trees, where she nearly trips on the tongue of a
          harvest cart.

          
          DOWN ANGLE ON on Coraline as she BACKS INTO a circle of
          TOADSTOOLS in front of a STUMP. BREATHING HARD, she looks
          out for her pursuer.

          
          NEW ANGLE. The black cat shoots past Coraline in the tall
          grass. She can't see him but she knows something is
          there. Already behind her now, the cat LEAPS onto the
          stump with a loud, warning MEROWWW!

          
          STARTLED, Coraline YELLS and whips around. She's both
          angry and relieved when she sees it's just some cat.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    You scared me to death, you mangy thing!

          
          Cat GLARES at her with BLUE OPAL EYES, makes a low growl
          as she stands. She exhales.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    I'm just looking for an old well. Know
                    it?

          
          Cat BLINKS EYES slowly.

          

                                 CORALINE(CONT'D)
                    Not talking, huh?

          
          The wind picks up. She grasps the forks of her stick,
          closes her eyes, and, tracing a figure eight above her,

          SAYS:

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Magic dowser, magic dowser: show... me...
                    the well!

          
          ANGLE ON CORALINE FROM HIGH BLUFF. The SPY moves into
          frame, astride some kind of MOTOR-BIKE. He presses a
          button on the handlebars and BLASTS a loud AIR HORN.
          STARTLED, Coraline SPINS around.

          
          UP ANGLE ON SPY. As LIGHTNING FLASHES and THUNDER ROLLS,
          Coraline sees him for the first time. With his turret-
          lensed SKULL MASK and SKELETON GLOVES and black FIREMAN'S
          COAT flapping in the wind, he looks like a PSYCHO KILLER!

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                           (freaked out)

                    AHHHHH!

          
          He REVS his motor, pops a wheelie, then SWOOPS DOWN the
          bluff towards her. She HOLLERS IN FEAR, then tries to
          WHACK HIM with her forked stick.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)

                    GET AWAY FROM ME--

          
          He SNATCHES it from her as he passes, KNOCKING HER to the
          ground. He SIDE-SKIDS his bike, hops off and JUMPS UP
          onto the stump. Looking TEN FEET TALL from the ground,
          THUNDER AND LIGHTNING at a peak, the Spy turns his THREE-
          EYED TURRET LENS and studies her like a predatory alien.

          
          And then, the thunder and lightning just FADE OUT and
          this psycho-killer, three-eyed spy pulls off his mask and
          Coraline GASPS -- he's just a short kid in a costume.

          
          Shoulders hunched, neck bent, the Spy - real name WYBIE
          LOVAT - aged 12 - examines Coraline's forked stick, aims
          it around.

          

                                 WYBIE

                           (OBLIVIOUS)
                    Hoo! Let me guess, you're from Texas or
                    Utah; someplace dried out and barren,
                    right? I heard about water-witching
                    before but it doesn't make sense; I mean,
                    it's just an ordinary branch.

          
          Coraline, SNATCHES it from his GLOVED HANDS.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (ENRAGED)

                    IT'S A DOWSING ROD!

          
          Coraline smacks Wybie.

          

                                   WYBIE
                    Ow!

          

                                 CORALINE
                    And I DON'T LIKE BEING STALKED, not by

                    PSYCHO-NERDS OR THEIR CATS!

          
          He crouches, nervous, to scratch the cat behind his ears.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    He's not really my cat; he's kinda feral
                    ­ you know, wild? Of course, I do feed
                    him every night and sometimes he'll come
                    in my window `n bring me little dead
                    things.

          
          The cat PURRS like a diesel.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (TOUGH)
                    Look, I'm from Pontiac.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    Huh?

          

                                 CORALINE
                    MICHIGAN? And if I'm a "water witch",

                    THEN--
                           (points stick, stomps foot)
                    --where's the secret WELL?

          

                                 WYBIE
                    You stomp too hard and you'll fall in it!

          
          Coraline reacts, hops out of the springy circle. The boy
          scrapes at the ground, revealing a CIRCULAR COVERING
          made of WOODEN PLANKS. He wedges a fallen branch under
          one side, and, using a rock for the fulcrum, pries up the
          covering.

          

                                 WYBIE (CONT'D)
                    See? Supposed to be so deep if you fell
                    to the bottom and looked up, you'd see a
                    sky full of stars in the middle of the
                    day.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (SOFTENS)
                    Huh.

          
          Her frown RELAXES and the black cat tilts his head,
          noticing her change in tone. He steps off the branch, and
          the well cover thumps in place.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    Surprised she let you move in...

          
          Jerks his head toward the pink house in distance.

          

                                 WYBIE (CONT'D)
                    ... my Gramma. She owns the "Pink Palace"
                           (indicates house in distance)
                    Won't rent to people with kids.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    What do you mean?

          

                                 WYBIE
                           (suddenly worried)
                    Uh... I'm not supposed to talk about it.

          
          Changing the subject, he lifts a gloved hand to shake.

          

                                 WYBIE (CONT'D)
                    I'm Wybie, Wybie Lovat.

          

                                   CORALINE

                             (SKEPTICAL)
                    Wybie?

          

                                 WYBIE
                    Short for Wyborne. Not my idea, of
                    course. What'd you get saddled with?

          

                                 CORALINE
                    I wasn't saddled with anything. It's
                    Coraline.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    Caroline what?

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Coraline. Coraline Jones.

          

                                 WYBIE
                           (confused, not hearing it)
                    Hmmm... It's not real scientific, but I
                    heard an ordinary name, like Caroline --

          
          Her face goes as DARK as the rain clouds above.

          

                                 WYBIE (CONT'D)
                    -- can lead people to have ordinary
                    expectations about a person--

          

                                 WYBIE'S GRANDMOTHER (O.C.)
                           (calling from afar)
                    Wyborne!

          

                                 CORALINE
                    I think I heard someone calling you,
                    Wyborne.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    What? I didn't hear anything--

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Oh, I definitely heard someone, Why-were-
                    you-born.

          
          A distant dinner bell clangs.

          

                                  WYBIE'S GRANDMOTHER (O.C.)
                    Wyborne!

          

                                 WYBIE
                           (under his breath, nervous)
                    Grandma!

          
          He holds up his hands in surrender, nodding with eyes
          closed, forcing some laughs.

          

                                 WYBIE (CONT'D)
                    Heh. Well, great to meet a Michigan
                    water witch.

          
          He picks up his bike, wheels it around, then holds up his
          gloved hands.

          

                                 WYBIE (CONT'D)
                    But I'd wear gloves next time.

          

                                  CORALINE

                            (SKEPTICAL)
                    Why?

          
          He points to her dowsing rod, nods.

          

                                 WYBIE (CONT'D)
                    `Cause that dowsing rod of yours? Uh,
                    it's poison oak.

          

                                  CORALINE
                    Ehh!!

          
          Coraline drops the stick as he zooms away and wipes her
          hands on her clothes.

          
          The cat merows at her, shaking his head with a pitying
          look, then trots away after Wybie. She STICKS OUT HER
          TONGUE at him.

          
          She looks down at the COVERING to the well. Coraline
          finds a PEBBLE and drops it through A SMALL KNOT-HOLE.
          Ear at the knot-hole, she counts until there's a watery
          "plop" far below. FAT RAINDROPS start to fall around her.

          

                                                 ROTATE DISSOLVE TO:

          

          INT. KITCHEN - NEXT MORNING


          
          It's POURING out. Coraline looks out a window at the DEAD-
          LOOKING GARDEN, and places PACKETS OF SEEDS - pumpkins,
          squash, snap dragons, bleeding hearts - on the sill.
          She's developed a REDDISH RASH - poison oak - on one
          hand.

          
          The main floor kitchen, like most   things in the Pink
          Palace, is barely maintained, and   looks worn and faded.
          Coraline's MOTHER, MEL JONES, 40,   bangs away at her
          laptop on the table, MOVING BOXES   stacked nearby. She's
          plain-looking and tired and wears   a NECK-BRACE.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    I almost fell down a well yesterday, Mom.

          

                                 MEL
                           (not listening)
                    Uh huh.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    I would have died.

          

                                 MEL
                           (continues typing)
                    That's nice.

          
          Coraline scratches the rash on her hand, changes subject.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Hmmm. So can I go out? I think it's
                    perfect weather for gardening.

          

                                 MEL
                    No, Coraline. Rain makes mud. Mud makes a
                    mess.

          
          Coraline turns to her.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    But Mom, I want stuff growing when my
                    friends come to visit. Isn't that why we
                    moved here?

          

                                 MEL
                    Something like that. But then we had the
                    accident.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Wasn't my fault you hit that truck.

          

                                 MEL
                    I never said it was.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (MUTTERS)
                    I can't believe it -- you and Dad get
                    paid to write about plants and you hate
                    dirt.

          
          Mel stops typing, loses her patience.

          

                                 MEL
                    Coraline, I don't have time for you right
                    now. And you still have unpacking to do.
                    Lots of unpacking.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    That sounds exciting.

          
          Mel remembers something.

          
                                 Mel (CONT'D)
                    Oh - some kid left this on the front
                    porch.

          
          Coraline walks over and is handed a NEWSPAPER-WRAPPED
          PACKAGE. Attached note reads:

          

                                 WYBIE (V.O.)
                    Hey Jonesy, look what I found in Gramma's
                    trunk. Look familiar? Wybie.

          
          She rips open the package and finds the BUTTON-EYED, BLUE-
          HAIRED, YELLOW RAINCOAT-WEARING DOLL from the head
          credits - it's a litte Coraline!

          

                                 CORALINE
                           (to herself)
                    Huh... a little me? That's weird.

          
          She crumples the note, both annoyed and charmed.

          

                                 MEL
                    What's his name, anyway?

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Wybie. And I'm way too old for dolls.

          
          But Coraline takes it with her and leaves the room.

          

          INT. STUDY - SAME


          
          CHARLIE Jones, 40, goose-necked and gangly with thinning
          dark hair, HUNT-AND-PECKS at his ancient computer,
          surrounded by boxes of GARDENING MAGAZINES and empty
          coffee cups. Coraline, with doll, opens the SQUEAKY DOOR.
          He doesn't turn.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Hey Dad, how's the writing going?... Dad?

          
          He ignores her reflection in his computer screen as he
          types away, green letters on black. She CLEARS HER

          THROAT.

          

                                 CHARLIE
                    Hello, Coraline...
                           (notices doll's reflection)
                    And... Coraline doll?...

          

                                 CORALINE
                    D'you know where the garden tools are?

          
          He hears rain outside.

          

                                 CHARLIE
                    It's pouring out there, isn't it.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Humph, it's just raining.

          

                                 CHARLIE
                    What'd the boss say?

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (MOCKING)
                    "Don't even think about going out,
                    Coraline Jones."

          

                                 CHARLIE
                    Then you won't need the tools.

          
          Coraline GROANS, stamps her feet. Charlie just taps
          harder on the keys. Pouting, she makes the door squeak,
          opening and shutting it till he can't take any more. He
          spins around.

          

                                 CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                    Uhhh, you know, this house is a hundred
                    and fifty years old.

          

                                   CORALINE
                    So?

          

                                 CHARLIE
                    So explore it!

          
          He grabs a pen and pad, holds it out.

          

                                 CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                    Go out and ... count all the doors and
                    windows and write that down. List
                    everything blue!

                           (BEGGING)
                    Just let me work.

          
          She rolls her eyes, takes paper and pen and leaves.

          

          

          MONTAGE, VARIOUS - SAME

          

          HALLWAY NEAR STAIRS

          
          Coraline, with doll, jumps on BUMP in carpet that moves
          with each jump.

          

          LAUNDRY ROOM/WINTER GARDEN

          
          She wipes off the misted glass so she and the doll can
          see out, then writes in her pad: 7 leaky windows. A drop
          of water lands on the pad, smearing the ink. She adds
          really between 7 and leaky windows.

          

          HALLWAY NEAR STAIRS

          
          Coraline thumps the carpet bump again and pounds up the
          stairs.

          

          PARENT'S ROOM/BATHROOM

          
          A FRAMED PHOTO sits in the foreground on a beside table.
          It shows a younger, happier Coraline with her parents by
          the BEAR FOUNTAIN at the Detroit Zoo. RACK FOCUS to
          bedroom door as it swings into the room, with Coraline
          hanging on it. She drops to the ground and, doll and pad
          in hand, decides to check out the bathroom.

          
          When she pulls aside the mildewed shower curtain she
          finds a hundred skittering SILVERFISH BUGS.

          

                                    CORALINE
                    Ewww!

          
          Disgusted, she jumps into the tub and smashes as many as
          she can.

          
          She turns on the faucet to wash her hands, only to get
          soaked with rusty water from the shower head.

          

                                    CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Ahh!!

          
          She shakes out her hair.

          

          HALLWAY NEAR STAIRS

          
          Coraline pounds down the stairs, spots the carpet bump
          again in the hallway and jumps on it. A closet door
          opens, a light on inside, and she goes to investigate.

          

          WATER HEATER CLOSET

          
          ANGLE OVER water heater on Coraline. She jots down one
          rusty water heater in her pad. As she leaves, she flicks
          off the light switch, not noticing a note taped beside it
          that says: Do not turn off!

          

          

          INT. STUDY - SAME


          
          Lights flicker and then Charlie's computer dies. He
          hollers.

          

                                 CHARLIE
                    No, no, no, no, no; GAAAA--!

                                    CHARLIE (O.S.)

                    --AAAAAAA!

          
          Coraline reacts with guilty alarm, runs back to the
          closet and --

          

          

          INT. CLOSET - SAME


          
          -- spots the Do not turn off note. She flips the light
          switch back on and gets out of there.

          

          

          INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME


          
          The room is faded and cold with bare windows looking out
          on rain and gray. The floor is strewn with moving boxes,
          a few pieces of furniture, Charlie's old Nordic Track. A
          few garden tools lean against one wall; a cardboard
          mattress box leans against a corner wall.

          
          Coraline enters, counting windows and doors to note in
          her pad. She sets the doll on a low table beside an open
          moving box and smiles.

          
          The box is filled with her mom's collection of
          SNOWGLOBES. She takes out her favorite - the BEAR
          FOUNTAIN AT THE DETROIT ZOO - and shakes it. She studies
          the globe and sighs with homesickness. She sets it
          carefully on the FIREPLACE MANTEL, then unwraps the rest
          of the snowglobes and places them beside it.

          
          Over the mantel hangs a PAINTING of a CRYING BOY IN BLUE -
          a scoop of ice cream melting on his shirt, his hand
          holding an EMPTY CONE. Coraline takes up pad and pen and
          adds to her list, muttering aloud.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    One boring blue boy in a painfully boring
                    painting ... four incredibly boring
                    windows ... and no... more... doors...

          
          She turns to grab the doll off the table by the snow
          globe box. It's gone.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    All right, little me, where are you
                    hiding?

          
          Scanning the room, she spots the doll LOOKING OUT FROM
          BEHIND THE MATTRESS BOX leaned against the corner wall.
          Perplexed, she walks over and kneels down to grab the
          doll when she notices SOMETHING ON THE WALL behind the
          box.

          
          She shoves the box aside, and discovers the outline of a
          SMALL DOOR that's been wallpapered over.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Huh?

          
          Intensely curious, she calls to the kitchen.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)

          Mom, typing away, ignores her.

          

                                 CORALINE (O.S.)
                    Where does this door go?

          

                                 MEL
                    I'm really, really busy!

          

          INT LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          
          Coraline tries to open it but there's no handle.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    I think it's locked.

          

                                    MEL (O.S.)

                                 CORALINE (O.S.)
                    Pleeeeeeeeease!

          
          Mel gets up, really annoyed. Big sigh.

          

                                    MEL
                    Uhhh...

          

          

          INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME


          
          She walks over to Coraline, looks at the outline of the
          door in the ratty old wallpaper.

          

                                  MEL
                    Will you stop pestering me if I do this
                    for you?

          
          Coraline nods her head quickly, PANTING like a dog.

          

                                    MEL (CONT'D)
                    Fine.

          
          She heads back to the kitchen.

          

          

          INT KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

          
          Mel pulls open a drawer, pushes a bunch of loose brass
          and nickel keys aside to find a small, sharp black key.
          Holds it up.

          

          

          INT LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          
          Mel cuts the wallpaper around the door and sticks the key
          in the lock. Coraline looks on, giddy with anticipation,
          the doll at her side. Mel turns the key, unlocks the
          door, and pulls it open to reveal ... an UNBROKEN BRICK
          WALL. Coraline is totally disappointed.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Bricks? I don't get it.

          
          Coraline scratches her wrist rash with annoyance.

          

                                 MEL
                    They must have closed this off when they
                    divided up the house.

          
          Mel gets up to leave.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    You're kidding? And why is the door so
                    small?

          
          Mel leaving room, turns back, and loses it.

          

                                 MEL
                    We made a deal. ZIP IT!

          
          She exits. Coraline makes annoyed sound.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    You didn't lock it.

          

                                  MEL (O.S.)
                    AaaaaH!!!

          
          Coraline pushes the little door shut, her head lowered.

          WIDE ANGLE ON HOUSE. Pouring rain. We hear Charlie
          singing a song about Coraline, badly.

          CHARLIE, using OVEN MITT to protect his hand, takes a
          BURNED-UP CASSEROLE DISH from the oven while mom closes
          up her LAPTOP. Coraline sits at the table with her doll.

          

                                 CHARLIE
                    I think you are so nice,
                    I give you bowls of porridge
                    And I give you bowls of ice --

          
          CHARLIE sets the dish on the table.

          

                                 CHARLIE
                           (really bad note)
                    -- cream!

          
          Coraline pushes it away, disgusted.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Why don't you ever cook, Mom?

          

                                 MEL
                    Coraline, we've been through this before:
                    your Dad cooks, I clean, and you stay out
                    of the way.

          
          Coraline HUFFS.

          

                                 MEL (CONT'D)
                    I swear I'll go food shopping soon as we
                    finish the catalog.
                           (indicates Coraline's plate)
                    Try some of the chard, you need a
                    vegetable.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Looks more like slime to me.

          

                                  CHARLIE
                    Well, it's slime or bedtime fusspot --
                    now what's it going to be?

          
          Coraline looks to her doll, cradles its head.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Think they're trying to poison me?

          
          She makes the doll's head nod "yes." Coraline rolls her
          eyes, looks up to the heavens and --

          -- falls back, washed and dressed for bed, on her pillow.
          Still raining out. Coraline puts the doll on the chair
          beside her, then scratches at her wrist. ORIGAMI
          DRAGONFLIES are strung between the tall, thin bed posts;
          the TURTLE SHELL she found in the garden sits up on a
          box, her NIGHT LAMP that projects stars and moons is
          warming up on the bedside table. Despite her efforts at
          decorating, Coraline's new bedroom feels small and cold,
          cracked and faded.

          
          Coraline reaches for a framed PHOTO that rests on a toy
          PRAYING MANTIS by her night lamp.

          
          It's her TWO BEST FRIENDS from home, posing in the snow
          by her old school's marquee, its letters rearranged to
          spell "CORALINE, GOOD BYE!" She touches her friends'
          faces with her fingertips.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Don't forget about me, guys. Okay?

          
          She puts back the photo, hits the light switch over her
          bed and, looking over at the doll, sighs.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Good-night...little me.

          
          Her breathing slows and, with the doll WATCHING HER, she
          starts to fall asleep.

          --SURREAL MIST SWIRLS out her window. MOONS AND STARS
          SLOWLY MOVE across the walls.

          
          SOMETHING in the room goes t-t-t-t-t-t. Coraline sits up,
          awake. SOMETHING CHITTERS under her bed. She leans over
          her bedside, head first, peering underneath when a ghost-
          pale KANGAROO MOUSE JUMPS OUT and bounds out the door.

          

          

          INT. HALL - SAME


          
          She gives chase, down the upper hall, down the stairs,
          snaps on the lower hall light, sees it hop into the
          living room.

          

          

          INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS


          
          Coraline enters. The mouse edges out from beneath the
          sofa, then hops frantically toward the SMALL DOOR behind
          the wallpaper! Coraline runs and dives, but the door is
          open a crack, and the mouse escapes.

          
          Coraline grabs the door's edge and pulls it open. Instead
          of a brick wall, there is a DARK, EXPANDING TUNNEL, with
          the hopping mouse heading towards a bluish light at the
          far end.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Whoa...

          
          She catches her breath, pulls the door wider and CRAWLS

          THROUGH.

          

          INT. PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS


          
          Coraline MOVES FORWARD, towards the light ahead.

          

          

          INT. OTHER LIVING ROOM ­ CONTINUOUS


          
          Coraline steps out through the same little door, into
          what looks like the EXACT SAME LIVING ROOM she just left,
          only something is different -- it feels deeper, more
          dimensional.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Huh?

          
          She looks around, notices the painting over the
          fireplace: the crying blue boy is now SMILING, his shirt
          clean and his ice cream back on his cone.

          
          From across the hall, warm light comes from the kitchen
          and the smell of delicious food wafts towards her nose.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    MMMMM, something smells good.

          

          

          INT. OTHER KITCHEN - NIGHT


          
          Coraline enters to see her mother cooking at the stove,
          wearing an apron and ROOSTER-HEAD OVEN MITTS. The light
          and colors are much warmer and the details more perfect
          in this kitchen. Other Mother is facing away from
          Coraline as she works.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Mom?! What are you doing here in the
                    middle of the night?

          
          Her mother turns from the stove to greet her and Coraline
          is DUMBSTRUCK: she's got BUTTONS FOR EYES! She beams with
          happiness at Coraline's arrival.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    You're just in time for supper, dear!

          

                                 CORALINE
                    You're not my mother.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    My mother doesn't have b-b-buh...

          
          Coraline points to her own eye.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    B-b-b-buttons? Do you like them?

          
          She taps one with her nail.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D)
                    I'm your Other Mother, silly. Now go tell
                    your Other Father that supper's ready.

          
          She opens the oven door and the intoxicating perfume of
          great cooking fills the air. Coraline breathes it in,
          suddenly VERY HUNGRY.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D)
                    Well, go on. He's in his study.

          

          

          INT. OTHER HALLWAY - SAME


          
          Coraline goes down the hall and opens the study door.

          

          

          INT. OTHER STUDY - CONTINUOUS


          
          She sees the back of a man like her father, only with
          more hair. Instead of tapping away at his computer,
          though, he's picking notes on a BABY GRAND PIANO.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Hello?

          
          He turns around. He, too, has SHINY BUTTON EYES. He seems
          happier and a little more handsome than real Dad, and
          wears an IRIDESCENT ROBE over POLKA DOT PAJAMAS, with
          ORANGE MONKEY SLIPPERS on his feet. He smiles broadly.

          

                                 OTHER FATHER
                    Hello, Coraline. Want to hear my new
                    song?

          

                                 CORALINE
                    My father can't play piano.

          

                                 OTHER FATHER
                    No need to ... this piano plays ME!

          
          DR. SEUSS GLOVES ­ connected with rods and pulleys ­ POP
          OUT of the piano's front and ONTO HIS HANDS. His hands
          RAISE UP ­ then DROP DOWN to play pounding STRIDE PIANO
          as Other Father SINGS out.

          

                                 OTHER FATHER (CONT'D)
                    Making up a song about Coraline.
                    She's a peach, she's a doll, she's a pal
                    of mine.
                    She's as cute as a button in the eyes of
                    everyone who ever laid their eyes on Cor-
                    a-line.

          
          Coraline is amazed as his hands fly.

          

                                 OTHER FATHER (CONT'D)
                    When she comes around exploring
                    Mom and I will never ever make it boring
                    our eyes will be on Coraline.

          
          Anxious, she taps his shoulder to stop him.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    I, uh ­ sorry ­ but she said to tell you
                    the food's ready.

          

                                 OTHER FATHER
                    Mmmmm! Who's starving? Raise your hand.

          
          He sticks his hand up, still in a glove, and his other
          gloved hand slaps his face. She LAUGHS, then covers her
          mouth.

          

          

          INT. OTHER DINING ROOM - SAME


          
          Other Mother sets down a HUGE, ROASTED CHICKEN near
          Coraline on a table spread with CANDLES, fine CHINA and
          SILVER and a PINEAPPLE CENTERPIECE. FIGURE EIGHT MODEL
          TRAIN TRACKS circle twin LAZY SUSANS covered in dishes of
          POTATOES, SWEET PEAS, ROLLS, and CORN. The Other Father
          seals this Norman Rockwell moment by making PRAYER HANDS
          and a solemn face.

          

                                 OTHER FATHER
                    We give our thanks and ask to bless,
                    Our Mother's golden chicken breast!

          
          He laughs with glee then a STARTING BELL rings and it's
          time to eat. Other Father really digs in while Coraline
          tries some chicken.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Mmmm, this chicken is good.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    Hungry, aren't you.

          

                                 CORALINE
                           (nodding, mouth full)
                    D'you have any gravy?

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    Well, here comes the gravy train! Choo-
                    choo!

          
          Other Mother GIGGLES as a MODEL TRAIN circles round the
          track, pulling a GRAVY BOAT CAR and blowing its whistle.
          The train goes in one side of the centerpiece and comes
          out the other, slowing till the gravy boat lines up with
          Coraline's plate, where it POURS GRAVY on her potatoes.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    Another roll, sweet peas? Corn on the
                    cob?

          
          Other Mother looks on approvingly, not touching any food
          herself.

          

                                 CORALINE
                           (mouth full)
                    I'm real thirsty.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    Of course! Any requests?

          
          A beautiful CHANDELIER DRINK DISPENSER descends.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Mango milk shake?

          
          The dispenser SPINS, stops and fills her glass while
          Other Mother presents dessert: a cake with candles that
          POP UP and LIGHT THEMSELVES while the words "WELCOME
          HOME!" write themselves in icing. Coraline is taken
          aback.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Home?

          
          Her Other Parents squeeze each other's hands warmly.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    We've been waiting for you, Coraline.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    For me?

          

                                 OTHER FATHER
                    Yep. Wasn't the same here without you,
                    kiddo.

          
          Coraline remains a little unsure.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    I didn't know I had an Other Mother.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    Of course you do. Everyone does.

          
          She smiles at Coraline, her button eyes gleaming.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Really?

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    Uh huh, and soon as you're through
                    eating, I thought we'd play a game.

          
          She taps her fingers a little too excitedly on the table.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (SKEPTICAL)
                    You mean like, hide and seek?

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    Perfect! Hide and seek in the rain.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    What rain?

          
          THUNDER, LIGHTNING, then RAIN appears outside the window.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Huh, what about the mud?

          

                                 OTHER FATHER
                    We love mud here!

          
          Other Mother rises, walks towards Coraline.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    Mud facials, mud baths, mud pies -- it's
                    great for poison oak.

          
          The takes Coraline's rashy hand, but Coraline pulls it
          away.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (SUSPICIOUS)
                    How'd you know I--

          
          Coraline adjusts her tone.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    I, I'd love to play, but ... I better get
                    home to my other mother.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    But I'm your other mother.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (BEFUDDLED)
                    I mean my other other mother. Mom number
                    one?

                           (YAWNS)
                    I think I should get to bed.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    Of course, sweetheart, it's all made up.

          

                                 CORALINE
                           (shakes head)
                    But ...

          
          Other Father steps in beside her.

          

                                 OTHER FATHER
                    Come along, sleepyhead.

          
          They lead her from the table towards the stairs to her
          bedroom.

          

          

          INT. CORALINE'S OTHER BEDROOM - SAME


          
          In this world, Coraline's bedroom is a dream come true:
          it is filled with rich color and light; there's a fire in
          the fireplace, a sheer, lacy canopy over her now
          beautiful bed. And her favorite toys are alive!

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Wow.

          
          Her ORIGAMI DRAGONFLIES FLUTTER towards her.

          

                                 DRAGONFLIES
                    Hello Coraline, hello, hello!

          
          Her BLUE SQUID greets her with a WAVE of its tentacle.

          

                                 TOY SQUID
                    What's shakin', baby?

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Hello.

          
          The TURTLE SHELL she'd found CIRCLES HER FEET on clothes
          pin legs, making PANTING SOUNDS. She laughs, then hears
          two voices from beside her bed.

          She jumps onto the bed, grabs the photo of her best
          friends from home, now ALIVE IN THE PHOTO.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Kripes a-mighty, how are my best trolls?
                    I can't wait till summer. You're both
                    comin', right?

          

                                 PHOTO FRIEND 1
                    We're already here, Coraline --

          

          

                                 PHOTO FRIEND 2

          
                    -- gone to Or-e-gine!

          
          Coraline grins hugely, then, exhausted, she yawns,
          stretching out her arms.

          
          The Other Mother, in the bedside chair, takes her hand
          and applies some SOOTHING BLACK MUD to Coraline's poison
          oak rash.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Oh, the mud...

          
          The Other Mother gently tucks her in then she and the
          Other Father smile at Coraline as she drifts off to
          sleep.

          

                  OTHER MOTHER                  OTHER FATHER
          See you soon ...              See you soon ...

          INT. CORALINE'S REAL BEDROOM - MORNING


          
          Coraline awakens. She looks around expecting bright
          colors, a magic dragonfly. But it's just her NORMAL ROOM:
          moving boxes; cracks in the ceiling -- nothing's changed.

          
          She notices the BUTTON-EYED DOLL on the chair where she
          left it, where the Other Mother was sitting. She picks it
          up, absentmindedly goes to scratch her wrist. She stops,
          noticing that the rash on her wrist IS GONE.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (GASPING)
                    It's gone, my poison oak, it's gone!...

          

          

          INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME


          
          Coraline goes to the little door, still ajar. She peeks
          behind and finds the WALL OF SOLID BRICKS. Yes, it was
          only a dream.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (SOFTLY)
                    Huh?

          
          She shakes her head and pushes the door shut. The kettle
          blows from the kitchen.

          

          

          KITCHEN - DAY, GROUND FOG OUT WINDOWS

          
          Breakfast. Mel and Charlie finish their "Go Lean
          Breakfast Twigs" and mugs of instant coffee. Preoccupied
          with their work, they half-listen as Coraline recounts
          her dream, her breakfast untouched. FOG lies outside the
          windows.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    It was incredibly real, Mom! Only you
                    weren't really you; you were my other
                    mother.

          

                                 MEL

                           (DISAPPROVING)
                    Buttons for eyes, huh?
                           (indicates untouched food)
                    Coraline, you only dreamed you ate all
                    that chicken. Take your multi-vitamin, at
                    least.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    You were in the dream too, Dad. You had
                    wild-looking pajamas and orange monkey
                    slippers.

          

                                 CHARLIE
                           (pretend offense)
                    Orange? My monkey slippers are blue.

          
          He stands, put his dishes in the sink. Whispers over his

          SHOULDER:

          

                                 CHARLIE (CONT'D)

                           (OPTIONAL)
                    Pssst. Can you get me some of that magic
                    mud you were talking about?

          
          She points to her rash-free wrists. He nods.

          

                                 CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                    Because I have a terrible case of
                    writer's rash. On my---.

          
          Mel CLEARS HER THROAT, interrupting.

          

                                 MEL
                    If the real Charlie Jones wants his pages
                    edited, he'd better wrap them up ASAP.

          
          He crisply salutes her, turns on his heel, and marches
          out the door. Mel gets up to clear the table with
          Coraline.

          

                                 MEL (CONT'D)
                    Coraline, why don't you go visit
                    downstairs? I bet those "actresses" would
                    love to hear your dream.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Miss Spink and Forcible? But you said
                    they're dingbats.

          

                                    MEL

                           (NODS)
                    Uh huh.

          
          Coraline sighs, gets up to go.

          

          

          EXT. HOUSE, FRONT PORCH - MORNING


          
          It's drizzling and a WHITE FOG has lowered over the house
          and grounds. Coraline ­ yellow rain poncho, garden SHEARS
          in hand ­ opens the front door. Stepping out onto the
          porch, she TRIPS on a big bundle of mail. Annoyed, she
          picks it up, starts leafing through the envelopes.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Bo-bin-sky...Bo-bin-sky....Bo-bin-sky...

          
          Smells something bad, sniffs the envelopes.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Ohh, Poo-eeeee!

          
          She goes down the front steps and finds a sign that reads
          "Bobinsky there" with an arrow that points up long,
          winding outside stairs. With an "oh well" shrug, she goes
          up.

          

          

          EXT. HOUSE, BOBINSKY'S - CONTINUOUS


          
          At the top, she knocks on the door, a little anxious.

          

                                  CORALINE
                    H-hello?...

          
          She knocks again.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    I think our mail got mixed up.    Should I
                    leave it outside or...

          
          The door swings open. Curious, Coraline peeks inside:
          it's dark and cramped with something boiling on the stove
          and a caged chicken.

          

                                  CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Hmmm...

          
          Suddenly a HUGE BLUE MAN swings down behind her and

          SCOLDS:

          

                                  MR. BOBINSKY

                    SEE-KRET...

          
          She whips around to find MR. Bobinsky - upside down,
          reaching right at her face! She ducks and he reaches past
          her to his actual target - his door knob - and pulls it
          shut.
          The Russian giant, dressed in a sleeveless T-shirt and
          shorts, pulls a RAW BEET from his pants. He's not happy.

          

                                 MR. BOBINSKY (CONT'D)

                           (SCOWLING)
                    Famous Jumping Mouse Circus not ready,
                    little girl!

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (CONFUSED)
                    Circus?... Oh, uh, I brought this for
                    you.

          
          She holds out his mail. Bobinsky takes it, smelling the
          stinky envelopes deeply. Nods approvingly.

          

                                 MR. BOBINSKY

                           (SNIFFS)
                    Mmmm... Noviseer.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Huh?

          

                                 MR. BOBINSKY
                    New "cheese" samples.

          
          He swings down like a spider monkey and stands beside her
          on the balcony. Coraline backs away.

          

                                 MR. BOBINSKY (CONT'D)
                    Very clever, using this "mix up" to sneak
                    my home and peek at meeshkas

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Meeshkas?

          

                                 MR. BOBINSKY
                    The Mice!

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Oh, sorry. I'm Coraline Jones.

          

                                  MR. BOBINSKY

                           (BOWS)
                    And I am the Amazing Bobinsky! But you
                    can call me Mr. B, because amazing I
                    already know that I am.

          
          He smells his mail again, makes pleased sound, then seems
          to fall off the side of the third story porch! Coraline
          rushes over, looks down. He cartwheels in from the porch
          railing behind her.

          

                                 MR. BOBINSKY
                    Ha! You see, Caroline, the problem is my
                    new songs go oompah oompah. But the
                    jumping mice play only toodle toot, like
                    that. Is nice, but not so much amazing?
                    So now--
                           (indicates smelly mail)
                    --I switch to stronger cheese, and soon ­

                    VATCH OUT!

          
          He opens his door, crouches low and turns. He hands her a
          beet.

          

                                 MR. BOBINSKY (CONT'D)
                    Here, have beet. Make you strong.
                           (salutes her )
                    Daas vee DAAN ya, Caroline.

          
          He scuttles inside and slams the door shut. Coraline
          mutters.

          

                                  CORALINE
                    Cor-a-line.

          
          Looking at the beet, she makes a disgusted sound and
          tosses it away, then heads down the stairs.

          

          

          EXT HOUSE, SOUTH SIDE YARD - CONTINUOUS

          
          When she gets to the bottom, she starts towards the back,
          gardening shears out.

          

                                 CORALINE
                           (to herself)
                    Oompah oompah, toodle toot, toodle toot.

          

                                 MR. BOBINSKY (O.C.)

                    EHHH! CAROLINE: PA-DAZH-DI'-- WAIT!!

          
          She looks up.

          

                                  CORALINE
                    No!!!

          
          Bobinsky LEAPS all the way to the ground, landing beside
          her, out of breath.

          

                                 MR. BOBINSKY
                    The mice...asked me to give you message.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    The...jumping mice?

          
          Mr. B nods gravely. He leans down, so close his moustache
          touches her ear, and whispers, his voice DEAD-SERIOUS.

          

                                 MR. BOBINSKY
                    They are saying: do not go through leetle
                    door. Do you know such a thing?

          
          Coraline is startled.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    The one behind the wall paper? But...
                    it's all bricked up.

          
          The old man shrugs, straightens.

          

                                 MR. BOBINSKY
                    Bah. So sorry, is nothing. Sometimes the
                    mice are leetle...

          
          He points to his head and rotates his finger.

          

                                 MR. BOBINSKY (CONT'D)
                    ...mixed up, hmmm? They even get your
                    name wrong, you know. They call you
                    Coraline instead of Caroline, not
                    Caroline at all.

          
          He starts back up the stairs.

          

                                 MR. BOBINSKY (CONT'D)
                    Maybe I work them too hard...

          
          Coraline stares after him.

          

          

          EXT. HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER


          
          SHEARS IN HAND, Coraline approaches the family VW, where
          one PINK SUITCASE remains tied to the roof. She snips it
          free and takes out her special HAT, a black Japanese
          schoolboy's cap.

          

          

          EXT. HOUSE, STAIRWELL DOWNSTAIRS FLAT ­ SAME


          
          Coraline climbs down the steps to the basement flat. At
          the door, she tries the comedy/tragedy door knocker and
          waits. Nothing. She glances down at the doormat - it
          reads "No whistling in the house."

          
          She peers through the door glass. A YAPPING DOG suddenly
          LEAPS UP inside, startling her, and a moment after, MISS
          SPINK ­ wearing some sort of house robe ­ opens the door
          and three SCOTTIE DOGS ­ HAMISH, JOCK, AND ANGUS ­ shoot
          out and surround Coraline. Spink tries to quiet them
          down.

          

                                 MISS SPINK

                           (HARSH)
                    Oh cease your infernal yapping!
                           (to Coraline, sweetly)
                    How nice to see you, Caroline. Would you
                    like to come in? We're playing cards.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Still Coraline, Miss Spink.

          

                                 MISS SPINK
                           (over shoulder)
                    Miriam, put the kettle on!

          

          

          INT. MISSES SPINK & FORCIBLE'S FLAT - SAME


          
          Miss Spink leads Coraline into the living area, as MISS
          FORCIBLE, taller and sporting a platinum wig and a very
          large bosom, prepares tea in the kitchen to the side. The
          dogs race ahead and jump onto the sofa. Coraline scans
          the walls to see framed POSTERS from the "Shakespeare"
          the ladies used to perform like King Leer and Julius
          Seize Her. Miss Forcible peers out her, half-blind
          without her glasses.

          

                                 MISS FORCIBLE
                    April, I think you're being followed.

          

                                 MISS SPINK
                    It's the new neighbor, Miriam - Caroline?
                    She'll be having the Oolong tea.

          

                                 MISS FORCIBLE
                    No, no, no, no. I'm sure she'd prefer
                    Jasmine.

          

                                  MISS SPINK
                    No, Oolong.

          

                                 MISS FORCIBLE
                    Ah, Jasmine it is, then.

          
          Forcible grabs a handful of tea, puts it in the pot and
          pours boiling water in.

          

                                 MISS SPINK
                    Come on, boys!

          
          The dogs leap off the sofa and, as Coraline takes their
          place, she looks to the side and sees a towering bookcase
          filled with STUFFED SCOTTY DOGS IN KNITTED SWEATERS WITH

          ANGEL WINGS.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (ALARMED)
                    Are those dogs .... real?

          

                                 MISS SPINK

                           (SIGHS)
                    Our sweet, departed angels. Couldn't bear
                    to part with them ... so we had them
                    stuffed.

                           (CONTINUES)

                                 (MORE)

          

                                 MISS SPINK (CONT'D)
                    Now, there's Hamish the third, the
                    fourth, the eighth, the ninth. Angus the
                    second, the fifth, the..

          
          Miss Forcible arrives with a tea tray and urges Coraline
          to take a candy as Spink goes on and on.

          

                                 MISS FORCIBLE
                    Oh go on, have one ­ it's hand-pulled
                    taffy from Brighton ­ best in the world.

          
          Coraline reaches for a pink and green one. But the taffy
          is so old and sticky, her fingers get stuck. Then her
          other hand gets stuck, trying to get the first hand out.

          

                                 MISS SPINK (O.C.)
                    ...seventh, the third, the ninth, yes,
                    the fourthI'm right; and Jock Junior,
                    Jock senior, Jock the third, the
                    fourth...

          
          Coraline, using her feet, finally un-sticks the candy
          bowl which FLIES UP and sticks to the ceiling.

          

                                 MISS SPINK (CONT'D)
                    ...oh, and that's Jock's 2nd cousin,
                    twice removed.

          
          She turns to Coraline, about to sip her tea. Spink
          indicates cup.

          

                                 MISS SPINK (CONT'D)
                    I'll read them, if you like.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Read what?

          

                                 MISS SPINK
                    Oh, your tea leaves, dear. They'll tell
                    me your future. Drink up then, go on.

          
          Coraline gulps down the bitter brew.

          

                                 MISS SPINK (CONT'D)
                    No, not all of it, not all of it. That's
                    right, now hand it over.

          
          Coraline passes her the cup. Spink puts a saucer on top
          and swirls it three times, removes the saucer and peers
          in at the abstract leaf pattern. She purses her lips.

          

                                 MISS SPINK (CONT'D)
                    Oh... Caroline, Caroline, Caroline; you
                    are in terrible danger.

          
          Miss Forcible snorts.

          

                                 MISS FORCIBLE
                    Oh, give me that cup, April, your eyes
                    are going.

          

                                 MISS SPINK
                    My eyes! You're blind as a bat!

          
          Spink passes the cup to Forcible, who adjusts thick
          glasses and peers closely into it.

          

                                 MISS FORCIBLE
                    Oh, now, ummm... not to worry, child,
                    it's good news: there's a tall, handsome
                    beast in your future.

          

                                   CORALINE
                    A what?

          

                                 MISS SPINK
                    Miriam, oh really, you're holding it
                    wrong.

          
          Spink forcibly rotates the cup.

          

                                   MISS SPINK (CONT'D)
                    See? Danger!

          
          Coraline wants more information.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    What do you see?

          
          The ladies, heads side by side, gaze into the cup. We see
          a SPIKY CLAW formed from the leaves.

          

                                 MISS SPINK

                           (OMINOUS)
                    I see a very peculiar hand...

          
          Forcible rotates the cup back again. Upside down, the
          claw hand looks like a GIRAFFE.

          

                                 MISS FORCIBLE
                    I see a giraffe.

          

                                 MISS SPINK
                    Giraffes don't just fall from the sky,
                    Miriam.

          
          The stuck candy dish suddenly CRASHES to the floor.

          

                                  MISS SPINK (CONT'D)
                    Oh!

          

                                  MISS FORCIBLE
                    Oh, lord!

          
          Coraline asks in a practical voice:

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Well, what should I do?

          

                                 MISS SPINK
                    Never wear green in your dressing room.

          

                                 MISS FORCIBLE
                    Acquire a very tall step ladder.

          

                                 MISS SPINK
                    And be very, very careful. Now, was there
                    something you came to tell us?

          
          Coraline thinks it over, then shakes her head.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    No, I guess not. Thanks for the tea,
                    though.

          
          She gets up and leaves, the dogs immediately return to
          their sofa.

          

                                  MISS FORCIBLE
                    Toodle-oo.

          

                                  MISS SPINK
                    Cheery-bye.

          
          The ladies resume their card game with Miss Spink turning
          to the dogs.

          

                                 MISS SPINK (CONT'D)
                    Do you have any nice Queens for mummy?

          

          

          EXT. HOUSE, TOP OF BASEMENT FLAT STAIRS - SAME


          
          Coraline climbs the stairs up to ground level, intrigued
          by her fortune.

          

                                 CORALINE
                           (to herself)
                    Danger?

          
          Behind her, a PERISCOPE RISES from the WAIST-DEEP FOG.
          Coraline just catches it in her peripheral view.

          
          She frowns but doesn't let on she's aware of it. She
          walks ahead nonchalantly, the periscope following her,
          then suddenly turns and GRABS it, PULLING UP WYBIE, then
          PUNCHES him in the arm.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    Owwwwwwww!

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Great, the village stalker.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    Ow. I - I wasn't stalking you. We're
                    hunting banana slugs.

          
          Wybie takes some SALAD TONGS from a tool belt, snaps
          them.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    What d'ya mean, "we?"

          
          There's a soft meowing from under his coat. He opens it
          up and the BLACK CAT EMERGES and climbs onto his
          shoulders.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Ha! Your cat's not wild, he's a wuss-
                    puss!

          
          Cat glares at her angrily.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    What? He hates to get his feet wet. Geez.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (MOCKING)
                    Wuss-puss...

          
          Tired of her company, the cat jumps off Wybie, onto a
          tree and up onto the roof of the house. Coraline softens.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    So... that doll. Did you make it look
                    like me?

          
          Wybie, scanning under the ground fog for slugs, sticks
          his head up for a moment.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    Oh no; I found it that way. It's older
                    than Gramma -- old as this house prob'ly.

          
          Coraline is highly skeptical. Wybie returns to his hunt.

          

                                 CORALINE
                           (points to self)
                    C'mom - blue hair, my swampers and
                    raincoat?

          
          Wybie stands excitedly and presents a HUGE YELLOW-GREEN
          SLUG to Coraline.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    Dang, check out Slugzilla!

          
          She's not impressed.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (FRUSTRATED)
                    You're just like them.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    Huh?

          
          He looks from the slug to himself.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    I meant my parents; they don't listen to
                    me either.

          
          Wybie nods, not listening again, takes his camera --

          

                                 WYBIE
                    Uh huh... You mind?

          
          -- hands it to her. She acts put-out, but frames a shot.
          He signals he's ready and she fires off one auto-flash
          shot after another as he strikes silly poses making SOUND
          EFFECTS: horrified of the slug one moment; ready to eat
          it the next; pretending it's something from his nose in
          another. She can't help but GIGGLE.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Ew!

          
          Finished, Wybie tosses the slug back into the fog, and
          takes the camera back. He lowers his head, thoughtful,
          then glances up past Coraline at the house. He SIGHS and
          speaks in a SAD TONE.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    You know, I've never been inside the Pink
                    Palace.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (SCEPTICAL)
                    You're kidding.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    Grandma would kill me. Thinks it's
                    dangerous or something.

          

                                    CORALINE
                    Dangerous?

          

                                 WYBIE
                    Well... she had a twin sister.

          

                                    CORALINE
                    So?

          

                                 WYBIE (O.C.).
                    When they were kids, Grandma's sister
                    disappeared.

                           (ON CAMERA)
                    She says she was stolen.

          

                                 CORALINE (O.S.)

                           (SKEPTICAL)
                    Stolen?

          
          ANGLE from roof, over CAT'S SHOULDER as dialog continues.
          Cat senses something and turns -- it's Coraline's DOLL AT
          THE WINDOW, looking like it's spying on things.

          

                                 CORALINE(CONT'D)
                    Well, what do you think?

          

                                 WYBIE
                    Uhhh, I-I don't know.

          
          BACK TO KIDS. Wybie, astride his electric bike now,
          WHISTLES and the black cat jumps down from the roof, onto
          his shoulders.

          

                                 WYBIE (CONT'D)
                    Maybe she just ran away?

          
          We hear Wybie's agitated grandmother call out.

          

                                    WYBIE'S GRANDMOTHER (O.C.)
                    Wyborne!

          
          Wybie turns away: he's said too much.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    Look, I gotta go.

          
          He starts to pull away.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Wait a minute!

          
          And he's gone. PUSH IN on her pensive face.

          

          

          INT CORALINE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          
          CU ON DOLL FACE, back in   the chair by the bed. Coraline
          takes some yellow cheese   from her pocket and puts it by
          the door: mice bait. She   lies down and her breathing
          slows, the doll watching   her with a nearly IMPERCEPTIBLE
          SMILE on its face.

          

          

          INT CORALINE'S BEDROOM - LATER

          
          Coraline sleeping, lighting suggests another dream. SOME
          THINGS go t-t-t-t-t-t. Coraline sits up, looks to her
          door, and spots a COUPLE OF KANGAROO MICE stealing the
          last bit of cheese.

          

          

          INT. UPPER HALL - SAME


          
          She gives chase after the mice, hopping down the stairs
          with the cheese.

          

          

          INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME


          
          Coraline follows the kangaroo mice directly to the little
          door, opened a crack, where they disappear.

          
          She pulls it open. Bricks are gone; tunnel revealed. She
          doesn't hesitate this time to crawl through the door.

          

          

          INT. OTHER KITCHEN - NIGHT


          
          Coraline enters Other Kitchen to find Other Mother
          preparing a delicious breakfast. She looks PRETTIER
          tonight; her black hair shining, lips REDDER. She stops
          HUMMING A LULLABY to greet Coraline.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    Welcome back, darling.

          

                                    CORALINE
                    Hi.

          
          She is grating YELLOW CHEESE into scrambled eggs.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    So thoughtful of you to send this nice
                    cheddar, Coraline.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Cheddar?... Oh, the mice bait...

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    Would you go fetch your father?

          
          Beams at Coraline.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D)
                    Bet he's hungry as a pumpkin by now!

          

                                 CORALINE
                    You mean my Other Father?

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    Your better father, dear.   He's out in
                    the garden.

          

                                 CORALINE.
                    But my parents don't have time to garden.

          
          Other Mother SHUSHES her and pops a strawberry in her
          mouth.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Mmmmmm!

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    Go on...

          
          Coraline shrugs okay, starts for the door.

          

          

          EXT STUDY DOOR TO BACK PORCH - CONTINUOUS

          
          Looking out, she sees the broken-down garden from the
          real world, still grey and lifeless in the dim light.

          

          

          EXT. OTHER GARDEN - SAME


          
          Coraline opens the gate to the garden. A large CRESCENT
          MOON RISES, and THINGS START TO GROW.

          
          Two dead shrubs start to RISE, then BLOSSOM, then the
          blossoms themselves are LIT UP by some GOLD AND AMBER

          HUMMINGBIRDS.

          
          The hummingbirds circle around Coraline, light her
          DRAGONFLY BARRETTE, then continue on, LIGHTING UP PITCHER
          PLANTS that have grown up in a nearby flower bed. A
          beautiful FROG POKES OUT of one blossom.

          
          The birds lead Coraline up steps past a stone wall where

          BLEEDING HEART GROW, AND GLOW, AND BEAT.

          
          She spots the Other Father, riding a PRAYING MANTIS
          TRACTOR on the hillside, planting SEEDS that instantly
          grow into FLOWERING PLANTS.

          

                                    OTHER FATHER
                    Hey!!!

          

                                 CORALINE
                    I love your garden!

          
          He waves back, calling:

          

                                 OTHER FATHER
                    Our garden, Coraline!

          
          A gang of SNAP DRAGONS goes at her, TICKLING Coraline
          till she falls down. Her squeals of delight grow into

          HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (GIGGLING)
                    Oh ah, stop! Stop tickling, ah!

          
          The Other Father hears this and looks over.

          

                                 OTHER FATHER
                    Oops, daughter in distress!

          
          He guns the tractor full-speed over a little bridge,
          grabbing a GOURD TRUMPET from a vine and blowing it.

          
          JACK-O-LANTERNS surface in the pond below and spout

          STREAMS OF WATER.

          
          Arriving beside Coraline, he waggles his finger at the
          naughty snapdragons.

          

                                 OTHER FATHER (CONT'D)
                    Tickle no more, you dragon snappers!

          
          Then he deftly cuts a bouquet of them and presents it to
          Coraline. She nods thanks.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Well, she says it's time for dinner ...
                    breakfast ... food?

          

                                 OTHER FATHER
                    Hop on, kiddo, I want to show you
                    something!

          
          She does. The Other Father grabs the GEARSHIFT KNOB,
          pulls it, and the mechanical mantis SPROUTS WINGS. They
          RISE in the air. Looking down, she sees that the garden
          is a PORTRAIT OF CORALINE.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    I can't believe you did this!

          

                                 OTHER FATHER
                    Mother said you'd like it! Boy she knows
                    you like the back of her hand.

          
          He pulls a lever and they ZOOM out of frame.

          

          

          INT. OTHER KITCHEN - SAME


          
          Coraline doesn't hold back this time. She stacks sausages
          on eggs on top of waffles, rolls it up and stuffs it in
          her mouth. The Other Mother FEEDS BITS OF SAUSAGE to the
          HUNGRY SNAPDRAGONS bouquet now in a vase.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Mmmm...so good!

          

                                 OTHER FATHER
                    I love dinner, breakfast food.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    Coraline, Mr. Bobinsky has invited you to
                    come see the Jumping Mice perform after
                    dinner.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Really. That know-it-all Wybie said it
                    was all in Mr. B's head, I knew he was
                    wrong.

          

                                 OTHER FATHER
                    Well, everything's right in this world,
                    Kiddo.

          
          Coraline hurries to shovel in the rest of her meal, while
          her Other Parents smile at one another.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    Your father and I will clean up while you
                    and your friend head upstairs.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    My friend?

          
          There's a KNOCK at the door. Other Mother opens it to
          reveal the OTHER WYBIE. He's cleaner, with better
          posture, and cute button eyes.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Great... another Wybie. Hello, Why-were-
                    you-born.

          
          The boy nods, button eyes shining.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Hello?

          
          He just makes a shy smile, doesn't answer. She's
          confused.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    I thought you'd like him more, if he
                    spoke a little less.
                           (shrugs, smiling)
                    So I fixed him.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    So he can't talk at all?

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    Nope.

          
          She looks Other Wybie over appreciatively.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Hmm, I like it.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER

                           (PROUDLY)
                    Now run along, you two, and have fun.

          
          Coraline heads out the door with the mute boy.

          

          

          EXT. OTHER ESTATE HOUSE - SAME


          
          The Other House ­ lit by amber spotlights looks MAGICAL
          with ornate GINGERBREAD TRIM; glowing TOPIARY in the
          yard. The kids come out the front door.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    You're awful cheerful, considering you
                    can't say anything.

          
          Other Wybie nods in agreement. Coraline and he start up
          the stairs to Bobinsky's.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Uh...It didn't hurt, did it, when she...

          
          She points to her mouth. There's an awkward moment and
          then he points past her, excitedly: a SMALL BLIMP is
          flying towards Bobinsky's door.

          
          They run up the stairs and watch it slip through an
          opening above his door. Coraline knocks and the door
          suddenly SPINS, THROWING THEM INSIDE.

          

          

          INT. OTHER MR. BOBINSKY'S FLAT - SAME


          
          They somersault to a stop and sit up. Down two rows of
          SMALL CANNONS that face each, an amazing MINIATURE CIRCUS
          has been set up, with a FERRIS WHEEL beside it.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Whoa... cool!

          
          Coraline goes right to the Ferris wheel where a
          MECHANICAL CHICKEN eats dried corn on the cob, fires up
          its belly, then POOPS OUT POPCORN into paper bags.

          
          Other Wybie stomps a firing button and COTTON CANDY
          shoots out of a cannon. He catches the cone, then starts
          firing off all the cannons. Coraline looks back to find
          him covered in the cotton candy.

          

                                   CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Look at you!

          
          Spotlights come on in the big top, the entrance opens,
          and a big voice is heard over loudspeakers.

          

                                 OTHER MR. BOBINSKY (O.S.)

                    and AH-MAZING Jumping Mouse Circus!

          
          They sit between miniature grandstands and watch as the
          little BLIMP, bathed in spotlights, enters through a
          flap. It circles around, rising to the top of the tent,
          then NOSE-DIVES towards the ground! It CRASHES in the
          center of the circus ring, and OPENS LIKE A FLOWER from
          which 50 JUMPING MICE spring up like Chinese acrobats to
          spell out C O R A L I N E.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (DELIGHTED)
                    My name!

          
          The jumping mice leap to the ground in formation,
          BRANDISH TINY INSTRUMENTS, and DRUMMERS START POUNDING.
          The DRUM MAJOR MOUSE parachutes down and whips out a
          BATON. On his signal, the group launch into a WILD

          RUSSIAN CIRCUS MARCH.

          
          Coraline, grinning, turns to the Other Wybie.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    It's wonderful, Wybie!

          
          The boy smiles and nods to the beat of the bass drums as
          the hopping band marches in and out of ever changing
          formations - PINWHEELS, X's, CIRCLES WITHIN CIRCLES.

          
          They hoppers begin to SPIRAL to the center of the circus
          ring when the floor RISES UP from its center to form a
          six-foot Tower of Babel, the mice HOPPING TO THE TOP. The
          DRUM MAJOR balances on the tippy-top on a COLORFUL CIRCUS

          BALL.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Wow!

          
          He RUNS the ball DOWN AND AROUND the spiral as the MICE
          HOP OFF, and when he hits the ground, the TOWER DROPS
          AWAY to reveal the OTHER MISTER BOBINSKY! He CRACKS A

          WHIP.

          
          Coraline and Other Wybie STAND and CLAP. Other Bobinsky ­
          in a RINGMASTER'S OUTFIT with a full length cape ­ bows
          graciously, doffing his tall black hat. His moustache is
          waxed, his eyes black buttons.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Yah! Whooo-oooh! That was great!

          

                                 OTHER MR. BOBINSKY
                    Very very thank you, lady and gentleman.

          
          On cue, the entire jumping mice band DISAPPEARS INTO
          OTHER MR. B'S SLEEVES while the drum major SWINGS UP from
          the man's moustache and onto his head, where he's quickly
          hidden by the tall black hat.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    We loved it, Mr. B. It was ... so ... so--

          

                                 OTHER MR. BOBINSKY

                           (COACHING)

                    AHHHHHH---

          

                                 CORALINE
                    A-mazing!

          

                                 OTHER MR. BOBINSKY
                    You are very velcome anytime you like,
                    you and also your good friend there.

          
          She happily turns to Other Wybie, beaming with joy.

          

                                 OTHER MR. BOBINSKY(CONT'D)
                    Dosvedanya, Coraline.

          
          Bobinsky takes her hand to kiss it.

          

          

          INT. CORALINE'S OTHER BEDROOM - SAME


          
          Other Mother kisses SLEEPING CORALINE'S forehead, sits
          back in the bedside chair. Other Father, close by, pulls
          a cotton candy cone off Other Wybie and munches it.
          Coraline's Other Parents smile warmly, knowing something
          secret that makes them glad.

          INT. CORALINE'S BEDROOM - DAY


          
          EARLY MORNING. Coraline once again wakes in own bed in
          the real world, the little doll ­ left on the chair ­ now
          clutched against her chest.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Ughhh.

          
          Her gaze moves from the doll to where she left the cheese
          by the door. It's GONE. This is much too confusing.

          

          INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME


          
          Coraline tries the small door in the corner wall. It's
          locked. What the heck?

          

          

          EXT. SMALL OFFICE BUILDING IN TOWN - DAY


          
          --SQUEALING brakes, as the Jones' JEEP pulls up in front
          of "Northwest Garden" headquarters. TOWNSFOLK in
          SHAKESPEAREAN COSTUMES stand about, advertising a local
          festival. Coraline is sharing her latest dream:

          

                                 CORALINE (V.O.).
                    ... there were garden squash like balloon
                    animals AND snap dragons.

          
          ON FAMILY: Coraline continues from back seat as her
          father and mother review their work pages.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Oh, and upstairs I saw a real mouse
                    circus, not pretend like the crazy man's
                    in our house.

          
          Her parents, preoccupied, ignore her.

          

                                 CHARLIE
                    You sure you won't come?

          

                                 MEL
                           (indicates neck brace)
                    Don't fret, Charlie, they'll love the new
                    catalog. At least, they'll love my
                    chapters.

          
          Gives her an "aren't you funny" look, opens door. Mel
          looks back at Coraline.

          

                                 MEL (CONT'D)
                    I did not call him crazy, Coraline.   He's
                    drunk.

          
          She makes the hand-thumb bottle sign. Charlie leans in to
          Coraline, pinches her nose.

          

                                 CHARLIE
                    Well, I guess I'll see you around, you
                    dizzy dreamer.

          
          Coraline cuts him off, embarrassed.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Da-ad! I'm not five anymore.

          
          Dad sighs, heads up the steps to his appointment as Mel
          and Coraline drive off.

          

          

          INT. UNIFORMS DEPARTMENT STORE - SAME


          
          PRESIDENT'S DAY SALE. Mel piles gray blouses, a navy
          skirt, white socks onto the arms of a CLERK.

          
          Sitting alone on some stairs, Coraline sees a pair of
          fancy GREEN AND ORANGE GLOVES.

          
          As she tries them on, a YOUNG RASCAL in costume with
          sword BOUNCES PAST her down the stairs on a WHEELED STEP
          STOOL - his FATHER in pursuit.

          

                                 YOUNG RASCAL
                    My kingdom for a hooooooorse!!!!

          
          There's an off screen crash, then the step stool rolls
          back to Coraline. She gets an idea.

          
          Mel is checking out school blouses, when Coraline rolls
          past, first one direction, then the other, modeling the
          colorful gloves. Without looking up, her mom tells her:

          

                                 MEL
                    Put them back.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    But Mom, the whole school's gonna wear
                    boring gray clothes. No one will have
                    these.

          

                                 MEL
                    Put them back.

          
          Coraline mutters:

          

                                 CORALINE
                    My other mother would get them.

          

                                 MEL
                    Maybe she should buy all your clothes.

          
          Coraline scowls and stomps away to return the gloves.

          

          

          INT. CAR - SAME


          
          Coraline and Mel are driving home, shopping bags in back.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    So what do you think's in the other
                    apartment?

          

                                 MEL
                    I don't know. Not a family of Jones
                    imposters.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Then why'd you lock the door?

          

                                 MEL
                           (shorter than previous)
                    Oh, I found some rat crap and... I
                    thought you'd feel ... safer.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    They're jumping-mice, Mom! And the dreams
                    aren't dangerous; they're the most fun
                    I've had since we've moved here.

          

                                 MEL
                    Your school might be fun.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    With those stupid uniforms?   Right.

          

                                 MEL
                    Had to give it a try.

          
          They pull into their DRIVEWAY.

          

          

          INT. KITCHEN - SAME


          
          Mel pulls out salsa, mustard, catsup, stale tortillas
          from the fridge.

          

                                 MEL
                    How do you feel about a mustard-ketchup-
                    salsa wrap for lunch?

          
          Coraline, carrying in the bags from outside, makes a
          face.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Are you kidding me?

          

                                 MEL
                    Mmm... Had to go food shopping anyway.
                    Dad's planning something special.

          
          Coraline squinches up her nose.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Gross-gusting.

          

                                 MEL

                           (BRIGHTENS )
                    You wanna come along? You can pick out
                    something you like.

          
          Coraline plops down in a chair.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Oh, like the gloves?

          
          Mel reaches out and musses Coraline's hair. The girl
          pulls away.

          

                                 MEL
                    Look, Coraline... if things go well
                    today, I promise I'll make it up.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    That's what you always say.

          
          Mom rolls her eyes, shaking her head, and opens the door
          to leave.

          

                                 MEL
                    Won't be long.

          
          Shuts the door.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (MUTTERS)
                    But I might be...

          
          She leaves.

          

          

          INT. KITCHEN - SAME


          
          Coraline pulls open the key drawer, looking for the small
          black key. Not there. She looks around, then spots it
          hanging on a hook above a door. She stands on a chair and
          snags it.

          

          

          INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME


          
          Coraline stoops in front of the small door and pushes the
          key into the keyhole and unlocks the door.

          
          She listens for her mother's car. Nothing. Grasping the
          key between thumb and forefinger, she closes her eyes,
          she pulls the door open.

          
          ANGLE ON CORALINE: A SOFT BREEZE MOVES her hair. She
          knows before her eyes open that the BRICKS ARE GONE.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (TRIUMPHANT)
                    I knew it was real!

          
          She opens her eyes, smiles, and CRAWLS FORWARD.

          
          ANGLE ON CORALINE THROUGH WINDOW. CAMERA PULLS BACK and
          we FIND the BLACK CAT, perched on the wet window sill,
          OBSERVING Coraline as she disappears into the tunnel.
          With a look of concern, he exits frame.

          

          

          INT. OTHER KITCHEN - NIGHT


          
          Lunch is ready and waiting for her: foot-long hotdogs
          with relish; grilled cheese sandwiches with gherkins;
          curly-fries; piles of coleslaw and potato salad; five
          flavors of soda-pop. There's a NOTE attached to a GIFT-

          WRAPPED BOX:

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER (V.O.)

                    you downstairs after lunch. I hope you
                    like the new outfit I made you! Love,
                    Mother.

          
          Coraline tears open the box and finds a pair of beautiful
          BLUE BOOTS, BLACK CORDUROY TROUSERS, and a METALLIC GREY

          SWEATER WITH TWINKLING STARS.

          
          She holds up the sweater to her body, smiles, then puts
          down the clothes and digs into lunch.

          

          

          EXT. OTHER HOUSE - SAME


          
          Coraline, dressed in her FANCY NEW CLOTHES, steps onto
          the FRONT PORCH and BURPS. It's always nighttime in this
          world.

          
          A CAT MEEEROWS. Coraline looks up to see a BLACK CAT on
          the porch roof above her.

          
          Coraline raises her brows, studies the animal a moment.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Hmmm... Wybie's got a cat like you at
                    home. Not the quiet Wybie; the one that
                    talks too much. You must be the Other
                    Cat.

          
          The cat LEAPS down and lands on the railing by the
          basement stairs. He shakes his head and SPEAKS!

          

                                 CAT
                    No. I'm not the other anything. I'm me.

          
          He tips his head to one side, opal blue eyes glinting.
          Coraline is surprised.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Um... I can see you don't have button
                    eyes. But if you're the same cat, how can
                    you talk?

          
          The cat shrugs from the tip of his tail to his whiskers.

          

                                  CAT
                    I just can.

          
          He leaps smoothly from the railing and onto a large,

          FALLEN TREE.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Cats don't talk at home.

          

                                  CAT
                    No?

          

                                  CORALINE
                    Nope.

          
          Climbs up the tree's upended roots, head held high and
          proud.

          

                                 CAT

                           (DRYLY)
                    Well, you're clearly the expert on these
                    things. After all, I'm just a big fat
                    wuss puss.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Come back. Please? I... I'm sorry I
                    called you that, I really am.

          
          Coraline forces herself to be polite.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    How'd you get here?

          

                                 CAT
                    I've been coming here for a while.

          
          He DISAPPEARS behind one a thick root that sticks up,
          then REAPPEARS from a large knot hole beside Coraline,
          startling her.

          

                                 CAT (CONT'D)
                    It's a game we play. She...
                           (indicates house)
                    ...hates cats and tries to keep me out.
                    But she can't, of course.

          
          He pokes his HEAD DOWN into the knot hole, then POPS IT
          UP out of ANOTHER KNOT-HOLE, ten feet away.

          

                                 CAT (CONT'D)
                    I come and go as I please.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (SKEPTICAL)
                    The Other Mother hates cats?

          

                                 CAT

                           (CONTEMPTUOUS)
                    Not like any "mother" I've ever known.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    What do you mean? She's amazing!

          
          Cat climbs the tree's branches onto the roof.

          

                                 CAT
                    You probably think this world is a dream
                    come true. But you're wrong. The Other
                    Wybie told me so.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    That's nonsense. He can't talk.

          
          The cat looks at her, pitying her lack of intelligence.

          

                                 CAT
                    Perhaps not to you. We cats, however,
                    have far superior senses than humans and
                    can see and smell, and --

          
          Suddenly, the cat drops into a crouch and freezes,
          sensing something.

          

                                 CAT (CONT'D)

                           (WHISPERING)
                    Shhhh! I hear something! Right ...over...

          
          He SCRAMBLES across the roof and disappears around the
          corner.

          
          Coraline shrugs, skeptical, and heads down to Spink and
          Forcible's, their door now circled with CHASER LIGHTS.

          

          

          INT. MISS SPINK AND FORCIBLE'S OTHER APARTMENT - SAME


          
          She pushes past elegant VELVET CURTAINS to discover an
          enormous, darkened THEATER with dim rows of seats and a
          high WOODEN STAGE.

          
          A FLASHLIGHT comes towards her, carried by a black
          SCOTTIE DOG with button eyes. He looks up at her, sniffs,
          then leads her down the aisle past rows and rows of
          BUTTON-EYED SCOTTIES, to a front seat by the Other Wybie.
          She squeezes his arm hello, he looks back warmly.

          

                                  CORALINE
                    Hey, Wybie.

          
          Light flash, the audience quiets, then the curtains open
          on a SEASIDE SETTING with ROTATING WAVES. OTHER MISS
          SPINK rises up on stage left, in a MERMAID SUIT, large
          WIG, BUTTON EYES, and UKULELE.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)

                           (SHOCKED)
                    She's practically naked!

          
          And Miss Spink sings.

          

                                 OTHER MISS SPINK
                    I'm known as the siren of all seven seas
                    The breaker of hearts by the bay.

          
          A flat cut-out ship manned by cut-out men rows in behind
          her.

          

                                 OTHER MISS SPINK (CONT'D)
                    So, if you go swimmin'
                    With bow-legged women,
                    I might steal your weak heart away.

          
          She bows her head and the audience of dogs THUMP their
          tails.

          
          Spink is LOWERED through the stage floor, the SCENERY
          CHANGES, and on the right, a huge SCALLOP SHELL RISES up
          with the OTHER MISS FORCIBLE, clad in the bare minimum -
          her homage to Botticelli's BIRTH OF VENUS. She's facing
          the wrong way.

          

                                 CORALINE
                           (whisper, to Wybie)
                    Oh my God.

          
          A dog HOWLS, alerting the near-blind lady, who turns to
          the audience and begins the next verse.

          

                                 OTHER MISS FORCIBLE
                    A big-bottomed sea witch may bob through
                    the waves,
                    And hope to lead sailors astray,
                    But a true ocean goddess,
                    Must fill out her bodice,
                           (indicates her ample bosom)
                    To present an alluring display.

          
          The dogs thump and woof, Wybie and Coraline clap.

          
          Spink, furious at the greater reaction, gets back in the
          competition. Rising up, she makes it clear just who she's
          dissing.

          

                                 OTHER MISS SPINK
                    Beware of old oysters, too large in the
                    chest,
                    Let's banish them from the buffet.

          
          But Forcible is up to the challenge - the scenery starts
          to change faster and faster as the ladies rise up and
          down, competing.

          

                                 OTHER MISS SPINK (CONT'D)
                    I'm far more nutritious

          

                                 OTHER MISS FORCIBLE
                    You smell like the fishes

          

                                 OTHER MISS SPINK
                    Did I hear a banshee?

          

                                 OTHER MISS FORCIBLE
                    You're sea-green with envy

          

                                 OTHER MISS SPINK
                    This mermaid enchantress,

          

                                 OTHER MISS FORCIBLE
                    No, I "Birth of Venus!"

          
          The set rigging can't take it anymore -- ropes snap,
          sandbags swing, scenery starts to fall.

          

                                 OTHER MISS FORCIBLE

                                 (CONT'D)
                    Will send sailors swooning --oh--!

          

                                 OTHER MISS SPINK
                    Will send sailors swooning --oh--!

          

          
          With a crash, the old ladies TUMBLE DOWN IN A PILE.
          Coraline winces. The audience HOWLS with laughter as the
          curtains close on the disaster.

          

          
          DRUM ROLL. A SCOTTIE DOG pushes a large BUCKET OF WATER,
          labeled "POOL", onto center stage. Spotlights tilt up to
          the top of very tall diving platforms WHERE THE OLD
          LADIES NOW STAND. Coraline can't stand it.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (WHISPERS)
                    I can't look!

          

                                 OTHER MISS SPINK
                    Ready to break a leg, Miriam?

          

                                 OTHER MISS FORCIBLE
                    Our lives for the theater, April!

          
          They begin to bounce on the diving boards. As they bounce
          up, the two troupers unzip FAT SUIT DISGUISES from which
          emerge their YOUNGER BEAUTIFUL SELVES which LEAP to catch
          matching TRAPEZE BARS that swing into place.

          
          Coraline LAUGHS with relief and amazement, Other Wybie
          pleased. Dogs WOOF, MUSIC BEGINS and the TWO BEAUTIES ­
          eyes BRIGHT BUTTONS, SEXY BATHING SUITS striped pink and
          green ­ SWING OUT over the stage.

          

                                 YOUNG FORCIBLE
                    What a piece of work is man!
                    How noble in reason!

          
          They FLY past each other on their trapezes, double up,
          catch one another hand to ankle. We notice a LARGE PEARL
          RING on Forcible's finger.

          

                                 YOUNG SPINK
                    How infinite in faculty!
                    In form and moving how express and
                    admirable!

          
          In a SUDDEN change of direction, they SWING OUT over the
          audience, trapeze bar LOWERING and PULL CORALINE INTO THE
          AIR! She HOLLERS, terrified.

          
          They expertly TOSS HER one to the other, FLIPPING AND
          SPINNING, as they continue their lines. Her SCREAMS
          become CRIES OF EXHILARATION.

          

                                 YOUNG FORCIBLE
                    In action like an angel!

          

                                 YOUNG SPINK
                    In apprehension how like a god!

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Ahhh!!!

          

                                 YOUNG FORCIBLE
                    The beauty of the world!

          

                                 YOUNG SPINK
                    The paragon of animals!

          
          Coraline swings face-to-face to the dogs in the royal box
          seats where one licks her.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Yeah!!

          
          The acrobats TOSS CORALINE UP into the air and JACK-KNIFE
          DIVE into the large bucket below. They rise up, unhurt,
          just in time to catch Coraline. The THREE BOW to
          THUNDEROUS THUMPING APPLAUSE and, as the camera pulls
          back on the scene, Other Wybie throws her a rose!

          

          

          EXT. OTHER ESTATE HOUSE - NIGHT


          
          Other Wybie escorts Coraline up the stone stairs from
          Spink and Forcible's apartment. The Other Mother and
          Other Father, a huge, full moon rising behind them, wait
          at the top of the stairs.

          

                                 OTHER FATHER
                    Hey there.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    Was it wonderful, dear?

          
          Other Mother's hair looks absolutely beautiful and Other
          Father dapper. Coraline shakes with excitement as they
          walk toward the front porch. Other Wybie holds back,
          loses his smile.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Oh yeah. They swooped down and pulled me
                    right out of my seat ­ Spink and
                    Forcible. Only they weren't old ladies,
                    that was just a disguise. But then, I was
                    flying through the air and... it was, it
                    was magic.

          
          They walk up the front steps.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    You do like it here, don't you, Coraline?

          

                                 CORALINE
                           (nods, turns back)
                    Uh-huh! Good night, Wybie.

          
          Other Father takes Coraline inside. Wybie, at the bottom
          of the steps, looks GUILTY AND SAD. Other Mother glares
          at him, makes a huge, false smile then points to him. He
          just lowers his head.

          

          

          INT. OTHER HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS


          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    You could stay here forever... if you
                    want to.

          

                                   CORALINE
                    Really?

          

                                 OTHER FATHER
                    Sure...we'll sing and play games, and
                    Mother will cook your favorite meals.

          
          Other Mother rests her hand on Coraline's shoulder.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    There's one tiny little thing we need to
                    do.

          

                                   CORALINE
                    What's that?

          

                                 OTHER FATHER
                    Well, it's a surprise.

          

          

          INT. OTHER DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS


          
          Coraline is seated in her place. The Other Mother places
          a SMALL BOX with a bow in front of her, and takes her
          seat along with Other Father. Coraline excitedly removes
          the lid.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    For you ... our little doll.

          
          The "surprise" is a spool of BLACK THREAD, a SILVER
          NEEDLE, and a pair of SHINY BLACK BUTTONS -- FOR

          CORALINE'S EYES.

          
          Coraline GASPS. She looks up at her Other Parents, hoping
          it's a bad joke.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D)

                           (SMILING)
                    Black is traditional, but if you'd prefer
                    pink or vermillion or chartreuse...

          
          Coraline sees their button eyes changing colors, growing
          ever more panicked.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D)
                    ... though you might make me jealous.

          

                                 CORALINE

                    NO WAY!

          
          She bats the box away, and her hands FLY to her face,
          COVER her eyes.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)

                    YOU'RE NOT SEWING BUTTONS IN MY EYES!

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    Oh, but we need a yes ... if you want to
                    stay here.

          
          Other Father tests the needle on his finger.

          

                                 OTHER FATHER

                           (ENTHUSIASTIC)
                    So sharp you won't feel a thi-- Oww!

          
          Other Mother KICKS him under the table. Embarrassed, he
          puts the needle back in the box.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    There now; it's your decision, darling.
                    We only want what's best for you.

          
          She walks over and puts her hand, now ICY COLD, on
          Coraline's shoulder. Coraline PUSHES it away and STANDS

          UP.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    I'm... I'm going to bed! RIGHT NOW!

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER

                           (WOUNDED)
                    Bed?

          

                                 OTHER FATHER
                    Before dinner?

          
          Coraline fights to control her quaking voice.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    I'm really, really tired. Yeah...
                           (fakes huge yawn)
                    I just need to sleep on things.

          
          Other Mother stands, masking disappointment.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    Well of course you do, darling... I'll be
                    happy to tuck you in.

          
          Coraline backs away, urging them to stay where they are.

          

                                 CORALINE
                           (palms out, forced smile)
                    Oh, no thanks, uh, you-you've done so
                    much already--

          
          She turns to leave and finds the Other Mother BLOCKING
          THE DOORWAY. Other Father joins her.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    You're welcome. And I ­
                           (smiles to Other Father)
                    we aren't worried at all, darling.

                           (SOFTLY)
                    Soon you'll see things our way.

          
          She lets go. She and the Other Father herd Coraline
          across the hallway to the stairs.

          

          

          INT. OTHER HALLWAY, STAIRS, UPPER HALL - CONTINUOUS


          
          Coraline carefully climbs the stairs, the Other Parents
          watching. When they can no longer see her, she RACES up
          the last steps and DASHES to her Other Bedroom.

          

          

          INT. CORALINE'S OTHER BEDROOM - TWILIGHT


          
          Coraline shuts the door and is quickly surrounded by
          fluttering DRAGONFLIES.

          

                                 MAGIC DRAGONFLY
                    What's wrong, Coraline? Don't you want to
                    play?

          
          She jumps up and CATCHES the paper creatures, opens the
          TOY CHEST and tosses them in.

          
          The PLUSH BLUE SQUID greets her from the shelf, followed
          by the TOY TANK GIRAFFE.

          

                                 TOY SQUID
                    Yeah, I wanna hugga your face!

          

                                 TOY TANK GIRAFFE
                    Get a grip, soldier.

          
          She GRABS them both and drops them in the toy chest.

          
          Her PHOTO FRIENDS - NOW WITH BLACK BUTTONS FOR EYES -
          call out from the photo by her bed.

          

                                 PHOTO FRIENDS
                    Hey!

          

                                 PHOTO FRIEND 1
                    Where's yer buttons, yuper?

          

                                 PHOTO FRIEND 2
                    You wanna stay, don'tcha?

          
          Coraline grabs them as well, drops them in the chest, and
          SHUTS the lid. She barricades the door with a DRESSER and
          CHAIRS and then the TOY CHEST.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    I'm going home tonight, robots - and I
                    won't be back.

          
          She sits on the bed, pulls off the blue boots then CLIMBS
          UNDER THE COVERS, pulling them over her head and holding
          tight. She HUGS herself to stop shaking, knowing she must
          fall asleep in this bed to wake up in her real bed at
          home. She closes her eyes and tells herself:

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep, go
                    to sleep!

          
          She tosses one way, then another. WE HEAR her voice

          CONTINUE:

          

                                 CORALINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    Go to sleep, go to sleep...

          
          There are strange, backwards sounds, then the eerie
          voices of Other Mother and Other Father.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER (V.O.)
                    There's just one tiny little thing we
                    have to do.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep...

          

                                 OTHER FATHER (V.O.)
                    So sharp you won't feel a thing...

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep...

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER (V.O.)
                    Soon you'll see things our way...

          
          Coraline fidgets and turns and turns again but sleep
          finally wraps her and takes her to oblivion.

          

                                                        MATCH PULLBACK

                                                             DISSOLVE:

          

          

          INT. OTHER BEDROOM - LATER


          
          We see Coraline's room, BRIGHTLY LIT LIKE MORNING IN THE

          REAL WORLD.

          
          ANGLE ON Coraline's face beneath the covers, as she's
          WOKEN by the light. With a hopeful look, she calls out,
          pulls back the covers:

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Mom!... Dad!..

          
          Her smile turns to shock -- there's a BRIGHT, FULL MOON
          in her window and it's STILL NIGHTTIME IN THE OTHER

          WORLD.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Oh God, I'm still here?

          

          

          INT. OTHER STAIRS, LOWER HALLWAY - SAME


          
          Coraline races downstairs to the Other Living Room where
          the little door home must be! But the living room is
          LOCKED TIGHT. She pulls at the handles, plants a foot and
          tries with all her might! It's no use. She stops,
          panting, then hears a piano note being hit over and over.

          

          

          INT. OTHER FATHER'S STUDY - SAME


          
          Coraline opens the door and finds the Other Father
          sitting at the piano, his back to her, hitting the note.
          She speaks in her bravest voice.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Hey you! Where's the Other Mother?     I
                    want to go home.

          
          The Other Father turns around. He looks ill; his hair
          messed and his glasses askew. He speaks, his voice slowed-
          down.

          

                                 OTHER FATHER
                    All will be swell, soon as Mother's
                    refreshed. Her strength is our strength.

          
          The WHITE-GLOVED HANDS POP OUT from the piano. One COVERS
          HIS MOUTH, the other WAGS A FINGER in his face.

          

                                 OTHER FATHER (CONT'D)
                    Mustn't talk when Mother's not here.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    If you won't even talk to me, I'm gonna
                    find the Other Wybie. He'll help me.

          
          She turns to go.

          

                                 OTHER FATHER
                    No point; he pulled a long face...

          
          He PULLS DOWN the corners of his mouth impossibly far.

          

                                 OTHER FATHER (CONT'D)
                    ...and Mother didn't like it.

          
          The PIANO HANDS pop out again, aggressively SHUT HIS
          MOUTH and SPIN HIM away from Coraline. Frightened, she
          runs to the door that leads outside, and pulls it open.

          

          

          EXT. OTHER HOUSE - NIGHT, FULL MOON


          
          She runs out the back porch, towards the Other Garden.

          

          OTHER STEEP HILLSIDE TRAIL

          
          She crosses the trail, the Other House in the distance.

          

          ENTRANCE TO OTHER ORCHARD

          
          She runs down the path.

          

          OTHER ORCHARD

          
          Coraline runs past trees that are LUSH WITH GREEN LEAVES

          AND RIPE RED FRUIT.

          
          She's panting hard, and has to slow to a fast walk. The
          further she goes, the LESS TREE-LIKE the fruit trees
          become.

          
          She hears the CAT MEROWWW. Surprised, she looks down.

          

                                 CAT
                    And what do you think you're doing?

          
          The cat trots along by her feet. She blinks.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Well, I'm gettin' outta here. That's what
                    I'M doing.

          
          The sky starts to BRIGHTEN and the apple trees become

          WIRE-THIN SHAPES OF TREES.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Huh? Something's wrong. Shouldn't the
                    old well be here?

          
          The remnants of the trees and the sky and the ground give
          way to a PALE, EMPTY NOTHINGNESS. No ground or shadows.

          

                                 CAT
                    Nothing out here ... it's the empty part
                    of this world. She only made what she
                    knew would impress you.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    But why? Why does she want me?

          
          They walk over the horizon.

          
                                 CAT (cont'd)
                    She wants something to love, I think.
                    Something that isn't her... Or maybe
                    she'd just love something to eat.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Eat? That's ridiculous, mothers don't eat
                    daughters!

          

                                 CAT
                    I don't know. How do you taste?

          

          OTHER HOUSE REAPPEARS

          
          A SHAPE RISES in front of them in the whiteness and
          becomes the beautiful OTHER HOUSE. Coraline and the cat
          slow, then the front yard and topiary, the sky, hills,
          white gravel drive and the poplar trees behind them FILL

          IN.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Huh? But how can you walk away from
                    something and still come back to it?

          
          The cat curls its tail into a question mark, and tips its
          head to one side.

          

                                 CAT
                    Walk around the world.

          

                                   CORALINE
                    Small world.

          
          Coraline shivers. The cat suddenly TENSES, focuses on a
          shrub.

          

                                   CAT
                    Hang on--

          
          He bounds towards the shrub and chases out a CUTE
          KANGAROO MOUSE in uniform with a TINY TRUMPET. Before
          Coraline can blink, he's PINNED IT DOWN.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Stop, he's one of the circus mice!

          
          With a SWIFT BLOW of its paw, the cat KNOCKS the mouse
          into the air, and catches it in his mouth. He gives a
          QUICK, KILLING BITE - CORALINE GASPS - and the mouse
          TRANSFORMS into a BIG DEAD RAT. Coraline is stunned. He
          drops the rat on the ground.

          

                                 CAT
                    I don't like rats at the best of times,
                    but this one was sounding an alarm.

          
          The cat picks the rat up and heads off. Slack-jawed,
          Coraline speaks with admiration.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Gooooood kitty.

          
          Coraline looks to the house with a determined look.

          
          On the porch, she takes out a HEAVY CANE from the
          UMBRELLA STAND and hits it into her hand.

          

          

          INT. HOUSE,   OTHER HALLWAY - SAME


          
          Coraline, standing in front of the living room doors,
          TESTS the cane in her hands, and peers down the hall for
          danger. It's dead quiet -- no piano, no sounds of
          anything.

          
          She JAMS the cane through the doors' handles, and PULLS
          with all her might. One HANDLE AND LOCK BREAK and the
          door swings open into the pitch black living room. The
          hall light casts a narrow path directly to the Other
          Little Door on the far wall, cracked open. She steps into
          the room.

          

          

          INT. OTHER LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS


          
          A huge ARMOIRE BUG suddenly crab-steps in her path,
          blocking the little door, and all around her things start
          to glow. The room has been TRANSFORMED into an amazing
          BUG MUSEUM, with all sorts of glowing, living specimens
          in the place of the old furniture and furnishings. The
          radiators are now big caterpillars, the Nordic Track a
          serving bug.

          
          The Other Mother speaks out, startling Coraline.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER (O.S.)
                    They say even the proudest --

          
          The sofa, now a LARGE BUG, turns in place to reveal her
          sitting on it.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D)
                    --spirit can be broken ... with love.

          
          She's all smiles, button eyes shining, one hand held out
          in a behold my handiwork gesture.

          
          A BUG CHAIR scoops up Coraline and brings her to the
          Other Mother.

          
          The Other Mother takes a candy dish from the servant bug.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D)
                    Of course, chocolate never hurts. Like
                    one?

          
          She extends a CANDY DISH filled LIVING CHOCOLATE BEETLES.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D)
                    They're Cocoa Beetles from Zanzibar.

          
          Coraline is disgusted. The Other Mother takes back the
          dish and BITES OFF THE HEAD OF ONE. It's the first thing
          she's eaten in the film.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    I want to be with my real mom and dad. I
                    want you to let me go.

          
          The Other Mother FROWNS, swallows. She speaks with a
          FRIGHTENING STEELINESS in her voice.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    Is that any way to talk to your mother?

          
          Coraline is mad, and feeling mad makes her brave.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    You aren't my mother.

          
          The Other Mother STRAIGHTENS. Her button eyes, now DEAD,
          stare into Coraline's.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    Apologize at once, Coraline!

          
          Coraline stares right back, not blinking.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    No.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER

                           (TENSELY)
                    I'll give you to the count of three.
                    One...

          
          Then she stands up, GROWING TALLER.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D)
                    ...two...

          
          She grows TALLER STILL and SCARIER like a super model on
          steroids.

          

                                 TALL OTHER MOTHER

                    ...THREE!

          
          This TALL OTHER MOTHER GRABS Coraline by her NOSE and
          DRAGS her to the hallway.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Ow, what are you doing!

          

          

          INT. OTHER HOUSE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS


          
          She PULLS Coraline down the hallway to the mirror at the
          end. Coraline flails at the Tall Other Mother with her
          fists.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Ow, that hurts!

          
          Tall Other Mother SHOVES Coraline RIGHT THROUGH THE
          MIRROR as if it was water!

          

          

          INT. CLOSET-PRISON BEHIND THE MIRROR - CONTINUOUS


          
          Coraline HITS the ground hard. The Tall Other Mother,
          head thrust through the mirror, stares down at her
          angrily.

          

                                 TALL OTHER MOTHER
                    You may come out when you've learned to
                    be a loving daughter!

          
          She PULLS HER HEAD OUT and leaves Coraline in DARKNESS.

          
          Coraline pounds on the mirror-door, kicks it with her
          blue boots. A SOB wells up in her throat.

          
          And then we hear a SOFT GHOSTLY MOAN.

          
          She turns. She can just make out a sagging iron bed. When
          the voice speaks, there is a faint glow from beneath its
          stained cover.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (FRIGHTENED)
                    Who's there?

          

                                 TALL GIRL GHOST (O.S.)

                           (WHISPERS)
                    Hush! And shush! For the Beldam might be
                    listening!

          
          Coraline steps towards the bed, the faint glow from under
          the covers in sync with the words she hears.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (WHISPERS)
                    You ... you mean the Other Mother? ...

          
          She gently pulls back the sheets.

          
          The DIMLY GLOWING GHOSTS of THREE CHILDREN, BUTTON EYES,
          SIT UP: a SWEET GIRL GHOST, Coraline's size; a TALL GIRL
          GHOST, emotional; a young BOY GHOST, very sad.

          

                                   CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Who are you?

          

                                 BOY GHOST

                           (WISTFUL)
                    Don't remember our names... But I `member
                    my true mommy...

          
          The boy, dressed like Huck Finn, CONJURES up ghost
          flowers.

          
          The strange-looking flowers wither and fade. He's so sad
          that Coraline takes his cold hand and squeezes it.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Why are you all here?

          

                                  ALL GHOSTS
                    The Beldam!

          
          The ghosts move about in a dance macabre, like ghostly
          fish in water.

          

                                 SWEET GIRL GHOST
                    She spied on our lives,
                    through the little doll's eyes,

          

                                 BOY GHOST
                    And saw that we weren't    happy.

          

                                 TALL GIRL GHOST
                    So she lured us away,

          

                                 TALL GIRL GHOST (CONT'D)
                    with treasures and treats,

          

                                 SWEET GIRL GHOST
                    and games to play!

          

                                 BOY GHOST
                    Gave all that we asked -

          

                                 SWEET GIRL GHOST
                    yet we still wanted more -

          

                                 TALL GIRL GHOST
                    So we let her sew the buttons.

          

                                 BOY GHOST
                    She said that she loved us,

          

                                 TALL GIRL GHOST
                    But she locked us here

          

                                 ALL GHOSTS
                    And ate up our lives.

          
          The ghosts fall back into their bed and sink down.
          Coraline is stunned. She thinks a little and then speaks,
          trying to steady her voice.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Well, she can't keep me in the dark
                    forever; not if she wants to win my life.
                    Beating her is my only chance.

          
          A beat. Then the Sweet Girl asks in her sing-song way:

          

                                 SWEET GIRL GHOST
                    Perhaps, if you do win your escape, you
                    could find our eyes?

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Has she taken those, too?

          

                                 SWEET GIRL GHOST
                    Yes, miss. And hidden them.

          

                                 BOY GHOST
                    Find our eyes, mistress, and our souls
                    will be freed.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    I ... I'll try.

          
          The ghosts PULSE with hope. Coraline sits down against
          the mirror door, bounces her head against it. She's not
          hopeless.

          
          Suddenly, HANDS REACH THROUGH THE MIRROR and PULL HER

          OUT!

          

          

          INT. OTHER HALLWAY - NIGHT


          
          C.U. of Coraline's FACE, eyes wild, as she TEARS at the
          hands that hold her. She GRABS one and, FLIPS her MASKED
          ATTACKER onto the ground. She pulls off his mask: it's
          the OTHER WYBIE, his mouth stitched into a PAINFUL, EAR

          TO EAR SMILE.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (PANTING)

                    WYBIE?..

          
          Coraline sits him up.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Did she do this to you?

          
          She unstitches his painfully-huge grin.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    I hope that feels bet--

          

                                  OTHER WYBIE
                    Shhh.

          
          He stops her with a finger to her lips, and points to the
          Other Living Room, its door UNLOCKED AND OPEN. He grabs
          her hand and PULLS her there.

          

          

          INT. OTHER LIVING ROOM ­ CONTINUOUS


          
          It's dark, the bug furniture asleep. They run to the big
          armoire bug that guards the little door and SHOVE IT out
          of the way. It CRASHES to the floor. And from upstairs, a
          voice calls out.

          

                                 TALL OTHER MOTHER (O.S.)
                    Coraline? Is that you!

          

                                  CORALINE
                    Let's go!

          
          She opens the little door. A COLD WIND blows from the
          dark passageway, now filled with SPIDER WEBS and the
          SHOES, COATS, AND HATS of other kids who tried to escape.

          

                                  TALL OTHER MOTHER (O.S.)
                    Coraline...

          
          The tunnel MOVES at the sound of her voice. Coraline
          takes Other Wybie's arm.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Come on. She'll hurt you again!

          
          He shakes his head no, then pulls off his glove to reveal
          a HAND MADE OF SAWDUST. He blows his fingers away.

          
          HIGH HEELS CLICK from the stairs; she's ALMOST THERE!

          

                                 TALL OTHER MOTHER (O.S.)
                    Coraline? How dare you disobey your
                    mother!!

          
          Other Wybie shoves Coraline into the tunnel and shuts the

          Hunched down, she moves as quickly as she can, tearing
          through the sticky cobwebs.

          

                                 TALL OTHER MOTHER (O.S.)
                           (calling after her)
                    Coraline!

          
          Strands of web brush her face, stick to her hair; she
          closes her eyes, hands out until she finally gets to the
          little door at the other end. She DIVES, TUCKS, --

          

          

          INT. REAL LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS TIME, BUT DAY HERE


          
          -- AND ROLLS OUT onto the REAL LIVING ROOM FLOOR.
          Coraline SLAMS the door shut and turns the sharp little
          key ­ still in the keyhole ­ to LOCK IT.

          
          She stands, covered in dust and cobwebs, and calls out
          with joy and relief.

          

                                 CORALINE

                    I'M HOME!

          

          

          INT. HALLWAY, STAIRWAY, DAD'S STUDY - SAME


          
          She goes quickly through the apartment, happily calling:

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Anybody here? Hello, hello, hello! Real
                    Dad ... Real Mom!

          

          

          INT. KITCHEN - SAME


          

                                 CORALINE
                    Oh, Mom's groceries!

          
          There are bags of groceries on the table, as if her
          mother had just gotten in. She pulls open a bag to peek
          and FRUIT FLIES shoot out. The food is spoiled.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)

                           (PUZZLED)
                    Uhhh. That's disgusting.

          
          Door bell rings.

          

          

          INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS


          
          She runs excitedly to the door and flings it open.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    I missed you guys so much-- You'll never--

          

          INT./EXT. FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS, RAIN


          
          But it's just Wybie, the real boy.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Oh... the Wybie that talks...

          
          He's waves, face down, awkward.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    Huh? Ha ha ha....yeah... Um, so you know
                    tha-that old doll I gave you?

          
          Coraline tenses, sharp breath.

          

                                 WYBIE (CONT'D)
                    Um... my Gramma's real mad, says it was
                    her sister's - the one that...
                    disappeared?

          
          She reads him like a book.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (REALIZATION)
                    You stole that doll, didn't you?

          
          Wybie answers quickly, guilty as heck.

          

                                 WYBIE.
                    Well, i-it looked just like you. And I

                    FIGURED--

          
          Coraline, rushing the words, tells him the truth.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    It used to look like this pioneer girl;
                    then Huck Finn junior; then it was this
                    Little Rascals chick with all these
                    ribbons, and braids, and....

          
          Her voice trails off. Coraline studies Wybie, then, snaps
          her fingers.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Grandma's missing sister!

          
          He nods, one brow raising up.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    I think I just met her. C'mon!

          
          She pulls him inside and--

          

          INT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

          
          --drags him down the hall.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    Uh, listen, I-I-I'm really not supposed

                    TO--

          

          

          INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS


          
          Coraline WALKS HIM to the LITTLE DOOR in the corner wall
          and points. Wybie looks around anxiously, fearful and
          curious to be in his grandmother's old house.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    She's in there.

          
          Reluctantly, he bends down and reaches for the key in the
          lock.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    C-can you ­ can you unlock it?

          
          She grabs his hand, stops him.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Not in a million years. But it wouldn't
                    matter; she can't escape without her
                    eyes. None of the ghosts can.

          
          Wybie stares at her, nodding his head as if he
          understands her crazy story. He changes the subject, gets
          back to his mission.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    Huhhhhhh... So, uh, I really need to get
                    that doll?

          
          Coraline snaps at him.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Great! I'd love to get rid of it!

          
          She exhales in a huff. Grabs his sleeve, leads him from
          room.

          

          

          INT. CORALINE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS


          
          The doll's not on the bed, not on the chairs or moving
          boxes.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Where are you hiding, you little
                    monster?!

          
          Wybie nervously watches Coraline pull out her dresser
          drawers, yank cushions off the window seat.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    You and Gramma been talking?

          

                                 CORALINE
                    The doll's her spy! It's how she watches
                    you, finds out what's wrong with your
                    life!

          
          Wybie, trapped like a deer-in-the-headlights, tries to
          make sense of her remarks.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    The doll...is my Gramma's...spy.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    NO! - the Other Mother! She's got this
                    whole world where everything's better -
                    the food, the garden, the--
                           (leans in on him)
                    --neighbors.

          
          Holds her hands up.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    But it's all a trap!

          
          Wybie, eager to escape, cups hand to ear by the window.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    Yeah... Uh, I think I heard someone
                    calling me, Jonesy.

          
          Coraline sees right through him.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Don't believe me?... You can ask the cat!

          
          He moves around her towards the door, turns to leave.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    The cat... I-I'll just tell Gramma that
                    you couldn't find the doll-- OW!

          
          A blue boot - thrown by Coraline - HITS his arm. He turns
          back as she takes off the second one.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    You're not LISTENING TO ME!

          

                                 WYBIE
                    That's ... cause ... you're CRAZY!

          
          He FLEES as the second boot flies past. Coraline GROWLS,
          and gives chase.

          

          

          INT UPPER STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS

          
          She grabs her boots from the floor, and CHASES him down
          the stairs in her socks.

          

          

          EXT. FRONT DOOR/DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS, RAINING


          
          Door flies open and Wybie RUNS down the front steps to
          his electric bike. Coraline RACES down after him.

          

                                  CORALINE
                    You creep!

          

                                 WYBIE
                           (calling over his shoulder)
                    Crazy!!

          
          He RUNS his bike towards the FALLEN TREE, HOPS ON and
          PEDALS LIKE MAD. As Coraline hurls a boot at him, he GUNS
          the motor and escapes down a side path past the driveway.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Crazy?... You're the jerk-wad that gave
                    me the doll!

          
          Out of breath, she turns away and notices her PARENTS'
          CAR parked to the side.

          

                                  CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Mom!   Dad!

          
          Excited, she hops over the fallen tree and runs to the
          car.

          

          

          INT. JONES' CAR - SAME

          Coraline, standing in the rain, excitedly looks through
          the car's window. But the car is EMPTY. She spots her
          mom's PHONE, then opens the door to grabs it and speed
          dial a number.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Pick it up, Dad, pick it up.

          

                                  CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    Hi!

          

                                  CORALINE
                    Dad!   Whe-

          

                                 CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    I'm digging in my garden right now, but
                    leave a message and I'll get right back
                    to you.

          
          She dejectedly looks at the phone, then snaps it shut.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Where have you gone?

          

          

          INT. SPINK AND FORCIBLE'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING


          
          Miss Spink is knitting a SWEATER WITH WINGS for a worried-
          looking ANGUS, one of the Scotties, who sits on her lap.

          
          Coraline sips tea, anxious, the other two DOGS beside
          her.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Uh... don't you only make wings for the
                    ... dead ones?

          

                                 MISS SPINK
                    Just looking ahead dear... Angus hasn't
                    been feeling very well of late.

          

                                 MISS FORCIBLE (O.S.)
                    April? Aren't you getting ready?

          

                                 MISS SPINK
                           (looks off camera)
                    We've lost our ride, Miriam. Caroline
                    says her parents have vanished, quite
                    completely.

          
          ANGLE ON Miss Forcible, tightening her elaborate corset
          behind a screen, using pulleys and hooks.

          

                                 MISS FORCIBLE
                    What?! We've waited months for those
                    tickets.

          
          One of the corset hooks FLIES UP and pulls off her wig.
          She ignores it and comes over to address Spink.

          

                                 MISS SPINK
                    I suppose we could walk!

          

                                 MISS FORCIBLE
                    With your gamy legs? It's nearly two
                    miles to the theater!

          
          Coraline CLEARS HER THROAT, frustrated.

          

                                 MISS SPINK
                    Oh, oh yes ... your missing parents. We
                    know just what you need. Miriam,
                    get...that's right.

          
          Miss Forcible grabs another dish of old stuck-together
          candy and puts it in front of Coraline.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    How is hundred-year-old candy going to

                    HELP--

          
          Miss Spink suddenly RAISES her KNITTING NEEDLES as if to
          STAB CORALINE. Coraline yelps, hands up in defense. But
          it's CANDIES she attacks, sending sticky chips flying,
          making loud grunts as she stabs.

          
          She pulls a LARGE, THREE-SIDED CANDY WITH A HOLE IT from
          the rubble and passes it to Coraline.

          

                                 MISS SPINK
                    There you go, sweety.

          
          Coraline studies the odd candy.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    What's it for?

          
          She holds it up, looks through its hole at the ladies.

          

                                 MISS SPINK
                    Well,it might help. They're good for bad
                    things, sometimes.

          

                                 MISS FORCIBLE
                    No, they're good for lost things.

          
          They don't look any different.

          

                                 MISS SPINK
                    It's bad things, Miriam.

          

                                 MISS FORCIBLE
                    Lost things, April.

          

                                 MISS SPINK
                    Bad.

          

                                  MISS FORCIBLE
                    Lost.

          

                                  MISS SPINK
                    Bad things!

          

                                  MISS FORCIBLE
                    Lost.

          

                                  MISS SPINK
                    Bad.

          

                                  MISS FORCIBLE
                    Lost.

          
          Coraline can't take anymore. She gets up, takes the odd
          piece of candy and leaves.

          

          

          INT. PARENT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT


          
          Coraline, dressed for bed with her blanket over her
          shoulder, walks into her parent's room, the PHOTO of her
          and her parents at the Bear Fountain in the foreground.

          
          She pulls down the bed covers and builds COPIES of her
          parents out of pillows. She fits an extra neck brace on
          one pillow head and some reading glasses on the other.
          Then Coraline lies down and pulls up the covers, very
          sad.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Good-night, Mom. Good-night, Dad.

          
          She kisses them both and BEGINS TO CRY. CAM PUSHES IN.

          

                                                         DISSOLVE TO:

          

          

          INT. PARENT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT, LATER


          
          Coraline, asleep. SOMETHING blurs past camera. One paw
          and then two paws bat her nose. She opens her eyes to
          find OPAL BLUE EYES staring at her. It's the BLACK CAT,
          purring loudly.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Hello. How did you get in?

          
          The cat yawns, his eyes flash.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Do you know where Mom and Dad are?

          
          The cat blinks. Then he heads out the door.

          

          

          INT. LOWER HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS


          
          She follows him, wrapped in her blanket, to the MIRROR at
          the end of the hallway. The mirror starts to GLOW and
          then an IMAGE FORMS within the glass. It's HER PARENTS!
          They cling together, blue with cold, as snow falls.

          

                                 CORALINE

                    MOM! DAD!!

          
          They look up and, with a desperate look, Mel BREATHES on
          the inside mirror-glass to fog it. She writes H E L P U
          S. ­ her fingertip squeaking on the glass like a SMALL,
          SAD BIRD. Frost RISES UP, hiding the letters and then her
          parents. The image fades.

          
          Coraline STRIKES AT THE MIRROR as hard as she can. GLASS
          SHATTERS and she drops to the ground, shaking. The cat
          nuzzles her..

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    How did this happen?

          

          

          INT. PARENT'S BEDROOM - SAME


          
          From under the bed, the cat drags out the BUTTON-EYED
          DOLL, REMADE into HER MOTHER on one side, and HER FATHER
          on the other!

          

                                 CORALINE
                    She's taken them.

          
          Coraline, enraged, THROWS the doll. FIRE LIGHT comes up
          on her face as the background DISSOLVES TO:

          

          

          INT. LIVING ROOM, FRONT OF FIREPLACE - SAME


          
          CLOSE ON DOLL: BURNING in the FIREPLACE.

          
          Coraline and cat watch until the fire burns out. She
          takes a breath and looks up at the mantel.

          
          ANGLE ON snowglobe, the one of the FOUNTAIN BEARS from
          the Detroit Zoo. Coraline cradles it, remembering.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    They're not coming back, are they ­ Mom
                    and Dad. Not on their own.

          
          The cat blinks. She looks over at the locked little door
          in the corner wall.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Only one thing to do.

          

                                                              CUT TO:

          

          

          INT CORALINE'S BEDROOM   - CONTINUOUS

          
          Series of quick shots of Coraline getting ready to go.
          Pulls her collecting bag from the closet, her puffy vest,
          her boots; grabs a candle and garden shears, puts them in
          the bag. She stands to go, taking her cap off the chair.
          The ODD PIECE OF CANDY, the triangle green one with the
          hole, drops to the floor. She hesitates a moment, then
          sticks it in her bag.

          

          

          INT. PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS


          
          We hear the click of the door being unlocked. It opens to
          reveal the cat, and - holding a lit candle - Coraline.
          She leaves the key in the lock, like always, takes a
          breath and crawls forward.

          
          The candle casts huge, flickering shadows along the wall.
          The cat, his voice returned, SPEAKS to her.

          

                                 CAT
                    You know, you're walking right into her
                    trap.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    I have to go back.

          
          With great feeling, she explains:

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    They are my parents.

          

                                 CAT
                    Challenge her then. She may not play
                    fair but she won't refuse. She's got a
                    thing for games.

          
          Coraline thinks about it, remembering.

          

                                   CORALINE
                    Hmmm, okay.

          
          The door at the end of the tunnel clicks open, the candle
          BLOWS OUT and the cat VANISHES IN THE DARK. Coraline
          tenses when a voice calls out.

          

                                   MOTHER
                    Coraline?

          

                                   CORALINE
                    Mom?

          
          There, framed in the open door, back-lit in blue,
          Coraline's REAL MOTHER, with neck brace and dressed in
          her shopping clothes, calls.

          

                                 MOTHER
                    Coraline, you came back for us!

          

                                   CORALINE

                             (RELIEVED)

                    MOM!

          
          She runs forward eagerly and--

          

          

          INT. OTHER LIVING ROOM - NIGHT


          
          --out the Other Little Door, throwing her arms out to hug
          her real Mom.

          

                                 MOTHER
                    Darling!
                           (voice shifting)
                    Why would you run away from me?

          
          Coraline sees her mother's hand GROW as it wraps around
          her. Alarmed, she PUSHES AWAY and sees the DECOY MOM grow
          into the TALL OTHER MOTHER.

          
          The room LIGHTS UP with the glowing bug furniture and a
          fireplace fire.

          
          Coraline tries her best to be brave.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Where are my parents?

          
          The Tall Other Mother's button eyes GLITTER.

          

                                 TALL OTHER MOTHER
                    Gosh, I have no idea where your "old"
                    parents are. Perhaps they've grown bored
                    of you and run away to France?

          
          Her teeth gleam.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    They weren't bored of me.   You stole
                    them!

          
          Other Father, a FOOT SHORTER than before, his sagging
          face a pale PUMPKIN color, his hair VINES, comes up
          behind Coraline.

          

                                 TALL OTHER MOTHER
                    Now, don't be difficult, Coraline. Have a
                    seat, won't you?

          
          Other Father, GURGLING happily, herds Coraline onto the
          walking bug chair.

          
          The Tall Other Mother, standing by the little door, turns
          to it and CLAPS her hands.

          
          A moment later, a HUGE RAT skitters out of the tunnel -
          FILLED AGAIN with spider webs and children's things -
          carrying the KEY from the real world door.

          
          The Tall Other Mother takes the key, locks the door, and -
          while the armoire bug assumes guard position - she

          SWALLOWS THE KEY.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (OFFHAND)
                    Why don't you have your own key?

          

                                 OTHER FATHER
                    Only one key.

          
          The Other Mother PULLS A VINE growing from his ear,

          SHUTTING HIS MOUTH.

          

                                 TALL OTHER MOTHER
                    Shhh!

                           (SUNNIER)
                    The garden squash need tending, don't you
                    think, pumpkin?

          
          She turns him around, her hands under his arms and drags
          him out.

          

                                 OTHER FATHER
                    Squish squash, pumpkin sauce...

          
          After a beat, Coraline hears the very faint SOUND OF A
          FINGER ON GLASS, just like when her mother wrote HELP on
          the mirror. Coraline jumps to her feet, looking around
          the room for a sign of her real parents.

          

                                 CORALINE
                           (loud whisper)
                    Mom, Dad, where'd she hide you?

          
          A muffled screen door slams O.S. and the Tall Other
          Mother calls to her from the kitchen.

          

                                 TALL OTHER MOTHER (O.S.)
                    Breakfast-time!

          
          Coraline leaves frame.

          

          

          INT. OTHER KITCHEN - NIGHT


          
          Coraline pauses in the doorway.

          

                                 CORALINE (V.O.)
                           (to herself)
                    Be strong, Coraline.

          
          She sits at the kitchen table in her regular place, her
          back to the sink.

          
          Tall Other Mother, humming happily, prepares a mushroom
          omelet and bacon. Fragrant cinnamon buns bake in the
          oven.

          
          At the table's center, Coraline sees the box with her
          BUTTON EYES with needle and thread. A bead of sweat rolls
          down her forehead. As casually as she can, she asks:

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                           (anxious, trying to be cool)
                    Why don't we play ... a game? I know you
                    like them.

          
          The Tall Other Mother's button eyes FLASH.

          

                                 TALL OTHER MOTHER
                    Everybody likes games.

          

                                    CORALINE

                           (NODS)
                    Uh huh.

          
          Bacon sizzles and spits on the stove.

          

                                 TALL OTHER MOTHER
                    What kind of game would it be?

          

                                 CORALINE)
                    An exploring game ... a finding things
                    game.

          
          Other Mother tries to act disinterested, but her fingers
          drum with excitement.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    And what is it you'd be finding,
                    Coraline?

          
          Coraline hesitates.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    My real parents.

          

                                 TALL OTHER MOTHER

                           (DISMISSIVE)
                    Too easy.

          
          She folds the omelet over in the pan.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    And, and the eyes of the ghost children.

          
          Tall Other Mother smiles: now it's getting interesting.

          

                                 TALL OTHER MOTHER
                    Huh.

          
          The meal ready, she turns from the stove and takes the
          food to Coraline.

          

                                 TALL OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D)
                    What if you don't find them?

          

                                 CORALINE
                    If I lose, I'll stay here with you
                    forever and let you love me.
                           (indicates button box)
                    And I'll let you sew buttons into my
                    eyes.

          

                                 TALL OTHER MOTHER
                    Hmmm... And if you somehow win this game?

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Then you let me go. You let everyone go ­
                    my real father and mother, the dead
                    children, everyone you've trapped here.

          
          The Tall Other Mother smiles a malicious not in a million
          years smile.

          

                                 TALL OTHER MOTHER
                    Deal.

          
          She holds out her hand. Coraline doesn't reach.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Not till you give me a clue.

          
          Tall Other Mother snorts, her smile sours. She slowly
          circles Coraline, and speaks as if talking to a very
          stupid child.

          

                                 TALL OTHER MOTHER
                    Oh, right... In each of three wonders
                    I've made just for you, a ghost's eye is
                    lost in plain sight.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    And for my parents?

          
          Tall Other Mother - standing behind her in front of the
          sink - smiles wickedly and just starts TAPPING HER BUTTON
          EYE with her finger nail. Coraline turns away from her.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)

                           (SHRUGS)
                    Fine. Don't tell me...

          
          Extending her hand, Coraline starts to turn back.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    ...it's a deal--

          
          But the Tall Other Mother HAS DISAPPEARED and the tapping
          now is the FAUCET DRIPPING in the sink.

          
          Coraline EXHALES, walks to the sink, stares at the
          dripping faucet.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    What does she mean "wonders?"

          
          Out the kitchen window, the FANTASTIC GARDEN LIGHTS UP,
          answering her question. She FURROWS HER BROWS, thinks
          this was too easy.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Hmmm.

          

                                                               CUT TO:

          

          

          EXT. OTHER GARDEN - SAME


          
          Coraline walks through the gates. The bright magic of the
          garden is DARKER NOW, with areas of black against areas
          of glowing flowers.

          
          She passes the PITCHER PLANTS, and the one with the frog
          suddenly SWALLOWS the animal.

          
          She goes up the steps past the BLEEDING HEARTS, which now
          LEAK STICKY RED JUICE that runs down the wall.

          
          At the top, a few SNAPDRAGONS, feeble now, SNAP at her.
          She KICKS them down. Behind her, a brick tree ring OPENS
          like a monster's MOUTH and five HUGE, PALE SNAPDRAGONS
          sneak towards her. They ATTACK, knock her to the ground,
          spilling her bag.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    No!!

          
          They GRAB CORALINE at her ankles, knees, hips, waist, and
          shoulder, and start to ROLL HER UP TOWARDS THE STONE

          MOUTH.

          
          Coraline is just able to GRAB her GARDEN SHEARS. She CUTS
          OFF one mutant snapdragon's head, then another, until she
          is free. The HEADLESS STEMS retreat into the rock mouth.

          
          Coraline, winded, goes to gather her spilled things when
          a trio of HUMMINGBIRDS/WASP HYBRIDS SWOOP IN. They don't
          attack her; instead they poke their long beaks into the
          TRIANGLE CANDY WITH THE HOLE and LIFT OFF.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Stop!!

          
          Coraline chases them, but they're getting away. As she
          crosses the little bridge, she takes off her cap and
          FLINGS IT LIKE A FRISBEE at them. SCORE! They fall to the
          ground, near the eyebrow shrubs, sawdust spilling out.
          She picks up the triangle candy.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Why steal this?

          
          With a look of what does she have to lose, she holds it
          up to her eye and GASPS.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Wow...

          
          EVERYTHING IS BLURRY GREY like a pencil drawing, all
          color gone. She scans the garden, turning slowly. As she
          turns back to where she started, she sees something,
          right in front of her: a BURNING RED EMBER -- A GHOST'S

          EYE!

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    That must be it.

          
          She lowers the stone from her eye, to see that the
          ghost's eye is the FADED STICK SHIFT KNOB from the
          preying mantis tractor, which STANDS RIGHT IN FRONT OF
          HER with the Other Father, a SQUAT PUMPKIN MAN, at its
          controls, his own hands IMPRISONED IN THE MECHANICAL

          PIANO HANDS.

          
          HEADLIGHTS GLARE and the tractor ROARS TO LIFE. The
          mechanical hands FORCE Other Father to SHIFT GEARS, and
          the tractor LURCHES at Coraline, its arms SLASHING. She
          yells, backs away. Other Father calls in a garbled voice:

          

                                 OTHER FATHER
                    Sorrry, so sorrry, Motherrr making meeee.

          
          Coraline backs onto the little bridge that spans the
          fountains as the tractor moves in.

          

                                 OTHER FATHER (CONT'D)
                    Don't waaaanno hurrrrrt you.

          
          The Other Father tries to steer the tractor away, but the
          mechanical hands are stronger. It moves onto the bridge -
          STUPIDLY SMASHING THROUGH THE PLANKS in front of it.
          Halfway over, it lurches, then STARTS TO FALL THROUGH THE
          HOLE IT HAS CREATED. The tractor hangs precariously for a
          moment.

          
          Other Father KICKS away one mechanical hand, and with ONE
          HAND FREE, manages to PULL OFF THE SHIFT KNOB.

          

                                 OTHER FATHER (CONT'D)
                    Taaaake it!!!!!

          
          Coraline DIVES FORWARD and just GETS THE KNOB before the
          tractor and Other Father fall away and SINK UNDER THE

          WATER.

          
          Rippling out from Coraline like a gray wave, the entire

          GARDEN BECOMES ASHEN AND DEAD.

          
          Coraline CATCHES HER BREATH, shaken. The ghost eye/gear
          knob GLOWS RED, no magic candy necessary.

          

                                 BOY GHOST
                    Bless you, miss, you found me! But
                    there's two eyes still lost.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Don't worry, I'm getting the hang of it!

          
          Coraline looks past the greyed garden towards the Other
          House. A LUNAR ECLIPSE has begun, the full moon a pale
          acid green.

          
          Coraline looks concerned, then resolved, and then she
          heads towards the house. A haunting version of Spink and
          Forcible's show song starts to play...

          

          

          EXT. OTHER HOUSE, STAIRWAY TO SPINK AND FORCIBLE'S - SAME


          
          CORALINE'S POV DOWN STAIRWAY: chaser lights circle the
          door at half-speed. Haunting show song continues.

          
          REVERSE ON Coraline. She carefully descends towards CAM.

          

          

          INT DOWNSTAIRS THEATRE - SAME

          
          WE SEE her flickering shadow and then Coraline appears
          behind the entry curtains. She steps close, pulls the
          curtain open. Song stops.

          
          POV ON THEATER, quiet and dark save for light coming
          through entry curtains. She spots usher's FLASHLIGHT on
          the ground.

          
          ON CORALINE - she picks it up, clicks it on, and STEPS
          FORWARD. She sweeps the light beam around, apprehensive,
          then HEARS SOMETHING overhead. She aims flashlight up and
          startles a NEST OF BAT-DOGS - half Scotties/half bats.
          One bares his teeth and GROWLS. She clicks off the light
          and shivers.

          
          On stage, one spotlight and footlights FADE UP on a huge,
          wrapped SALTWATER TAFFY. It hangs from ropes and
          sandbags.

          
          She cautiously climbs up onto the stage. A HUMAN-SIZED
          TAFFY THING - striped pale pink and green - can just be
          seen through the wrapper. She holds her TRIANGLE CANDY-
          WITH-HOLE to her eye. There is a BLUE-WHITE GLOW coming
          from inside the wrapper.

          
          Coraline PUNCHES A HOLE through the paper, steels
          herself, then reaches inside. She touches something
          sticky and cold and inhuman. Clenching her teeth, she
          grabs hold and pulls out two clasped-together COLD, TAFFY
          HANDS - Young Spink and Forcible's.

          
          Her heart thumps. She PRIES the TAFFY HANDS open like
          scallop shells until a large PEARL-on-a-ring is revealed.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (REALIZING)
                    The pearl!

          
          The hands suddenly GRAB HER! She SCREAMS. Young Spink and
          Forcible, twisted together into one taffy monster, THRUST

          THEIR HEADS FROM THE BAG!

          

                                 TAFFY MONSTER
                    Thief!! Give it back!

          
          Coraline PULLS AWAY, STRETCHING the candy arm out across
          the stage! The taffy monster THRUSTS OUT another paired
          arm, and starts DRAGGING ITSELF TOWARDS CORALINE, ropes
          swaying on pulleys.

          

                                 TAFFY MONSTER (CONT'D)
                           (in unison)
                    You thief! Thief! Thief! Thief! Give it
                    back! Thief! Give it back! Give it back!
                    Thief! Stop thief! Thief! Stop!

          
          Coraline, desperate, gets an idea. She clicks on her
          flashlight and aims it at the BAT-DOGS. They GROWL with
          annoyance, OPEN their wings.

          
          The taffy monster is GETTING CLOSER! Coraline hurls the
          flashlight at the bat-dogs and HITS THEM. Angered, they
          TAKE WING TO ATTACK HER - just like she planned!

          
          Bat-dogs are closing on the left, the taffy monster on
          the right! She waits to the very last second, and then

          DIVES OUT OF THE WAY!

          
          BAT-DOGS AND TAFFY MONSTER COLLIDE! Coraline's hand is
          released by the taffy hands, leaving her the PEARL. The
          bat-dogs and taffy monster - stuck together and still-as-
          stone - turn to dead, grey ash, as does the stage and
          theater.

          
          The PEARL in Coraline's hand PULSES BLUE.

          

                                 TALL GIRL GHOST (V.O.)
                    Hurry on, girl - her web is unwinding!

          
          Coraline nods, sticks the pearl in her bag, and looks up
          towards the ceiling and beyond.

          

          

          EXT. OTHER HOUSE/OTHER BOBINSKY'S BALCONY - SAME


          
          CORALINE'S MOVING POV, on lower ext stairs to UP ANGLE ON
          BALCONY. We hear haunting circus music in the air.

          
          Other Mr. B's Russian flag, TORN in places, waves in the
          air. The pale green moon is nearly HALF-ECLIPSED now with
          what is clearly the SHADOW OF A HUGE, DARK, BUTTON.

          
          ANGLE ON CORALINE as she climbs the last flight of stairs
          to Bobinsky's. She stops with a SHUDDER at the top. The
          flag has been replaced with the EMPTY COAT OF OTHER WYBIE-
          gloves, pants and sneakers pinned on - hanging like old
          laundry.

          

                                   CORALINE
                    Oh, Wybie...

          
          She takes a breath, leans out over the railing and
          shouts.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)

                    EVIL WITCH ... I'M NOT SCARED!

          
          The door behind her CREAKS open. Coraline shivers - she
          is definitely scared.

          

          

          INT. OTHER MR. B'S ATTIC FLAT - CONTINUOUS


          
          Coraline steps into the apartment and carefully shuts the
          door. The cannons and Ferris wheel are dark and quiet;
          the circus tent glows dimly. Pale green moonlight shines
          in patches through holes in the roof. The corners and
          edges of the room are very dark.

          
          OTHER BOBINSKY suddenly CRAWLS by the door behind her.
          Coraline whips around, on guard. He LOOMS UP past the
          cannons on her right, leaning towards her.

          

                                 OTHER MR. BOBINSKY
                    Hello, ga-LOO-boo-shka.

          
          There are too many joints in his arms and legs.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    I'm Coraline.

          
          His tall, crooked hat is pulled so low, and his collar so
          high, that his face is completely hidden.

          
          He throws out his arm towards her and the CIRCUS BALL
          from the mouse circus rolls from his sleeve to his hand.

          

                                 OTHER MR. BOBINSKY
                    Is dis vhat you're looking for?

          
          She looks through the hole of the triangle candy and sees
          an AMBER GLOW ­ the THIRD GHOST'S EYE!

          

                                   CORALINE
                    Uh-huh.

          
          She grabs for it, but he's too quick. He back-bends to
          all fours and SCUTTLES around her towards the back
          shadows.

          

                                 OTHER MR. BOBINSKY
                    You tink vinning game is goot ting?

          
          Coraline holds up the triangle candy, scans the room for
          him. His voice sounds distorted now.

          

                                 OTHER MR. BOBINSKY (O.S.)

                                 (CONT'D)
                    You'll just go home and be bored and
                    neglected...

          
          WE SEE him twine up a post behind Coraline, crawl out on
          a beam...

          

                                 OTHER MR. BOBINSKY

                                 (CONT'D)
                    ...same as alvays.

          
          He SWINGS UPSIDE-DOWN from his ankles, his head stopping
          right by Coraline's. She whips around, alarmed.

          He DROPS to the floor on his head, then SLITHERS into the
          circus tent. Coraline does not want to follow him. But
          she does.

          

          

          INT. CIRCUS TENT - CONTINUOUS


          
          The Other Mr. B is perched on a pile of MOLDY CHEESES in
          the center of the ring. He moves like all his bones are
          broken.

          

                                 OTHER MR. BOBINSKY
                    If you stay here, you can have vhatever
                    you vant, vsig-DA - alvays.

          
          Coraline raises the triangle candy to her eye, sees the
          AMBER GLOW coming from inside his hat.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    You don't get it, do you?

          
          She moves closer.

          

                                 OTHER MR. BOBINSKY
                    I don't understand.

          
          Small forms MOVE under the back of his coat.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Of course you don't understand. You're
                    just a copy she made of the real Mr. B.

          

                                 OTHER MR. BOBINSKY
                           (last breath)
                    Not even that anymore.

          
          Coraline pulls off his hat. Instead of his head, a HUGE
          PALE RAT SITS THERE - holding the circus ball. It barks
          at her then DIVES DOWN the coat collar.

          
          RATS leap from COAT SLEEVES and PANT LEGS, Coraline pulls
          back, HORRIFIED, as the clothes collapse, scanning around
          for the circus ball.

          
          There's a rat bark behind her and she turns. The HUGE RAT
          - balanced on a wheel of cheese, circus ball in paws -
          TAUNTS HER, then RUNS THE CHEESE OUT THE DOOR! She GIVES

          CHASE.

          

          

          INT. OTHER MR. B'S FLAT - CONTINUOUS


          
          The OTHER RATS RACE behind the twin rows of cannons - the
          cheese wheel rat rolls through them, heading towards the
          door!

          
          Coraline CHARGES. The cannons, manned by rats, FIRE
          COTTON CANDY at her. She's HIT in the side, her leg, her
          ribs; she weaves and STUMBLES, the shots landing like
          punches.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Ahhh! No!!

          
          A PET DOOR - perfectly shaped for the rat on the wheel -
          appears in the front door as the rat approaches.

          
          Coraline looks up to see the PET DOOR OPEN and the CHEESE-

          WHEEL RAT HEADING THROUGH IT TO THE OUTSIDE.

          
          Coraline takes her triangle candy stone and THROWS IT as
          hard as she can AT THE RAT.

          
          The whistling candy FLIES through the pet door towards
          the RAT, just outside.

          

          EXT. OTHER MR. B'S FLAT - CONTINUOUS


          
          The RAT DUCKS, the CANDY MISSES, and the cheese-wheel rat
          ESCAPES down the stairs with the ball.

          

          INT. OTHER MR. B'S FLAT - CONTINUOUS


          
          Coraline, lurching forward, HOLLERS.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)

                    NOOOO!

          
          Two waiting rats - tail tips tied - pull tails tight, and
          TRIP her. She CRASHES THROUGH THE DOOR AND--.

          

          

          EXT. OTHER HOUSE - CONTINUOUS


          
          --OUT onto the balcony which TEARS AWAY FROM THE HOUSE
          with ATTACHED STAIRWAY.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Noooo!

          
          The whole rig, with Coraline on top, ROTATES as it
          collapses, THROWING CORALINE toward the front of the
          house when it HITS THE GROUND. She BLACKS OUT a moment.

          
          WHEEZING for breath, Coraline pushes up on hands and
          knees and SCANS past the topiaries and poplars and white
          gravel driveway, looking for the cheese-wheel rat and
          circus ball. No cheese-wheel rat, no circus ball ghost
          eye.

          
          Coraline, lit by a NARROWING BAND of pale green light,
          turns to look at the moon. It's nearly covered now by the

          DARK BUTTON SHADOW.

          
          Her HAND stings from a scrape. BLOOD trickles from her
          knee. She feels nothing but COLD LOSS.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)

                           (DEVASTATED)
                    Oh God, I've lost the game; I've lost
                    everything.

          
          She sobs, hugs knees and face to chest. The band of light
          that illuminates her is narrowing to near-gone.

          
          In the foreground, the HEAD of the cheese-wheel rat -
          CIRCUS BALL IN ITS TEETH - DROPS ON THE GROUND. Sawdust
          leaks from its neck. Band of light STOPS NARROWING, the
          eclipse paused.

          
          There's a familiar MEROWWW and Coraline looks up.

          
          Across from her on the front yard, sits the BLACK CAT,
          licking his paws, rat's head and circus ball at his feet.

          

                                 CAT
                    I think I mentioned that I don't like
                    rats at the best of times.

          
          Coraline smiles, walks towards him.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    I think you might have said something
                    like that.

          

                                 CAT
                    It looked like you needed this one,
                    however.

          
          He bats the circus ball and it rolls to Coraline.

          
          She picks it up , sticks it in her bag. Around her, the

          YARD, HOUSE, TREES, SHRUBS AND DRIVEWAY TURN ASHEN GRAY.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Thank you.

          
          Looks towards house.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    I'm heading inside. I still have to find
                    my parents.

          

                                                              CUT TO:

          
          ANGLE ON MOON. The stalled eclipse STARTS AGAIN, and in
          one beat, the last sliver of green moon is FULLY BLACKED
          OUT. The EDGES of the button shadow start to FLAKE AWAY.

          
          ON CORALINE WITH CAT. A strange insect thrumming has
          begun. What appear to be grey paint chips or bits of
          paper are falling. Confused, she looks up to see:.

          
          The huge button shadow is EATEN TO NOTHING and then the
          SKY around it IS EATEN AS WELL, revealing dirty white
          light. The destruction TRAVELS from sky to the distant
          hills, the sound of a million, invisible locusts growing
          louder.

          
          UP ANGLE ON CAT AND CORALINE. The cat hisses. Deeply
          alarmed, they look from one direction to another.

          
          POV out front yard. The destruction TRAVELS up the
          driveway, PULLS APART the poplars, and then UNRAVELS the
          topiary elephant and bird.

          
          DOWN ANGLE ON Coraline and cat, his TAIL TWITCHING. WE
          PULL BACK to find they are at the center of a RAPIDLY

          SHRINKING ISLAND!

          
          NEW ANGLE on Coraline and cat as ground beneath their
          feet STARTS CRACKING, white light coming through. Cat
          makes a fearful sound, afraid for the first time in the
          movie!

          
          Coraline holds out her arms to the trembling animal, her
          guardian angel.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Come on, quickly!

          
          The cat LEAPS and she catches him, then CARRIES HIM up
          the DISINTEGRATING porch steps to the front door. She
          gets through just in time, and SLAMS it shut!

          

          

          INT. OTHER HOUSE HALLWAY - SAME


          
          It's dark and stable in here, with just some creaks and
          intermittent vibrations. A poisonous green light spills
          from the other living room.

          
          Coraline goes there, carrying the cat over her shoulder,
          past wallpaper that PEELS UP as she passes, to the room
          where she last heard the sound of her mother's finger on
          glass.

          

          

          INT. OTHER LIVING ROOM - SAME


          
          A poisonous GREEN FIRE - LIKE SLEEPY SEA SNAKES - BURNS
          in the fireplace. The bug furniture looks grey now, their
          lights flickering as if short-circuited; legs and wings
          twitching uncontrollably.

          
          Coraline scans the walls, the ceiling, looking for a sign
          of her parents.

          
          ANGLE ON CORALINE in foreground. She senses the Other
          Mother behind her, a creature who is no sort of Mother at
          all but a witch, a Beldam. She turns.

          
          The Beldam is hunched on the sofa - her face hidden.

          

                                 BELDAM
                    So, you're back....

          
          Her voice sounds dry and tired. She turns her face
          towards Coraline. It is a WHITE DEATH MASK, cracked and
          peeling - her true face.

          

                                 BELDAM (CONT'D)
                    And you brought vermin with you.

          
          Coraline shudders and steps back. The cat makes a fearful
          sound and digs his claws into her shoulder.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    No, I ... I brought a friend.

          
          The Beldam rises up 12 FEET TALL. She is WITHERED to the
          bone; with plate-like shoulders and hips; her bustle now
          an arachnid's tail section. Her true form.

          
          She reaches her long, sharp FINGERS MADE OF NEEDLES to
          Coraline's face.

          

                                 BELDAM

                           (FLATLY)
                    You know I love you.

          
          Coraline works hard to not show how freaked out she is.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    You, you have a very funny way of showing
                    it.

          
          The Beldam smiles, turns away, then back, her hand
          outstretched.

          

                                    BELDAM
                    So?     Where are they - the ghost eyes?

          
          Coraline pulls out the three spheres from her bag and
          starts to hand them over. But she catches herself.

          

                                   CORALINE
                    Hold on.

          
          And pulls back.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    We aren't finished yet, are we?

          
          The Beldam looks daggers, then smiles sweetly.

          

                                 BELDAM
                    No, I suppose not. After all, you still
                    need to find your old parents, don't you?
                    Too bad you won't have this.

          
          She produces the TRIANGLE CANDY that Coraline lost and
          FLINGS it into the green fire. The Beldam laughs while
          the MAGIC BURNS out of the candy with sparks and pops.

          
          ON CORALINE. The third ghost eye PULSES WITH AMBER LIGHT
          in her hand. Coraline turns away, so the witch won't see.

          

                                 SWEET GIRL GHOST (O.S.)
                    Be clever, miss; even if you win she'll
                    never let you go!

          
          Coraline looks towards the locked little door behind the
          armoire bug and understands: she's got to get the Beldam
          to unlock it! She furrows her brow as an idea comes to
          her then nods.

          
          She turns to the witch and in the most confident tone she
          can muster, says:

          

                                 CORALINE
                    I already know where you've hidden them.

          
          The Beldam turns from the fire, both concerned and
          sceptical.

          

                                 BELDAM
                    Well... produce them.

          
          Coraline points to the little door.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    They're behind that door.

          
          The Beldam leans close, knowing Coraline is wrong, and
          speaks very quietly.

          

                                 BELDAM
                    Oh, they are, are they?

          
          A smile creeps onto her terrible face. And she STARTS
          TOWARDS THE LITTLE DOOR, moving in an odd, laboring way,
          as if she had four legs instead of two. She signals the
          armoire bug to stand aside, her back to Coraline.

          
          Coraline hears the soft chirp of her mother's finger on
          wet glass! Looks around, desperate - where is it coming
          from?!

          
          The cat's ears twitch and focus, and then he SEES
          SOMETHING on the mantel!. He whispers to Coraline --

          

                                 CAT
                    There!

          
          -- and JUMPS to land beside the DETROIT ZOO SNOW-GLOBE -

          OPAQUE WITH FROST.

          
          C.U. ON SNOW-GLOBE. With a SOFT-CHIRP, a section of glass
          is WIPED CLEAR from inside by a TINY FOREARM - and we see
          the tiny, cold figures that are CORALINE'S TRAPPED
          PARENTS! Coraline's heart races. She purposely stays back
          from them.

          

                                  CORALINE

                            (WHISPERING)
                    Mom.   Dad!

          
          ON BELDAM, by little door. Oblivious to Coraline's
          discovery, she COUGHS up the KEY into her hand. She turns
          to Coraline, expectantly.

          

                                  CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Go on.   Open it. They'll be there, all
                    right.

          
          The Beldam stoops to push the key into the lock, turns
          it, leaves the key in place.

          
          She grins at Coraline and speaks in a low, sing-song
          voice.

          

                                 BELDAM
                    You're wrong, Coraline!

          
          She opens the little door, revealing the empty, spider-
          web tunnel.

          
          ON CORALINE, who glances from the open door to the cat -
          obscured on the mantel - and back to the Beldam. She's
          thinking very hard.

          

                                 BELDAM (CONT'D)

                           (PITYING)
                    They aren't there.

          
          She opens her hands: one holds box with Coraline's BLACK
          BUTTON EYES, the other a THREADED NEEDLE. Triumphant, the
          Beldam softly gloats:

          

                                 BELDAM (CONT'D)
                    Now you're going to stay here forever.

          
          Coraline strikes a warrior's pose, and, summons all the
          fury she can.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    No ... I'm ...

          
          She GRABS THE CAT off the mantel and RAISES HIM OVER HER

          HEAD.

          

                                  CORALINE (CONT'D)

                    NOT!

          
          And she HURLS THE CAT at the Beldam. The YOWLING ANIMAL -
          face shocked with surprise - SAILS through the air and
          lands RIGHT ON THE ASTONISHED WITCH'S HEAD.

          
          FREAKED-OUT, the cat DIGS in his CLAWS AND BITES the
          shrieking Beldam, who STAGGERS to one side of the little
          door.

          
          Coraline GRABS the SNOW GLOBE with her parents inside,
          stows it in her bag, and moves out to approach the door
          from the other side.

          
          The Beldam FLAILS WILDLY at the cat. The cat HOWLS LIKE A
          BANSHEE, RAISES HIS CLAWS, and - quick as you can - TWO

          SHINY BLACK BUTTONS HIT THE FLOOR - THE BELDAM'S EYES!

          
          ANGLE ON CAT as he's thrown on armoire bug.

          
          ON BELDAM, hands covering her face.

          

                                  BELDAM

                    NOOOOOOOOO!

          
          Her hands pull away to show EMPTY, FLAT SOCKETS and TORN

          THREAD!

          

                                 BELDAM (CONT'D)
                    You horrible cheating girl!

          
          She furiously STOMPS the floor which FLIES UP in a spiral
          of floorboards that drive Coraline to the room's center.
          A huge WEB TRAP LIES BENEATH THE FLOOR!

          
          The web trap STRETCHES DOWN into a FIFTY FOOT DEEP PIT.
          There is nothing beyond but PALE NOTHINGNESS.

          
          The cat scrambles along the tops of falling furniture
          straight to the little door and disappears into the
          tunnel.

          
          Coraline falls the very bottom of the web.

          
          Fifty feet above, the Beldam LAUGHS MANIACALLY and LEAPS
          DOWN like a huge, flying spider!

          
          Coraline manages to pull herself to the outside of the
          trap JUST AS THE BELDAM LANDS.

          
          The witch - furious her prey has escaped - spins around,
          grasping blindly.

          

                                 BELDAM (CONT'D)
                    Noo!! Where are you? You selfish brat!!

          
          Coraline, nearing the top, looks up and spots the LITTLE
          DOOR, still in the corner wall of the Other Living Room.
          She goes to climb back inside the web, when her bag GETS
          CAUGHT on a barb. She pulls and pulls until it breaks
          free, sending a STRONG VIBRATION DOWN THE SPIRALING WEB

          TO THE VERY SENSITIVE HAND OF THE BELDAM.

          

                                  BELDAM (CONT'D)
                    Hahahaha...

          
          The Beldam smiles - she knows where her prey is now!

          
          Coraline makes it to the little door, but the BELDAM IS

          COMING UP BEHIND HER VERY FAST!

          

                                 BELDAM (O.S.) (CONT'D)

                    YOU ... DARE ...

          

          

          INT. PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS


          
          Coraline SCRAMBLES through the door, KEY IN HAND, and
          grabs the door's handle. Before she can shut it, the

          BELDAM'S HEAD THRUSTS INSIDE.

          

                                 BELDAM

                    ... DISOBEY YOUR MOTHER??!!

          
          Coraline KICKS HER IN THE FACE, knocking her back. The
          cat takes off down the tunnel.

          
          Coraline nearly shuts the door, when NEEDLE FINGERS GRAB
          HOLD THROUGH THE CRACK. The door STARTS TO PULL OPEN!

          

                                 CORALINE

                    PLEASE...SHUT!!

          
          The ghost children's FLUTTERY, DISMEMBERED HANDS FLY OUT
          FROM HER BAG and GRAB HOLD OF CORALINE'S HANDS that grip
          the door's handle. And her STRENGTH IS QUADRUPLED.

          
          The door STARTS TO SHUT. The Beldam SNATCHES DESPERATELY
          at Coraline, reaching through the closing gap with one
          thin claw. There's a final moment of resistance - the
          Beldam's wire-thin wrist caught in the door - and then
          SNAP! The DOOR SHUTS, and the Beldam's hand drops to the
          ground!

          
          She SCREECHES like a metal rake on pavement!

          
          Coraline just manages to lock the door in the dark when
          it is POUNDED from the other side, green light coming
          through cracks! She takes off down the tunnel, stooped
          down, as fast as she can.

          
          The pounding grows more insistent, green light flashing.

          

                                 BELDAM (O.S.)

                    DON'T LEAVE ME! DON'T LEAVE ME!!! I'LL

                    DIE WITHOUT YOU!!!!

          
          And then the tunnel behind coraline STARTS TO GROW
          SHORTER, like a collapsing accordion and the pounding far
          door with the blind, one-handed Beldam on the other side

          STARTS TO CATCH UP TO HER!

          
          Ahead, DAYLIGHT APPEARS, and then the LITTLE DOOR TO THE

          REAL WORLD!

          

          

          INT. REAL LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS


          
          Coraline FLINGS HERSELF through the doorway, SHUTS AND
          LOCKS THE DOOR and BRACES HERSELF AGAINST IT. A split-
          second later, the OTHER WORLD DOOR CATCHES UP WITH A
          CRASH! Coraline is THROWN BACK. But the real-world door
          and lock, hold. It's over...

          
          Coraline lies on her back, as beat-up and tired as she's
          ever been, GULPING in breaths of air till her heart slows
          a little. The room is brightly lit by sunlight, the first
          since she moved here, and the sky out the windows is blue
          with white clouds.

          
          She smiles, remembering, and turns to her bag with the
          ghost eyes and snow globe with her parents inside.

          
          She opens it up, and searches, shoving aside ghost eyes
          and garden shears. But the snow globe is GONE!

          
          She gets on all fours, starts searching the floor. Her
          hand hits a small PUDDLE by the fireplace, with tiny
          bits of BLUE SNOW. A drip plops down, then another. She
          looks up to the mantel and spots the MISSING SNOW GLOBE.
          She stands up and finds that it's BROKEN OPEN, and
          neither her parents or the fountain bears are inside.

          
          As the last of the snowy liquid drains from the globe,
          Coraline's face clouds with confusion and fear: What does
          this mean and where are her parents? Then her WONDERFULLY
          REAL MOTHER calls to her.

          

                                 MEL (O.S.)
                    Coraline? We're home!

          
          Her TRUE PARENTS enter the room from the hallway, a
          dusting of snow on their shoulders and hair.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Mom! Dad! I missed you so much!

          
          Coraline runs to her parents and throws her arms around
          them.

          

                                   MEL
                    Missed us?

          
          C.U. ON CORALINE. Huh?

          
          Mel notices the broken snow globe.

          

                                 MEL (CONT'D)
                    Oh no, you broke my favorite snow globe.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    I didn't break it. It must've broke when
                    you escaped.

          
          Mom spots her bloody knee.

          

                                 MEL
                    And cut your knee.

          
          Charlie crouches low, clutching his briefcase.

          

                                 CHARLIE
                    Coraline, I asked you to count all the
                    windows, not put your knee through them.

          

                                   CORALINE

                    BUT-

          
          Mel tells her.

          

                                 MEL
                    Well, get yourself cleaned up,

                           (WARMS)
                    we're going out tonight.

          

                                 CHARLIE
                    We gotta lot to celebrate!

          
          Coraline, confused, takes a stab.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    You're talking about... your garden
                    catalog?

          

                                 MEL
                    Of course! What else?

          
          Her parents turn to leave the room.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    But look at the snow on your clothes...?

          
          But the snow melts without a trace.

          

                                 MEL

                           (CONFUSED)
                    What's gotten into you, Coraline?

          
          Her parents walk off. Coraline shrugs her shoulders and
          looks back to the broken snow globe on the mantel. She
          cocks her head, deeply puzzled, then leaves the room.

          

                                                          DISSOLVE TO:

          

          

          EXT HOUSE - NIGHT, SKY CLEAR

          
          The VW is parked out front, its interior light fading as
          light in Coraline's bedroom window switches on. We HEAR
          Charlie make a strangled sound.

          

          

          INT. CORALINE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT FULL MOON RISING


          
          Coraline sits in bed -- pajamas washed and PATCHED,
          wounds-dressed, hair shining. The KEY hangs from a string
          around her neck. A gibbous moon shines in the clear night
          sky.

          
          Charlie wrestles with a blue stuffed-toy squid like it's
          an alien face-hugger then, FEIGNING DEATH, falls on the
          bed. Coraline LAUGHS.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    So, gonna order the tulips?

          
          He opens one eye, pretends he's never heard about this.

          

                                   CHARLIE
                    What's that?

          

                                 CORALINE
                    For the garden party!!

          
          He sits up and kids her, tickling her face with the
          squid.

          

                                 CHARLIE
                    I have no idea what you're talking about.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Dad!

          
          She turns to Mom, arranging things on a shelf.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    So, Mom. Invitations? Don't forget the
                    invitations.

          
          Her mother nods, points up.

          

                                 MEL
                    Even Bobinsky?

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Mr. B's not drunk, Mom, he's
                    just...eccentric.

          
          Charlie LAUGHS. He bends down to kiss her.

          

                                 CHARLIE
                    Good night, Coraline.

          
          As he steps away, Mel slips a slim box under the covers
          next to her daughter. She gives Coraline a "told you so"
          look, and she and Charlie leave the room.

          
          Coraline sits up excitedly and opens the box - it's the
          GREEN AND ORANGE GLOVES she'd wanted! She pulls one on to
          admire when the BLACK CAT appears outside her window

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Oh, hello again.

          
          She walks over to the window, opens it.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    You still mad?

          
          His expression says yes, he's still mad.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    I'm really sorry I threw you at her - the
                    Other Mother? ­ it was all I could think
                    of.

          
          The cat's angry expression softens. He rests his head on
          her hand, licking her fingers and purrs.

          
          Coraline exhales with relief then picks him up and
          carries him over to her bed.

          
          She grabs her collecting bag and takes out the large
          PEARL, the CIRCUS BALL, and the GREY STICKSHIFT KNOB. She
          holds them out to the cat.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    I think it's time, don't you? To set them
                    free?

          
          The cat nods. She puts the ghost eyes under her pillow
          and gently lays down, the cat lying beside her. The two
          of them close their eyes, and in no time at all, they
          doze off to sleep. WE SLOWLY TILT UP.

          

                                             MATCH MOVE DISSOLVE TO:

          

          

          EXT. DREAMSCAPE - MAGIC TIME


          
          A MAGIC ART SKY animates subtly.

          
          CAM TILT DOWN ON Coraline, studying sky, her back to us.
          From behind CAM, CHIMES sound and GOLD LIGHT begins to
          shine on her. She turns toward us, shielding her eyes.

          
          Coraline's eyes adjust to the brightness to see the THREE
          GHOST CHILDREN, now transformed into GOLDEN ANGELS; EYES
          RESTORED, small fluttering WINGS ON THEIR BACKS.

          

                                 SWEET GIRL GHOST
                    It's a fine, fine thing you did for us,
                    miss.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Well, I'm glad it's finally over!

          
          A SHADOW crosses the faces of the three children. They
          gather around Coraline and bow their heads.

          

                                 SWEET GIRL GHOST

                           (SIGHS)
                    It is over and done with ... for us.

          
          Silent beat.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    What about...me?

          
          The tall girl ghost shifts uncomfortably, then BLURTS

          OUT:

          

                                 TALL GIRL GHOST
                    You're in terrible danger, girl!

          
          Coraline is stunned and gestures for an explanation.

          

                                  CORALINE
                    But how?   I locked the door!?

          

                                 SWEET GIRL GHOST
                    It's the key, miss, there's only one and
                    the Beldam will find it.

          
          The KEY ON THE STRING around Coraline's neck floats out
          in front of Coraline. She grabs it.

          
          The three ghost children all embrace Coraline tenderly.

          

                                 BOY GHOST

                           (WHISPERS)
                    Tain't all bad, miss. Thou art alive ...
                    thou art still ... living...

          
          They begin to swirl around her, spinning faster and
          faster. Coraline starts to turn and then she --

          

                                                               CUT TO:

          

          

          INT. CORALINE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT


          

          -- ROLLS HERSELF AWAKE IN HER OWN BED. FAST PULL BACK
          above her to find covers thrown off and the CAT awake by
          her side.

          
          Coraline lifts up her pillow and GASPS - the GHOST EYES
          ARE IN PIECES like hatched bird eggs. She takes out the
          key on its string and explains to the cat, her voice

          PANICKED:

          

                                 CORALINE
                    I -- I've gotta hide this somewhere, s-
                    somewhere she can never ...

          
          The cat doesn't like the sound of this. Coraline grabs
          her blanket and heads to her door. But the cat leaps down
          and blocks her way.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Outta my way!

          
          She sidesteps the cat and leaves her room. The cat glares
          after her

          

          INT. HOUSE STAIRWAY, LOWER HALL, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS


          
          Coraline trots down the stairs and purposefully heads
          down the hall. She passes the LIVING ROOM and exits
          frame. CAMERA stays on living room, where, on the LITTLE
          DOOR in the corner wall, SHADOWS and LIGHT start to MOVE.

          WE ROCKET IN AND--

          

                                                         JUMP CUT TO:

          

          

          INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS


          
          The baseboard is PUSHED ASIDE. Through the narrow gap at
          the door's bottom, the DISMEMBERED HAND OF THE BELDAM
          CRAWLS OUT. It scrambles out of frame in the direction of
          Coraline!

          

          

          EXT ROCKY PATH HIGH ABOVE HOUSE - SAME

          
          Coraline moves briskly, the house below, GRIPPING THE KEY
          that's tied round her neck. DARK, ROPEY CLOUDS reach like
          fingers across the gibbous moon. Coraline sings her
          father's nonsense song, her voice hardly trembling.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Oh.... my twitchy witchy girl,
                    I think you are so nice ...

          

          

          EXT. ORCHARD - SAME


          
          She moves down past the old fruit trees, now covered with
          BRIGHT SPRING BLOSSOMS that fall gently like snow.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    ... I give you bowls of porridge
                    And I give you bowls of ice cream.

          
          LOW ANGLE ON Coraline, moving away. The BELDAM'S HAND
          drops into frame and CREEP-CRAWLS after her.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    I give you lots of kisses,
                    And I give you lots of hugs ...

          

          

          EXT. WELL - SAME


          
          Coraline jams the SAME DEAD BRANCH Wybie used under the
          well's cover, lining it up over the SAME FULCRUM ROCK.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    ... But I never give you sandwiches
                    With grease and worms and mung beans.

          
          Circling around behind the BIG STUMP, the HAND SCAMPERS
          behind one rock to a bush to a tree, coming closer.

          
          Coraline manages to lever the well's cover off to one
          side, leaving the WHOLE WELL OPEN. Huffing and sweating,
          she wipes her brow, then takes the key string that's
          around her neck.

          
          The hand, SEEING what is about to happen, RACES TOWARDS

          HER!

          
          Coraline lifts string and key, not quite over her head.

          
          The hand JUMPS onto the big stump and SPRINGS through the
          air to GRAB THE KEY and PULL CORALINE TO THE GROUND!

          
          Coraline makes a CHOKED SCREAM, her fingers caught
          between the key string and her neck!

          
          The HAND wants to DRAG HER BACK TO THE HOUSE and the

          LITTLE LOCKED DOOR THAT IS BREATHING WITH ANTICIPATION!

          
          A BLINDING HEADLIGHT hits HAND and CORALINE; an AIR HORN
          SOUNDS; and WYBIE LOVAT - hollering a BATTLE CRY all his
          own - comes SPEEDING DOWN THE BLUFF on his whining
          electric bike!

          

                                  WYBIE

                    YAHHHHH!!!!

          
          Wybie GUNS the throttle, and, leaning out, GRABS the
          confused HAND with his slug tongs!

          
          He CIRCLES AROUND and HEADS TOWARDS THE WELL, readying to
          throw the hand in. But the HAND GETS FREE, and GRABS his
          handlebars.

          
          OUT OF CONTROL, Wybie's bike HITS A ROCK, and WYBIE AND
          HAND ARE THROWN RIGHT DOWN THE WELL. HOLLERING, he just
          manages to hang on with one hand! The Beldam's hand,
          caught on Wybie's coattail, SCRAMBLES UP his body and
          face and onto the well's edge where it STABS AT HIS
          FINGERS to make him fall!

          

                                 WYBIE (CONT'D)

                           (STRUGGLING)
                    Get off!!

          
          Coraline, choking, rises to her feet. She grabs her
          BLANKET and - in the still-blazing headlight of the
          crashed bike - she RUNS UP and THROWS IT OVER THE HAND.
          It fights like crazy as Coraline wrestles to control it.
          The hand STABS THROUGH THE BLANKET and SHAKES IT OFF. It
          crouches to attack her!

          
          And then WYBIE IS BACK, pumped with adrenaline, a BIG
          ROCK raised over his head! He HURLS IT DOWN ON THE
          LEAPING HAND! And it BREAKS into TWENTY LIFELESS NEEDLES.

          
          Wybie struggles to catch his breath. Coraline - breathing
          hard - removes the key and string from around her sore
          neck. She pulls up the corners of her blanket - with the
          needles on it - around the rock, and ties it all together
          with the string. The key is left attached.

          
          The two friends carry the heavy package to the well and
          DROP IT DOWN THE HOLE. By the light of a stray moonbeam,
          they watch and listen until it makes a muffled splash in
          the dark water at the bottom. They slide the well cover
          in place.

          
          Still catching his breath, Wybie stands, holding his
          injured hand, its glove ripped by the Beldam's claw. He
          looks over at Coraline as the scene brightens a little
          with moonlight.

          

                                 WYBIE (CONT'D)
                    I-I'm really sorry I didn't believe you
                    about all this ... evil stuff, Coraline.

          
          Coraline, shoulders rising as she catches her breath,
          stands and smiles: he called her by real name for the
          first time.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Why did you change your mind?

          
          He walks over, and takes out an old B&W photo from his
          jacket.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    W-well, Gramma showed me this picture,
                    after I called you crazy?

          
          He hands it to her.

          
          ANGLE ON PHOTO: two light-skinned black girls - dressed
          in old-fashioned clothing - stand in front of the Pink
          Palace, before it was divided into apartments. One looks
          just like the sweet ghost girl, and holds the DOLL WITH
          BUTTON EYES, which looks just like her.

          

                                 WYBIE (O.C.) (CONT'D)
                    It's her and her sister, before she
                    disappeared.

          
          ANGLE ON WYBIE AND CORALINE. Behind them, blossoms fall
          like snow in the orchard.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    The sweet ghost girl.

          
          Wybie's grandmother, loud and worried, calls from the
          distance.

          

                                  WYBIE'S GRANDMOTHER (O.C.)
                    Wyborne!   Come home!!

          

                                 WYBIE
                           (re: his grandmother)
                    Oh, man...what am I going to tell her?

          
          She looks up from the photo and smiles.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Just bring her by the house tomorrow.      We
                    can tell her together.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    We...we can??

          

                                 CORALINE
                    You know, I'm glad you decided to stalk
                    me.

          
          She gives Wybie a playful punch on the arm and LAUGHS.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    Wasn't my idea.

          
          The BLACK CAT jumps up on the TREE STUMP and MEROWWS.
          Coraline smiles.

          
          We TILT UP to the sky and see the last ropey clouds -
          like two clawed hands - clear away from the bright
          gibbous moon.

          

                                                          DISSOLVE TO:

          

          

          EXT HOUSE, GARDEN - DAY

          
          One WHITE BALLOON floats against a blue sky with puffy,
          white clouds. WE TILT DOWN past more balloons to a TABLE
          OF REFRESHMENTS, set up by the front gates.

          
          Coraline picks up a TRAY OF DRINKS and heads out to her
          hard-working GUESTS, all wearing garden gloves and
          showing signs of having helped plant about TWO HUNDRED

          RED TULIPS.

          
          SPINK AND FORCIBLE, along with their DOGS, are set up at
          a table below the steps. Empty plant cartons are stacked
          nearby along with some garden tools and empty bags of
          peat moss.

          

                                    CORALINE
                       Thanks for helping me, Miss Spink, Miss
                       Forcible.

          

                                    MISS FORCIBLE
                              (straining to see)
                       Oh, look April - Pink Ladies!

          

                                    CORALINE
                       Actually, it's just lemonade.

          
          Coraline hands them the beverages, then nods towards the
          GREY DOG digging in the flowers.

          

                                    CORALINE (CONT'D)
                       How's Angus doing?

          
          Miss Spink sighs.

          

                                    MISS SPINK
                       Oh, much better, dear... But he can't
                       duck his wings forever!

          
          Coraline heads up the steps to find her PARENTS dumping a
          heavy bag of PEAT MOSS around the dead-looking tree in
          the stone circle.

          

                                    CHARLIE
                       Here comes a burp.

          
          Charlie BURPS.

          

                                    MEL

                              (SCOLDING)
                       Charlie!

          

                                    CHARLIE
                       Oh, excu-say-moi, but that pizza was
                       delicious.

          
          Mel SIGHS.

          

                                      CORALINE
                       Cold drinks?

          
          Charlie nods, grabs them for Mel and Wybie.

          

                                 CHARLIE

                           (HAPPILY)
                    Oh yeah, great!

          

                                 MEL

                           (SKEPTICAL)
                    You were right, Coraline. I really hate
                    dirt, but the tulips look nice.

          

                                   CORALINE
                    Thanks, mom.

          
          Coraline, delighted, moves on.

          
          Coraline comes upon Bobinsky in the bottom of the drained
          fish pond. He's stealthily PULLING just-planted tulips
          from the dirt there, and putting BEETS in their place.

          

                                 MR. BOBINSKY (O.S.)
                           (pulling beets)
                    Ooo, dret nican...neit, neit...da, da, dat iz
                    possible.

          
          Coraline CLEARS HER THROAT to get his attention.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    How are the meeshkas, Mr. B?

          
          Surprised and looking very guilty, he tries to cover up
          his activities. She smiles and hands him a drink.

          

                                 MR.   BOBINSKY

                           (SMILES)
                    Dey tell me that   you - are saviour,

                    dey vish to give   special tenks-you
                    performance.

          
          He drains his glass of lemonade. A familiar voice is
          heard approaching. Coraline turns and smiles.

          Coraline sees them and waves.

                    Welcome, Ms. Lovat!

          
          The old lady looks up and smiles.

          

                                  WYBIE'S GRANDMOTHER
                    Oh, hello.

                    Of course!

          
          CAMERA PULLS UP from the GARDEN, FLIES OVER THE HOUSE and
          BOOMS DOWN to the PINK PALACE APARTMENTS SIGN out front.
          On top of the sign sits the black cat, who looks right
          into camera, blinks, then walks behind the thin post that
          holds the sign and DISAPPEARS.

          A cave painting of the Dreamworks logo. Push past the
          moon to the sun. Bright. Beautiful. The sun DISSOLVES
                         TO:

                         
          Cave paintings of a family of cavemen -- we will come to
          know them as The Croods.
                         
                          EEP (V.O.)
           With every sun comes a new day. A new
           beginning. A hope that things will be
           better today than they were yesterday.
                         
          The Croods scurry out of their cave like mice looking for
          food. Scared. Fast.
                         
          The Croods are chased by beasts across the desert. They
          escape from creatures up trees. They hide behind rocks.
                         
                          EEP (V.O.)
           But not for me. My name's Eep. This, is
           my family, the Croods. If you weren't
           clued in already by the animal skins and
           sloping foreheads - we're cavemen. Most
           days we spend in our cave, in the dark.
           Night after night, day after day. Yep.
           Home sweet home. When we did go out, we
           struggled to find food in a harsh and
           hostile world. And I struggled to
           survive my family.
                         
          The Croods are chased by beasts across the desert. They
          escape from creatures up trees. They hide behind rocks.

                          EEP (V.O.)
           We were the last ones around. There used
           to be neighbors. The Gorts, smashed by a
           mammoth. The Horks, swallowed by a sand
           snake. The Erfs, mosquito bite. Throgs,
           common cold. And, the Croods. That's
           us. The Croods made it...
                         
          Grug protects his family from a GIANT BEAR OWL.
                         
                          EEP (V.O.)
           Because of my Dad. He was strong... and
           he followed the rules.
                         
          A shadow falls across their feet and Grug ushers his
          family home.

          2.
                         
                         
                          EEP (V.O.)
           ... the ones painted on the cave walls.
           Anything new is bad, curiosity is bad,
           going out at night is bad. Basically,
           anything fun is bad. Welcome to my
           world.
                         
          They all run back into the cave where Grug slams the rock
          door closed.
                         
          SLOWLY LIGHT ON CAVE PAINTINGS COMES UP AGAIN. But this
          time the light casts an ominous tone.
                         
                          EEP (V.O.)
           But this is a story about how all that
           changed in an instant.
                         
          RAPID SHOTS OF THE GREAT SPLIT CUTTING THROUGH THE LAND.
          HEADED TOWARDS CROOD VALLEY.
                         
          SHOTS OF CATACLYSM. CUT FASTER AND FASTER UNTIL...
                         
                          EEP (V.O.)
           Because what we didn't know, was that our
           world was about to come to an end. And
           there were no rules on our cave walls to
           prepare us for that.
                         
          CAVEMAN HANDS PRESS against the rock wall. They PUSH. A
          BLINDING LIGHT FLOODS the screen.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          SEQ. 100 - MEET THE CROODS
          A HUGE CAVEMAN, GRUG, RUSHES forward, screaming,
          growling, and throwing handfuls of dirt in a THREAT
          DISPLAY. He BLINKS in the bright morning light. He
          LIFTS and HURLS a large boulder.
                         
                          GRUG
           Raaaaar grooooOOOOoooowwwll ERF ERF
           Glaaaaaabbbbllllllllthhhh!
                         
          As suddenly as he began, Grug stops. Panting, he waits
          for the echoes of his outburst to fade.
                         
          Grug TURNS to the cave entrance, he prepares to BELLOW a
          signal, but before any sound escapes his lips--
                         
          A CAVE GIRL, EEP, bursts from the cave.
          3.
                         
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           You're supposed to wait for my signal
           Eep. Eep?
                         
          Eep scares a pack of nearby Liyotes away. They pounce on
          Grug briefly before scampering off. Eep spreads out on
          an overhanging rock. She BASKS IN THE SUN.
                         
                          EEP
           We've been in that cave forever.
                         
                          GRUG
           Three days is not forever.
                         
                          EEP
           It is with this family.
                         
                          GRUG
           Eep would you come down here? You're
           being so dramatic.
                         
          A LITTLE GIRL, SANDY, charges out next. Her display is
          more terrier-like.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           No, no, no Sandy, come back here.
           Remember the signal. Good girls wait for
           the signal.
                         
          A CAVE WOMAN, UGGA, scrambles out next. She is mostly
          focused on catching Sandy, giving only cursory effort to
          her display.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Ugga.
                          UGGA
           As soon as I get Sandy, I'll go back in,
           and you can give the signal.
                         
                          GRUG
           No, I mean, you're already out now.
                         
           THUNK (O.S.)
           I am waiting for the signal, dad.
                         
          We HEAR the voice of Grug's nine-year-old son from inside
          the cave. THUNK is eager to please his dad and emulates
          his every move.
                         
                          GRUG
           Never mind, Thunk. Just, come out.
          4.
                         
                         
                          THUNK
           (not so fast)
           Uhh, but if you don't give the signal,
           how do I know you're my dad?
                         
                          GRUG
           The signal isn't so you know it's me,
           it's so you know I wasn't eaten by an
           animal.
                         
          Beat.
                         
                          THUNK
           Then why is the signal an animal noise?
           I mean, doesn't that just confuse things?
                         
          Grug sighs.
                         
                          THUNK (CONT'D)
           I don't know... I'm still waiting for the
           signal.
                         
                          GRUG
           Sigh. Hoo hooooo! Hoo hooooo!
                         
          Thunk comes out growling, and barrels into Grug. Thunk
          picks up a boulder and throws it. It ricochets off the
          cliff wall and careens into Grug. Grug gets plowed over
          by the boulder.
                         
                          UGGA
           Mom, we're ready to leave.
                          (BEAT)
           Mom!
                         
          Grug sits up and smiles.
                          GRAN
           Still alive!
                         
          Grug's face drops.
                         
                          GRUG
           It's still early.
                         
                          GRAN
           And you're still fat.
                         
                          GRUG
           Breakfast formation!
                         
          The Croods form up in a flying wedge, with Grug in the
          lead.
          5.
                         
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           I want to see some real caveman action
           out there. We do this fast. We do this
           loud, we do this as a family and never
           not be afraid. Go!
                         
                          THUNK
           YAY, BREAKFAST!!!!
                         
          COMPRESSED TIME - The Croods RUN out of Crood canyon,
          across the wide expanses of desert.

          EXT. MOUTH OF CROOD CANYON - MORNING
                         
          Grug and the Croods come to a stop at the HUNTING
          GROUNDS. They are spent from a fifteen-mile run.
                         
                          THUNK
                          (HUFFING)
           Yeah... breakfast...
                         
          We see a nest with a huge unguarded blue egg. The Croods
          take shelter behind a rock. Grug PEERS over the top.
                         
                          GRUG
           Who's up?
                         
          Eep's hand SHOOTS up. Thunk is less than enthusiastic.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           We'll flip for it.
                         
          Grug LIFTS Gran on his hand, and FLIPS her up in the air.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Call her in the air.

          Gran FACE-PLANTS, her head buried in the sand. Only her
          tail is showing.
                         
                          GRUG

          The family fades back and splits up. They get into
          fighting/running position.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Ok. Thunk. Go. Come on Thunk.
                         
          Thunk BREAKS COVER. He dashes into the open, SNATCHES
          the egg.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Hah! Way to go. Take it to the cave!
                         
          Thunk PASSES Grug and makes a bee-line for Crood Canyon.
                         
          A Gerf bird smashes Thunk and steals the egg back.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Oooh!
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Release the baby.
                         
          Eep and Sandy MOVE IN on the bird. Sandy NIPS at its
          heels while UGGA CLIMBS up onto its head. She PULLS the
          egg from its beak.
                         
          Down range, TRIP GERBILS SURFACE. They STRETCH their
          shared tail across the Ramu's path like an arresting
          cable on a carrier.
                         
          Ugga RISES to THROW the egg to Grug - the gerbils WRAP
          their tail around the Ramu like a bola. The Ramu GOES
          DOWN hard. Ugga and the egg ROLL forward. The Trip
          Gerbils SNATCH up the egg and make off with it.
                         
                          UGGA
           Get um Mom! Do it for the Croods!
                         
          Gran's cane HOOKS the gerbils in the middle of their tail
          and WHIPS them up and over her shoulder.
                         
                         ON GRAN
                         
          DRIBBLING the egg down-range with her cane like a hockey
          player. LIYOTES POP UP from behind hoodoos. They SWARM
          in behind her.
                         
          The Liyotes TRIP Gran. They steal the egg, and HIT THE
          GAS. They are INCREDIBLY FAST.
                         
                          GRAN
           Old lady down! Eep, avenge me.

          Crouched in the shade of a scrubby bush, like a runner on
          the blocks - she has the Liyotes in her sights. Eep
          LAUNCHES.
                         
          Eep runs after the Liyote with the egg, cutting him off
          in his tracks he slams into a cactus launching the egg
          into the air. Eep leaps into the air taking back the egg.
                         
                          EEP
           Thanks!
                         
          A bunch of Jackrobats see Eep and swarm around her. She
          loses her footing and throws the egg to Grug.
                         
                          GRUG
           Eep!
                         
                          EEP
           Heads Up!
                         
          Grug catches the egg and runs by the entrance of a small
          cave. Thunk following close behind accidentally trips
          over the tail of a sleeping Bear Owl knocking Grug to the
          ground and fumbling the egg once again.
                         
          Thunk catches the egg just as the Girelephant bears down
          on him from behind and lifts him onto one of its tusks.
          The family members meet up as they begin their long run
          back to the cave.
                         
          An entire swarm of animals chase the Croods as they head
          back to their cave.
                         
          The Bear Owl is awakened and goes after everyone on the
          chase.
                         
          Grug protecting his family from the BearOwl tosses each
          family member onto the Girelephant's back.
                         
          Grug dodges the BearOwl's attack and uses him as a
          launching pad to get himself safely on the Girelephant.
                         
          Thunk is happy to see Dad is safe.
                         
                          THUNK
           Oh hey Dad, can we eat now?
                         
                          GRUG
           Just wait till we get home. Eep put on
           the brakes.
                         
          The entrance to Crood canyon appears on the horizon.
          8.
                         
                         
          Eep hangs off the edge of one of its tusks as Grug takes
          over the other. Together they dig their heels into the
          ground, slowing down the Girelephant.
                         
          The Bearowl continues the chase. The Croods maneuver the
          Girelephant to fend off the Bearowl.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Eep!
                         
          The Girelephant moving way too fast readies for the
          crash. The Girelephant crashes into the entrance of the
          canyon, sending the Croods flying in. They all tumble.
          Grug makes an extraordinary football catch. He holds
          tight to the meal as he slams into a rock. Grug holds up
          the egg.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Who's hungry?
                         
                          THUNK
           Alright! Good one, dad!
                         
                          GRUG
           Here you go, Thunk. Drink up.
                         
          Grug tosses the egg to Thunk, Thunk fumbles it and it
          cracks open.
                         
                          THUNK
           Sorry, dad.
                         
                          UGGA
           Looks like fast food tonight!
                         
          The family passes the leaky egg around quickly, each
          Crood gets a taste. Thunk is the last Crood to get a
          mouthful, he hands it over to Grug-- the egg is empty.
                         
                          GRUG
           That's alright. I ate last week.
                         
          A SHADOW TOUCHES Grug's feet. He looks up - the sun is
          setting behind the canyon wall. He HOLDS UP his hand to
          gauge how much daylight is left.

          stick off the floor.

          Whack! Like she's cleaning a rug, Ugga SMACKS Sandy hard
          with the stick. Dust and bugs fly off of her.
                         
                          UGGA (CONT'D)
           See? Sandy doesn't fuss.
                         
          Ugga CLAPS her hands together and Sandy knows to let go.
          She hits the floor and SCAMPERS away.

          Eep begins to climb down the wall outside when she hears
          a sound in the distance. Curious, she begins to climb
          even higher. Grug leaves the cave, searching for her.

           Come on.
                         
          Behind Grug, the Bear Owl appears up the canyon. It
          SPOTS Grug and the open cave and RACES to attack. Grug
          sees the BearOwl in full attack mode.

          Grug throws a rock which momentarily stuns the creature,
          allowing Eep to JUMP DOWN and DART into the cave. Grug
          barely gets the cave closed in time.

           not be afraid.
                         
          Eep climbs up on a ledge and curls up in the corner where
          a tiny spot of light seeps in.
                         
                          EEP
                          (TO HERSELF)
           What's the point of all this?
                         
                          GRUG
           Hmmm? What was that?
          12.
                         
                         
                          EEP
           (a little louder)
           I mean, why are we here? What are we
           doing this for?
                         
                          CROODS
                          GROAN 
                         
                          GRUG
           No one said survival was fun.
                         
                          EEP
           Nothing is fun.
                         
                          GRUG
           Hmm? Would you come down here. Eep?
                         
          No answer. Grug CLIMBS up. Ugga PULLS Grug back down.
                         
                          UGGA
           Grug. Off.
                         
                          GRUG
           Yes.
                         
          Grug climbs back up.
                         
                          UGGA
           Off!
                         
                          GRUG
           I just don't see why she needs her own
           ledge. That's all. That's what this is
           about.
                         
                          UGGA
           She's working through some things and
           needs her own space.
                         
                          GRUG
           What things? How long is this going to
           take? Really? I mean she already
           doesn't listen to me.
                         
          A pebble hits Grug in the head. It came from Eep's
          ledge.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Hey!
                         
                          UGGA
           See? She's listening.
          13.
                         
                         
                          GRUG
           If she wants to survive, she has to
           follow our rules.
                         
                          UGGA
           How about a story? Eep loves those.
                         
          Grug brightens.
                         
                          GRUG
                          (BRIGHTENING)
           That's a good idea ... How about a story,
           huh?
                         
                          THUNK
           Oh yeah, tell us a story.
                         
          The Croods minus Eep gather in a semi-circle on the
          ground. Grug retrieves Sandy and her Krispy Bear from
          the bone-crib.
                         
                          GRUG
           Ok. Can I borrow that? Thank you. Eep!
           Your old favorite?
                         
                          EEP
           I haven't played with that thing in
           years.
                         
                          GRUG
           Tonight we'll hear the story of Krispy
           Bear.
                         
          Grug sits and waits a beat for Eep to join, but she stays
          put.
          As Grug talks, he gestures at a rough sketch on the wall
          of the cave.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           A long time ago, this little bear was
           alive. She was alive because she
           listened to her father and lived her life
           in routine and darkness and terror. So
           she was happy. But Krispy had one,
           terrible problem. She was filled with...
           curiosity.
                         
                          UGGA
           Grug!
                         
          Ugga covers Sandy's ears.
          14.
                         
                         
                          GRUG
           Yes. And one day, while she was in a
           tree, the curious little bear wanted to
           climb to the top.
                         
                          THUNK
           Wha?
                         
                          GRUG
           And no sooner than she climbed to the
           top, she saw something new and died.
                         
          Grug SWATS the painting.
                         
                          THUNK
           Just like that?
                         
                          GRUG
           Yes! Her last moments of terror still
           frozen on her face.
                         
          Grug holds out Krispy Bear. The family is terrified.
                         
                          GRAN
           Oh, same ending as everyday.
                         
                          THUNK
                          (FREAKED OUT)
           I get it, dad. I get it. I will never
           do anything new or different.
                         
                          GRUG
           Good man, Thunk.
                         
          Pan across the walls to reveal they are covered with
          stories all seemingly with the same ending.
                          UGGA
           Alright, everyone sharpen your teeth and
           let's pile up.
                         
          All their worst fears confirmed, the Croods snuggle into
          one big heap, warm and comfy. Grug casts a glance to
          Eep's ledge. She doesn't budge.
                         
           FADE TO BLACK:
                         
                         
          SEQ. 500 - FOLLOW THE LIGHT
          15.
                         
                         
          INT. CROOD CAVE - NIGHT
                         
          The Croods sleep peacefully in their pile. Except Eep,
          who tosses restlessly on her LEDGE. Outside, we hear the
          ROARS and HOWLS of prehistoric creatures fighting.
                         
          But then, SILENCE.
                         
          And then cutting through the primordial night is a
          MUSICAL SOUND. Unsettling. Unearthly. Eep creeps
          around her sleeping family and cautiously approaches the
          "door" to peer outside, when suddenly--
                         
          WHOOSH! A bright light blazes through the gaps around
          the boulder door, bathing Eep in an OTHER-WORLDLY GLOW.
          She chases the flash of light around the cave trying to
          catch it in her hands.
                         
          Eep presses her face against the cold boulder, trying to
          get a look at what is outside, but she can't get more
          than a blurred glimpse of the canyon beyond - and the
          disappearing light.
                         
          Desperate to see more, Eep braces her back against the
          cave and PUSHES the plug rock with her legs. Slowly, she
          shifts the rock, careful not to wake her father. It takes
          all of her strength, but she manages to move it just
          enough for her to BARELY SQUEEZE out.
                         
          EXT. CROOD CANYON - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Eep stands outside at night for the first time ever. Her
          heart races. The hot night wind blows against her face
          and through her hair. The forbidden sensation is
          exhilarating.
          The canyon beyond is quickly swallowing the light - it
          will be gone in another few seconds. With one of her
          hands pressed tightly to the cave `door', she steels
          herself.
                         
          Eep LETS GO and DASHES after the light, SCRAMBLING
          through the SANDSTONE NARROWS, bounding from side to
          side. As she disappears into the darkness of the canyon,
          we...
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. CANYON
                         
          The light ahead is growing brighter. Eep is closing on
          it. In her excitement, she missteps and SNAPS a stick
          underfoot.
          16.
                         
                         
          It was barely audible. Eep instinctively FREEZES.
                         
          A huge SHADOW of a TUSKED CREATURE is cast on the wall
          above her. Eep throws a rock at the shadow.
                         
          She POWERS STRAIGHT UP the stone wall with unexpected
          speed.
                         
          The Creature RUNS. Eep tops the wall and...
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          SEQ. 550 - CLOSE ENCOUNTERS
                         
                         
          EXT. ROCK ARCH - NIGHT
                         
          Eep steps into a small clearing. Stuck in the ground, is
          a TORCH. As far as Eep knows, this is the thing she was
          following. Eep crouches down and cautiously approaches.
                         
          REVERSE ANGLE - Eep can feel the heat from the fire on
          the palms of her hands and her face. TENSE. EXCITING.
                         
          But camouflaged against the rock wall behind her,
          something MOVES. A WARTHOG CREATURE stands upright and
          creeps up behind her.
                         
          Eep reaches out to TOUCH the flame. The torch blows away
          from her. The wind has changed direction. The breeze at
          her back, Eep smells the Creature behind her. On her
          face, awe turns to determination as she wheels and grabs
          the creature. She THROWS and FLIPS it over her shoulder.
          It hits the torch, knocking it to the ground. Eep jumps
          back, GRABBING a good-sized rock - she's poised to bash
          the Creature's brains in.
                         
                          CREATURE
           Nuh! Nuh!
                         
          The Creature defensively raises its arms, hands in front
          of its face.
                         
                          GUY
           No!
                         
          Hands? Eep GASPS, shocked to see HUMAN HANDS attached to
          this monstrosity.
                         
          The Creature slowly puts his hands to the sides of his
          grotesque head, and RAISES its mask. It's a boy... he's
          BEAUTIFUL! This is GUY.
          17.
                         
                         
                          EEP
           Augh!
                         
          Eep LEAPS BACK a few paces, DROPPING the rock on Guy's
          foot.
                         
                          GUY
           AAAAAAAUGHHHHHHHH!
                         
                          EEP
           Shhh!
                         
          Eep moves swiftly to silence him. She POUNCES on him and
          TWISTS his head sideways. Guy is SUFFOCATING. He feels
          around for a stick and BASHES Eep in the side of the
          head.
                         
                          EEP (CONT'D)
           Ow!
                         
                          GUY
                          (GASPING)
           Air.
                         
                          EEP
           ...You talk.
                         
                          GUY
           I'm a person, like you.
                         
          Eep TOSSES the boulder aside and LIFTS Guy with one hand.
                         
                          GUY (CONT'D)
           Sort of... like you.
                         
          Eep OPENS Guy's mouth and pokes around inside. She
          SNIFFS at him. Turns him upside-down.
                         
                          GUY (CONT'D)
           Okay, could you not, hee hee hee, that
           tickles. Hey!
                         
          Eep looks closely at BELT, a sloth wrapped around Guy's
          waist. Belt's eyes OPEN.
                         
                          EEP
           Augh!
                         
          Eep DROPS Guy on his head.
                         
                          GUY
           OW! Wow. --
                         
          Eep jams her foot over Guy's mouth.
          18.
                         
                         
                          EEP
           Quiet! I'm not supposed to be out here.
                         
          Guy BITES her foot.
                         
                          EEP (CONT'D)
           OW!
                         
          She KICKS Guy in the stomach. He ROLLS sideways. Guy is
          getting the worst of this encounter. Eep kicks Guy off-
          frame. We HEAR the fight continuing.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          INT. CROOD CAVE
                         
          Grug is awakened by wind coming from the cave opening.
          He pushes the "sleep pile" off of him. Checks Eep's
          ledge... but she is gone.
                         
                          GRUG
                          (TO UGGA)
           Eep's gone.
                         
                          UGGA
           What? Grug!
                         
                          GRUG
           Stay in the cave!
                         
          Grug stands outside the entrance to the cave. Peering
          into utter darkness. He steels himself... and then
          releases his hand from the "door."
                         
                          CUT TO:

          EXT. ROCK ARCH
                         
          Guy is still on his knees.
                         
                          GUY
           (in pain, defeated)
           Wow. You're really strong.
                         
          The flame DWINDLES. Guy MOVES toward it. Eep BLOCKS
          him.
                         
                          EEP
           No! It's mine. No, no. I caught it!
          19.
                         
                         
          No way Guy is getting past her.
                         
                          GUY
           It's dying. I can fix it!
                         
          Eep doesn't want to.
                         
                          GUY (CONT'D)
           Please. I hate the dark.
                         
          Eep sees a kindred spirit. She gets out of his way. Guy
          PICKS UP the torch and BLOWS. Eep scoots closer to Guy,
          staying in the circle of light around him. As Guy brings
          the fire back to life, the relief on his face is familiar
          to Eep. This boy seems to have power over light itself.
          Eep is smitten.
                         
                          EEP
           It does what you tell it?
                         
                          GUY
           Well, yeah, sort of.
                         
                          EEP
           The sun?
                         
                          GUY
           No, no. Fire.
                         
                          EEP
           (to the flame)
           Hi, fire.
                         
                          GUY
                          (LAUGHING)
           It's not alive.
                          EEP
           But you said it was dying.
                         
                          GUY
           Uh sorry,--
                         
                          EEP
           It comes from where you come from?
                         
                          GUY
           No. I make it.
                         
          Eep BALLS her fist, GRABBING Guy tightly by the hair.
                         
                          EEP
           Make some for me.
          20.
                         
                         
                          GUY
           Ow. Okay, it doesn't come out of me.
                         
                          EEP
           Make. MAKE! MAKE IT!
                         
          Eep SQUEEZES Guy like a tube of toothpaste.
                         
                          GUY
           You do this a lot.
                         
          Something CRACKS. Eep DROPS Guy - he's broken.
                         
                          EEP
           Are you dead? Can I have your fire if
           you're dead?
                         
          Belt RUBS two flat rocks together and places them on
          Guy's chest like defibrillator paddles. Guy BOLTS
          upright.
                         
                          GUY
           Hey, those are cold!
                         
                          BELT
           Squirf!
                         
                          GUY
           You think? Listening shells, activate.
                         
          Belt AND Guy use shells to LISTEN to the ground.
                         
                          GUY (CONT'D)
           I concur. Tiger girl, we need to leave
           immediately.
          He tries to pull her by the arm. She stays put like an
          anchor.
                         
                          EEP
           I don't even know you.
                         
                          GUY
           (pained, rushed)
           Ow. I'm Guy.
                         
                          EEP
           Guy?
                         
                          GUY
           And this is Belt. Cook,
           conversationalist, navigator, also keeps
           my pants up.

                          EEP
           What are "pants up?"
                         
                          GUY
           Who are you?
                         
                          EEP
           Eep.
                         
                          GUY
           (cutting her off)
           Let me clarify, Eep. The world is
           ending.
                         
                          EEP
           What?
                         
                          GUY
           I'm calling it...
                          (VERY DRAMATIC)
           The... End.
                         
                          BELT
           Da da daaaaa.
                         
                          EEP
           How do you know?
                         
          Guy and Belt both do gestures to accompany the Da da
          daaaa. It seems very important to them.
                         
                          GUY
           I've seen it. It's coming this way.
           First, the Earth is going to shake. Then
           it breaks open. Everything falls in.
           Fire. Lava. I don't mean to sound too
           dramatic, but Aaaaaaaugh. Believe me,
           everything we're standing on, all this
           right here, will be gone.
                         
          Again with the gestures. It's a little weird to Eep.
                         
                          GUY (CONT'D)
           We've got to get to high ground. I know a
           mountain, that way--
                         
          He points into the distance.
          22.
                         
                         
                          GUY (CONT'D)
           It's our only chance.
           (extending his hand)
           Come with me.
                         
          Guy and Belt reach out their hands to Eep.
                         
                          EEP
           I can't.
                         
          Guy hands the shell to Eep. And Eep is mesmerized. Guy
          pulls his hog-mask back down.
                         
                          GUY
           Okay. Here. If you survive, call me.
                         
          Eep test-blows the shell. It makes a sound, she giggles.
          When she looks up to thank Guy, he is GONE.
                         
                          EEP
           Thank you. Hello? Hey!
                         
          Eep BUMPS directly into Grug.
                         
                          EEP (CONT'D)
           Dad!
                         
                          GRUG
           Are you hurt? What took you?
                         
                          EEP
           Nothing. I left on my own.
                         
                          GRUG
           You... youuuuuuu... ww-what!?
                          EEP
           Dad, let me explain...
                         
          A low GROWL interrupts them.
                         
          ON THE BEAR OWL Sniffing around. It passes over a log.
                         
          CRANE DOWN to reveal Grug hanging under the log by one
          hand, Eep dangling in the other.
                         
                          EEP (CONT'D)
                          (WHISPERED)
           You never let me talk.
                         
                          GRUG
           You're grounded.

          Grug and Eep move up the canyon. Eep furiously kicks a
          rock, it nearly hits Grug.
                         
                          GRUG
           Hey!
                         
          Things are tense between the two. At the KEYHOLE, they
          are met by the rest of the Croods.
                         
                          UGGA

                          UGGA
           Grug! What happened!?
                         
                          GRUG
           You know what, I am so mad right now,
           that I can't talk to her.

                          EEP
           You'll never believe it. I found
           something new.
                         
                          CROODS
           New?!!!!
          The Croods all SNATCH up stones. They form a defensive
          circle.
                         
                          GRUG
           New's a big problem!
                         
          Eep is trapped in the middle of the defensive formation.
          She SQUEEZES out.
                         
                          EEP
           Wait. Wait!
                         
                          UGGA
           Eep. Stay inside the family kill circle.
                         
                          EEP
           It wasn't bad.

                          GRUG
           New is always bad.
                         
                          EEP
           No. He was nice.
                         
                          GRUG
           What!? Excuse me? He?
                         
                          EEP
           Oh. Well, I thought he was a warthog,
           but then he turned into a boy.
                         
                          GRAN
           Strange. Usually it's the reverse.
                         
          Grug RAISES an eyebrow.
                         
                          THUNK
           Eep's got a boy hog! Eep's got a boy
           hog!
                         
          Eep ELBOWS Thunk in the back of his head.
                         
                          EEP
           There was a boy. Watch, okay. I'm gonna
           call him.
                         
          Eep pulls out the SHELL. She BLOWS into the shell - the
          sound ALARMS the Croods.
                         
          They SMACK the shell from Eep's hand and SMASH it with
          their rocks.
                         
          Eep is incredulous. The dust clears - the panting Croods
          are satisfied the object is gone.
                          EEP (CONT'D)
           What is wrong with you?
                         
                          GRUG
           It was dangerous.
                         
                          EEP
                          (VERY ANGRY)
           It was beautiful. You want to see
           dangerous? Here.
                         
          She pelts Thunk with a rock.
                         
                          THUNK
           Owww! My sniffer!
          25.
                         
                         
                          GRUG
           Okay Eep, that's it. We're going back to
           the cave and you're going to stay in
           there until you're older than... her!
                         
                          EEP
           What!? You can't keep me inside forever!
                         
          Eep throws a tantrum of epic proportion. She SLAMS a
          rock on the ground. It SHATTERS to dust.
                         
          CREAK! A strange GROAN is heard from under the ground.
          Then a small amount of sand falls from up above. A crack
          starts to splinter under their feet.
                         
                          EEP (CONT'D)
           He said this would happen.
                         
          Then BOOM! The ground starts to SHAKE!
                         
                          GRUG
           Get to the cave! GO!
                         
          The Croods RACE through the CANYON NARROWS, fighting
          their way through falling boulders and shifting ground,
          heading towards the safety of their cave.
                         
          The Croods see the cave entrance. The canyon walls above
          their home start to crack. Grug sees that the falling
          rock will crush the cave.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Look out! Stop!
                         
          Grug leaps and tackles his family, protecting them from
          the mass of rocks crashing down.
          The top of the canyon collapses and the Crood's cave is
          destroyed. Everything is engulfed by dust. The earth
          settles.
                         
                          DISSOLVE TO:
                         
          SEQ. 710 - CROSSING OVER
                         
          The dust clears a bit - the Croods are in a tight ball,
          covered by Grug. Grug stands, all Croods were sheltered
          and safe under his mighty arms.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Is everyone okay?
                         
                          UGGA
           Yes. Grug, the cave, it's gone.
          26.
                         
                         
          Grug looks back to Crood cave. It is gone.
                         
                          GRUG
           No.
                         
          Grug searches the rubble for any sign that the cave might
          still be there. He finds one handprint, split in two.
                         
          He carefully fits them back together. Emotional, he
          lowers his head.
                         
          As Eep steps forward, a shaft of light filtering through
          the dusty veil from the wreckage crosses her face--
                         
          As the dust descends, Eep sees A NEW WORLD beyond.
                         
                          EEP
           You really need to see this...
                         
          The dumbfounded Croods stare in awe at the beautiful
          world.
                         
          The Croods look out at the new world.
                         
                          EEP (CONT'D)
           We should go there!
                         
                          GRUG
           No. No one is going anywhere.
                         
          Grug pulls Eep back from the precipice.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           What else did that boy say?
                         
          WHOOSH! Suddenly, bursting from the New World is a giant
          flying creature - a TURTLE DOVE.
                         
          The Croods reel back as it sails overhead. They turn to
          watch the Turtle Dove as it flies away.
                         
          They hear a familiar menacing growl. It's the BEAR OWL!
                         
          It roars and charges toward the Croods.
                         
          Grug instinctively GRABS a giant boulder and rolls it in
          front of his family.
                         
          The Bear Owl runs and swats the massive boulder away like
          a ball of yarn.
                         
          But the Croods are not behind it. They are running
          towards the New World.
          27.
                         
                         
                          UGGA
           Grug?
                         
                          GRUG
           Just go! Go! Go!
                         
          The Croods run towards the precipice with the Bear Owl
          closing in.
                         
          They reach the edge. The Bear Owl dives.
                         
          The Croods LEAP. They hang for a moment and begin
          tumbling down a steep jungle hill.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          SEQ. 776 - NEW WORLD
                         
          EXT. NEW WORLD. DAY
                         
          The Croods tumble through a twisty mess of giant roots
          and strange plants and land in a heap. They all lie on
          their backs, disoriented, but momentarily calm.
                         
          Grug sits up first. He turns to the high, high, cliff
          above them -- to the top, where they have lived all their
          lives up to this moment. A few loose pebbles continue to
          tumble down. There is no sign of the BEAR OWL.
                         
          The others stand up, and they take in this new place.
                         
          Grug takes a deep breath and then quickly counts:
                         
                          GRUG
           One, two, three, four, five --
          BEAT. Grug smiles.
                         
          Gran lands in a heap behind him.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           Six.
                         
                          GRAN
           (winces in pain)
           Oh... Where are we?
                         
                          GRUG
           I don't know, I'm not sure. Down. In a
           lower place. One thing's for sure, we
           can't go back the way we came.
          28.
                         
                         
          The Croods SIT UP. They are disoriented.
                         
                         ON SANDY
                         
                          SANDY
           Sniff sniff sniff 
           Grrrrrrrrrrr..... 
                         
                          UGGA
           (hushed, urgent)
           Sandy? What is it?
                         
          Sandy LUNGES at something almost disappearing into a
          bush.
                         
          Grug BARELY catches Sandy by her leg. Grug PULLS her back
          like a dog on a leash.
                         
                          GRUG
           No, no! Come back, Sandy!
                         
          Sandy has a MOUSEPHANT in her mouth. Grug knocks it from
          Sandy's mouth. A gaggle of mousephants run out from the
          bush and scurry away.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
                          (TENSE WHISPER)
           We can't be out in the open like this.
           We need a cave. Now step where I step.
                         
          They start moving.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
                          (WHISPERS)
           Okay. Stay quiet. Hopefully nothing big
           knows we're here yet.
          PULL BACK - a huge colorful predator, THE MACAWNIVORE
          senses something. He SITS UP and STALKS OFF.
                         
          ON THE CROODS moving fitfully through the strange forest.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Wait. Okay. Wait. Okay. Wait. Okay.
                         
          The Croods cautiously move in fits and stops through the
          middle of this thick, pre-historic rainforest.
                         
                          THUNK
                          (RAMBLING)
           So Dad, just to be clear, are we looking
           for the exact same cave?

          29.
                          THUNK (CONT'D)
           If it was me, I'm just throwing this out
           there, if it was me choosing the cave, I
           would go with a smaller cave.
                         
          As they trek, strange creatures (BEAR PEARS, PUNCH
          MONKEYS) watch these foreigners.
                         
          In the front of the line, Grug is freaked out. But in
          the back Eep is taking in the wonders. They pass through
          a curtain of hefty hanging pears. After they pass the
          "pears" all turn to watch the Croods.
                         
          A leaf FLUTTERS down.
                         
                          GRUG
           Wait.
                         
          Eep and Grug LOOK UP.
                         
          WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL THEY ARE SURROUNDED BY PUNCH
          MONKEYS.
                         
                          THUNK
           Dad?
                         
                          GRUG
           I'll take care of this.
                         
          Grug launches into his Threat Display -
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           WWAAAAaaarrgghhaarrraaaarrgghhh!!
                         
          He flails his arms around and jumps about in front of the
          nearest Punch Monkey. No reaction from the Punch Monkey.
          Grug stops, confused... The Punch Monkey now breaks into a
          BROAD GRIN... Then hauls off and - THUD - Punches Grug in
          the face! Grug reels back, surprised - turns... Right into
          another Punch Monkey. It winds up and - THUD! - it hits
          Grug - Grug reels back - into another Monkey - THUD! -
                         
                          THUNK
           Alright dad, go get `em! Oh, oh, now you
           got em-- Now they're really hitting you.
           Dad I got it, just stop running into
           their fists.
                         
          Gran joins in and punches Grug in the nose.
                         
                          GRAN
           Hah, I'm loving this.

                          UGGA
           Grug, when you're done, we should get
           going.
                         
          Wide shot: Grug is being bounced back and forth like a
          pinball from one punch Monkey to the next. The Punch
          Monkeys are whooping and hollering - this is great fun!
          The Punch Monkeys let go of Grug and begin running away
          for no apparent reason.
                         
          Grug staggers backwards into the family.
                         
                          GRUG
           That's right! You can't get past this!
                         
                          CHUNKY
           ROOOAR!
                         
                         
          A colorful 'bush' rears up - it's not a bush, it's a
          MACAWNIVORE! The Croods react, terrified
                         
          Grug throws a rock at it. The Macawnivore catches the
          rock and SPRINGS! -
                         
                          CROODS
                          GASPS 
                         
                          GRUG
           Climb! Climb! Climb!
                         
          Grug pushes and forces the Croods up a huge tree then as
          it steps away-- it is actually a giant animal.
                         
          GRUG'S POV: A cave!
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           CAVE! GO! GO!
                         
          The Croods jump off the bird leg in hopes of getting to
          the cave.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Come on! Hurry up, let's go! Come on!
                         
          The Croods all RUN LIKE CRAZY in the direction Grug
          pointed. They step inside the "cave." SLAM! The front
          of the cave comes down. The Croods have jumped inside
          the MOUTH of a LAND WHALE!
          31.
                         
                         
                          THUNK
           Hey look! This cave has a tongue.
           Awesome!
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          SEQ. 1250 - GUY TO THE RESCUE
                         
          The Land Whale stands up and then SPITS the Croods out
          through its blow hole. The Croods land in a heap.
                         
                          GRUG
           Okay, that's one, two, three, four,
           five... six...
                         
                          GRAN
           And seven... if we're counting Chunky the
           Death Cat.
                         
                          CHUNKY
           Grrrrrrrrr.
                         
          The Macawnivore appears from behind some nearby grass.
          It looks at the Croods with delight. Suddenly, the
          shadow of the setting sky passes over the Macawnivore.
          It freaks out and retreats into the forest.
                         
                          THUNK
           Hah! It's scared of the dark... wait...
           we're scared of the dark.
                         
          And for good reason, because as the SHADOW from the
          setting sun falls across the Croods.
                         
          Suddenly, thousands of PIRANHA OWLS BURST from the
          grasses around the Croods and form a huge undulating
          cloud above them. It's a beautiful sight.
                         
          The cloud of Piranha Owls then SETTLE on a massive LAND
          WHALE.
                         
          Moments later, they fly back into the air - the whale is
          SKELETONIZED. It CRUMPLES to the ground.
                         
                          GRUG
           Kill circle!
                         
          The Croods form their defensive circle, brandishing
          rocks.
                         
          Eep spies a SKULL lying in the sand. She SPRINTS for it.
          32.
                         
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Eep! Eeeep!
                         
          Eep breaks a horn from the skull and BLOWS on it loud and
          long.
                         
          ON GUY hearing the horn. He is happy to hear the sound,
          knowing it's Eep calling him.
                         
          Then as Guy begins walking towards the sound, Guy notices
          the circling birds in the sky. Alarmed, he DASHES off.
                         
          Guy appears at the treeline. He spots Eep standing alone
          in the clearing. He sees the birds heading towards her.
          He runs and leaps off a ROCK OUTCROPPING jumping right
          over the CROODS who are huddled near the ROCK.
                         
          Guy lands and in one fluid motion knocking the horn out
          of Eep's hand to stop the noise then STRIKES a spark with
          two STONES. The birds close in, blotting out the
          remaining light. All goes BLACK.
                         
          Then, a tiny leaf of flame FLUTTERS to life before Guy.
          He THROWS two more handfuls of grass on it, and it FLARES
          UP! The light SPLITS the onrushing red tide of birds
          like a knife. For a few moments the Croods are inside a
          TORNADO of the tiny monsters. The mass PASSES.
                         
          Grug SLAPS at one last smoldering bird FLUTTERING past.
                         
          Grug TURNS to see Guy, HOLDING his daughter. Grug's
          expression DARKENS. He SNARLS.
                         
                          GUY
           Ta-da.
                          EEP
           (Sigh.)
                         
          Grug pushes Eep aside and shows Guy his threat display.
                         
                          GRUG
           Auughhauhhhgggh!
                         
           SMASH CUT TO:
                         
          SEQ. 1275 - FIRE GOOD, FIRE BAD
                         
          Suddenly, Guy and Eep are circled by the Croods. They
          are in defensive ape-like positions. Each doing their
          threat display.
          33.
                         
                         
                          CROODS

          Guy stands in front of Eep defensively.
                         
                          GUY
           Cavies!
                         
                          EEP
           Cavies?
                         
                          GUY
           Cavemen! Stand back! They're
           practically animals. See their bony,
           sloping foreheads?
                         
                          EEP
           Oh... yeah!
                         
                          GUY
           The huge primitive teeth?
                         
                          EEP
           Er... yeah...
                         
                          GUY
           The excessive body hair? Oh, that one's
           got a tail...
                         
                          EEP
           Uhhh... yeah...
                         
          Guy PULLS his knife.
                          GUY
           Close your eyes. I'm going to have to
           take their lives.
                         
                          EEP
           (slapping the knife away)
           No. It won't help.
                          (EMBARRASSED)
           They're my family.
                         
                          GUY
           What?
                         
          Eep nods toward Thunk.
                         
                          THUNK
           Ah, the sun is in his hands!
          34.
                         
                         
          The Croods keep circling.
                         
                          EEP
           No. No. It's "fire."
                         
                          UGGA
           Where did it come from?
                         
                          EEP
                          (PROUDLY)
           He made it.
                         
          Grug grabs him and squeezes him tight.
                         
                          GRUG
           Make some for me!
                         
                          EEP
           It doesn't come out of him.
                         
                          GRUG
           Make. Make it.
                         
          POP! Guy's ribs are cracked for the second time.
                         
                          GUY
           You know, you're a lot like your
           daughter.
                         
          Guy falls in a heap.
                         
                          EEP
           Great, now he's broken.
                         
           UGGA (O.S.)
           Oh, it's a baby sun.
          Grug turns to see Ugga, Thunk, Gran and Sandy are now
          sitting very close around the fire, transfixed.
                         
                          GRUG
           Whoa! Stay back. We don't know what it
           wants.
                         
          As Grug moves around the circle, picking up sitting
          Croods and placing them a safe distance from the fire, he
          talks to them like a kindergarten teacher:
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Now we'll all sit here, and wait for the
           sun to come back. And tomorrow we'll
           find a new cave, and pretend today never
           happened.
                          (MORE)
          35.
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           (looks at the fire)
           Isn't this fun, Eep?
                         
          Grug looks around to see that Eep is kneeling beside Guy.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Eep, don't touch him. Goodness knows
           where he's been.
                         
          Suddenly, behind Grug, Sandy ATTACKS the torch. She
          shakes it with her teeth, EMBERS FLY EVERYWHERE.
                         
                          THUNK
           Dad, Sandy's hurting fire.
                         
          Grug reaches down and scoops up Sandy. (NOTE: From this
          point, Grug will hold onto Sandy, no matter how much she
          struggles, kicks and bites.)
                         
                          GRUG
           Sandy! No! Fire is not a play thing!
                         
                          UGGA
           Aww, what a cute little guy.
                         
                          GRUG
           Hey, stay back.
                         
          The Croods snatch at the embers as they dance in the air
          around them.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           No, no, no, wait!
                         
          One of the embers has caught onto Thunk's tunic.
                          THUNK
           It likes me!
           (after a beat)
           Hey! IT'S BITING ME!!
                         
          Thunk takes off running like a maniac.
                         
          The flame explodes into embers, which starts more fires
          in the grass around him. Grug looks at the growing fires
          with utter confusion.
                         
                          THUNK (CONT'D)
                          (SCREAMING)
           Ow! You're not my friend. Stop, stop
           touching me!
          36.
                         
                         
                          GRUG
           Thunk! Uh, try hiding from it in the
           tall dry grass!
                         
          Thunk sprints through the grass, arms flailing, as a ring
          of fire blazes up.
                         
                          THUNK
           (pleading with fire)
           Stop please, please. I'm only nine.
                         
          Gran cackles at her grandson's misfortune, but then she
          realizes her WALKING STICK IS ON FIRE.
                         
          Angrily, Gran starts to slam the burning end of the stick
          on the ground, trying to put it out.
                         
          But she only ends up making more small fires.
                         
                          UGGA
           Ooh, more fire babies.
                         
          While Gran tries desperately to save her cane, Ugga
          starts throwing sticks on the small fires, which begin to
          grow in size.

          Eep and Guy witness the FIERY MAYHEM:
                         
           GRUG (O.S.)
           Hold on son, come back!
                         
          SERIES OF SHOTS:
                         
           GRUG is chasing THUNK in circles, throwing rocks at his
          flaming butt.
                         
                          THUNK
           I don't like you anymore!
          37.
                         
                         
           Sandy, who is still in Grug's arms, but facing
          backwards, is now holding onto a burning stick and
          lighting everything she passes on fire.
                         
                          SANDY
           Weeeee!!!!
                         
           Gran, who is still trying to put out her stick, is
          batting it into every tree and bush she can hit.
                         
                          GRAN
           Get out! Out!
                         
           Ugga carries a REDWOOD above her head and then tosses
          it onto the small fire.
                         
                          UGGA
           Eat up, babies!
                         
          WHOOSH! Ugga ignites a massive bonfire.
                         
          The Croods appear like a bunch of violent, lunatic
          pyromaniacs.
                         
          CLOSE ON GRAN
                         
          Gran is pounding her walking stick on the ground.
                         
          PULL BACK TO REVEAL - she is standing on the edge of a
          giant corn field that is slowly catching on fire.
                         
                          GRAN
           Die! Die!
                         
          POOF! The fire on her cane has finally gone out.
                          GRAN (CONT'D)
           I win!
                         
          She smiles. And then WA-POP!
                         
          The giant ear of corn explodes blasting Gran off frame
          who slams into Thunk. The speeding ear picks up Ugga,
          Grug.

           They're not so scary once you get to know
           them.
                         
          Eep and Guy are HIT by the speeding corn.

                          UGGA
           Oh, I'm sorry. We're the Croooooods!
           And you are?
                         
                          GUY

           Hi, Guy.
                         
          The speeding ear CRASHES into a lone tree, sending Guy
          and the Croods sprawling across the tundra. The flying
          ears ROCKET SKYWARD and BURST like colorful fireworks.
                         
                          THUNK
           Wow! Looks like magic. And smells like
           food.
                         
          Popcorn kernels RAIN DOWN upon the Croods. They are
          BURIED.
                         
                          GRUG
           Don't eat it, it's new.

          Guy BURROWS out the side of the popcorn pile like a
          prisoner escaping Alcatraz.
                         
                          GUY
           gasping for air

          Guy RUNS for the mountain. Eep POUNCES on Guy like a
          tiger.
                         
                          GUY
           No!
                         
                          EEP
           Going somewhere?
                         
                          GUY
           The mountain? High ground? End of the
           world, remember?
                         
                          EEP
           That already happened. It destroyed our
           cave.
                         
                          GUY
                          (STRUGGLING)
           Noooo. That was just the beginning of the
           end. The end of the end is still coming.
                         
                          GRUG
           (as if to a dog)
           Eep. Drop it.
                         
          Eep SETS him down. Guy BOLTS but discovers Eep hasn't
          let go of his hand. Guy is YANKED backwards like he's
          been tied to a piling.
                         
                          EEP
           We can't let him go! What if we don't
           find a cave before sunset? What if it
           takes a few days? What if the birds come
           back?
                         
          BEAT.
                         
                          GRAN
           We need his fire, dummy!
                         
          WHOOSH! Grug grabs Guy and throws him in a log.
                         
                          GRUG
           Fine. You're staying with us till we
           find a cave.
                         
          Grug hoists Guy in the log onto his shoulder.
          40.
                         
                         
          Grug moves out, AWAY from the mountain. The family falls
          in behind Grug. Thunk is carrying a huge piece of
          popcorn that he's snacking on.
                         
                          GUY
           What? No I'm not. Don't make me part of
           this. Stay here if you want, but let me
           go. I've got a dream, a mission, a
           reason to live.

           Umm... I've got an idea. Let's go to
           that mountain.
                         
          ON THE TALL MOUNTAIN way in the distance.
                         
                          GRUG
                          (BARELY LOOKS)
           It's too far.
                         
                          EEP
           Dad really has his heart set on a cave.
                         
                          GUY
           Uh, there, are, caves on that mountain.
                         
                          EEP
           Have you been there?
                         
                          GUY
           It's a mountain. Mountains are safe.
           Mountains have caves. And water. And
           sticks.
                         
                          THUNK
           Mom? Did you hear that? I can get my
           own stick!
                         
                          GUY
           Yes. Sticks. Caves and sticks. Crazy
           sticks. Let's go.
                         
          On cue, a RUMBLE. This gets Grug's attention. Grug
          STOPS. The Croods wait to see what's going to happen
          next. A Mammoth FALLS out of sight, SWALLOWED by the
          ground.

          Sandy tries to attack Belt.
                         
                          THUNK
           Ugh. That thing is weird.
                         
          Belt antagonizes Sandy by sticking his tongue out at her.
          Sandy goes at Belt again.
                         
                          EEP
           No no, it's okay Sandy. That's just a
           belt.
                         
           Grug takes a step back. Turns.
                         
                          GRUG
           I've made a decision. We're going to,
           that mountain! Don't ask me why. It's
           just a hunch. It just feels right.
                         
                          UGGA
           I don't know Grug. We've never really
           walked that far.
                         
                          THUNK
           I don't think my feet can do that.
                         
                          GRAN
           I'll never live long enough to get there.
                         
                          GRUG
                          (LIGHTING UP)
           Let's do it.
                          (PAUSE)
           Oh come on, just think. Our whole
           family, packed together on a long, slow
           trip across country? Days and nights
           with just each other. We'll tell
           stories. We'll laugh.
           (glancing at Eep)
           We'll become closer as a family.
                         
          Eep RAISES one eyebrow.

          The Croods have not traveled far. The camera starts
          tight in on Thunk and Sandy. Sandy is harassing Thunk.
                         
                          THUNK

           then don't look her in the eye.
                         
          We follow Sandy as she moves past Gran.

           Could you keep your big giant arms on

          Sandy moves past Ugga, Eep and Guy who is still stuck in
          the log and being carried by Grug.
                         
                          UGGA
           No more touching. No more touching.

           Isn't this fun? We're taking our first
           trip together.
                         
          Thunk accidentally bumps into Eep.
                         
                          EEP (CONT'D)

           this family around so fast!
                         
          The camera slowly pulls out from the family in chaos as
          they walk across the burned out landscape.

           stepped on me and pushed me into the
           ground, the scorpion grabbed a hold of me
           and one thing led to another and here we
           are eating him. Win win.

          Guy lays a snare in the low grass. He WALKS to the base
          of a rotund, spikey tree, unwinding more rope as he goes.
          He TIES the rope around the base of the tree. Then he
          hands the loose end to Eep. Belt stretches his arms
          WIDE. Guy STOPS jumping and points up to the top of the
          tree.
                         
          Eep takes the cue. She LEAPS up and grabs the leaning
          top of the tree. Her weight gently BENDS the tree top
          down to the ground.
                         
                          GUY

          long, long time.
                         
                          EEP (CONT'D)
           ... So what do we do?
                         
          Guy pulls out a weird miniature TURKEY FISH PUPPET.
                         
                          GUY
           How's your acting?
                         
          ON THE TURKEY FISH getting ready to eat the TRIP-GERBILS.
          The Turkey LIFTS the creature to his mouth to DEVOUR it,
          but he's INTERRUPTED by a WHISTLING sound. He TURNS to
          see the silly little puppet dancing about. The Turkey
          Fish DROPS his meal and cautiously APPROACHES the puppet.
                         
          ON GUY AND EEP working the puppet. Eep is having the
          time of her life.
                         
                          GUY (CONT'D)
           Oh, you're good at this.
                         
          They are so into what they are doing, they accidentally
          get TANGLED UP.
                         
                          GUY (CONT'D)
           Oh, sorry, I...
                         
                          EEP
           Just move your arm... no, your other arm.
           Oh, that one's mine.
                         
          In their struggle to UNTANGLE themselves, Eep and Guy
          inadvertently insult the Turkey Fish. It CHARGES. Eep
          and Guy don't notice.
                         
          The Turkey Fish MISSES the snare, LEAPS the rock and
          SNATCHES the fake bird off of Guy's head, THRASHING it.
                         
                          EEP (CONT'D)
           Uh... It didn't step in your trap-y,
           thing.

                          GUY
           Yeah, I noticed.
                         
          Eep BOLDLY STANDS in front of the bird. The Turkey Fish
          grabs Guy and tosses him high across the open field. He
          goes flying through the air, screaming.
                         
          ON GRUG - hearing the commotion. Guy lands back in the
          log.
                         
                          GRUG
           Where's Eep?
                         
          Eep is in full parkour as she runs from the Turkeyfish.
                         
                          GUY
           She's awesome.
                         
          Grug STEPS FORWARD. He's going to SPRING the trap.
                         
                          GRUG
           Eep!
                         
                          EEP
           Dad, no!
                         
          She LEAPS the snare, PUSHING Grug DOWN.
                         
          The Turkey Fish HITS the trigger. The snare TRIPS. The
          bird BITES at the cavemen, but comes up short. The
          Turkey Fish WHOOSHES BACKWARDS into the air. He FLIES a
          couple hundred feet up...
                         
          ... and CRASHES down in a cloud of feathers.

          THE CROODS are eating like wild animals. They
          practically MAUL each other for scraps. HOWLS and
          SNARLING fill the night air. Guy is amazed and shocked
          at how the Croods are wolfing it down.

          their meal. Eep comes over and sits next to Guy.

           We never have that much food.
                         
          Grug is struck by Eep's words. Ugga sees Grug is hurt.
          Guy and Belt are struck by this as well.
                         
                          UGGA
           Grug, how about a story?
                         
                          GRUG
           That's a good idea. How about a story
           huh?

          Croods gather around Grug.
                         
                          GRUG
           Once upon a time there was a little tiger
           who lived in a cave with her family.
           There were a lot of rules, but the big,
           simple one was to never leave the cave at
           night. And the door was so heavy, you'd
           think it would be easy to remember.
                         
                          THUNK
           So easy to remember!
                         
                          GRUG
           I know! But, while everyone was asleep,
           she went out anyway.
                         
                          CROODS
           No!

                          GRUG
           Yes! And no sooner than she did, her
           cave was destroyed and everyone had to go
           on this long, sucky walk, with some
           weirdo they met, and died! The end.
                         
                          GUY
           Whoa! I did not see that coming. Twist

           Yes! Two stories in one night!
                         
          The Croods LEAVE Grug and GATHER around Guy. Guy is
          uncharacteristically dumbstruck.
                         
          A BEAT -
                         
                          GUY
           Okay. But it won't be as good as Grug's.
           Um, once upon a time, there was a
           beautiful tiger. She lived in a cave
           with the rest of her family. Her father
           and mother told her, "You may go anywhere
           you want but never go near the cliff, for
           you could fall."
                         
                          GRUG
           And die. Good story.
                         
          Thinking the story is over, the Croods begin to get up.
          As Guy begins talking again they settle back down.
                         
                          GUY
           But when no one was looking, she would go
           near the cliff, for the closer she came
           to the edge, the more she could hear, the
           more she could see, the more she could
           feel. Finally, she stood at the very
           edge, and she saw a light. She leaned
           out to touch it, and slipped.
                         
                          GRUG
           And she fell.
                         
                          GUY
           And she flew.

           A place not like today, or yesterday, a

                          GRUG

           Oh yes, yes it is. I've seen it. That's
           where I'm going.
                         
          Grug studies Guy. Is he crazy? Eep though is entranced.
          Eep and Guy lock eyes. There is something growing between
          them. Grug and Belt see it too. Grug is not thrilled.
                         
                          GRUG
           Well, WE are going to shut our eyes and
           sleep. And when we wake up we're going
           to find the place that has everything we

          Grug stuffs Guy neatly back inside the log. Grug CURLS
          UP by the fire with the LOG TUCKED UNDER HIS ARM far away

          Morning light kisses Grug's cheeks. He's sound asleep.
          PULL OUT to reveal that Guy's log is now teetering over a
          cliff edge - there was another subduction during the
          night, and half of the Croods' sleeping platform has sunk
          two hundred feet. Grug is still grasping Guy's log,
          which now hangs over the fresh abyss, and the still-
          asleep Guy is now SLIPPING out of one end. In the nick
          of time, Grug SHIFTS position, inadvertently TURNS the
          log, and Guy starts slipping out the OTHER end. Guy
          WAKES UP, looking down.

                          GRUG
           He's loose!
                         
          Grug goes to retrieve Guy, and STEPS on something sharp.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Aaaaahhhhhh! Do not step on those weird,
           pointy rocks!
                         
                          THUNK
           You mean these rocks? Ahh owww! Do not
           step on these rocks!
                         
          Thunk steps on the coral - it CRUNCHES under his feet.
                         
                          GRAN
           Step aside, girls!
                         
          Gran steps out, and then SCREAMS.
                          GRUG
           Hello? Nobody's listening! No one is
           listening. You cannot walk on those!
                         
          Guy stands on the coral without flinching.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Arraughrragh come back here now.
                         
                          GRAN
           Well, there goes our chance for survival.
                         
                          THUNK
           And our log!
                         
          Grug must make the choice to go after Guy.
          56.
                         
                         
                          GRUG
           Okay. Arraugh!
                         
          Grug cringes and bellows with every step. Guy still
          locked inside the log, hops away as fast as he can. Grug
          leaps out and grabs the log only to loosen it as Guy
          jumps to a coral patch below.
                         
                          GUY
           Ow, ow, ow.
                         
          Guy now free runs and hides behind a giant shell. He
          looks back at the Croods as they try in vain to cross the
          field and feels pity for Eep.
                         
                          THUNK
           Ow! Jumping doesn't help, I mean, just
           briefly, but it doesn't get better! Ow!
           Do not walk on your hands, the hands do
           not help at all.
                         
          Guy looks back at the stranded Croods. Then he looks
          again to the tall mountain. Belt sees that Guy is having
          a hard time leaving the Croods. He needs to make a
          choice. Belt makes it for him.
                         
                          BELT
           Eeccoomme on!
                         
          Belt walks Guy back to the Croods
                         
           HARD CUT TO:
                         
                         
          GUY STANDS AT THE EDGE OF THE CORAL, ONLY A FEW FEET FROM
          GRUG AND THE CROODS. GUY'S ARMS ARE FILLED WITH
          SUPPLIES.
                         
                          GUY
           I can help you, but we're going to have
           to make a few changes around here. The
           log ride is over. Drop the log.
                         
          Grug grudgingly DROPS the log.
                         
                          GUY (CONT'D)
           Now, kick it away.
                         
          Grug BARELY NUDGES it.
                         
                          GUY (CONT'D)
           Farther.
                         
          Grug KICKS it a quarter-mile.
          57.
                         
                         
                          GUY (CONT'D)
           Really?!
                         
                          GRUG
           Okay, smart, Guy... now what?
                         
          Guy SMILES.
                         
           HARD CUT TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. CORAL FIELDS - LATER
                         
          Everyone is now wearing "shoes" -- some made of leaves,
          sponges and some are actually fish!
                         
          Ugga and Gran wobble on their new shoes.
                         
          Thunk is covering his eyes, too afraid to look down.
          Thunk looks down at his horrifying fish shoes. They
          blink at him.
                         
                          THUNK
           Ahhhh! Good fish.
                         
          Eep is covering her eyes.
                         
                          GUY
           Okay. Now you can look.
                         
          Eep peers down at her new boots.
                         
                          EEP
           Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh! I love
           them! Where are my feet!?
                          GUY
           They're still there!
                         
                          EEP
           Oh, okay.
                         
          Eep slips, and falls into Guy's arms.
                         
                          GUY
           Whoa. You're really
                          (GETTING CRUSHED)
           ... heavy.
                         
                          EEP
           Really? Thank you!
                         
          Grug walks over as the two fall to the ground.
          58.
                         
                         
                          GRUG
           Hey, wait. Whoa. Whoa. WHOA!!
                         
                          GUY
                          (SWEATING)
           Okay! She's up. I'm good. We're
           good...
                         
                          GRAN
           These shoes are great! Where do you get
           these ideas?
                         
                          GUY
           Ah ha.
                         
          On cue, Belt produces a piece of chalk.
                         
          Guy stands Thunk against a wall. Guy stands next to him.
          Belt OUTLINES them. Guy excitedly gestures to the
          silhouettes.
                         
                          GUY (CONT'D)
           I'm calling it, a brain. I'm pretty sure
           it's where ideas come from.
                         
                          THUNK
           Dad. I don't have a brain.
                         
                          GRUG
           We've gotten along just fine without
           brains till now. Cavemen don't need
           brains. We have these. Heeya! Haha!
           (balls his mighty fists)
           That's what I'm talking about! Ideas are
           for weaklings.
          Grug punches at the air in front of Guy making him wince.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Now, let's get to that mountain.
                         
          Ugga and Eep notice each other's shoes.
                         
                          UGGA/EEP
           Oh wow. I love those!
                         
                          THUNK
           Good fish. Don't eat my feet.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          SEQ. 1710 - GOING GUY'S WAY
          59.
                         
                         
          The Croods run, slowly at first, then faster. And
          faster. The shoes make the difference.
                         
          ON THE CROODS
                         
          Grug encounters a bunch of Punch Monkeys again. He
          readies himself for a fight.
                         
          Guy hands out bananas.
                         
          Grug throws his banana to the ground only to slip on it.
                         
          ON THE CROODS
                         
          Grug sees the Macawnivore down below in the crevasse
          waiting for his Croods dinner.
                         
          Grug sees Guy making something out of sticks.
                         
          Traveling by stilts over a crevasse.
                         
          The family hobbles across a canyon on their stilts. Guy
          helps Eep from falling.
                         
                          EEP
           So... How'd the tiger fly?
                         
                          GUY
           He jumped on the sun and rode it to
           tomorrow.
                         
           Grug doesn't like seeing his daughter so close to Guy.
                         
                          GRUG
           No, no, no!
          The family moves across, Grug is the last to follow.
                         
          Grug spies Chunky the Death Cat below him. Grug WHACKS
          Chunky in the face with a stilt.
                         
          Chunky ponders the strange sticks Grug is perched on,
          then WHACKS a chunk out of them. Grug DROPS down by a
          yard or so. Panicking, Grug RACES across the chasm,
          losing stilt height with every SWIPE of Chunky's paw.
          Grug doesn't make it across - SNARLING and BITING sounds
          emanate from the canyon.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Ooowwwww!
                         
          The Croods stand at the top of a cliff.
          60.
                         
                         
          Grug tries to maneuver his way down the cliff by clinging
          to the side.
                         
          Guy and the other Croods sit on a giant leaves, sledding
          down the side of the canyon past Grug.
                         
          They pass Grug up as he continues to make his way down by
          tiptoeing. Grug stumbles and falls down the slope.
                         
                          THUNK
           Hi dad! Bye dad!
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          BOOM! A FLASH POPS against the Croods. SWING THE CAMERA
          AROUND to reveal A HUGE STORM hanging like a purple
          curtain before them. The Croods stop dead.
                         
          The rain line BEARS DOWN on them.
                         
          Grug tries to PUNCH the drops.
                         
          ON EEP AND GUY
                         
                          GUY
           You've seen rain before... right?
                         
                          EEP
           We don't get out much.
                         
          Guy opens an Umbrella to cover himself from the rain.
          Belt pulls Eep under the umbrella to be close to Guy.
                         
                          BELT
           Hmmmmm.
          Belt makes an Origami boat. He and Sandy sail across the
          rain puddles.
                         
          Grug seeing Guy and Eep snuggling under the umbrella,
          grabs the umbrella away from Guy. Grug gets hit by
          lightning.
                         
          The rest of the Croods open their umbrellas to take cover
          as they enjoy the RAIN.
                         
          ON THE CROODS UNDULATING REFLECTION
                         
          The Croods stand on a tiny island in a shallow ocean -
          Eep is pointing at her own reflection.
                         
                          GRUG
                          (FRUSTRATED)
           Eep, looks dangerous.
          61.
                         
                         
                          EEP
           Oh dad, you say that about everything.
                         
          Eep goes to jump in the water. Guy STOPS her.
                         
                          GUY
           Careful.
                         
                          EEP
           Oh really? Okay.
                         
          Guy CANNONBALLS. Then SURFACES.
                         
          Eep tentatively HOPS in. Guy STEADIES her. Then shows
          her how to move her arms in a swimming motion.
                         
          Guy SUPPORTS Eep by holding one hand under her tummy.
          She begins to SWIM.
                         
          Gran and Ugga SMILE mischievously - a positive vibe is
          building.
                         
          The Croods ALL JUMP at once.
                         
          Grug is left alone. Belt uses Grug's arm as a diving
          platform. Gran, Sandy and Belt are doing synchronized
          swimming. Then Grug sees Eep and Guy SURFACE - Eep is on
          Guy's shoulders! This is too much for Grug!
                         
                          GRUG
           Augh! No no no! Not cool. Not cool.
           Not cool.
                         
          Grug DIVES IN to put a stop to any potential shenanigans.
                         
          Grug's huge tidal wave SWAMPS Guy and Eep. Grug SINKS to
          the bottom.
                         
          ON GRUG laying on the bottom. His family SWIMS above him
          on the tails of Fishcats, confident and free and buoyant.
                         
          A lone bubble escapes Grug's nose, like oil oozing from a
          sunken wreck. He's feeling mighty extraneous.
                         
          Grug sees the Macawnivore swimming towards him. Grug
          swims for his life. Ends in a big splash.

          Guy is handing out SHELLS to the Croods.

          Grug is annoyed by everyone blowing their shells.
                         
                          GRUG
           Okay. Okay. That's enough. I don't see
           why the kids need their own shells.
                         
                          GUY
           So if anyone gets in trouble, we can call
           the others.
                         
                          GRUG
           Wait-- you're saying we should split up?
                         
                          GUY
           We can try more paths at once. It's the
           fastest way through.

           Croods stick together.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           They can handle it.
                         
                          EEP
           We can do it, dad.
                         
                          GRUG
           No no no no no. It's my job to keep you
           safe. I'm still in charge and we are not
           splitting up.
           (seeing Eep and Guy together)
           Except for you two. And that's final.
                         
          Grug SITS down like a silverback gorilla.
                         
          Just then, A HUGE RUMBLE. The EARTH STARTS TO SHAKE
          VIOLENTLY. The Croods and Guy are KNOCKED DOWN into the
          Maze each `falling' into a separate entrance.
                         
          They disappear into the rift like a penny dropped down a
          drain.
                         
          As Grug and Guy slide passed each other. Frustrated Grug,
          tries to punch Guy.
                         
                          GUY
           Oh, hello.
                         
                         
          INSIDE THE MAZE
          The SHAKING COMES TO A STOP. Everyone (now separated)
          gathers themselves.
                         
          ON GRUG-- finding himself alone.

                          (VERY FRIGHTENED)

                          UGGA
           (trying to calm him)
           We're okay, Grug.
                         
                          THUNK

           No. Too slow. Everybody, keep moving

           GRUG (O.S.) (CONT'D)
           Remember never not be afraid.
                         
           GUY (O.S.)
           You can do this.
                         
                          THUNK
           It's gonna be okay. I'm gonna pass out.
                         
          Thunk PICKS UP his shell, and tentatively makes his way,
          alone, into his branch of the maze.
                         
          ON EEP (OR GUY?)-- in another part of the maze. She puts
          her hand on the giant wall to her LEFT.
                         
          PULL BACK and see that they are actually in parallel
          `channels' but with the huge wall between them.
          ON Gran and Ugga - encountering carnivorous flowers.
                         
          ON Thunk - encountering a croco-pup.
                         
          ON Eep - finding a flower dropped on her path.
                         
          ON Grug - reaching a fork.
                         
          Ugga and Gran don flowery camouflage.
                         
          Thunk THROWS his shell at the Crocopup, MISSES. To his
          surprise the Crocopup returns the shell.
                         
          Thunk plays fetch with this portly beast, which shows him
          the way through the maze.

          Eep PICKS UP the flower, puts it in her hair, then finds
          a more flowers dropped on her path. She playfully begins
          hunting for Guy.
                         
          Guy and Belt are secretly and playfully tossing flowers
          in Eep's path.
                         
          Grug POPS out of a passageway - he's back where he began.
          He chooses another tunnel.
                         
          Ugga and Gran pass unharmed through the flower grove -
          the colors and smells are overpoweringly vibrant.
                         
          Eep surprises Guy and Belt in their hideaway as the two
          of them continue to throw flowers over the edge and onto
          Eep's path.
                         
                          EEP
           You dropped these.
                         
          Guy slips and falls onto a huge lilypad. He smiles up at
          Eep.
                         
          They share a moment before Eep shyly vanishes again.
                         
          Grug finds himself back at the entrance of the maze. He
          grumbles and enters a different tunnel.
                         
          ON THE MAZE EXIT -
                         
          Guy appears at the exit and puts his hand up to the
          setting sun that kisses the top of the mountain. Guy is
          amazed that he and Eep are both doing the same thing. He
          is smitten. Guy goes over to Eep.
                         
          Guy takes her hand.
                          GUY
           Come with me.
                         
          Eep and Guy turn to each other, just as Thunk emerges and
          tosses a rock for the Croco-Pup to fetch.
                         
                          THUNK
           Here boy, catch!
                         
          A shell note signals Ugga, Gran and Sandy's arrival.
          There is an obvious change in the ladies.

          A loud shell blast interrupts. It is followed by two
          others.
                         
                          UGGA
           Grug?
                         
          Grug lets out another blow on his horn.
                         
                          UGGA (CONT'D)
           I'll go get him.

          defeat, and TOSSES the shell down.

                          GRUG
           Sleep pile? How about a story, huh?
           Anyone?
                         
          Grug listens intently. All he hears is laughter.
                         
                         TREE TOP
                         
          Thunk, Sandy Belt and Gran are sitting around a torch,
          listening to one of Gran's stories.
                         
                          GRAN
           And then Torg said "Know it? I drew it!"
          68.

           Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
                         
                          THUNK
           That makes no sense.
                         
          Ugga arrives and sits next to Guy. She takes in the
          scene.
                         
                          UGGA
                          (TO GUY)
           I know it was hard for you to bring us
           along, but they had the best day of their
           lives... Thank you for that.
                         
          A RUMBLE distracts Guy. He looks to the horizon. FIRES
          and SMOKE on the horizon mark the leading edge of the
          collapse. Eep comes to his side.
                         
                          GUY
           I want to show you something.
                         
          Guy LIGHTS A TORCH and leads the Croods up, up, to the
          forest canopy.
                         
          Guy BLOWS OUT his torch. The night sky is revealed in
          all its glory. The Croods are amazed.
                         
          Music POUNDS as the spectacle SWEEPS around the Croods.
          Perched on the canopy of the forest the Croods seem to
          sit at the very brink of the universe.
                         
                          THUNK
           More suns in the sky than you can count.
                         
                          GUY
           Every sun that crosses our sky, comes to
           rest up there.
                         
                          EEP

          ON GRUG ARRIVING at the tree top. When he sees the stars
          he DUCKS back down, terrified.
                         
          He overhears the rest of the conversation.
                         
          Eep with tears in her eyes.

           I'm going with Guy.

          Grug is beside himself with panic, sick at the thought of
          losing Eep.
                         
                          GRUG

           No. Not my little girl.

           I can't go without Grug.
                         
                          GRAN
           Well, that makes one of us. Count me in!
                         
                          UGGA
           Really Mom? Now?
                         
          Grug continues to listen in.
                         
                          GRAN
           Grug has no idea how to protect us. In
           fact, he has no ideas at all.
                         
                          UGGA
           No, that's not true. What about that one
           time when he a...
                         
                          GRAN
           Face it! If he actually had an idea of
           his own I'd, I'd have a heart attack and
           die!

           He's a big guy. How can he just disappear
           like that?
                         
                          THUNK
           Hey wait. Let's ask that ugly lady if

           Yeah.
                         
          Grug SPINS AROUND. He's wearing a rasta-style wig made
          from knotted grass. The sight SHOCKS Ugga.
                         
                          GRUG
           Haven't seen him.

           Yeah, Wow. Like, I was up all night cuz
           like all these, ideas just kept coming to
           me.
                         
          Grug LIFTS his tunic, a Boa Constrictor is wrapped around
          his waist.
                         
                          GUY

          The constrictor SQUEEZES Grug till he turns blue. Grug
          SMACKS it and it relaxes a little.

           I call it a "rug." Rhymes with Grug.
           And this one. I call it a "ride."
           Rhymes with Grug.
                         
          Grug regards a boulder as if it's a Ferrari.

           It's gonna get us places faster than
           shoes.
                         
          Grug climbs on top of the rock, facing the wrong way.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Yeah. Try to keep up.
                         
          He LEANS FORWARD. The "car" ROLLS downhill and SMASHES
          through a redwood, TOPPLING it.
                         
                          THUNK

          Grug takes a huge flat stone and SMASHES it against
          Thunk, forcibly transferring the mud image to the rock.
                         
          Grug shows the Croods.

           Let's do it again. I think I blinked.
                         
          Thunk PASSES OUT.
                         
          ON THE CROODS

           and then up again into my mind.
                         
          Thunk walks into a tree. All the other Croods RAISE their
          "shades" in time to see Grug walk over a cliff.

          A huge BEAST BUNNY JUMPS into the opening of the rock.
          Grug is smashed flat.

          Grug tosses a massive boulder on the opposite end. Grug
          is LAUNCHED into the sky. Grug becomes a speck in the

          Thousands of birds fly overhead darkening the sky.
                         
          The shell boat hits the shore. The Croods step out onto
          land.
                         
          An explosion goes off on a nearby mountain. A PLUME of
          magma BURSTS from the water in the distance.
                         
          Grug looks around for shelter and spots a cave.

           Cave! Everyone inside. Come on! Hurry
           up, let's go. Go, go.
                         
          The Croods don't want to move.

                          GRUG
           What?
                         
                          GRAN
           We're gonna jump on the sun and ride it
           to Tomorrow with Guy.
                         
                          GRUG
           Wait, so you're all going to do this?
                         
          Silence from the Croods answers his question.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Thunk?
                         
                          THUNK
           Sorry, dad.
                         
          Thunk joins the others. It's the last straw.
                         
                          EEP
           You have to stop worrying for all of us.
                          GRUG
           It's my job to worry. It's my job to
           follow the rules.

                          GRUG
           Ugga, everyone, you have to listen to me.
                         
          Ugga doesn't move.

          Grug is STUNNED.
                         
                          EEP (CONT'D)
           We have to follow Guy now.
                         
          Grug slowly turns around to face Guy. He is smoldering.
                         
                          GRUG
           Guy?

           Guy, run.
                         
          Grug lunges toward Guy, SCREAMING.
                         
                          GRUG
           AAAAAAAAAAUGHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!
                         
          Grug ATTACKS Guy - they fall down an embankment.
                         
                          CUT TO:

                          GUY
           This is pointless. We're running out of
           time. Everything is collapsing. You're
           being irrational and counterproductive.
                         
                          GRUG
           Big words anger me. Keep talking.
                         
                          GUY
           Countermeasures.
                         
          Belt THROWS fruit at Grug. The fruit HITS Grug square in
          the face. He's blinded. He doesn't stop.
                         
                          GUY (CONT'D)
           Remember how you were this morning? You
           changed, remember? Idea man? Modern
           man?
                         
          Guy comes to a sudden stop - he's stepped in a small
          puddle of TAR.
                         
          Grug wipes his eyes clean of fruit.

                          GUY
           No, no, no wait.
                         
          Guy and Grug do a slow-motion PLUNGE over a tar-fall. As
          they descend Grug SWINGS at Guy, coating himself with
          tar. Grug's arms are held like glue. His punches stop
          well short of Guy's face. Guy and Grug arrive in a wide
          pool of tar. They SINK slowly.
                         
                          GRUG
           Hnnnnnngh! No. What is this stuff that
           saves you from my punches?

           Tar.
                         
          The tone of Guy's voice SINKS IN. Grug CEASES his
          attack.
                         
                          GUY (CONT'D)
           Please Grug. You have to stop struggling.
                         
                          GRUG
           No. I have to get back to them.
                         
                          GUY
           Grug! Stop!
                         
          Grug looks to Guy.
                         
                          GUY (CONT'D)
           No one gets out of this. Believe me. I
           know.
                         
          Grug gets it.
                         
                          GRUG
           Your...?
                         
                          GUY
           Family. Yeah.
                         
                          GRUG
           Sorry.
                         
          Grug looks at Guy again - he needs more than that. Guy
          takes a deep breath - this is going to be hard.
          77.
                         
                         
                          GUY
           I was little when it happened. The last
           thing my parents told me was, "Don't
           hide. Live. Follow the Sun. You'll
           make it to Tomorrow."
                         
          This resonates with Grug.
                         
          A thread of light trickles through the storm, falling
          just near enough to Guy he can gather it in his palm.
                         
                          GRUG
           You followed the light. My daughter is a
           lot like you.
                         
                          GUY
           No. She's like you. She loves you but
           always forgets to say it. Just like you
           forget to tell her.
                         
          Grug ponders this. A CHANGE comes over Grug. He focuses
          on Guy. This hits Grug hard.
                         
                          GRUG
                          (CRUSHED)
           I guess I was just busy keeping them all
           alive.
                         
          Guy considers Grug.
                         
                          GUY
           It's okay. That's what Dads do.
                         
          Grug smiles. He regards Guy in a different light. He
          sees him not as a boy but a man. Someone good enough for
          his little girl.
                          GRUG
           That's right... but we can't do that from
           here. We need one of your ideas.
                         
          The music TURNS.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Come on. You can do it.
                         
          Buoyed by Grug's encouragement, Guy swings into action
          mode.
                         
                          GUY

          We are tracking with the MACAWNIVORE. Suddenly, the big
          cat stops. His eyebrows raise.
                         
          MACAWNIVORE'S POV - a FEMALE MACAWNIVORE PUPPET.

                          GUY
           Yeah, I know. But he's doing the best
           with what he has. Let's go.
                         
          Grug and Guy are holding bones connected to the puppet.
          Belt SIGNALS to Guy.
                         
                          GUY (CONT'D)
           There he is. Belt, I want romance, drama,
           sincerity. Move me.
                         
          Belt makes music, which grabs the Macawnivore's
          attention.
                         
                          GUY (CONT'D)
           Okay he sees us!
          Belt plays a little melodramatic tune.
                         
          Grug halfheartedly moves the bones he's holding.
                         
                          GUY (CONT'D)
           That's our cue. Now work it!
                         
          The puppet starts shaking its tail.
                         
                          GUY (CONT'D)
           He's not coming over. I don't think our
           puppet looks scared enough.
                         
                          GRUG
           Scared? I'll show you scared. Hand me
           those acting sticks!
          79.
                         
                         
          Grug shakes the puppet and makes a frightening sound of
          terror.
                         
          Suddenly, the Macawnivore leaps forward and jumps on the
          puppet. He grabs it and pulls it up out of the tar,
          bringing Grug and Guy along with it.
                         
          Grug and Guy hang on to the bones of the puppet frame.
                         
          The Macawnivore shakes the puppet, pulling it out of the
          tar along with Grug and Guy.
                         
                          GUY
           Hold on!
                         
          The puppet breaks apart, the Macawnivcore turns to Grug
          and Guy. He is not pleased.
                         
                          BELT
           Da da daaaaaa...
                         
          The Macawnivore dashes towards the pair. They try to run
          from him. The Macawnivore's paws slip slowly backwards
          into the nearby tar--he's stuck. The tar snaps him back
          and throws him far from Grug and Guy.
                         
          Belt blows a whistle signalling a field goal!
                         
                          GRUG
           Yes. You did it!
                         
          Grug PATS Guy on the back. Grug realizes his hand is
          stuck to Guy's back.
                         
          The Croods come running to help them.

          Grug and Guy TURN to see the rest of the Croods. Grug
          waves to the family with Guy stuck to his hand.
                         
                          GUY
           Hey, we're okay!

           Yeah, we're okay.
          80.
                         
                         
          The ground shakes violently. Meteors stream across the
          sky.
                         
                          GUY (CONT'D)
           Grug. Your call.
                         
          Grug knows his answer.
                         
                          GRUG
           Take us to Tomorrow.

          EXT. EDGE OF THE WORLD - EARLY EVENING.
                         
          ON THE CROODS
                         
          RUSHING up the gun-sight into the bright rays of the sun.
                         
                          GUY
           Hurry! Come on. We're gonna make it!
                         
          When the Croods rush toward "Tomorrow," it is a golden,
          ethereal image created by a perfect alignment of sun,
          clouds, and mountain. From the Croods POV it looks as if
          they can cross a solid bridge of clouds and climb onto a
          waiting sun.
                         
                          EEP
           You were right.
                         
                          GUY
           There it is. The sun. We can do it! We
           can ride it to Tomorrow.
                         
          Even Grug is taken with the sight - it's there after all.
                         
          The Croods stare at the open meadow across from them.
          Tremors violently SHAKE the ground.
                         
                          GUY (CONT'D)
           Run!
                         
          When the rift OPENS in front of them, the hot gasses and
          blasts of hot ash BURST the clouds from beneath. The
          debris shades the sun, revealing a very Earthly landscape
          beyond.
                         
          From the Croods perspective, Tomorrow vanished before
          their eyes.
          81.
                         
                         
          A SHOCKWAVE knocks a large chunk of rock off the edge the
          Croods are standing on blowing them backwards.
                         
                          GUY (CONT'D)
           I don't understand. The sun was right
           here. It was right here.
                         
          KABOOM! A gargantuan jet of ash STABS at the sky. Ugga
          PULLS the Croods away from the ledge. She herds them
          back toward the gunsight.
                         
                          UGGA
           We have to go back to the cave. Hurry,
           hurry, stay together. Let's keep moving.
           Move, move! Everybody hold my hand.
           Thunk let's go. Go! Let's stay
           together.
                         
          But Grug doesn't join them. Instead, Grug takes a step
          TOWARD the precipice, peering into the curtain of ash as
          if trying to burn a hole straight through it.
                         
                          UGGA (CONT'D)
           Grug? What's wrong with you? Grug we'll
           die if we stay here!
                         
          Grug spies a wispy shaft of light STRUGGLING through the
          ash cloud. He HOLDS UP his hand to feel it. A beam of
          light settles on his palm. Grug is ENLIGHTENED.
                         
                          UGGA (CONT'D)
           (softly to Grug)
           Grug. Listen to me. We've gotta get
           back to that cave.
                         
          Grug looks back at his family - huddled, terrified. The
          picture of what he would have wanted in the beginning.
          The sight bothers him.
                         
          Grug TURNS to face them.
                         
                          GRUG
           No more dark. No more hiding. No more
           caves.

          A smile breaks across Eep's face - her dad has answered
          the question.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           I can't change. I don't have ideas. But
           I have my strength. And right now that's
           all you need.
                         
                          UGGA
           No. We don't know what's over there.
           Maybe nothing. It's too risky.
                         
                          GRUG
           It's a chance.
                         
          Belt wipes a tear off his face.
                         
                          GUY
           I'll take that chance.
                         
          Grug LIFTS Guy above his head.
                         
                          GRUG
           You know, I've wanted to throw you away
           ever since I met you.
                         
                          GUY
           Heh. That's a joke, right?
                         
                          GRUG
           What's a joke?
                         
          Grug's comment freaks Guy out. ANOTHER ANGLE shows Grug
          with a twinkle in his eye.
                         
          Belt puts on his helmet for safety.
          With a titanic effort, he HURLS Guy in to the void.
                         
          The Croods wait an eternity. Then - a HORN SOUNDS.
                         
                          UGGA
           He made it... He made it...
                         
                          GRUG
           Okay, Thunk. Your turn.
                         
                          THUNK

           When you make it, so will I.
                         
          Grug HURLS Thunk.

          Ugga KISSES Grug. She whispers in his ear.
                         
                          UGGA
           You did good.

           Daddy.
                         
          Grug wipes a tear from Ugga's eye. Then lifts her above
          his head. He HURLS her across.
                         
                          GRUG
           Gran.

          Grug LIFTS her above his head.
                         
                          GRAN (CONT'D)
           Wait. You surprised me today. Lunkhead.
                         
          Grug SMILES and throws her next.
                         
                          GRAN (CONT'D)

          Another TREMBLER. MORE cliff FALLS away. Now the
          distance is even greater.
                         
          Eep is next in line.
                         
                          GRUG
           Time to go.
                         
                          EEP
           No. I have too much to say to you. I
           need to fix everything and I don't have
           time.
                         
                          GRUG
           I can fix it.
                         
          Grug embraces Eep.
                         
                          EEP
           This works good. What do you call it?
                         
                          GRUG
           I was thinking of calling it a Hug.

           change it if you want.
                         
                          EEP
           No. I like a "Hug."

           I love you.
                         
          Eep takes in the full effect of her dad's words.
                         
                          EEP
           I...
                         
          The ground begins to shake and break apart around them.
                         
                          EEP (CONT'D)
           Dad, I'm scared.
                         
                          GRUG
           Never be afraid.
                         
          The gap grows wider. Grug lifts Eep and makes the
          greatest throw of his life.
                         
          The tumult parts briefly. Grug can see his entire family
          safe on the other side. He waves a last goodbye. To his
          surprise, a shaft of sunlight has settled on his open
          hand.

          Grug is startled by another earthquake. The ground is
          ripping itself apart as meteors begin to fall around him.
          Grug dodges falling debris and lighting and manages to
          crawl into a nearby cave-- a familiar place for him.

          Grug grabs two pieces of flint and starts clicking them
          together, just as Guy did earlier. They ignite. Grug
          has created his very first fire.

           Hey, I did it.
                         
          Another earthquake shakes the cavern. Grug moves over to
          a wall and uses some nearby mud to paint a portrait of
          his family. He paints each member individually and then
          looks longingly at the family he will never see again.
                         
          The torch begins to go out. Grug blows on it and is
          startled by the massive Macawnivore beast, growling at
          him.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Ahhhh! Back! Stay back! Stay back!
                         
          The Macawnivore blows out the torch. Another meteor hits
          the cave with a loud boom! The Macawnivore stops growling
          and starts blowing on the torch along with Grug. It is
          just as frightened as Grug. Grug reaches out and pets
          the now gentle carnivorous beast.

          Grug and the Macawnivore huddle together in a prehistoric
          armistice. When suddenly, Grug hears the dim tone of
          Eep's "shell signal." He rushes to the entrance to the
          cave. He surveys the raging CATACLYSM outside the cave
          as the world is being torn asunder.
                         
          He hears the SHELL ALARM blow TWO MORE TIMES. His family
          is in trouble.
                         
                          GRUG
           They're in trouble. Hang on! I'm
           coming.
                         
          The scale of his problem sinks in.

          Grug CLOSES HIS EYES, and CONCENTRATES.
                         
          The ember of a thought FLICKERS TO LIFE in Grug's brain.

          EXT. FIELD
                         
          Grug uses a log to wipe tar all over a giant rib cage.
          Grug runs out of the cave and into a nearby field and
          startles a pack of nesting PIRANHA OWLS. He turns back
          to the Macawnivore.
                         
          The meat-eating birds begin to chase Grug.
                         
                          GRUG
           Run!
          Grug leaps onto the Macawnivore's back as the birds move
          in closer. The ground begins to break up violently as
          lakes empty themselves and entire forests turn sideways.
                         
          The Macawnivore rushes into a giant rib cage that Grug
          has coated with tar. The Piranha Owls hit the rib cage
          and stick to it. As they fight to free themselves, the
          rib cage lifts off the ground. Grug takes a giant tree
          branch, ignites it, and uses it as a rudder, scaring the
          Piranha Owls and prompting them to fly in one coherent
          direction.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Yes!
                         
          As the cage flies, above the fiery landscape, Grug sees
          Douglas, sitting forlornly with the shell still in his
          mouth.
          87.
                         
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Douglas?
                         
          Grug doesn't even debate it, he runs back for the little
          monstrosity.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Hey, I know that guy.
                         
          Grug JUMPS out of the cage and rushes over to grab the
          gerbils. Then Grug notices a familiar Liyote hiding
          under a nearby rock. He GRABS the Liyote. Grug sees the
          TRIP-GERBILS stranded as well. Grug TWIRLS the Trip-
          Gerbils around his neck like a scarf.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Get up!
                         
          A ROAR BUILDS behind Grug - the pyroclastic flow is
          SPEEDING closer.
                         
          Grug CATCHES UP to the lumbering blimp-cage. He PUSHES
          it to go faster.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Hold on.
                         
          The pyroclastic cloud BLASTS up the narrow passage.
          Finally, with Grug's strength, the cage CLEARS the edge
          of the cliff.
                         
          The CLOUD HITS them all, SWALLOWING the Cage like a
          speck.

          Standing at the edge of the cliff alone, BLOWING her
          shell horn. Behind her, Sandy HOWLS. Gran puts a
          comforting arm around her grandchildren, even she has a
          tear in her eye.
                         
          The ground begins to shake softly.

           It's not safe here.

                          GRAN
           I'll tell her.
                         
          Gran walks up to Eep. Eep continues to blow her shell
          horn. Eep and Gran share a moment. Eep breaks into tears.
          Gran looks at her shell horn and BLOWS it loudly. Eep is
          happily surprised.
                         
          The whole family, even Guy, steps up next to Eep and
          begins BLOWING their shell horns.
                         
          It's clear from Eep's expression she has no intention of
          budging.
                         
                          EEP
           I never got to tell him.
                         
          Ugga appeals to Eep.
                         
                          UGGA
           Eep, if your Dad were here, he would tell
                          YOU TO--
                         
           GRUG (O.S.)

           Wow, you sound just like him.
                         
          Ugga looks up. Guy LOOKS UP. Everyone looks up!
                         
           GRUG (O.S.)
           GET OUT OF THE WAY!!!

           He's riding the Sun... but not very well.
           Everybody out of the way!
                         
          Grug CRASHES near the family. They run to meet him.
                         
                          THUNK
           Dad!

                          GRUG
           Ahhh! Where's the danger? Who blew their
           shell?
                         
          But all Grug sees is his astonished family staring back
          at him.
                         
          Eep RUNS to him, HUGS him ferociously, nearly knocking
          him down.
                         
                          EEP
           I love you too.
                         
          The rest of the Croods begin running to Grug. Grug hugs
          each of them like never before.
                         
                          GRUG

          Belt wants to be acknowledged as well.

           And a half.
                         
          All the animals join in hugging Grug.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           And eight, and nine.
          Douglas runs up and licks Thunk.
                         
                          THUNK
           Douglas! Dad you saved him!
                         
                          GRUG
           Well, a boys gotta have a pet.
                         
          Suddenly the group rises up as the Macawnivore stands
          near them.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Turns out, I'm a cat person.
                         
          Grug notices a TAIL sticking out of Chunky's mouth.
          90.

           Uh! No.
                         
          Chunky SPITS OUT the TRIP-GERBILS. He GRINS sheepishly.
          The TRIP-GERBILS run to Gran knocking her over in their
          excitement.
                         
                          EEP
           You really need to see this.
                         
          The whole family takes this amazing view in then looks to
          Grug for his decision.
                         
                          GRUG
           We should go there.
                         
                          DISSOLVE TO:
                         
                         
          SEQ. 3500 - EPILOGUE
                         
          RUSHING TOWARD A SHORELINE covered in dense palms, gentle
          waves lapping at the sand.
                         
          On Eep, fixing her hair. We PULL OUT to see the whole
          family preparing for a family photo.
                         
           EEP (V.O.)
           This is me. My name's Eep. And this, is
           my family. The Croods. If you weren't
           clued in by the sun tans and pets, we're
           not exactly cavemen anymore.
                         
          Grug has a wonderful picture making contraption they are
          about to experience. The slab of rock smacks them all in
          the face leaving the first family photo.
                          THUNK
           Let's do that again. I think I blinked.
                         
          BACK TO THE SHORELINE, RUSHING ever closer to the beach.
                         
                          EEP
           Our world is still plenty harsh and
           hostile. But now we know the Croods will
           make it.
                         
          ON BELT riding on the back of the Crocopup, delivering a
          drink to Gran, PULL OUT to reveal she is in a sled,
          hitched to a team of Liyotes. The liyotes are tending to
          her. Gran sips her drink.

          On Ugga sharpening a spear. The Macawnivore comes in to
          frame with Grug riding on top. Ugga tosses him the spear.
          Eep, flips from out of the trees. She blows her horn to
          call Guy and the BearOwl for a ride.
                         
                          EEP (CONT'D)
           And because of my dad, who taught us that
           anyone can change...
                         
          The Macawnivore LEAPS through the trees onto a broad,
          beautiful beach with Grug and Ugga atop.
                         
                          GRUG
           Release the baby!
                         
                          EEP
           Well, sort of.
                         
          Thunk breaks through the trees riding a LANDWHALE. Sandy
          and Belt are riding the Crocopup. Eep and Guy are riding
          the BearOwl.
                         
                          EEP (CONT'D)
           So from now on we'll stay out here.
                         
          The first camera picks them up as it reaches the beach.
          It FOLLOWS the Croods as they TURN and ride toward a
          sunrise.
                         
                          EEP (CONT'D)
           Where we can follow the light.

EXT. YUAN COMPOUND - DAY

Security men and porters are loading wagons for a convoy.
As they work, we see across the lake a lone horseman entering
the village.  One of the men recognizes him.

				WORKER
		Master Li is here!

ANGLE ON: Li Mu Bai, thirties, powerful and handsome.

In the background, old Aunt Wu, at the sight of Li Mu Bai,
drops her parcels and runs excitedly into the building.

INT. YUAN HALLWAY - DAY

Aunt Wu runs hurriedly through the halls.

				AUNT WU
		Shu Lien!

INT. YU'S ROOM - DAY

Yu, a beautiful woman in her early 30s, is finishing packing
for the convoy, wrapping a few small items in a linen
wrapper, as Aunt Wu bursts in.

				AUNT WU
		Li Mu Bai is here!

INT. YUAN PRACTICE HALL - DAY

				LI
		How's everything?

				AUNT WU
		Fine.  Please come in.

Yu sits, composed, as Aunt Wu ushers Li in.  Li carries a
large object, wrapped in silk.

Yu smiles.

				YU
		Mu Bai...It's been too long.

				LI
		It has.
			(he glances around
			the room)
		How's business?

				YU
		Good.  And how are you?

				LI
		Fine.

An awkward pause.

				YU
		Monk Zheng said you were at Wudan
		Mountain.  He said you were
		practicing deep meditation.

				LI
		Yes.

				YU
		The mountain must be so peaceful...
		I envy you.  My work keeps me so
		busy, I hardly get any rest.

				LI
		I left the training early.

				YU
		Why?  You're a Wudan fighter.
		Training is everything.

				LI
		During my meditation training... I
		came to a place of deep silence...
		I was surrounded by light... Time
		and space disappeared.  I had come
		to a place my master had never told
		me about.

				YU
		You were enlightened?

				LI
		No.  I didn't feel the bliss of
		enlightenment.  Instead... I was
		surrounded by an endless sorrow.  I
		couldn't bear it.  I broke off my
		meditation.  I couldn't go on.
		There was something... pulling me
		back.

				YU
		What was it?

				LI
		Something I can't let go of.  You
		are leaving soon?

				YU
		We're preparing a convoy for a
		delivery to Peking.

				LI
		Perhaps I could ask you to deliver
		something to Sir Te for me.

Li unwraps the object.  It is an ancient, astonishingly
beautiful sword.

				YU
		The Green Destiny Sword?  You're
		giving it to Sir Te?

				LI
		I am.  He has always been our
		greatest protector.

				YU
		I don't understand.  How can you
		part with it?  It has always been
		with you.

				LI
		Too many men have died at its edge.
		It only looks pure because blood
		washes so easily from its blade.

				YU
		You use it justly, you're worthy of
		it.

				LI
		It's time for me to leave it behind.

				YU
		So what will you do now?

Li doesn't reply.

				YU
		Come with me to Peking.  You can
		give the sword to Sir Te yourself.
		It'll be just like old times.

				LI
		First I must visit my master's
		grave.  It's been many years since
		Jade Fox murdered him.  I have yet
		to avenge his death.  And yet I'm
		thinking of quitting.  I must pray
		for his forgiveness.

				YU
		Join me once you have finished.  I
		can wait for you in Peking.

				LI
		Perhaps.

EXT. THE GATE TO PEKING. DAY

Customs officials have just finished checking the contents
in a row of carriages bearing the Sun Security insignia.
The caravan slowly passes through the checkpoint into the
boundaries of Peking.  Yu, riding a handsome horse and
clearly the leader, watches as her crew clears inspection.

				GUARDS
		Ok.  Pass.

				YU
		Thanks.  Let's go into the city.

EXT. OUTSIDE A DEPOT. DAY

Workers are busy unloading the contents from the carriages.
Boss Giao is checking off the merchandise -- a cargo of
medicinal herbs.

				GIAO
		Everything got here safely.  I'm
		much obliged.

				YU
		Just doing my job.

				GIAO
		Sun Security has been the best
		since your father started it.
		You're a credit to his memory.

				YU
		Thank you.

				GIAO
		I mean it.

EXT. DAY. PEKING

From a gray tiled roof, we can see Peking's magnificent grid
of houses extending miles and miles out, freshly painted by
the morning sun.

EXT. PEKING STREET. DAY

Dusty and congested as always, people, horses, and carriages
are fighting to get through the boulevards.

A group of jugglers perform at a corner.

Yu surveys the busy street from on top of her horse.

INT. TE'S GREAT HALL - DAY

Yu presents the sword to Sir Te.

				SIR TE
		This is Li's personal sword, a
		great hero's weapon!  He is the
		only one in the world worthy of
		carrying it.  It's too fine a gift.
		I cannot accept it.

				YU
		Sir Te!  It has brought him as much
		trouble as glory.  Help him to
		leave these troubles behind.
		Otherwise, he'll never be able to
		start anew.

				SIR TE
		All right.  I'll act as the sword's
		custodian.

De Lu, the head servant, enters.

				DE LU
		Governor Yu has arrived.

				SIR TE
		I must change.

				YU
			(getting up)
		You've always been so good to Li Mu
		Bai and me.  Please accept our
		thanks.

				SIR TE
		Please do not be such a stranger.
		You'll stay the night as my guest.
		Now, Shu Lien... tell me something.
		And forgive me for prying.  Your
		father was a great friend to me,
		and I think of you as my own
		daughter.

				YU
		Please, Sir Te, what is it?

				SIR TE
		Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and
		his warrior days... maybe he's
		trying to tell you something?

				YU
		I don't know...

				SIR TE
		Don't be coy.  I've always known
		about your feelings for each other.
		All these years, it's a shame...
		neither of you is brave enough to
		admit the truth to the other.
		You're both wasting precious time.

				YU
		I beg your pardon.  Li Mu Bai and I
		aren't cowards.

				SIR TE
		When it comes to emotions, even
		great heroes can be idiots.  Tell
		me if Li Mu Bai is not more open
		the next time you see him.  I'll
		give him an earful!

INT. TE'S STUDY - DAY

Yu and De Lu approach the study.

				DE LU
		Sir Te said to leave the sword in
		here.

De Lu opens the door and is startled to find a young woman
inside.  The woman is studying the sheets of calligraphy
hanging on the walls.

				DE LU
		Who are you?

				JEN
		I'm your guest today.  I am Governor
		Yu's daughter.

				DE LU
		This is Sir Te's study.  You are
		here to...

				JEN
		I was looking for a quiet corner.

				DE LU
		I am Sir Te's head servant.  And
		this is another of our guests.

INT. TE'S STUDY - DAY

Yu gently lays the sword, still in its sheath, in Jen's hands.

				JEN
		It's heavy for such a thin piece of
		metal!

				YU
		The handle is heavy.  And the blade
		is no ordinary metal.  Still, the
		sword is the lightest of weapons.
		You're just not used to handling it.

				JEN
		But I have had much practice.  As a
		child in the West, a platoon lived
		with us.  They'd let me play with
		their weapons.  The scabbard is so
		beautiful.

				YU
		Beautiful but dangerous.  Once you
		see it tainted with blood, its
		beauty is hard to admire.  It's 400
		years old.

				JEN
		Exquisite!  You said it belongs to...

				YU
		My friend Li Mu Bai.  He's given it
		to Sir Te as a gift.

				JEN
		Li Mu Bai!  The famous warrior?
		Why would he give his sword to Sir
		Te?

				YU
		You're too young to understand.

				JEN
		You're a sword fighter too?

Yu yanks the sword out of the sheath.  An eerie sound
resonates within the study.  Jen is even more impressed.

				YU
		Yes, I am.  But I prefer the
		machete.  Certain moves, however,
		call for a sword.

				JEN
		Really?

Yu puts the sword back in the case.

				JEN
			(longingly)
		It must be exciting to be a fighter,
		to be totally free!

				YU
		Fighters have rules too: friendship,
		trust, integrity... Without rules,
		we wouldn't survive for long.

				JEN
		I've read all about people like you.
		Roaming wild, beating up anyone who
		gets in your way!

				YU
		Writers wouldn't sell many books if
		they told how it really is.

				JEN
		But you're just like the characters
		in the stories.

				YU
		Sure.  No place to bathe for days,
		sleeping in flea-infested beds...
		They tell you all about that in
		those books?

				JEN
		You know what I mean.  I'm getting
		married soon, but I haven't lived
		the life I want.

				YU
		So I heard.  Congratulations.  It's
		the most important step in a
		woman's life, isn't it?

				JEN
		You're not married, are you?

				YU
		What do you think?

				JEN
		No!  You couldn't roam around
		freely if you were.

				YU
		You're probably right.

Yu studies Jen.  The room falls silent for a moment.

EXT. SIDE COURT YARD - DAY

It's dusk and the sky is beautiful orange and purple.  Jen
is leaving the study escorted by her maid.  She turns to Yu
for a final good-bye.  Yu seems intrigued by the encounter.

EXT. SIR TE'S COMPOUND - NIGHT

Two lighted lanterns are raised up.

INT. TE'S STUDY - NIGHT

Sir Te hands the sword to Governor Yu.

				SIR TE
		Go ahead, Governor Yu.

Governor Yu is impressed by the opulence and elegance of the
sword.  He closes his eyes to guess the weight of the sword.
Te snubs out the flame from a candle, then slides the sword
out from its sheath.  The sword gives off a luminous blue
glow in the dark.

				SIR TE
		Two feet 9 inches long.  1 inch
		wide.  The handle is 1 inch deep,
		2.6 inches wide.  Seven-tenths of
		an inch thick.  With seven rubies
		missing from the hilt.  You can
		tell the design dates back to
		before the Chin era.  Engraved with
		a technique lost by the time of the
		Han Dynasty.

				GOVERNOR YU
		Your knowledge is remarkable, Sir Te.

				SIR TE
		A sword by itself rules nothing.
		It comes alive only through skillful
		manipulation.

				GOVERNOR YU
		I see your point.  Please continue.

				SIR TE
		The Imperial Court isn't the
		problem.  With royalty and officials
		everywhere, the Royal Guard keeps
		security tight.  But Peking is not
		like the West.  Here, you'll find
		all sorts of characters.  Proceed
		with caution in your quest for law
		and order.  Don't depend only on
		the court.  Contacts in the Giang
		Hu underworld can ensure your
		position.  Be strong, yet supple.
		This is the way to rule.

INT. JEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

A maid warms her hands in a basin of hot water for Jen, then
walks over to Jen and helps remove her earrings.  Someone
knocks and the maid goes to answer the door.

				MAID
		Governess...

				GOVERNESS
		Let me do it.

The maid leaves as the governess enters the room.

				JEN
		Please sit.

				GOVERNESS
		I've made you silk pajamas.  Do you
		want to change into them?

				JEN
		Put them down.

				GOVERNESS
		I heard you met Shu Lien today.

				JEN
		Do you know her?

				GOVERNESS
		She's one of those.  Your mother
		would not want you consorting with
		her kind.

Jen shoots her an angry look.

				JEN
		I'll socialize with whomever I
		please.

				GOVERNESS
		Don't invite danger into your
		father's house.

She's about to say something, then thinks better of it.

				JEN
		I'm tired now.

				GOVERNESS
		Go to bed then.  Miss has grown up,
		and is getting married soon.  God
		knows what the future will bring.

				JEN
		It will be just the same.  Enough!
		I'm tired.

				GOVERNESS
		Autumn is coming.  I'll shut the
		windows for you.

The governess leaves.  Jen sits on the side of her bed,
thinking.

EXT. TE'S COMPOUND - NIGHT

A wide shot of the compound.  A patrol man greets Master Bo,
Sir Te's head of security.  The place is serene.

				MASTER BO
		Chilly, eh?

				NIGHTMAN
		Yes, Master Bo.

As Bo walks on, shadows rustle in a treetop in the background.

EXT./INT. INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF TE'S STUDY - NIGHT

A masked figure silently opens the window and enters the
room.  It moves swiftly to the sword case, opens it, and
wraps the sword.

Bo enters, sees the thief, who leaps up to the ceiling.  The
thief steps over Bo and out into the courtyard.  Bo tries to
stop the thief, who easily outwits him, jumping onto the
roof as Bo yells out.

				BO
		Someone help!  Stop him!  He's on
		the roof!  The sword's been stolen!
		Stop thief!  Stop him!

The thief skips a few times and jumps off to a side street.

Bo grabs a pole and runs, as gongs begin to sound, alerting
people to the theft.  People rush outside, Yu Shu Lien among
them.

EXT. PEKING STREET - NIGHT

Bo runs through the streets.  The thief is nowhere in sight.
Suddenly, there are sounds of weapons clashing.  Bo hurries
towards the source.

EXT. AN ALLEY OUTSIDE GOVERNOR YU'S COMPOUND - NIGHT

Bo is surprised to see the hooded figure battling with two
other fighters -- Tsai (male, 40s) and May, his daughter.

				TSAI
		It's Jade Fox!

				MAY
		We must avenge mother!

The hooded figure does a gravity defying flip and soars over
a wall, just as Bo arrives.

				BO
		Do something!  He's getting away!

EXT. PEKING ROOFTOP - NIGHT

The thief runs atop a roof -- right into Yu.  Yu and the
hooded figure face off.

				YU
		Return the sword, and I'll let you
		go.

The figure just regards her, slightly shifting weight.

Yu attacks, but the figure repels her.

				YU
		You've been trained at Wudan?

The figure answers by leaping to another rooftop.  Yu
catches up, and resumes her attack with a relentless series
of lightning-quick blows.

EXT. ALLEY OUTSIDE GOVERNOR YU'S COMPOUND - NIGHT

Bo follows Tsai and May, who are quickly walking away.

				TSAI
		You're mistaken.  We're just street
		performers.  We were rehearsing.

				MAY
		Father!

				BO
		You were rehearsing?  Who are you
		trying to fool?

May wants to respond but is again cut off by Tsai.  They run
off.

				BO
		Where did that thief go?

Bo looks around and discovers he had chased the thief into
Governor Yu's compound.

				BO
		Governor Yu's house!

EXT. ROOF TOP

Yu and the Black Figure continue to fight.

				YU
		Get down here!  Give back the sword!

EXT. GOVERNOR YU'S - NIGHT

Yu slowly gets the upper hand in her fight with the thief.
A small arrow cuts across the night and flies toward Yu.
She catches it, but the masked figure takes the opportunity
to get away.

Yu pauses to feel the arrow in her hand, standing in the
empty courtyard.

EXT. TE'S SIDE ENTRANCE - DAY

De Lu escorts Yu into Te's.

				DE LU
		Sir Te awaits you.

INT. TE'S GREAT HALL - DAY

Men are standing at attention.  Bo is giving his account of
what happened, as Yu enters.

				BO
		I'm sure the thief is in the Yu
		household.

				SIR TE
		How dare you imply?

				BO
		But I say --

				SIR TE
		-- Enough.

The men hustle out.  Bo can barely contain his frustration.

				YU
		Has Governor Yu ever seen the sword?

				SIR TE
		Yes, though I doubt he's involved
		in this.

				YU
		But the sword could be in his
		compound.

				SIR TE
		Then someone's trying to set him up.
		We should inform Li Mu Bai.

EXT. OUTSIDE GOVERNOR YU'S COMPOUND - NIGHT

Madam Yu is returning from temple.  The governess is helping
her out of the carriage.  Servants are peeling bills off a
wall across the street.

				MADAM YU
		What is it?

				MAID
		Madam Yu, someone's put up posters.

A partially torn flyer with the words "Jade Fox will not
escape justice!" is seen on the ground.

				MADAM YU
		Let me see.

				GOVERNESS
		Someone is after Jade Fox.
		Preposterous, looking for her here!

Madam Yu nods and walks inside, as the Governess tosses the
flyer away and follows her.

A hand scoops up the flyer -- it is Yu.  She studies it,
then puts it in her pocket, and moves on.

EXT. BRIDGE - DAY

Bo is searching for the Tsais.  The bridge is full of
jugglers.  But the two are nowhere to be found.

EXT. PEKING STREET - DAY

Bo quizzes a homeless man.

				BO
		Where are they?

				HOMELESS MAN
		I don't know.  I haven't seen them
		in two days.

Bo is about to give up when he looks up and sees May walking
quickly into an alley.  Bo follows her.

EXT. IN FRONT OF TSAI'S HOUSE

May walks into a dilapidated house surrounded by a broken-
down bamboo fence.  Bo inches closer and sees May and Tsai
oiling their weapons.

INT. BO'S ROOM - DAY

Jen practices calligraphy.  The governess is by her side
embroidering and throwing occasional glances at Jen.  The
maid enters.

				MAID
		There is a Miss Shu Lien here to
		see you.

Jen stops and looks up at them.

				GOVERNESS
		Miss is busy right now.

				MAID
		I'll tell her.

				JEN
		Show her in.

The governess shoots her a look.

				GOVERNESS
		This spells trouble.

				JEN
		I have a guest.

The governess gets up to leave just as the maid shows Yu in.

				MAID
		This way please.

The governess and Yu exchange quick glances.  The governess
bows slightly and departs.

				JEN
		I've missed you.

				YU
		How so?

				JEN
		I'm bored.

Yu sees the calligraphy.

				YU
		You're doing calligraphy?

				JEN
		I'll write your name.  Just for fun.

Jen writes Yu's name with great confidence and swiftness.

				YU
		I never realized my name looks like
		"sword."

Jen freezes slightly.

				YU
		You write gracefully.  Calligraphy
		is so similar to fencing.

				JEN
		Maybe it is.  I wouldn't know.

The maid enters with tea.

				JEN
		Please.

				YU
		Thank you for seeing me.  I hear
		your wedding day is near.  You must
		be overwhelmed by the preparations.

				JEN
		I'm hardly doing a thing.  The less
		I think of it the better.  My
		parents are arranging everything.
		The Gous are a very powerful family.
		My marrying one will be good for my
		father's career.

				YU
		You are fornuate to marry into such
		a noble family.

				JEN
		Am I?  I wish I were like the
		heroes in the books I read.  Like
		you and Li Mu Bai.  I guess I'm
		happy to be marrying.  But to be
		free to live my own life, to choose
		whom I love... That is true
		happiness.

				YU
		Do you think so?  Let me tell you a
		story.

				JEN
		About you and Li Mu Bai?

				YU
		Yes.  Did you know I was once
		engaged to be married?

				JEN
		No, really?

				YU
		His name was Meng Si Zhao.  He was
		a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath.
		One day, while in battle, he was
		killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai's
		enemy.  After, Li Mu Bai and I went
		through a lot together.  Our
		feelings for each other grew
		stronger.  But how could we dishonor
		Meng's memory?  So the freedom you
		talk about, I too desire it.  But I
		have never tasted it.

				JEN
		Too bad for Meng, but it's not your
		fault, or Li Mu Bai's.

				YU
		I am not an aristocrat, as you
		are... but I must still respect a
		woman's duties.

				JEN
		Don't distance us.  From now on,
		let's be like sisters.

				YU
		Then as a sister, let me wish you
		happiness in your marriage.

EXT. YU'S GARDEN - DAY

The maid escorts Yu out.  Yu pauses, looks around, and sees
the profile of the Governess peering at her from around a
corner.

INT. JEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

Moonlight spills into the room, as Jen rises sleeplessly
from bed and looks out the window.  A light breeze stirs her
hair.  The sound of the wind rises, and slowly her face
dissolves, into...

INT./EXT. CARRIAGE/MONGOLIAN DESERT - DAY

...the face of a younger, less sophisticated Jen, as she
lets the dry desert air flow through her hair.  She sits in
a carriage, part of a caravan, with guards on horseback,
that is traveling through the spectacular desert.  Across
from her sits her mother, of whom she is barely cognizant.

				MADAM YU
		What a godforsaken place!  Can't
		your father be appointed closer to
		civilization?  Jen... are you
		listening to me?

Jen is still looking out the side of the carriage, at a
beautiful mountainside.

INT. JEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

Jen sighs, and turns back toward her bed.

EXT. STREET OUTSIDE GOVERNOR YU'S COMPOUND - NIGHT

Tsai and May have been sitting, hidden in the branches of a
tree, watching Jen.

				TSAI
		Let's go!

They drop down silently and walk away.  From another rooftop,
Lo looks silently on.

EXT. TSAI'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Tsai and May enter the house.

INT. TSAI'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Inside the tiny house, they discover a hooded figure going
through their belongings.

Immediately Tsai throws a knife, which rips off the figure's
mask -- revealing Bo.  Tsai has another long knife at his
throat.

				TSAI
		Who are you?

				BO
		Wait!  I'm a friend!

Tsai pauses.

INT. TSAI'S HOUSE - NIGHT (LATER)

May fans a small coal-fired grill that is boiling a sizzling
pot of vegetable and meatball soup.  Her father and Bo are
now friendly dinner companions, much to May's delight.

				TSAI
		I don't care about your sword.

				BO
		Why were you spying on the Yus?

				TSAI
		I'm looking for someone.  Jade Fox.
		I'm a police inspector from Shaan
		Xi, Gen Su district.  Jade Fox is a
		master criminal.  I hear she
		infiltrated the Yus.  She must have
		come with them when they transferred
		here.  But with Yu's reputation, I
		can't just go in and accuse her.

				BO
		This Jade Fox is a woman?

				TSAI
		Yes.

				BO
		Then leave her to me.

				TSAI
		Pardon me, but I doubt you can
		handle her.  My wife was quite a
		martial arts expert.  Jade Fox
		killed her.  So you see, this is
		personal.  Leave her to me.

				MAY
		It's ready!
			(re: the soup)


				BO
		I'm ready for anything!

Bo fishes into the pot with his chopsticks.  May intercepts
him with her own chopsticks.

				MAY
		Father gets first dip.

Tsai stiffens and snaps his chopsticks, not to pick up a
meatball but to catch an incoming dart.  A dart wrapped with
a note.  Bo jumps up.

				TSAI
		They're gone.

				MAY
		What does it say?

				TSAI
		"We'll settle this at midnight on
		Yellow Hill."  Good, the fox is out
		of her hole.

INT. TE'S STUDY - NIGHT

Yu is ushered into the room, to discover Sir Te talking to
another man, whose back is to her.

				SIR TE
		Shu Lien, look who's here.

The man turns around -- it's Li Mu Bai.

EXT. TE'S HALL - NIGHT

Yu and Li Mu Bai sit together.

				LI
		Sir Te believes it's a ploy cast
		suspicion on Governor Yu.

				YU
		But something is going on at the Yu
		household.

				LI
		What have you discovered?

From her sleeve, Yu removes the flyer.  Li takes it, his
face darkening.

				LI
		Jade Fox?  Impossible.

				YU
		You always suspected she'd fled to
		the West.

				LI
		I didn't think she'd dare come back
		to Peking!

				YU
		Is there any place safer than under
		the nose of Governor Yu?

				LI
		So I shall avenge my master's death
		after all.

				YU
		Be careful.  Sir Te requires
		discretion.  Official business is
		difficult enough.  Don't let
		personal feelings make it worse.
		And I don't know... even this
		poster... could be some sort of trap.

				LI
		Did you see who posted it?

Yu pauses.

				YU
		No.

				LI
		It says Jade Fox is hiding at Yu's.
		On the night of the theft there was
		a brawl near Yu's.  Were you
		involved?

				YU
		It was Bo, Sir Te's man.  I hear he
		followed the thief to the Yus'.

				LI
		Have you questioned him yet?

				YU
		No, not yet...

				LI
		But your men are watching over Yu's
		compund?

				YU
		No, I'd already sent them home.
		You can blame me for losing the
		sword, but please trust that I'll
		get it back soon using my own
		methods.

				LI
		That's not what I meant.  I don't
		care about the sword.

				YU
		What do you mean?  Didn't you come
		back here for it?

				LI
		I don't know it was stolen until I
		got here.

				YU
		Then, why did you come?

				LI
		Well, we had talked...

De Lu enters.

				DE LU
		Pardon my intrusion.  Master Li,
		your room is ready.

				LI
		Thank you.  Please lead the way.

EXT. YELLOW HILL - NIGHT

Tsai, Bo, and May wait under an ancient tree.  Bo stifles a
yawn.

				BO
		The fox doesn't care much for
		punctuality.  Still no sign of her.

An old lady struggles up the hill, wearing a floppy hat over
her face, holding a cane.  The three exchange glances.

				TSAI
		Enough!  Show yourself.

The old woman shrinks in fear, but then throws off her
disguise and unveils herself -- the Governess.

				FOX
		Tsai... you dog!  You will pay for
		your stubbornness.

				BO
		That's what you think, old witch!

				TSAI
		If you surrender now, you'll suffer
		less.  But if you resist, I won't
		stop until you're dead.

				MAY
		Father!  Let me avenge my mother's
		death.

				FOX
		You'll soon end up like her, you
		little whore!

				BO
		You'll pay for that!

A fierce battle begins, the main fighting between Tsai and
Fox, with May and Bo getting a stab in occasionally, when
the opportunity presents itself.

				TSAI
			(to Bo)
		She's going to paralyze you!

Using acupressure, Fox disables Bo.  May shoots an arrow at
her, but she catches it and flings it back, hitting May.

				TSAI
		May!

Fox then disables Tsai, but just as she goes for the kill,
Li Mu Bai flies down from the treetops and steps between them.

				FOX
		Tsai, you filthy mongrel!  An ambush!

				MAY
		Father, are you all right?

Li addresses Fox.

				LI
		Wudan should have gotten rid of you
		long ago.  It's been a long time,
		Jade Fox!  You don't remember me...
		But you should remember my master.
		You infiltrated Wudan while I was
		away.  You stole our master!  Now
		it's time for you to pay!

				FOX
		Your master underestimated us women.
		Sure, he'd sleep with me, but he
		would never teach me.  He deserved
		to die by a woman's hand!

				LI
		You stole the secrets of Wudan's
		highest martial arts.  But after
		ten years of training, your moves
		are still undisciplined.  And
		today, under a Wudan sword... you
		will die!

Li easily brings Fox to the ground.

Li raises his sword to the prostrate Fox.  A figure masked
in black appears next to Fox, sword extended, saving her.

				FOX
		Disciple, we'll kill them all!

				FIGURE IN BLACK
		Let's go!

				BO
		Another one!

				FOX
		I must get rid of Tsai!

Fox fights Tsai, Bo, and May, as Li addresses the masked
figure.

				LI
		Who are you?  Why is the Green
		Destiny in your possession?

				FIGURE IN BLACK
		What's it to you?

				LI
		My name is Li Mu Bai.  The Green
		Destiny is mine.  Jade Fox can't be
		your master.  Where did you learn
		that "Xuan Piu" move?

				FIGURE IN BLACK
		I'm just playing around.

				LI
		Tell me, who is your master?

				FIGURE IN BLACK
		Let's go!

				FOX
		We must kill them!

Tsai throws his blade at Fox, who catches it and throws it
back, hitting him in the head.  Fox and the masked figure
leap away.

May drops to the ground, cradling her dead father's head.
Bo kneels beside her.

				MAY
		Father!

EXT. TE'S - DAY

Te and a group of his men look down as a cloth is removed
from over the body of Tsai.  Bo and May stand before them.

				TE
		This is Tsai?

				MAY
		My father.  Police Inspector from
		Shaan.

				TE
		This should be reported to Governor
		Yu.  The victim is an officer.  You
		believe the killer is hiding out in
		his compound.

				YU
		I'd bet my life on it!

				TE
			(to Li and Yu)
		Come with me.

He exits the room.

INT. TE'S STUDY - DAY

Te, Li, and Yu are seated.

				SIR TE
		This needs to be resolved, and
		quickly.

				LI
		I'll get into the Yu household and
		get her.  I'll ferret out Fox and
		her gang.

				YU
		We must be careful.  Governor Yu is
		a court official, and in charge of
		security.  Any disturbance will
		cast suspicion on him.  It might
		get Sir Te in trouble.

				SIR TE
		This is a delicate matter.

				YU
		Sir Te, can you find some excuse to
		invite Madam Yu and her daughter?

				SIR TE
		What do you have in mind?

				YU
		The best way to trap a fox is
		through her cubs.

Sir Te and Li look puzzled.

EXT. SIR TE'S GARDEN - DAY

Yu sits with Madam Yu and Jen.  They busy themselves with
various items for her trousseau.

				MADAM YU
		Madam Te is certainly spoiling us
		with these wedding gifts.  She's
		being so considerate.

				YU
		I'm sorry she's not feeling well
		enough to receive you today.

				MADAM YU
		I heard Sir Te lost something.  And
		now Madame Te's not feeling well...

Jen sits silently reading.

				YU
		We know who stole the missing item.
		If the thief returns it, I'm sure
		Sir Te will pursue the matter no
		further.

				MADAM YU
		That's good.  Sometimes the help
		can't keep their hands to themselves.
		It's very embarassing.

				YU
		Sir Te knows that even well-meaning
		people can make mistakes... that
		can bring ruin to themselves and
		their families.

				MADAM YU
		But don't be too lenient.

				YU
		No mercy will be shown toward the
		murderer who turned up in Peking.

				MADAM YU
		A murderer?

				YU
		Yes.  The very killer of Li Mu
		Bai's own master.  Last night, she
		killed a policeman who had tracked
		her down.

				MADAM YU
		A female criminal!  Now that's news!

Jen becomes visibly upset.

				JEN
		You say she killed a policeman?

				YU
		Yes, from the West.  He went
		undercover and and followed her
		here,

				MADAM YU
		Maybe the murderer and the thief
		are one and the same.

				YU
		I doubt it.  This thief... it very
		unusual...

As Yu speaks, she lifts the tea pot to pour Jen some tea.
As she finishes speaking, she looks into Jen's face and the
pot slips from her hand.  Without even looking down, Jen
instinctively catches the pot with a lightning-fast move.

				YU
		...And most likely smarter than a
		mere killer.

Sir Te and Li Mu Bai walk by.

				JEN
			(formal)
		Greetings, Sir Te.

				SIR TE
		Hello, Madam Yu.  This is Li Mu
		Bai, the renowned swordsman.

				LI
		Delighted to meet you.

Li sizes Jen up.

				TE
		Miss Yu is soon to be married.

				LI
		Congratulations.

EXT. TSAI'S HOUSE - NIGHT

May opens her door, only to find Bo standing guard.

				MAY
		Why don't you come in?

				BO
		I'm standing guard.

				MAY
		Come in.  It's cold.

She turns back inside, hesitates, then turns back to him.

				MAY
		Come in.  We don't have to fear
		Jade Fox if we're together.

EXT. TE COMPOUND - NIGHT

A still, dark night.

EXT. TE'S STUDY - NIGHT

Something moves in the moonlight.  A hooded figure jumps down.

Li Mu Bai, who had been hiding in the shadows, comes forward.

				LI
		Isn't it a bit too late to be out?
		You've brought me the sword?

				FIGURE
		I do as I please.

The masked figure lunges away, but Li Mu Bai leaps with
incredible speed and grabs the sword from her.

				LI
		Where's your master?

				FIGURE
		What's it to you?

The figure floats away.  Li chases after her.

EXT. PEKING STREET - NIGHT

The two fly over houses and bounce off of rooftops,
displaying amazing floating skills.

INT. ABANDONED MONASTERY - NIGHT

The figure bounces into an old monastery.  Li is already
there.

				LI
		Had enough flying?  You've got
		potential.  You've studied the
		Wudan Manual but you don't
		understand it.  You need a real
		master.

The figure doesn't respond, but we sense the pride in her
eyes.

				FIGURE
		Do you think you are a real master?

				LI
		Like most things, I am nothing.
		It's the same for this sword.  All
		of it is simply a state of mind.

				FIGURE
		Stop talking like a monk!  Just
		fight!

				LI
		Then tell me where Jade Fox is.

				FIGURE
		On guard!

				LI
		Real sharpness comes without effort.

EXT. MONASTERY - NIGHT

The figure leaps into the garden, but again, Li is ahead of
her.

The figure attacks Li, who uses his agility to evade her.
Frustrated, the figure intensifies her attack.

The figure, losing composure, attacks wildly.  Li gets even
more elusive, using a branch to repel her.

				LI
		No growth without assistant.  No
		action without reaction.  No desire
		without restraint.  Now give
		yourself up and find yourself again.
		There is a lesson for you.

Li now holds the stick to her mask, gently raising it
slightly.

				FIGURE
		Go ahead.

				LI
		Why should I?  You need practice.
		I can teach you to fight with the
		Green Destiny, but first you must
		learn to hold it in stillness.

				FIGURE
		Why do you want to teach me?

				LI
		I've always wanted a disciple
		worthy of Wudan's secrets.

				FIGURE
		And if I use them to kill you?

				LI
		That's a risk I'm willing to take.
		Deep down, you're good.  Even Jade
		Fox couldn't corrupt you.

The figure's eyes cloud with tears.

				FIGURE
		Wudan is a whorehouse!  Keep your
		lessons!

The figure swirls and takes off, leaving a rueful Li standing
alone in the monastery.

INT. JEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

Jen slips in through the window.  She pulls off her mask, as
she spots the Governess/Fox sitting and sewing.

				FOX
		You're home late... or should I say
		early?

				JEN
		Why are you still here?  You killed
		a policeman.  You should leave!
		You'll bring ruin on my whole family.

				FOX
		They wouldn't have found me if you
		hadn't stolen the sword.  Like a
		little girl, you thought stealing
		would be fun?  You, too, are
		responsible for that death.  Come
		with me.  You don't want to waste
		your life as the wife of some
		bureaucrat.  Denied your talent...
		As a master and disciple we will
		rule.

				JEN
		I'll never live as a thief!

				FOX
		You're already a thief.

				JEN
		That was just for fun.  How can I
		leave?  Where would I go?

				FOX
		Wherever we want.  We'll get rid of
		anyone in our way.  Even your father.

				JEN
		Shut up!

				FOX
		It's the Giang Hu fighter
		lifestyle... kill or be killed.
		Exciting, isn't it?

				JEN
		I owe you nothing.

				FOX
		Yes, you do!  You are still my
		disciple.

Jen lunges at the Governess, and the two exchange a few
blows.  Jen presses her finger against one of the Governess's
pressure points, disabling her.  Jen pushes her across the
room.

				JEN
		You think you've been teaching me
		all these years from the manual?
		You couldn't even decipher the
		symbols!

				FOX
		I studied the diagrams.  But you
		hid the details!

				JEN
		You wouldn't have understood, even
		if I had tried to explain.  You
		know... you've gone as far as you
		can go.  I hid my skills so as not
		to hurt you.

				FOX
		If I hadn't seen you fight with Li
		Mu Bai, I'd still be ignorant of
		all you've hidden from me.

				JEN
		Master... I started learning from
		you in secret when I was 10.  You
		enchanted me with the world of
		Giang Hu.  But once I realized I
		could surpass you, I became so
		frightened!  Everything fell apart.
		I had no one to guide me, no one to
		learn from.

				FOX
		Believe me, I've a lesson or two
		left to teach you!

Fox exits.

EXT. GOVERNOR YU'S GATE - DAY

The Governess leaves, a small sack over her back.

EXT. TE'S COURTYARD - DAY

Li practices fluently with Green Destiny in hand, beautifully
at ease with the weapon.  He spins around to find Yu standing
in the doorway.

				YU
		The sword is back... are you happy?

Li smiles.

				LI
		I admit, getting it back makes me
		realize how much I'd missed it.

				YU
		But it's not your sword anymore.
		You gave it to Sir Te.

				LI
		True.  But I must borrow it for one
		last mission.  Jade Fox must die at
		its edge.  Did you know what you
		were hiding when you covered for
		that girl?

				YU
		My job was to get the sword back,
		without embarassing anyone.  I
		wasn't about to ruin her life, or
		her father's.

				LI
		You did your job well.  But, this
		girl... I saw her last night.

				YU
		I knew she would intrigue you.

				LI
		She needs direction... and training.

				YU
		She's an aristocrat's daughter.
		She's not one of us.  In any case,
		it will all be over soon.  You'll
		kill Fox, and she'll marry.

				LI
		That's not for her.  She should
		come to Wudan and become a disciple.

				YU
		But Wudan does not accept women.

				LI
		For her, they might make an
		exception.  If not, I'm afraid
		she'll become a poisoned dragon.

				YU
		It's not our affair.  Even if Wudan
		accepts her, her husband might
		object.

				LI
		I thought by giving away the sword,
		I could escape the Giang Hu world.
		But the cycle of bloodshed continues.

				YU
		I wish there were something more I
		could do to help you.

				LI
		Just be patient with me, Shu Lien.

INT. JEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

Jen is asleep.  A noise awakens her.

Lo opens the window and sneaks in -- right into the point of
Jen's waiting sword.

Jen's sword drops to the ground.

				JEN
		Lo?

				LO
		Jen!

Lo grabs her by the wrist.

				JEN
		You shouldn't have come.

				LO
		With all the traffic on your
		rooftop these days... it took me a
		while to get in here.  I can't wait
		any longer.  I was wrong to let you
		go.  Come back with me.  You'll be
		happy in the desert.  You'll be
		free there.

Jen turns back to him and rests herself briefly in his arms
again.

				JEN
		You've been looking for me all this
		time?

FLASHBACK: FOUR YEARS EARLIER

INT./EXT. CARRIAGE/MONGOLIAN DESERT - DAY

Jen holds up a comb, with daylight shining through it.  Jen
admires the piece, her most prized possession.

Madam Yu sits opposite her.

				MADAM YU
		Jen... stop playing with it.

Jen looks out over the desert, as the wind picks up and the
sky darkens.

				JEN
		I won't break it.

EXT. CARRIAGE/MONGOLIAN DESERT - DAY

Lo and a group of armed bandits descend on the caravan.

				GUARD A
		It's Dark Cloud!  Dark Cloud is
		coming!

His warning is useless.  From Jen's pov, we see the guards
slaughtered in a hail of arrows and swords.

				MADAM YU
		Lower the shade, don't let them see
		you!

				DARK CLOUD (LO)
		Don't touch the women!

Though unharmed, Madam Yu immediately faints.  Lo approaches
the carriage and grabs the comb from Jen's hand.

She bolts from the carriage, and, once outside, bends down
and grabs a lance from the body of a dead guard, whose horse
flails beside him.

She looks up to see the gang of bandits already making their
escape on horseback.

				LO
		Let's go!

EXT. DESERT - DAY

Jen and Lo ride across the desert floor at breakneck speed.

				LO
		Come get your comb.

She tries to jab him with the lance, but he grabs it and
flings her off her horse.

				LO
		Hurry back to your mother.

Lo rides on as she charges after her horse.

EXT. DESERT BLUFF - DAY

A group of bandits is dividing up the loot, as Jen rides up,
keeping a respectable distance.  They notice her and rise as
she dismounts.

One of them saunters over to her and stands, grinning, a few
feet away.

In a second, she's slammed his balls into his stomach and
knocked his nose into his face.  He crumples to the sand.

The other bandits stop laughing, quickly exchange glances,
and charge her at once.

In a matter of seconds, they're either on the ground or
dragging their fallen comrades back.

Lo calls out and stops the fight.

				LO
		She's mine.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

Lo and Jen ride, if not side-by-side, then parallel, about
20 feet apart.  Their pace has slowed considerably.  In
fact, they're dead tired.

				LO
		Let's stop a moment.

				JEN
		Give it back!

				LO
			(shouting a bit)
		You're tired.  You need rest.  Your
		horse needs water.  There's a creek
		up here.

He dismounts, looks down at the dry creek bed.

				LO
		Well, there used to be!  What's
		your name?  I'm Lo.  The Hans call
		me Dark Cloud.  I'm not that tall
		or big, but I'm quick as lightning.

				JEN
		My comb!

She kicks him.  They fight ferociously until Lo, exhausted,
collapses.  She kicks him a few times, then collapses too.

INT. CAVE - DAY

Jen comes to and finds herself wrapped in a blanket of
animal fur.  She sits up with a start and checks her clothes.
Looking around, she realizes she's in a cave.  Next to her
are a lamp, some hunting equipment, and a neat row of sharp
arrows.  She quickly grabs one of the arrows.

				LO
		If you like that arrow, I can make
		you a bow.  Great for hunting wild
		chicken.  They're delicious.

Jen raises one of the arrows, going on the attack again, but
her legs betray her and she falls.

				LO
		You need to eat, understand?  Then
		you'll have the strength to fight.
		Understand?

He helps her up, then pours her some horse milk from a sac.
He hands her a small chunk of food, which she first accepts
grudgingly, then, her hunger getting the better of her, she
starts to wolf it down.

				LO
		You're eating too fast.  Slowly.

EXT. CAVE - DAY

Lo walks out into a barren mountain landscape.  A chicken
roasts over a fire.  Lo whistles.

Jen appears suddenly with a rock and knocks it over his head.
Lo passes out as Jen scurries away.

EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE AND DESERT - DAY

Jen tries to find her way among the treacherous stony
terrain, her lips chapped and fingers bloody and blistered.
But soon she passes out.

INT. CAVE - NIGHT

Jen again awakes inside the cave.  Lo tries to feed her some
water, but she chokes, and tries to push him away, only to
find that her legs and hands are tied up.

				LO
		You've got quite a temper.  It's
		better this way.

				JEN
		You coward!

				LO
		Still in a bad mood?  At least
		you're speaking.  What's your name?

Jen spits at Lo.

				LO
		I didn't think the Hans had names
		like that.

Later: She weaves in and out of consciousness.  In the
flickering lights, she sees Lo sharpening his arrows.

Later, he pulls back an opaque curtain to reveal a makeshift
bathroom -- a water-filled cavity serves as a tub.

He rises as Jen sobs at the sight of her imprisoned and
dishevelled body.  He comes over and unties her.

				LO
		Relax.  If I had wanted to, I would
		already have done it.  You must be
		dying for a bath.  Fresh water's
		hard to get here.  But I managed to
		bring some up.  You can wear my
		clothes when you're done.  They're
		clean.  Don't worry.  I'll sing, so
		you'll know where I am.  After the
		bath, you'll be calmer.

Jen nods and the bandit releases her.  He starts to sing as
he walks out.  Jen waits until the sound recedes before
closing the curtain behind her and dipping into the pit.
While she bathes, she listens to his singing, a loud
rendition of a tribal song.  Lo apparently doesn't remember
all the lyrics, and la-las his way through more than a few
passages.  Jen smiles.

INT. CAVE - NIGHT

Jen grimaces as Lo pulls the last of some cactus needles
from the soles of her feet.

				LO
		No more hitting on the head!  All
		this trouble for a comb?

				JEN
		It's mine.  It means a lot to me.
		A barbarian like you wouldn't
		understand.

				LO
		Not true.  I can use it to pick
		fleas from my horse.

				JEN
		By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.

				LO
		I'm sorry... I guessed wrong.  I
		though you were a Han.

				JEN
		Give me back my comb.

				LO
		I don't take orders from anyone.

				JEN
		Give it back.

Jen impulsively grabs an arrow and stabs Lo, drawing a
little blood from his chest.  Furious, Lo lunges at her and
they tussle briefly.  Finally, Lo gets on top of Jen, and
the scuffling becomes more like foreplay.  Violence turns
into unleashed passion.

EXT. DESERT OASIS - DAY

Lo and Jen ride across the desert.  Jen holds tightly to him.

EXT. CAVE - NIGHT

Lo and Jen lie in the bath together.

				LO
		When I was a boy, one night, I saw
		a thousand shooting stars.  I
		thought, where did they all go?
		I'm an orphan.  I used to look for
		stars alone.  I thought if I rode
		to the other end of the desert, I'd
		find them.  I've been riding in the
		desert ever since.

				JEN
		And so, the little boy became a
		fearsome bandit.  He couldn't find
		the stars, so he stole my comb.

Lo pauses.

				LO
		Out here, you always fight for
		survival.  You have to be part of a
		gang to stand a chance.  Slowly,
		your gang becomes your family.  All
		that Dark Cloud stuff is just to
		scare people and make my life easier.

				JEN
		So you're still that little boy
		looking for shooting stars.

				LO
		I am a man.  And now I've found the
		brightest star of all.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

Lo sees uniformed men through his binoculars.

				LO
		Your father's men are looking for
		you.

Jen doesn't respond.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

Lo and Jen ride through a mountain pass.

EXT. CLIFF - DAY

Lo and Jen stand at the crest of a cliff.  Lo looks over,
viewing the desert valley below, as Jen joins him.  They see
a troop of uniformed men riding by in the distance.

				LO
		Your father's men are still looking
		for you.  They're still out there,
		circling closer.

				JEN
		Let them look.

				LO
		It is trouble for me.

Jen bites her lip.

				JEN
		Don't send me back!

				LO
		You must decide.  You might get
		tired of this life.  You might
		begin to miss your family.  If it
		were our daughter, we'd look for
		her too.  She would miss us.  Jen...
		I want you to be mine forever.  I
		will make my mark on the world.  I
		will earn your parents' respect.
		We have a legend.  Anyone who dares
		to jump from the mountain, God will
		grant his wish.  Long ago, a young
		man's parents were ill, so he
		jumped.  He didn't die.  He wasn't
		even hurt.  He floated away, far
		away, never to return.  He knew his
		wish had come true.  If you believe,
		it will happen.  The elders say, "A
		faithful heart makes wishes come
		true."

INT. TENT - DAY

Jen and Lo kiss.  Jen takes the jade comb out of her hair
and presses it into his palm.  Jen starts to cry.  They
embrace.

				JEN
		Keep it safe.  Return it to me when
		we are together again.

				LO
		I will.

				JEN
			(smiling painfully)
		If you don't, I'll come after you.
		And I won't let you off so easy.

EXT. TENT - DAY

Jen quietly walks out and stands sadly in the early morning
light.

End of flashback.

INT. JEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

				LO
		Wherever I went, someone always
		recognized me.  I really tried.
		Later, I heard you came to Peking.
		I was afraid I'd never see you
		again.  So I came.  I can't let you
		marry.

Jen is about to respond when a servant's voice is heard from
outside the door.

				JEN
			(whispering)
		Go.

				LO
		Jen...

				JEN
			(through her tears)
		Don't ever come back.

Lo hovers at the window frame.

				LO
		So it's over?

Jen pauses.

				JEN
		Yes.

Lo thrusts a small object in her hand.

He lifts his legs through the window, and drops out of
sight, just as Jen's door is opened from the hall.

				MAID
		We heard noises.

				JEN
		It was just a cat.

The maid pauses, then dutifully exits, closing the door.

Jen opens up her palm; gasping, she sees the comb that Lo
has given her.

EXT. WEDDING PROCESSION - DAY

The noise and color of a wedding procession.  A marching
band heralds the occasion, as throngs of onlookers fight to
get a glimpse of the groom, Gou Jun Pei, who trots by on a
handsome white horse.

INT. WEDDING CARRIAGE - DAY

Jen's head is completely covered in red cloth, as she rides
silently in the bride's carriage.

EXT. BALCONY OVERLOOKING WEDDING PROCESSION - DAY

Li and Yu watch the festivities from a balcony of the city
gate.

				YU
		You think Jade Fox will show up?

				LI
		She's out there, but I doubt she'll
		show herself.  We'll keep our eyes
		open.  Sooner or later, she'll come
		for the girl.

INT. WEDDING CARRIAGE - DAY

A small arrow flies into the carriage.  Jen calmly lifts the
red cloth from her face and pulls the arrow out of the
panelling inside the carriage.

We hear Lo's voice from outside the carriage, but Jen
doesn't seem to notice.

				LO
			(v.o.)
		Jen!  Come with me!  You're mine!

Lo runs wildly into the crowd.

				LO
		Come with me to the desert!  Jen!
		Come with me to Xin Jiang!

The guards surround Lo, but he escapes.

EXT. BEIJING STREET - DAY

Lo leaps and lands right in front of Li Mu Bai, his fingers
pressed against Lo's neck.  Yu comes running around the
corner and sees them.

				LI
		Where is Jade Fox?

Yu jumps in and pushes Li away.

				YU
			(to Lo)
		Come with me!  Hurry!

INT. CITY OUTSKIRTS - DAY

Lo sits dejectedly, having told his story to Yu and Li, who
look him over.

				YU
			(to Lo)
		You thought she'd give it all up
		and go back West with you?

				LO
		She's mine.

				LI
		Either way, you are no good to her
		dead.  With the Gou and Yu clans
		hunting you, you'll soon be in
		their hands.

				LO
		I don't care anymore.

				LI
		If you truly loved her, you wouldn't
		say that.

				YU
		Don't you want to see her again.

				LI
		All right.  I'll write you an
		introduction.  Take it to Wudan.
		Wait there for news from me.

				LO
		All right.

EXT. TE COMPOUND - NIGHT

Yu and Li enter, as other men and women race through the
compound, a sense of panic in the air.  Yu gives Li a look.
Li shrugs.

INT. TE'S HALL - NIGHT

A crowd, including Li and Yu, stand by as Te opens the empty
sword case, his voice rising.

				SIR TE
		When will this end?  They take it,
		they put it back, they take it
		again.  My home is turning into a
		warehouse.

Bo bursts into the hall, bows to Te.

				TE
		Speak!

				BO
		Jen has run away!  Gou found the
		wedding chamber empty.  Governor Yu
		requests your assistance.  You know
		the Giang Hu underworld.  He wants
		to find her, and keep her from harm.

				LI
		Sir Te, leave this to us.  Don't
		worry.

INT. TEA STALL - DAY

Jen arrives at the tea stall.  She places her sword on the
table, which catches the attention of a couple of Giang Hu
martial arts characters sitting nearby.

				WAITRESS
		What can I serve you?

As the waitress turns to leave, Jen grabs her by the arm.

				JEN
		The cup is dirty.

The flustered waitress apologizes and takes the cup away.
The men approach Jen.

				GANGSTER A
		Hello.  What is your name?

				JEN
			(without lifting her eyes)
		Long.

				GANGSTER B
		It's young Master Long.  My
		apologies.  I'm Iron Eagle Sung and
		this is my brother in arms, Flying
		Cougar Li Yun.  What brings you to
		Huai An, and where are you headed,
		Master Long?

				JEN
		Anywhere there's action.

The two men exchange glances.

				GANGSTER A
		In that case, perhaps we could be
		of assistance.

				JEN
		Don't bother.

				GANGSTER A
		You don't seem to understand.

				JEN
		So what if I don't?

				GANGSTER B
		We have ways of helping you
		understand.

The two pull out their weapons which are immediately chopped
into scraps by Jen.

				GANGSTER A
			(stunned)
		Are you related to Li Mu Bai?

				JEN
		He is my defeated foe!

EXT. WOODS - DAY

Li and Yu pass a cup back and forth as Bo tends to the
horses in the background.

				YU
		Have some tea.

As Yu passes the cup to Li, their fingers touch.
Embarrassed, Li pulls back.

				LI
		Shu Lien... The things we touch
		have no permanence.  My master
		would say... there is nothing we
		can hold on to in this world.  Only
		by letting go can we truly possess
		what is real.

				YU
		Not everything is an illusion.  My
		hand... wasn't that real?

				LI
		Your hand, rough and callused from
		machete practice... All this time,
		I've never had the courage to touch
		it.

Li takes Yu's hand and presses it to his face.

				LI
		Giang Hu is a world of tigers and
		dragons, full of corruption... I
		tried sincerely to give it up but I
		have brought us only trouble.

				YU
		To repress one's feelings only
		makes them stronger.

				LI
		You're right, but I don't know what
		to do.  I want to be with you...
		just like this.  It gives me a
		sense of peace.

Li Mu Bai smiles.

INT. STAR RESTAURANT - DAY

Jen walks upstairs.  A waiter greets her.

				WAITER
		Please follow me.

				JEN
		I want a clean room.

				WAITER
		We have plenty.  Your order?

Jen again sets her sword on the table as she sits down.

				JEN
		Steamed whole cod, bite-size
		meatballs, a little starchy, but
		keep the sauce light, shark fin
		soup, mixed vegetables, and some
		warm wine.

				WAITER
			(dazed)
		I have to order from a bigger
		restaurant.

				JEN
		Hurry then.

The waiter gauges Jen for an instant before bouncing off to
place the orders.  Jen checks her pouch and sees there's not
much money left.

A large group of Giang Hu characters enters.  They survey
the restaurant and quickly find Jen upstairs.

				GIANG HU A
		That's him.

				MI BIAO
		I am Iron Arm Mi.  I heard a true
		master has arrived.  I have come to
		seek a lesson.

Jen ignores him.

				MI BIAO
			(bristles)
		You asked for it!

Mi charges and attacks Jen, who is still sitting sipping tea.
Jen barely lifts a finger and disposes of Mi with a poke at
a sensitive pressure point.  This provokes a reaction from
the other men.

				JEN
		What kind of Iron Arm are you?

				FLYING MACHETE CHANG
		You have amazing technique!  I am
		Flying Machete.  Are you related to
		Southern Crane?

				JEN
		Southern Duck?  I don't eat anything
		with two feet.  Who could remember
		such long-winded names?

				GOU JUN SIHUNG
		Li Mu Bai is your defeated foe, and
		you don't know his master, Southern
		Crane?

				JEN
		Who are you?

				GOU JUN SIHUNG
		I'm Shining Phoenix Mountain Gou.

				JEN
			(furious)
		Gou?  I hate that name.  It makes
		me puke!  Too bad you're named Gou.
		You'll be the first to feel my
		sword today.

Jen leaps up and dives into battle.  The men all use
different kinds of weapons, but they all succumb to the
powerful Green Destiny.

				MONK JING
		Hold it!  Don't you know Monk Jing?

				JEN
		A monk, in a place like this?  You
		need a lesson!

				MONK JING
		Who are you?

She smiles, and leaps again into action after unsheathing
the Green Destiny.

				JEN
		Who am I?  I am... I am the
		Invincible Sword Goddess.  Armed
		with the Incredible... Green
		Destiny.  Be you Li or Southern
		Crane... lower your head... and ask
		for mercy.  I am the desert dragon.
		I leave no trace.  Today I fly over
		Eu-Mei.  Tomorrow... I'll kick over
		Wudan Mountain!

Jen is in a frenzy, slashing and maiming as she speaks.

INT. STAR RESTAURANT - DAY

Yu and Li are surrounded by the variously bandaged men who
battled with Jen.

				FLYING MACHETE CHANG
		We politely asked for a friendly
		match, but she showed no respect,
		and attacked us.  Everyone came by
		to teach her a lesson.

				MI BIAO
		Her sword was just too powerful.

				MONK JING
		I've traveled everywhere, but never
		met anyone so uncivilized.

				SHINING PHOENIX MOUNTAIN GOD
			(heavily bandaged)
		She kept accusing me of being Gou
		Jun Pei's brother.  Who is this
		Gou, anyway?

				YU
		Her husband.

The men all nod their heads.

EXT. OUTSIDE HWAI AN - DAY

Li and Yu ride together.

				LI
			(to Yu)
		We're close to your headquarters.
		Go home and check in.

				YU
		What about you?

				LI
		I'll look around and catch up later.

				YU
		Not a bad idea.  Tonight we'll get
		a good night's sleep at headquarters.

Yu takes a fork off the road.  Thunder can be heard in the
darkening sky.

EXT. SUN COMPOUND - DAY

A group of security men are practicing Kung Fu in the front
yard of Sun Security.  They stop when Yu enters.

				SECURITY MAN A
		Mistress, you're back.

				YU
		It's you!  How's everything here?

				CAPTAIN
		Fine.  You've been gone a while.

				YU
		Yes, and I leave again tomorrow.
		Your wife was due?

				AH WAI
		Yeah, a baby girl.

				YU
		Good!

				AH WAI
		I'll be happy if she's half as
		strong as you.

				YU
		Mrs. Wu...

				AUNT WU
		You're back!

				YU
		How's the arm?  Still sore?

				AUNT WU
		Much better.  You've been gone so
		long.

				YU
		Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the
		night.

				AUNT WU
			(excited)
		I'll go and make up his room!

Aunt Wu hustles out.  Yu goes into her own room.

INT. HALL OF ANCESTRAL WORSHIP

Yu lights incense for her former fiancé Meng.  Hearing
something, she turns to see a dishevelled Jen standing
outside downstairs.

				JEN
		Sister Shu Lien...

INT. YU'S ROOM - DAY

Yu eases her guard, then opens a drawer, and takes out some
clothes.  Jen, wearing just white underclothing, sets
herself on the edge of Yu's bed.  Yu brings over the clothes.

				YU
		Here you must be in proper attire.

				JEN
		I'm just borrowing some clean
		clothes.  I'm not staying.

				YU
		I'll give them to you.

				JEN
		I was just passing by and wondered
		how you were.

Jen tries to hide her anxiety but finally breaks down on
Yu's shoulder in tears.

				JEN
		You, sister...

				YU
		Look at the trouble you've caused.
		Now you know what Giang Hu life is
		really like.  If you think of me as
		your sister, let me give you some
		sisterly advice.  You can run from
		marriage, but not your parents.

				JEN
		They forced me to marry!

				YU
		Go back to them first.  Then you
		can decide about Lo.

				JEN
		You know about Lo?

				YU
		He really loves you.  Come back to
		Peking with me.  We'll find a
		solution.

				JEN
		Where is he now?

				YU
		Li Mu Bai has made arrangements.
		He sent him to Wudan Mountain.

				JEN
		You're working together to set me
		up!  I'm leaving!

				YU
		How dare you accuse us?  I always
		knew you had stolen the sword!
		I've done nothing but protect you
		and your family.  And you're repaid
		me with nothing but contempt.  Li
		Mu Bai himself spared you, and all
		you do is insult him.  We wanted
		some peace and you've ruined it all!
		You're no sister of mine!

				JEN
		What do I care?  You were never a
		real friend anyway.  But I wonder,
		how long could you last as my enemy?

Jen gets up to leave.  Yu intercepts her.

				YU
		Put the sword down!

Jen jumps out.

INT. YUAN COURTYARD - DAY

Jen soars out to the front courtyard where the guards are
still practicing.

They raise their weapons at the sight of an intruder.

				YU
			(calling out)
		Jen!

Jen greets Yu with the Green Destiny.

				YU
		Everyone out.  Shut the doors.

The men leave.

				YU
		Fine... the friendship is over.

Yu scoops up a weapon from one of many lying around and
begins her battle with Jen.

Yu uses every weapon that's available against Jen but none
are any match for the Green Destiny.

After slicing through another set of Yu's weapons, Jen looks
admiringly at the Green Destiny in her hands.

				YU
		Don't touch it!  That's Li Mu Bai's
		sword.

				JEN
		Come and get it if you can.

				YU
		Without the Green Destiny, you are
		nothing.

				JEN
		Don't be a sore loser.  Go ahead.
		Take your pick.  I'll wait.  Go
		ahead.

Yu picks up a huge broad sword and attacks.  Just as the
Green Destiny slices it in half, Yu holds the broken blade
at Jen's neck.  She pauses before hurting Jen, then pulls
back.

				YU
		Give me the sword.

Jen, taking advantage of Yu's trust, slices her arm.

				JEN
		Take it!

Yu, her shoulder bleeding, falls back as Li Mu Bai jumps in.

				LI
			(enraged)
		Stop it!  You don't deserve the
		Green Destiny.

				JEN
		Not another lecture!  On guard!

				LI
		Let's end this here.

				JEN
		Only the sword will settle this.

Jen soars up to the rooftop, with Li right on her tail.

EXT. LAKE - DAY

Jen floats over the lake, Li close behind.

EXT. BAMBOO FOREST - DAY

Jen runs into a sea of bamboo.  She appears to have lost Li
but is not slowing down.  Her white clothes are now stained
with blood and mud.  The wind had picked up and every breeze
sounds like an air attack by Li.

The two leap onto the tips of the bamboo trees and begin
their dances and dodges.  They glance off bamboos and each
other while staying afloat.  Finally Jen lands on the same
stick of bamboo as Li.  The two hold their positions for a
while, as the bamboo bends.

				LI
		I only let you go because I wanted
		to see the real you.

Jen tries to shake Li off the bamboo but Li recovers nicely.

				JEN
		What do you know about a true heart?

Li suddenly leaps off the bamboo tree.  The bamboo
straightens up and throws Jen toward the ground.  Jen
quickly pulls herself up and charges at Li.

Jen chases after Li, into a clearing, out of the bamboo
forest.

EXT. RIVER - DAY

Jen finally catches up to Li, who is standing on a rock
about a few feet wide amid the rapids.  Jen vaults onto the
rock and scuffles with Li.  Jen loses her balance.

				JEN
		What do you want?

				LI
		What I've always wanted, to teach
		you.

				JEN
		All right.  If you can take back
		the sword in three moves, I'll go
		with you.

Li takes the sword back.

				JEN
		Give it back!

				LI
		Kneel!

				JEN
		Never!

				LI
		Then you have no use for the sword.

Li throws the sword into the rapids.

Jen dives in to retrieve it.  He follows Jen downstream by
hopping from one rock to another.  Jen recovers the sword
but is herself drowning.  Suddenly Jade Fox swings into the
rapids and fishes Jen out.  Jade Fox carries the unconscious
Jen away.  Li gives chase, but loses them.

INT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY

It's raining.  Inside an old factory, Fox heats some medicine
paste and then dips a needle in the paste.  She burns the
needle point, causing a blue smoke.  She lights some incense
and puts it in a burner near Jen, who is barely conscious.

				FOX
		Sooner or later, they'd drag you
		back to Peking.  Your parents will
		never accept you again.  But why go
		home?  We've gone this far, we
		won't stop now.  You'll always be
		my lady.  At last, we'll be our own
		masters.  We'll be happy.  That's
		the most important thing.  All we
		have left is each other, right?
		Lie down and rest.

Jen is too weak to respond.

Fox leaves Jen clutching the Green Destiny.

EXT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY

Fox scurries ahead in the rain.  Her eyes catch something,
but she keeps moving.

INT. YUAN COMPOUND - DAY

Aunt Wu finishes bandaging Yu.

				AUNT WU
		She's crazy.  You should have
		killed her.

				YU
		I didn't have the heart.

				AUNT WU
		Well, Li Mu Bai can do it.

Yu senses movement at the window.  Looking out, she sees
Jade Fox in the distance.

INT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY

Jen wakes up, flushed from fever.  She takes a sip from a
cup of water -- it's empty.  She tosses the cup, gets up,
and walks into the rain.

EXT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY

Jen walks out, raises her face into the rain, and drinks the
raindrops.  Thirst quenched, she turns around and finds Li
standing there.  Jen limps towards him while mumbling.

				JEN
		Is it me or the sword you want?

Jen falls into Li, who checks her pulse and looks at her eyes.

				LI
		You've been drugged!

Li carries her inside, kicking away the incense burner.

INT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY

Li lays his hands on Jen's back; she slowly comes to.

				LI
		Where is Jade Fox?

Jen gestures that she doesn't know.  Yu and Bo enter.  Yu
looks at Jen.

				YU
		What happened?

				LI
		Jade Fox drugged her.  How did you
		get here?

				YU
		We followed Jade Fox.

Instantaneously, a flurry of darts flies directly in Jen's
direction.  Li and Yu swipe miraculously at them all,
sending them flinging hither and thither.

Fox shows herself.  Li attacks her.  She falls back, bleeding
to death.

				LI
		And so you die.

Li touches his neck.

				FOX
		And so shall you!

Li pulls a single needle from his neck.

				YU
		A poisoned needle!

				FOX
		You deserve to die, but the life I
		was hoping to take... was Jen's.
		Ten years I devoted to you.  But
		you deceived me!  You hid the
		manual's true meaning.  I never
		improved... but your progress was
		limitless!  You know what poison is?
		An eight-year-old girl, full of
		deceit.  That's poison!  Jen!  My
		only family... my only enemy...

Jade Fox dies.

				YU
		You can't die!  Tell us what poison
		you used!  You can't die!  Tell us
		the antidote!  You can't let Li Mu
		Bai die!

				JEN
		She used Purple Yin... Purple Yin
		poison.  It goes straight to the
		heart.

				LI
		My blood will soon reverse its flow.
		It's the same poison she used to
		kill my master.  There is no
		antidote.

				YU
		That can't be!  Everything has an
		antithesis!  Why not this?

				JEN
		The antidote exists.  She taught it
		to me.  The formula is simple, but
		it takes time to prepare.  Trust me.
		As you have helped me, let me help
		you.

				LI
		All right.  Hurry.  I will hold on
		as long as I can.

				YU
			(takes the comb from
			her hair)
		Take my horse and go to the compound.
		Give this to Mrs. Wu.  She'll help
		you.  Hurry!

				JEN
		Spare your energy.  I'll be back!

EXT. ABANDONED FACTORY - NIGHT

Bo is burying Fox in the rain.

EXT. YUAN COMPOUND - NIGHT

The guards surround Jen.  She pushes past them.

				JEN
		Where is Mrs. Wu?

Aunt Wu comes running out.

				AUNT WU
		Stop it!

Jen pulls out Yu's comb.

				JEN
		Shu Lien told me to show you this.

				AUNT WU
		Let her in.

INT. ABANDONED FACTORY - NIGHT

Yu sits across from Li, whose pose is almost meditational,
eerily calm.

				YU
		Mu Bai, hold on.  Give me some
		hope...

				LI
		Shu Lien...

				YU
		Save your strength.

				LI
		My life is departing.  I've only
		one breath left.

				YU
		Use it to meditate.  Free yourself
		from this world as you have been
		taught.  Let your soul rise to
		eternity with your last breath.  Do
		not waste it... for me.

				LI
		I've already wasted my whole life.
		I want to tell you with my last
		breath... I have always loved you.
		I would rather be a ghost, drifting
		by your side... as a condemned
		soul... than enter heaven without
		you.  Because of your love... I
		will never be a lonely spirit.

Yu cries.

She kisses him lightly.  He closes his eyes.

EXT. PATH - DAY

As the sun rises, Jen rides speedily, clutching the medicine
in her hands.

INT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY

Li is in Yu's arms.  They're holding hands.  The sun shines
in.  Yu slowly releases Li's stiff fingers -- he is dead.

Jen is at the door.

				JEN
		He's gone?

Bo peeks over Jen's shoulder.

Yu rises and picks up Green Destiny.  Jen kneels.  Yu raises
the sword, but doesn't kill her.

				YU
		Bo... please take this sword back
		to Sir Te.

He takes the sword from her.

				YU
			(to Jen)
		Now you must go to Wudan Mountain.
		Lo awaits you there.  Promise me
		one thing, whatever path you take
		in this life... be true to yourself.

EXT. WU TAN TEMPLE - DAY

Jen climbs up toward the temple, finally reaching the temple
gate, and sees Lo standing there.

He runs to her.  She greets him.

INT. WU TAN TEMPLE - MAGIC

Jen and Lo make love.

INT. WU TAN TEMPLE - DAY

Lo wakes up to find the jade comb on the pillow beside him,
Jen gone.

EXT. WU TAN MOUNTAIN - DAY

Lo catches up to Jen, who stands on a bridge.  The gorges
below are shrouded in clouds.  She looks back at him.

				JEN
		Do you remember the legend of the
		young man?

				LO
		"A faithful heart makes wishes come
		true."

				JEN
		Make a wish, Lo.

Lo pauses.

				LO
			(closing his eyes)
		To be back in the desert, together
		again.

Jen smiles, turns, and leaps into the clouds.  They seem to
catch her gently, before she disappears into them.

Lo remains standing, a smile on his face, tears rolling down
his cheeks.

THE END.
DANCES WITH WOLVES

                                                         Final Draft

                

               INT. FIELD HOSPITAL TENT - DAY

               A black screen.

               The sound of a knife cutting through boot leather.

               Fade in on the waists of two men (THE SURGEONS) hovering 
               around a crude operating table.

               In the extreme background, TWO STRETCHER BEARERS are just 
               leaving.

                                     SURGEON 1 (O.S.)
                         Is this the last one?

               One of the bearers stops and looks back. His face is numb. 
               And he nods hollowly.

               We cannot see the patient stretched out on the table. But we 
               do see that the first surgeon has succeeded in getting the 
               man's boot off.

                                     SURGEON 2 (O.S.)
                         God, what a mess... at least there's 
                         no gangrene.

                                     SURGEON 1 (O.S.)
                         There will be if it doesn't come 
                         off.

                                     SURGEON 2 (O.S.)
                         Well I can't saw if I can't keep my 
                         eyes open.  Let's coffee up... he 
                         can wait a few more minutes.

               As the TWO SURGEONS duck through a tent flap in the background 
               we see a mangled foot, torn by shrapnel, it oozes blood from 
               a cut clear to the bone.

               LIEUTENANT JOHN J. DUNBAR'S eyes are now open. He's a young 
               man, his features sharp and handsome. With effort, he lifts 
               his head and searches the room.

               His eyes come to rest on the form of a legless man lying in 
               bloodsoaked sheets. He's whimpering like a child.

               Dunbar comes to a sitting position on the operating table. 
               As his eyes move around the room they come to rest on a crate 
               filled with the boots of men who have lost their legs.

               A cane travels through space and deftly hooks one of the 
               boots.

               Lieutenant Dunbar brings the boot onto the operating table. 
               He tries to pull it on his mangled foot, but the pain makes 
               him cry out. Deliberately he breaks the cane and sticks a 
               piece of it between his teeth.

               Tears of pain are rolling down his face. A sweat has broken 
               out on his forehead and with great determination he pulls 
               the boot on.

               EXT. FIELD HOSPITAL TENT - DAY

               The two weary surgeons sip on steaming mugs of coffee, their 
               white coats spattered with blood. Their brief respite is 
               interrupted by the sound of a muffled scream.

               Together they turn and rush back into the tent.

               INT. FIELD HOSPITAL TENT - DAY

               The operating table is empty save the broken cane and a small 
               pool of blood. Dunbar is gone.

               LEGEND: ST. DAVID'S FIELD, TENNESSEE - 1862

               EXT. CIVIL WAR HILL - DAY

               In a natural valley below is a peaceful field.  And on either 
               side of the field, seperated by a hundred yards of green, 
               are low rock walls.

               Several dairy cows are lying dead in the field.

               A group of MOUNTED UNION OFFICERS, ride onto the crest of 
               the hill and look down at the field. The distinguished man 
               with a long grey beard is GENERAL TIDE.

               EXT. CONFEDERATE WALL - DAY

               Ragged CONFEDERATE SOLDIERS crouch sullenly behind one of 
               the walls.

               EXT. UNION WALL - DAY

               And just behind the other wall are UNION MEN, better equipped 
               perhaps, but just as weary as their enemies.

               We hold on one man, an enlisted soldier, SERGEANT PEPPER. He 
               chances to glance behind and squints at a strange sight.

               A solitary officer is standing a few feet behind him. The 
               sun is at his back, giving him a ghostly feel. Eerily he 
               takes a step or two forward. He's limping badly.

               The sergeant recognizes him. It's Dunbar.

                                     PEPPER
                         Lieutenant... izat you?

               Dunbar says nothing. He just stands and stares. It unnerves 
               the sergeant.

                                     PEPPER
                         What're you doing here lieutenant?

                                     DUNBAR
                         This is where I belong... this is my 
                         outfit.

               The sergeant stares at Dunbar's foot.

                                     PEPPER
                         You went to hospital?

                                     DUNBAR
                         It was no good... what's going on 
                         here?

               A ping of riflefire flies overhead and the sergeant dives 
               for the wall. He calls over his shoulder.

                                     PEPPER
                         Better come to cover lieutenant... 
                         those boys are shooters.

               Dunbar settles next to the sergeant.

                                     PEPPER
                         What's goin' on here... seems to be 
                         the question alright... you could 
                         ask the major but he don't know. 
                         He's busy tryin' to figger out how 
                         come the officer's mess run outta 
                         peach ice cream...

               The sergeant nods at the distant hill and Dunbar looks too.

                                     PEPPER
                         General's come up to see the show 
                         but all he knows is there ain't no 
                         show...

               Now he nods toward the trees behind them and the lieutenant 
               follows. Several union men are clustered around a huge hunk 
               of material attached to a gondola.

                                     PEPPER
                         We started a balloon up but they 
                         shot her down fore she was ten feet 
                         off the ground... so nobody's made a 
                         run either way. It's been a stand-
                         off all damn day... and now... the 
                         major, he's lookin' at the general 
                         and he's thinkin' I better do 
                         somethin', and you know what that 
                         means...

               More riflefire comes in and some of the union men answer 
               with a few rounds of their own. The sergeant watches the 
               confederate line across the field through a crack in the 
               wall.

               Lieutenant Dunbar is not watching the enemy. He's looking at 
               some horses picketed in the trees behind the union lines. 
               There's a nice bay. There's a big roan.

                                     PEPPER
                         They're 'sposed to be beat up just 
                         like us but everybody knows that 
                         Tucker's men are tough as cobs. I 
                         sure don't wanna die out there with 
                         them cows.

               Dunbar is still watching the horses. He's holding on a small, 
               well-muscled buckskin standing a little apart from the others. 
               CISCO.

               Now he moves away from the wall, heading for the horses.

               The sergeant squeezes off a shot. Squinting across the field, 
               he sees a rifle with a hat on the tip of its bayonet waving 
               at him disrespectfully. The sergeant rolls on his side to 
               reload. He keeps on talking to the lieutenant, but the 
               lieutenant is gone.

                                     PEPPER
                         Some of the boys are sayin' that if 
                         we ain't gonna fight we could just 
                         settle the whole business with a 
                         little high stakes poker. Wouldn't 
                         that be a sight... a bunch of fellas 
                         sittin' in the middle of this field 
                         drawin' cards...

               The sergeant's chatter is interrupted by a sound... the sound 
               of hoofbeats rushing in behind him. Men on either side are 
               scattering, but there's no time for the sergeant. He turns 
               to the sound and cringes against the wall as the buckskinned 
               belly of a horse soars over his head.

               Dunbar and his horse hit the ground with a thud and dig for 
               the confederate line.

               EXT. CONFEDERATE LINE - DAY

               Some of the confederate riflemen can see the wild rider headed 
               for their lines. A sharpshooter (RAY) calls over his shoulder.

                                     RAY
                         Tucker!

               A man in a slouch hat crowned by a jaunty feather looks up 
               from an impromptu meeting. TUCKER.

               EXT. CIVIL WAR HILL - DAY

               Like the others, General Tide is absorbed with the spectacle 
               of a single horseman riding into the teeth of the enemy. He 
               holds out his hand and an AIDE slips a pocket telescope into 
               his palm. The general sights through his telescope.

                                     AIDE
                         What is it sir?

               Tide lowers the telescope, glances at the aide and peers 
               back down at the field.

                                     TIDE
                         Looks like a suicide.

               EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY

               Dunbar can see the confederate riflemen now. They're rising 
               up behind the wall to aim and fire.

               Fifty yards from the enemy line he's still unhit. He wheels 
               the buckskin into a sharp left turn and they streak parallel 
               to the confederate flank. The buckskin is charging hard, his 
               heels throwing out clumps of dirt.

               The firing is tremendous. The lieutenant's hat is torn away. 
               A slug lifts off one of the officer's epaulettes, but still 
               no bullet finds him.

               EXT. UNION WALL - DAY

               The entire union line is standing, strangely quiet in their 
               disbelief.

               EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY

               The lieutenant passes the last of the riflemen and pulls the 
               buckskin up at the far end of the field. The little horse is 
               pitching and rearing, ready for another run.

               The lieutenant bows his head in exhaustion, but a sound coming 
               across the field brings his head up quickly. A great cheer 
               is rolling along the union line.

               EXT. HILL - DAY

               General Tide is furiously spurring his horse as he tears 
               down the hill. His aides are trying desperately to keep up.

               EXT. CONFEDERATE WALL - DAY

               There's action along the confederate line. The men Dunbar 
               passed are desperately trying to reload. Those at the end 
               are jeering, taunting the lieutenant to take another pass.

               Tucker is moving along the line. The battle ground has 
               suddenly taken on a festival atmosphere and Tucker doesn't 
               like it.

                                     CONFEDERATE
                         Come on you son of a bitch -- you 
                         won't make it a second time...

               EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY

                                     DUNBAR
                         Alright by me.

               Dunbar gazes down along his leg. Blood is pumping from his 
               wound.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Forgive me Father.

               Again he digs his heels into the buckskin's flanks and they 
               fly down the line. The confederates are trying to reload. A 
               few are able to get off a hasty shot, but they're all too 
               late.

               EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY

               Dunbar swerves in a little closer to the wall as he approaches 
               the other half of the confederate ranks. They're standing 
               ready, like a firing squad.

               Tucker has just reached the side of Ray the sharpshooter.

               The lieutenant shuts; his eyes, lets the reins flop on the 
               buckskin's neck and spreads his arms as they thunder toward 
               the line of riflemen.

               Ray's finger squeezes the trigger, his keen eye sights down 
               the barrel of his gun. THUD... a rifle ball buries itself in 
               Ray's forehead.

               EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY

               The union trooper who fired the fatal shot gets up from a 
               kneeling position and scrambles after some of his comrades.

               EXT. UNION WALL - DAY

               With his aides coming behind, General Tide leaps his horse 
               over the wall at a dead run.

               The entire Union line pours after him, screaming a thunderous 
               battlecry in unison. Pepper is one of the last to scurry 
               over the wall.

               EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY

               The union troops have the rebels in full flight, chasing 
               them into the woods beyond the field.

               EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY

               Suddenly the field is quiet. There is rifle fire in the 
               distance but otherwise everything is still. The field is 
               almost empty. The three dead dairy cows are still there. And 
               at one end of the field is a solitary buckskin horse. His 
               rider lies on the ground, a foot hooked in one stirrup.

               The sound of men's voices is coming near. Suddenly, General 
               Tide is peering down at him. Dunbar stares back, glassy eyed.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Don't take off my foot.

               General Tide stares down into Dunbar's blank face. He kneels 
               next to the lieutenant and bends to whisper in his ear.

                                     GENERAL TIDE
                         You rest easy son... you'll keep 
                         you're foot. As God is my judge, 
                         you'll keep it.

               The general looks up at one of his aides.

                                     GENERAL TIDE
                         Bring up my ambulance...

                                     AIDE
                         Sir?

                                     GENERAL TIDE
                         Bring up my ambulance. And bring my 
                         surgeon with it. We've got an officer 
                         who's worth something lying here.

               The aide dashes off to do what he's told, as General Tide 
               gently removes Dunbar's foot from the stirrup and lays it 
               carefully on the ground. The image fades out.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               The image of a boot fades in, pull back to see that a lone 
               rider is coming toward us. He has had a long and dusty trip. 
               It's Lieutenant Dunbar. He's still riding the little buckskin.

               LEGEND - FORT HAYS. KANSAS - 1863

               Dunbar pulls up short. He stares thoughtfully at something 
               in the distance.

                                     DUNBAR (V.O.)
                         The strangeness of this life cannot 
                         be measured. In trying to produce my 
                         own death, I was elevated to the 
                         status of a living hero.

               Dunbar starts forward and the camera swings around to cover 
               his back. In the distance we can see an isolated and dreary 
               military post.

               The sky is very blue. The sun is bright. A rough-hewn, 
               unfenced fort is straight ahead.

               There are several miscellaneous stone structures, a well-
               stocked stable, barracks, officer's quarters and in the center 
               of it all, a headquarters building.

               Lieutenant Dunbar, riding straight and tall on his powerfully 
               built buckskin, Cisco, passes into view. He's headed for the 
               center of the fort.

               INT. FORT HAYS HEADQUARTERS - DAY

               Silhouetted against the outside, Lieutenant Dunbar pauses in 
               the wide doorway of headquarters. We can hear the distant 
               sounds of work and life coming from the outside but in here 
               it's strangely quiet.

               A SERGEANT sits at a desk in the foyer. Across the way, at 
               another desk, is an enlisted CLERK. Both men glance from 
               their paperwork at the man in the doorway. But it's only a 
               glance and they go right on shuffling paper.

               Footfalls sound in a hallway and a blue-eyed officer with 
               slick, black hair swings into the foyer. He too has a 
               slackness that echoes the dreariness of this post.

               The blue-eyed officer, LIEUTENANT ELGIN, and Dunbar meet at 
               the doorway. Dunbar glances down at a scrap of paper in his 
               hand.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Where can I find Major... Fambrough?

                                     ELGIN
                         Turn right... all the way to the end 
                         of the hall.

               Being roughly the same age and rank these two might idle 
               awhile, but Dunbar is eager. He's already moving.

                                     FAMBROUGH (O.S.)
                         Lt. John J. Dunbar.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Sir?

               Dunbar stops and turns, peering down the hallway. No one is 
               there.

               INT. FAMBROUGH'S OFFICE - DAY

               Sitting behind the desk, holding a set of orders is MAJOR 
               FAMBROUGH.

                                     FAMBROUGH
                         Lt. John J. Dunbar.

               Lt. Dunbar is standing in front of the desk.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Yes sir?

                                     FAMBROUGH
                         Indian fighter, huh?

                                     DUNBAR
                         Excuse me?

                                     FAMBROUGH
                              (indicating paper)
                         Your orders say you are to be posted 
                         on the frontier. The frontier is 
                         Indian country. I quickly deduced 
                         that you are an Indian fighter.

               He arches an eyebrow, challenging the lieutenant. He has sad 
               swollen eyes. He is an army lifer passed over too many times 
               for promotion and right now does not look like a well man.

                                     FAMBROUGH
                         I did not ascend to this position by 
                         being stupid.

                                     DUNBAR
                         No sir.

               Fambrough returns to the order. Dunbar watches him in silence.

               The major's tunic is covered with food stains. Sweat has 
               broken out all over his head. His grooming is awful. His 
               hands are trembling slightly. Something is very wrong with 
               him.

               Now the major sees something on the official paper. He looks 
               quickly at the lieutenant, then back at the paper, moving 
               his lips but making no sound.

                                     FAMBROUGH
                         It says here you've been decorated.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Yes sir.

                                     FAMBROUGH
                         And they sent you out here to be 
                         posted?

                                     DUNBAR
                         Actually sir, I'm here at my own 
                         request... I want to see the frontier.

                                     FAMBROUGH
                         You want to see the frontier?

                                     DUNBAR
                         Yes sir... before it's gone.

               The major fixes Dunbar with a sly look.

                                     FAMBROUGH
                         Such a smart lad coming straight to 
                         me.

               Still sly, Fambrough digs into a side drawer. There is the 
               distinct clink of glass on glass as he rummages. Now Fambrough 
               has what he wants, a blank official form. He begins to fill 
               it out, writing in a disturbingly childish way.

                                     FAMBROUGH
                         Sir Knight, I am sending you on a 
                         knight's errand. You will report to 
                         Captain Cargill at the furthermost 
                         outpost of the realm... Fort 
                         Sedgewick.

               He looks over his work with a schoolboy's excitement and 
               affixes his signature with a wild flourish.

                                     FAMBROUGH
                         My personal seal will assure you 
                         safe passage through many miles of 
                         wild hostile country.

               He folds the order and hands it to Dunbar.

                                     DUNBAR
                         I'm wondering sir, how will I be 
                         getting there?

                                     FAMBROUGH
                         You think I don't know?

                                     DUNBAR
                         No sir, it's just that I don't know.

                                     FAMBROUGH
                         Hold your tongue.

               The major turns in his chair to stare through a single, dusty 
               window. He can see a teamster outside, tying down canvas on 
               a heavily-loaded wagon.

                                     FAMBROUGH
                         I'm in a generous mood and will grant 
                         your boon. You see that peasant... 
                         he calls himself Timmons... he leaves 
                         this very afternoon for your Fort 
                         Sedgewick. Ride with him if you 
                         like... he knows the way. That is 
                         all.

               Dunbar stands and salutes. Fambrough returns it snappily.

               The lieutenant starts for the door.

                                     FAMBROUGH (O.S.)
                         Sir Knight...

               Dunbar turns around. Fambrough is standing in front of his 
               desk. There's a large, dark splotch on the major's trouser 
               front.

               He jams both of his hands into the front of his pants and 
               giggles.

                                     FAMBROUGH
                         I just pissed in my pants... and 
                         nobody can do anything about it.

               EXT. FORT HAYS - DAY

               Lieutenant Dunbar skips down the steps, picks up Cisco's 
               reins and starts leading the buckskin along the front of the 
               building. He looks briefly at his orders, stops and turns 
               back towards Fambrough's office.

               And there is Fambrough with a full glass of booze in hand, 
               toasting the young lieutenant from the window. A wide grin 
               on his face.

               EXT. FORT HAYS - DAY

               A wagon is pulling slowly away from the lonely headquarters.

               EXT. FORT HAYS - DAY

               The insane face of Major Fambrough peeks around the corner 
               of a building. On his head is a ridiculous, plumed hat.

               Now he looks both ways, as if preparing to cross a busy 
               street. Seeing that the coast is clear, he minces into the 
               parade ground in front of headquarters. The plume is waving 
               in the breeze and the major carries something in each hand... 
               an officer's sword and a revolver.

               Except for these items, the unfortunate major is naked.

               As he trots onto the parade ground, Fambrough is startled to 
               find that Elgin is following him. He begins to run faster.

               Fambrough halts near the center of the parade ground and 
               turns back on the lieutenant and waves his pistol menacingly.

                                     FAMBROUGH
                         Noooo, noooo...

                                     ELGIN
                         It's alright Major.

               Now Elgin sees a GRIZZLED SERGEANT approaching Fambrough 
               from the opposite direction.

                                     SERGEANT
                         Leave him alone lieutenant... he's 
                         cracked.

               Fambrough turns on the voice behind him and waves his pistol 
               at the sergeant.

                                     FAMBROUGH
                         Nooo, nooo...

               But Fambrough finds himself staring at the barrel of the 
               sergeant's raised pistol.

                                     ELGIN
                         Don't sergeant.

               In a panic Fambrough wheels back on Lieutenant Elgin.

                                     FAMBROUGH
                         Are you deaf fool. I said I'll have 
                         my crown this instant... this instant!

               Slowly and kindly, Elgin is walking toward him. He holds out 
               his hand.

                                     ELGIN
                         Let's have the pistol.

                                     SERGEANT
                              (to Elgin)
                         Don't do it.

               But the lieutenant keeps his hand held out. Fambrough eyes 
               him silently. Then he screws up his face like a crybaby.

                                     FAMBROUGH
                         The king is dead... long live the 
                         king.

               In one swift motion, Fambrough brings the revolver up, 
               swallows the barrel and pulls the trigger.

               EXT. WAGON - DAY

               At the sound of a single shot behind him, Dunbar twists around 
               on the wagon seat. Seeing nothing, he turns back to face the 
               front and takes stock of the driver, TIMMONS. He doesn't 
               like what he sees... or smells.

               Timmons, is not what would be called a credit to his race. 
               If all teamsters were greaseballs he would be their absolute 
               ruler. His stink must be incredible. He leans over the side 
               of the wagon and hocks out a disgusting stream of spittle.

               Afternoon shadows are slanting across the rolling ocean of 
               prairie. The wagon passes camera, headed towards an endless 
               expanse of prairie.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - NIGHT

               The sky is filled with stars. One suddenly catches fire and 
               shoots across the heavens.

               EXT. CAMPFIRE - NIGHT

               Dunbar sits at the fire watching the star burn out.

               Timmons is bending over the fire. He farts, then turns to 
               Dunbar with a smile "good one, huh?".

               He spits for good measure and for Dunbar, the moment is 
               broken, but not forgotten.

                                     DUNBAR (V.O.)
                         Were it not for my companion I believe 
                         I would be having the time of my 
                         life. He is quite possibly the foulest 
                         person I have ever met.

               Looking over his shoulder at the journal, we see that this 
               latest entry is one of many and Dunbar is embellishing it 
               with a drawing of a star.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               Dunbar is off the seat riding atop the mountain of supplies. 
               He is writing in his journal.

                                     DUNBAR (V.O.)
                         We have been gone four days now and 
                         still we have seen no signs of life. 
                         Only earth and sky.

               Dunbar stops his writing.

                                     DUNBAR
                         How far do you make the fort?

                                     TIMMONS
                         Far.

                                     DUNBAR
                         How far?

                                     TIMMONS
                         Forty or fifty miles, maybe... what's 
                         the big hurry on Sedgewick?

                                     DUNBAR
                         It's going to be my post... my home.

                                     TIMMONS
                         You ain't hard to please, I'll say 
                         that.

               Timmons slows the wagon and stops.  He has seen something.

                                     TIMMONS
                         Look yonder.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               A cluster of bones bleached white, are lying in the tall 
               grass. Human bones. Dunbar is squatting next to them. Timmons' 
               head dips into view over his shoulder and the teamster's 
               mouth splits into a toothless grin.

                                     TIMMONS
                         Somebody back east is sayin'... "why 
                         don't he write?" Stupid bastard.

               The teamster spits and starts for the wagon. Dunbar comes to 
               his feet and examines the burnt out remains of a wagon. Then, 
               he finds an arrow in the grassy wheel. Looking off he can 
               only guess at the drama here. The sun is sinking fast below 
               the great expanse of prairie.

               EXT. SEDGEWICK BLUFF - DAWN

               A hatless soldier in a tattered overcoat, CAPTAIN CARGILL, 
               is on the bluff staring morosely through his telescope. One 
               hand rubs a sore spot on his jaw. He sticks the telescope in 
               his overcoat pocket. He wedges a hand into his mouth and 
               wiggles a loose tooth. He gives it a tug but it is not ready 
               to come out.

               The breeze is coming up and Captain Cargill pulls his overcoat 
               closed. As he slips his last button through the hole, it 
               breaks off, bounces off of his foot and rolls a few feet 
               down the bluff.

               Captain Cargill watches the button forlornly, making no move 
               to go after it. He raises his head once more and looks to 
               the east. Nothing is out there.

               EXT. SEDGEWICK CUT BANK - DAWN

               Cargill is walking along the base of the cut bank. He stops, 
               staring up at a series of holes dug into the bluff. Their 
               entrance covered with "found" draperies of all description. 
               He works up the courage to call out.

                                     CARGILL
                         Corporal Guest... Corporal Guest... 
                         Corporal Guest. Corporal Guest, you 
                         don't have to talk to me... just 
                         please come out.

               At last there's some real movement behind one of the holes 
               and CORPORAL GUEST crawls through one of the curtains. He 
               neither salutes nor speaks. He blinks down at Cargill, looking 
               more like a hobo than a soldier.

                                     CARGILL
                         It's the end... assemble the men in 
                         front of my quarters.

               EXT. CARGILL'S QUARTERS - DAY

               The "MEN" have lined up in front of Cargill's sad, sod hut; 
               pitiful men. Sick, moth-eaten, crushed in spirit. There are 
               nine of them. Just behind Cargill is a half-collapsed supply 
               house and a broken down corral holding two bony horses.

               Cargill has a brave face and a broken heart.

                                     CARGILL
                         You hate me... but I feel none of 
                         the same for you... you men stayed. 
                         You stayed after they took all our 
                         horses. You stayed after all the 
                         others deserted. You stayed on the 
                         promise that the army would resupply 
                         us. I've looked for that wagon from 
                         Fort Hays just as you have... day 
                         after miserable day. All I can say 
                         is that I'm proud of you. Get your 
                         things men, we're leaving this place. 
                         The army... can go to hell.

               The zombie troops have already broken ranks, lurching back 
               to their holes and gear like a gang of drunks.

               Cargill walks out of frame to reveal the broken down sign 
               that hangs askew above his quarters: "Fort Sedgewick."

               EXT. SEDGEWICK BLUFF - DUSK

               A solitary WOLF trots along the top of a bluff overlooking 
               the river. He has two white socks running up his front legs. 
               An old jagged scar cuts across his muzzle. He's watching the 
               ruins of Fort Sedgewick.

               The little band of troops, all on foot, with their two lame 
               horses trailing behind are fading in the distance.

               EXT. WAGON CAMP - DAWN

               The wagon is parked in a shallow depression, its team 
               unhitched. Under the wagon the forms of two men lay curled 
               up in blankets.

               Dunbar is sleeping peacefully, his nose pressed against a 
               jacket. Now his nostrils begin to twitch. His face turns 
               sour and he wakes to find that he's been sleeping against 
               the stink of Timmons. Flies buzz about the teamster's sleeping 
               body.

               Dunbar quickly pulls away from the bad smell. He rolls out 
               from under the wagon and clambers to his feet.

               Lieutenant Dunbar looks out over the prairie. It's going to 
               be a spectacular day.

               In the far distance, a column of buzzards is circling. Dunbar 
               has paused to watch them. He ducks back under the wagon.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Timmons... Timmons.

               No response from the deep-sleeping driver. Dunbar starts to 
               move closer to shake him awake but the odor under there makes 
               him think twice. He snatches up the arrow and probes under 
               the wagon.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Timmons.

               The teamster comes awake with a squeal, he joins Dunbar 
               staring up at the circling birds.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Something's out there...

                                     TIMMONS
                         Somethin' dead.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Might have a look.

                                     TIMMONS
                         Might stay clear of whatever did the 
                         killin'.

               Timmons' mood is different now. He begins to hitch the team 
               with a new sense of urgency.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               From a high point on the prairie we can see the wagon moving 
               west. And no more than half a mile away we can see Cargill's 
               column, moving east. Neither is aware of the other's presence.

               Several buzzards are settling on a half-butchered horse. 
               It's one of the animals that was with Cargill's command. We 
               can hear men singing. The shaky little column from Fort 
               Sedgewick is marching east for Fort Hays.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               Dunbar is walking through a little valley of tall, rich grass. 
               The wagon is nowhere in sight.

               He looks back at Cisco who is also wandering by himself 
               searching for prime shoots.

               Timmons' wagon comes into view now.

                                     DUNBAR
                         How come we haven't seen any buffalo?

                                     TIMMONS
                         Can't figger the stinkin' buffalo. 
                         Sometimes you don't see 'em for days, 
                         sometimes they're thick as curls on 
                         a whore.

                                     DUNBAR
                         What about Indians?

                                     TIMMONS
                         Goddamn Indians you'd jus' as soon 
                         not see, lessen the bastards're dead. 
                         Nothing but thieves and beggars.

               Timmons, as usual, laughs at his own imagined wit.

               The wagon disappears over a ridge and again, Dunbar is alone.

               In gentle awe, he runs his palm over the top of the grass 
               swirling about his waist.

               A meadow lark's mournful call startles him. Dunbar brings 
               his head up at the sound and so does Cisco.

               Now there's a sudden lifting of the breeze. It sweeps through 
               the valley, making the grass roll with a life of its own.

               The lark's sad call and the sudden violent movement of the 
               wind sends a shudder through Lieutenant Dunbar. He scans the 
               horizon in all directions, aware all at once of his aloneness.

               He flips the reins over Cisco's neck and sticks a foot in 
               the stirrup.

               Dunbar heads for the ridge.

               EXT. BLUFF - DAY

               As Dunbar comes over the hill, he sees the wagon has ground 
               to a stop.

               The wagon has paused at the edge of a bluff. Dunbar and 
               Timmons are peering into the little valley below

                                     TIMMONS
                         Not what you'd call a going concern.

               The wagon lurches over the edge of the bluff and down. We 
               see the pathetic remains of Fort Sedgewick.

               EXT. SEDGEWICK - DAY

               A full view of the deserted fort. Timmons sits on the wagon 
               by himself.

                                     TIMMONS
                         Ain't nothin' here lieutenant.

               Dunbar appears from Cargill's former quarters.

                                     TIMMONS (O.S.)
                         Everybody's run off... or got kilt.

               The lieutenant looks briefly at Timmons, and marches over to 
               the caved-in supply house. Again he ducks inside.

               Dunbar emerges from the supply house and stares up at the 
               wagon driver.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Alright...lets unload the wagon.

                                     TIMMONS
                         What, and leave it all here?

                                     DUNBAR
                         I'm staying too... we don't know 
                         what's happened.

               Dunbar moves around to the back of the wagon.

                                     TIMMONS
                         There ain't nothin' here lieutenant.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Not at the moment, no.

                                     TIMMONS
                         So things bein' the way they are we 
                         might as well turn around and get 
                         started back.

                                     DUNBAR
                         This is my post...

                                     TIMMONS
                         This is my... are you crazy boy?

               The lieutenant's eyes have gone absolutely black. The heel 
               of his hand is dropping lightly on the butt of a long revolver 
               at his hip.

                                     DUNBAR
                         This is my post! And these are the 
                         post's provisions. Now get your ass 
                         off that wagon and help me unload.

               Timmons leaps down.

               INT. SUPPLY HOUSE - DAY

               The half-caved in supply house bulges with supplies.

               INT. CARGILL'S QUARTERS - DAY

               Cargill's late quarters are also filled with new goods. 
               There's barely enough room to reach the little bunk.

               EXT. SEDGEWICK - DUSK

               Timmons is atop his wagon seat, reins in hand.

                                     TIMMONS
                         Well... I'll let 'em know where you 
                         are.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Good.

                                     TIMMONS
                         Good luck lieutenant.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Thank you.

               Timmons clucks to his team and the wagon pulls out. The light 
               on the prairie is fading fast.

               EXT. SEDGEWICK RIVER BANK - DUSK

               The wolf with two socks is patrolling along the edge of the 
               river.

               INT. QUARTERS - NIGHT

               A lamp turns up, casting a glow over Dunbar's incredibly 
               cramped quarters.

               He adjusts the lamp and sits back on the bunk, his journal 
               on his lap. He begins an entry.

                                     DUNBAR (V.O.)
                         Have arrived to find Fort Sedgewick 
                         deserted. Am now waiting for the 
                         garrison's return or word from 
                         headquarters. Post is in exceedingly 
                         poor condition. Have decided to assign 
                         myself clean-up duty beginning 
                         tomorrow. Supplies abundant. The 
                         country is everything I dreamed it 
                         would be. There can be no place like 
                         this on earth.

               Dunbar signs the entry, yawns contentedly and reaches to 
               turn down the lamp.

               A wolf howls somewhere outside. It's low at first but it 
               keeps on building. At its height, the howl sounds as though 
               it is coming from, something gigantic.

               Dunbar is still listening after it's gone. He hears wood 
               snap in the direction of the river then all is quiet again. 
               Without hesitating, he slips the big revolver out of its 
               holster and cradling it like a teddy bear, slips it under 
               his blanket.

               The light is left blazing.

               EXT. SEDGEWICK - DAWN

               First light over the sad fort.

               INT. QUARTERS - DAWN

               Dunbar is sleeping quietly. He opens his eyes and rears his 
               head to get his bearings. Then he flops back down and shuts 
               his eyes, hoping for more sleep.

               He hears two heavy footfalls in rapid succession.

               Dunbar holds his breath staring at the doorway. Quietly, he 
               pulls his gun aiming it directly at the doorway.

               Silence. Suddenly, a shadow starts across the threshold, 
               followed quickly by Cisco's big buckskin head. The horse 
               watches Dunbar a moment, then looks curiously around the 
               room.

               EXT. CORRAL - DAY

               Dressed in pants, old boots, and a threadbare shirt, Dunbar 
               bangs home a nail on the sagging corral gate. He tests the 
               gate's swing and satisfied with this, he latches it leaving 
               Cisco inside.

               The lieutenant picks up a water bucket and we follow as he 
               walks the few, quick yards it takes to reach the bank 
               overlooking the river.

               When he sees what lies along the slope below, he stops. At 
               this spot just below the fort, a garbage dump falls away to 
               the stream. Old containers, sacks, rags, trash, bottles, and 
               a thousand other miscellaneous scraps.

               Dunbar hops over the steep lip of the bank and starts down 
               the gentle incline, eyeing the trash as he goes. Now he 
               reaches the stream and kneels, preparing to dip the bucket.

               He sniffs a bad odor, looks across the stagnant stream and 
               sees something sticking out of the water.

               It's a cloven hoof. And further out, another. And part of an 
               antler. There are decomposed antelope corpses everywhere.

               EXT. RIVER - DAY

               An antelope skeleton is being pulled from the muck.

               Dunbar is stripped to the waist as he drags the body through 
               deep water. Covering his face against the stink is a bandana. 
               His pants are soaked and he's sweating hard.

               At the stream's edge he heaves the antelope onto a pile 
               holding several others. Under the bodies is a huge bed of 
               trash which he has already collected.

               The body he tosses up slips and he has to right it. Now he 
               wades back into the river and searches the water with his 
               hands for more.

               EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY

               Dunbar fastens the last of the traces to a pile of garbage 
               spread out on a sheet of canvas. He picks up a set of long 
               reins, clucks to Cisco and they start up the steep bank with 
               the load.

               EXT. RIVER - DAY

               A distinct change has taken place with the water. It's 
               running.

               EXT. TRASH PILE - DAY

               Oil is pouring out of a jug and onto the great heap. Dunbar 
               empties the last of the oil and throws the empty jug onto 
               the pile. He takes the match he's been holding between his 
               teeth and flicks it to life with a fingernail. He flips it 
               onto the heap.

               The fire catches immediately and Dunbar has to back away a 
               few steps as the flames send a column of thick, black smoke 
               into the air.

               To Dunbar's horror, the smoke billows bigger and bigger... 
               climbing into the sky as a signal for anyone to see.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Damn... damn.

               He stoops for his rifle and we follow as he scrambles up the 
               slope. The lieutenant clambers over the lip and stops to 
               scan the horizon.

               But we continue, following the black smoke as it towers higher 
               and higher until it is just a wisp.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               Four fantastic faces fill the screen, three together, one a 
               little apart. They are tired, frustrated faces, and also 
               very fierce. They are painted. Several wear their hair in 
               spiked roaches, one has brightly-colored eagle feathers 
               jutting out of his scalp at all angles. The FOUR WARRIORS 
               are naked from the waist up.

               They are Pawnee, the scariest of all the Plains Tribes. The 
               man a little apart looks THE TOUGHEST. The four men are 
               squatting on their haunches and four scrawny ponies stand 
               behind them. All the men are staring in the same direction 
               from a low rise on the prairie.

               It's smoke, a column much smaller than Dunbar's. The smoke 
               is drifting up from the furthest of a line of rolling gullies.

               We can see the whole Indian party now: the four men and their 
               ponies, two injured men on travois and two extra ponies.

               (PLEASE NOTE: ALL INDIAN DIALOGUE WILL BE IN NATIVE DIALECT 
               AS INDICATED BY TRIBE. SUBTITLES WILL BE USED.)

                                     THE TOUGHEST
                         Only a white man would make a fire 
                         for everyone to see.

                                     1ST PAWNEE
                         Maybe there's more than one.

               The Toughest turns back to face the others. Without another 
               word, he jumps on his horse. Another silence as the three 
               warriors consider what to do.

                                     2ND PAWNEE
                         We have no rifles. White men are 
                         sure to have rifles.

                                     3RD PAWNEE
                         We should forget this and go home.

               The Toughest has listened all the while, growing more and 
               more disgusted. He pulls the blanket from his shoulders and 
               flings it angrily at his companions.

                                     TOUGHEST
                         Then go. I for one, will not debate 
                         the merit of a single line of smoke 
                         in my own country.

               He starts his pony walking down the rise toward the smoke.

                                     1ST PAWNEE
                              (shaking his head)
                         He will not quit until we are all 
                         dead.

               The Third Pawnee starts after the Toughest. The other two 
               follow.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               We're dropping down through the smoke, right down to the 
               supper fire of Timmons the teamster. He's cooking slab bacon 
               in a pan. Risking the heat, he dips a finger into the pan 
               and sucks off the grease.

               There's a sudden swish of sound behind him and a split-second 
               later, an arrow goes deep into the wagon driver's ass knocking 
               him clear across the fire.

               Timmons screams like a half-butchered hog and starts into an 
               odd crippled run. He clears the gully where he's been camped 
               and struggles up the incline.

               Another swish and another scream, as another arrow catches 
               him high on the shoulder.

               Terrified with pain and fear, Timmons looks back as he 
               scrambles up the slope.

               Here comes the Toughest at a lazy gallop. He's riding only 
               with his legs. His hands are busy with bow and arrows. Casual 
               but blink quick, the Toughest snatches another arrow from 
               the quiver at his waist, strings it and fires. This arrow 
               catches Timmons in the gut. He falls squirming against the 
               slope.

               The Toughest is still coming, his face like granite as he 
               fires arrow after arrow.

               The three warriors who came with the Toughest have reached 
               the wagon. Two of them are slicing away harness on the team 
               of nice army horses. The third is rifling through Timmons' 
               gear. This man unwittingly picks up Timmons' blanket. When 
               he gets a whiff of its stink, the warrior flings it far out 
               on the grass. Then he drops to one knee, scoops up some dirt 
               and rubs it between his soiled hands.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               A lone arrow remains in Timmons' dead body, jutting out of 
               his privates.

               Now the Pawnee warriors pass by, heading for home in no 
               particular hurry. The Toughest passes by with Timmons' scalp 
               hanging from his bow. None of the men give Timmons a parting 
               glance.

               EXT. SEDGEWICK BLUFF - DAY

               We're close on Dunbar, his face is grimy with sweat and dirt. 
               He's working hard at something.

               We pull back and see that Dunbar is half-way up the bluff, 
               he's been filling up the pockmarks, the holes where Cargill's 
               men once lived.

               Exhausted, he stabs the shovel into the fresh earth and pauses 
               to look over his work, all of the holes have been filled.

               His eyes sweep over the prairie across the river. He sees 
               something moving, it's the wolf. Dunbar instinctively goes 
               for his rifle.

               Before he can bring it up to aim, he has second thoughts. He 
               lowers the gun and watches the wolf a moment longer, then 
               walks up the hill and disappears into the sky.

               EXT. SEDGEWICK BLUFF - DAY

               Fingers are playing with a button. It appears to be the same 
               one that came off Captain Cargill's coat. Dunbar stands atop 
               the hill, sighting across the prairie.

                                     DUNBAR (V.O.)
                         No sign of Captain Cargill's command. 
                         I don't know what to do. Communication 
                         can only take place if I leave and I 
                         don't want to abandon my post.

               He sticks a hand in his overcoat, pulls out a piece of dried 
               meat and bites off a hunk.

               Dunbar starts down the hill toward the fort. He watches the 
               horizon as he goes.

                                     DUNBAR (V.O.)
                         Made a short patrol yesterday p.m... 
                         discovered nothing. Will go further 
                         tomorrow.

               EXT. SEDGEWICK - DUSK

               His long day has drawn to a close. Dunbar sits on the stoop 
               of his quarters. His journal open in his lap. The sign over 
               the doorway has been straightened. Dunbar is staring at 
               something.

               One hundred yards away, sitting in the grass is the outline 
               of a wolf.

                                     DUNBAR (V.O.)
                         There is a wolf who seems intent on 
                         the goings on here. He does not seem 
                         inclined to be a nuisance however 
                         and aside from Cisco has been my 
                         only company. He has appeared each 
                         afternoon for the past two days. He 
                         has milky white socks on both feet. 
                         If he comes calling tomorrow I will 
                         name him Two Socks.

               EXT. SUPPLY HOUSE - DAY

               With a grunt Dunbar lugs an army saddle out of the supply 
               house and starts for the door. He slows to a stop and stares 
               down at the saddle as if in a trance. In a moment he is 
               tossing the saddle back where he found it.

               EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY

               Dunbar is leading Cisco to the top of a low hill. He glances 
               over his shoulder and sees that he is being followed.

               The wolf with two socks stops when Dunbar looks back at him.

               Dunbar watches him curiously for a moment and continues 
               leading Cisco up the hill. But now he's glancing regularly 
               over his shoulder and discovers that as he moves, so does 
               the wolf.

               Reaching the top of the hill, Dunbar pauses. He pulls out 
               the pocket telescope and sweeps the prairie. There is nothing.

               Now Dunbar swings onto Cisco's bare back and with a last 
               glance back at the wolf starts down the rise and on to the 
               open prairie at an easy canter. We follow for a little 
               distance. Dunbar glances once more over his shoulder.

               The wolf is sitting on top of the hill watching. He has 
               decided to come no further.

               EXT. SEDGEWICK - DAY

               Considerable time has passed. Dunbar, bundled warmly against 
               the chill of an oncoming storm, and Cisco are coming back 
               into camp from a hunting foray. A brace of grouse is slung 
               over Cisco's withers.

               INT. QUARTERS - DAY

               It's storming outside. Rain is pouring down, its patter broken 
               from time to time by spectacular flashes of lightning and 
               the boom of thunder.

               But inside it's cozy. The quarters are still crowded but 
               considerable order has been brought to bear on the place.

               He is just finishing up the grouse and a pile of bones sits 
               on the table. Open at his side is his journal.

                                     DUNBAR (V.O.)
                         Almost a month and no one has come. 
                         The longer this condition persists, 
                         the less inclined I am to believe 
                         that anyone will. Rain has forced me 
                         indoors for most of two days. I have 
                         begun an awning. The work has ruined 
                         my hands, but I am excited about the 
                         improvement it will bring to this 
                         place.

               A great bolt of lightning strikes outside, filling the room 
               with violent white light. Dunbar walks to the door and tosses 
               out a handful of bones. Two Socks scurries to collect the 
               bones and retreats under the shelter of a nearby tree.

                                     DUNBAR (V.O.)
                         It is the loneliest of times... but 
                         I cannot say that I am unhappy.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               Just as Dunbar did on his trip out with Timmons, someone is 
               running a palm over the tips of the tall prairie grass. This 
               hand, however, is red.

               A lone Indian is standing in the grass, his pony at his side. 
               He is a real Indian; tough, wild and free. He is a person of 
               special maturity. He radiates wisdom and is a man of 
               responsibility in his community. He is a Sioux medicine man. 
               He is KICKING BIRD.

               EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY

               Dunbar is squatting naked at the edge of the stream, pounding 
               the dirt out of his trousers on a little rock ledge. He rises, 
               wringing out the pants, and wades across the river.

               On the opposite bank he spreads the pants on a low bush. 
               Then he looks along the river. For some distance every bush 
               and shrub is draped with the lieutenant's laundry, all of it 
               drying in the sun.

               EXT. SEDGEWICK - DAY

               The spectacular face of Kicking Bird is staring at something.

               He's looking thoughtfully at the "new" Fort Sedgewick; the 
               tidy grounds, the great awning, the repaired corral. The 
               beautiful, buckskin standing inside.

               EXT. RIVER - DAY

               Comfortable with his nakedness, Dunbar is meandering along 
               the stream in no particular hurry. He's very white. His skin 
               practically sparkles in the sun.

               Dunbar is making his way up the bluff. The steepest part is 
               at the lip and here he drops to all fours.

               Dunbar's face comes into view. He freezes.

               Someone is creeping under the shade of the awning... an 
               aboriginal man.

               Dunbar's head pops down behind the bluff.

               The lieutenant is down on his naked haunches. His heart is 
               pounding in his ears. Sweat has broken out on his face. His 
               mouth is dry as ash.

               He's playing back images in fragments. A deerskin shirt, 
               strands of hair sewn along each sleeve. Fringed leggins. A 
               dark, faded breechclout. Moccasins with beading. A single, 
               large feather drooping behind a head of shiny, black hair. 
               Braids wrapped in fur. A lethal stone club hanging from a 
               red hand. No eyebrows on a magnificent, primitive face.

               Dunbar stays in a crouch, trying to think on jellied legs. 
               His breathing has quickened. His mouth is open.

               A horses' whinny startles him.

               Ever so slowly, the lieutenant peers over the bluff.

               The aboriginal man is in the corral. He's walking slowly 
               toward Cisco. One hand is held out reassuringly, the other 
               is grasping a rope. He's making gentle, cooing sounds and is 
               only a step or two from being able to loop his line over the 
               horse's neck.

                                     DUNBAR
                         You there!

               Kicking Bird jumps straight into the air. As he lands he 
               whirls to meet the voice that startled him.

               Dunbar is coming. His hands are clenched and his arms are 
               swinging stiffly at his sides.

               Kicking Bird has turned to stone at the sight of this horror. 
               With a sharp intake of breath, he staggers back a few steps. 
               Then he turns and runs, tearing through the corral fence as 
               if it were made of twigs. He leaps onto his horse and quirts 
               the pony into full gallop.

               Dunbar is watching from the yard. His jaw is clenched, his 
               hands are still fisted.

               The great grassland is empty. Kicking Bird is gone.

               INT. SUPPLY HOUSE - DAY

               The first of three carbine boxes is lugged off the stack.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               The three boxes are stacked on the open prairie. Suddenly a 
               shovelful of dirt flies out of an unseen spot next to the 
               crates. Another flying shovelful. And another.

                                     DUNBAR (V.O.)
                         Have made first contact with a wild 
                         Indian. One came to the fort and 
                         tried to steal my horse. Do not know 
                         how many more are in the vicinity 
                         but I am taking steps for another 
                         visitation. Am burying excess 
                         ordnance, lest it fall into enemy 
                         hands.

               The last square of sod is placed carefully on the surface of 
               the earth. Dunbar drives a bleached rib bone into the ground 
               at an angle just in front of his cache.

               Dunbar steps back from his work. The replaced sod is 
               invisible. The guns will not be found.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               The lieutenant sits atop Cisco scouting along the bluff. 
               Fort Sedgewick lies in the background.

               INT. QUARTERS - DAY

               Dunbar's journal lies open on his bunk. We hear a digging 
               sound in the background. The lieutenant is facing the wall 
               of his quarters. Using a bayonet as a cutting tool, he has 
               carved a window out of the sod. He's nearly finished and is 
               just tidying up.

                                     DUNBAR (V.O.)
                         Have made all the preparations I can 
                         think of. I cannot mount an adequate 
                         defense but will try to make a big 
                         impression when they come. Waiting.

               Finished, he retreats to his bunk and sits staring across at 
               his new window. He glances at the journal by his side and 
               has a thought. He picks it up and starts to write.

                                     DUNBAR (V.O.)
                         The man I encountered was a 
                         magnificent looking fellow.

               EXT. TEN BEARS' LODGE - DAY

               An old Indian man sits in the shade outside his lodge. His 
               skin is leathery, his hair grey and wispy but his eyes are 
               bright as diamonds. He is TEN BEARS, well past sixty, but 
               still strong enough to be the head man. He is, for the most 
               part, oblivious to the GRANDCHILD squirming in his lap.

               He's smoking a long-stemmed pipe, but the main object of his 
               interest is an old woman squatting next to him... PRETTY 
               SHIELD. She's pounding away at something in a bowl.

               Ten Bears looks up to notice Kicking Bird. The medicine man 
               is passing not far away and Ten Bears' eyes follow him 
               carefully, not glancing away until Kicking Bird has ducked 
               into his lodge.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         Kicking Bird has been keeping to 
                         himself these last few days. I do 
                         not like to see our medicine man 
                         walking so alone.

               The old woman looks up from her pounding but does not respond.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         What does his wife say?

                                     PRETTY SHIELD
                         He is keeping to himself.

               Ten Bears gives his wife a challenging look and she bristles.

                                     PRETTY SHIELD
                         That's what she says.

               Ten Bears accepts this. Then he looks down at the bowl.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         Make sure that meat is soft... my 
                         teeth hurt.

               Ten Bears looks once more at the entrance of Kicking Bird's 
               lodge.

               INT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - DAY

               Kicking Bird sits next to the fire playing with his son but 
               he is preoccupied with something.

               There is a rustle of movement at the tent flap, and Ten Bears 
               peers in.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         May I come in?

               The little boy races over to the old chief, Kicking Bird 
               makes a move to pull him back, but Ten Bears indicates the 
               boy should stay.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         No, no let him sit with me.

               There is silence as the two men settle themselves by the 
               fire, the little boy content in Ten Bears' lap.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         Our country seems good this summer, 
                         but I have not been out to see it.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Yes... it is good. The grass is rich. 
                         The game is plenty and not running 
                         away.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         I am glad to hear it. But the buffalo 
                         are late. I always worry about the 
                         bellies of our children.

               A brief silence.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         I was thinking of a dance.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         Yes, a dance is always a good idea. 
                         It would be good to have a strong 
                         sign.

               Kicking Bird seems suddenly uncomfortable. The little boy 
               leaves.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Yes.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         There's a funny thing about signs. 
                         They are always flying in our faces. 
                         We know when they are bad or good 
                         but sometimes they are strange and 
                         there is no way to understand them. 
                         Sometimes they make people crazy but 
                         a smart man will take such a sign 
                         into himself and let it run around 
                         for two or three days. If he is still 
                         confused he will tell somebody. He 
                         might come to you or to me and tell 
                         it. A smart man always does that.

               Ten Bears picks up the pipe and puffs away, seemingly without 
               care.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         I have seen such a sign.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         Oh?

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         I saw a man, a white man.

               Ten Bears' eyes get big for a moment. Then he thinks.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         Just one?

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Just one. He was naked.

               Ten Bears thinks some more.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         Are you sure it was a man?

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         I saw his sex.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         Did you speak to him?

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         No.

               Ten Bears rubs at his old eyes with both hands.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         We will council on this.

               EXT. TEN BEARS' LODGE - NIGHT

               A teenaged boy, SMILES A LOT and his two buddies OTTER and 
               WORM lie prone outside Ten Bears' home. They are peeking 
               under the tipi's rolled-up sides. Their eyes are wide, for 
               inside there's plenty to see and hear. The village's most 
               influential warriors have squeezed into the lodge for this 
               big and important meeting

               INT. TEN BEARS' LODGE - NIGHT

               The eldest and most respected men of the band, including Ten 
               Bears, his pal STONE CALF, an influential warrior named WIND 
               IN HIS HAIR, and Kicking Bird are seated around the fire.

               Crowded around them, in a high state of excitement, are the 
               village's leading warriors. The meeting is in progress.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         He might be a god or he might be a 
                         special chief -- that's why we are 
                         thinking of having a talk with him.

               There is a little murmuring around the fire, and it goes 
               silent. Wind In His Hair rises to speak.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         I do not care for this talk about a 
                         white man. Whatever kind of white 
                         man he is, he is not Sioux and that 
                         makes him less. We've camped here 
                         for ten days now and each day our 
                         scouts find nothing. One old bull 
                         with wolves tearing him apart, nothing 
                         more. We need meat -- not talk.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         You are right, we need meat today 
                         and tomorrow. But we must also have 
                         meat in ten years.

               Kicking Bird pauses here. Everyone is listening attentively.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         But the whites are coming. Our friends 
                         the Shoshone and the Kiowa, even our 
                         enemies, agree on this -- the whites 
                         are coming. More than can be counted.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         Kicking Bird is always looking ahead 
                         and that is good. But when I hear 
                         that more whites are coming -- more 
                         than can be counted I want to laugh. 
                         We took a hundred horses from these 
                         people, there was no honor in it. 
                         They don't ride well, they don't 
                         shoot well, they're dirty. They have 
                         no women, no children. They could 
                         not even make it through one winter 
                         in our country. And these people are 
                         said to flourish? I think they will 
                         all be dead in ten years.

               There is a surge of enthusiasm in the lodge and Wind In His 
               Hair is riding the crest of it.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         I think this white man is probably 
                         lost.

               This parting shot prompts a good-natured round of laughter.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Wind In His Hair has spoken straight, 
                         his words are strong and I have heard 
                         them. It's true the whites are a 
                         poor race and it's hard to understand 
                         them. But when I see one white man 
                         alone, without fear in our country, 
                         I do not think he is lost. I think 
                         he may have medicine. I see someone 
                         who might speak for all the white 
                         people who are coming. I think this 
                         is a person with which treaties might 
                         be struck.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         This white man cannot cover our 
                         lodges, or string our bows, or feed 
                         our children. I will take some good 
                         men... there are many here tonight. 
                         We will ride to the soldier fort, we 
                         will shoot some arrows into this 
                         white man. If he truly has medicine 
                         he will not be hurt. If he has no 
                         medicine he will be dead.

               This is the best idea so far and there is much talk around 
               the fire. They quiet down as Ten Bears prepares to speak.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         It is easy to become confused by 
                         these questions. It is hard to know 
                         what to do. No man can tell another 
                         how he will be. But I know this... 
                         killing a white man is a delicate 
                         matter. If you kill one, more are 
                         sure to come. We should talk about 
                         this some more.

               He drops his head, closes his eyes and starts to fall asleep. 
               The meeting is over.

               EXT. TEN BEARS' LODGE - NIGHT

               Inside the meeting is breaking up. But Smiles A Lot is no 
               longer watching. He's lost in thought, as if he has got 
               something on his mind.

               Now he comes out of it. With a last look into the lodge, he 
               sneaks off into the night.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - NIGHT

               Three boys Otter, Worm and their leader Smiles A Lot, are 
               riding to the fort.

               Smiles A Lot stops, just realizing that the other two have 
               fallen behind. He rides back to investigate.

                                     SMILES A LOT
                         What's the matter now?

                                     WORM
                         Otter doesn't want to go.

               Smiles a Lot trots his pony over to Otter.

                                     SMILES A LOT
                         If we take the horse of a white god 
                         they will make up songs about us.

                                     OTTER
                         Maybe.

                                     SMILES A LOT
                         They will ask us to go on raids.

                                     OTTER
                         Who gets the white god horse?

                                     SMILES A LOT
                         I do... but we share... you and Worm 
                         can ride him too. Who can say this 
                         is not a great plan?

               Otter and Worm have blank expressions.

               INT. QUARTERS - NIGHT

               Dunbar is snoring. The lantern is turned down low. A horse 
               whinnies loudly and Dunbar arises.

               In the next instant there is a pounding of hooves and the 
               yelping of Indian boys.

               Reeling with sleep, Dunbar is up and moving. He grabs a rifle 
               and lurches for the door.

               As he runs through the door he forgets to duck under the 
               wooden cross beam. His skull cracks resoundingly against 
               the. overhang and Dunbar slumps onto his back... out cold.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - NIGHT

               The three boys are shrieking as they race across the prairie 
               with their prize. Otter has Cisco by a lead line. Smiles A 
               Lot gallops alongside.

                                     SMILES A LOT
                         Let me take him Otter.

                                     OTTER
                         I have him.

               To Smiles A Lot's amazement, Otter is suddenly gone. He's 
               zooming backward in midair.

               Otter comes to ground a few yards back, throwing up a puff 
               of dust. Cisco has screeched to a halt. Now he rears up, 
               twisting until the rope is free of Otter. Then he sticks his 
               tail in the air and makes tracks in the direction of the 
               fort. Worm chases after Cisco as Smiles A Lot sees to Otter

               EXT. PRAIRIE - NIGHT

               Smiles A Lot pulls his pony up next to Otter and peers down 
               at the fallen boy.

                                     SMILES A LOT
                         What happened?

                                     OTTER
                         I don't know. My arm doesn't work.

                                     SMILES A LOT
                         You shouldn't have fallen down... 
                         now we'll get in trouble.

                                     OTTER
                         It was your idea.

                                     SMILES A LOT
                         My idea was only to take the horse.

               This squabble is interrupted by Worm's return. He gallops up 
               and jumps off his pony.

                                     SMILES A LOT
                         Otter hurt himself.

               Worm shakes his head in frustration. Otter grabs a handful 
               of dirt and flings it at Smiles A Lot and Worm.

                                     OTTER
                              (to Worm)
                         You're not hurt... I'm hurt.

                                     WORM
                         I will be when my father finds out, 
                         his bow will be across my back.

               INT. QUARTERS - DAWN

               It's growing light and Dunbar is just coming to. He rolls to 
               one side and touches the egg that has risen on his forehead. 
               He hears movement in the yard and looks out.

               Cisco is pawing the ground. The Indian line still around his 
               neck.

               EXT. RIVER - DAY

               Dunbar is sitting naked in the shallow river below the fort. 
               He has worked up a good lather on his face and is shaving. 
               The big Navy revolver and his gunbelt are slung over his 
               shoulder. Dunbar glances at the far bluff.

               Two Socks is sitting quietly, watching the shaving ritual 
               below.

               The lieutenant is finishing shaving his moustache. He stares 
               onto the surface of the water trying to get it just right. 
               Once again he glances up at Two Socks.

               Two Socks' attention has been diverted. He's on guard, staring 
               intently across the river.

               Dunbar looks quickly at the bluff nearest the fort. Everything 
               is still. He looks back at Two Socks.

               The wolf is gone.

               The lieutenant hears something now. Hoofbeats. Hoofbeats 
               coming in a rush.

               He bursts from the water and scrambles up the incline.

               EXT. CORRAL - DAY

               They're streaming past him. FIVE MOUNTED WARRIORS bunched 
               around Cisco: raw, powerful men on painted, feathered ponies. 
               Wind In His Hair is one of them.

               Their faces are streaked with colorful designs, their weapons 
               slung around the shoulders, their nearly naked bodies all 
               sinew and bone. They are the full and breathtaking glory of 
               war.

               Dunbar is struck dumb. He stands still as the pageant passes 
               in front of him.

               The sight of Dunbar troubles Wind In His Hair, so much that 
               he pulls up a hundred yards away. He sits a moment on his 
               whirling pony, trying to decide if he should confront this 
               white god.

               He makes a warrior's choice. Wind In His Hair shouts to his 
               fellows to go on and charges down the slope... straight for 
               Dunbar.

               Dunbar's eyes are fixed on the closing horseman. He can't 
               move.

               Wind In His Hair is coming flat out, his lance extended. At 
               the last moment he pulls up so hard that the black pony skids 
               to a sit. The horse is up quickly and hard to manage. He 
               pitches back and forth only a few feet in front of Lieutenant 
               Dunbar.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         I am Wind In His Hair. Do you not 
                         see that I am not afraid of you?... 
                         Do you see?

               Dunbar stares expressionlessly into the Sioux's eyes. He 
               doesn't blink.

               Wind In His Hair suddenly turns his pony and whips after his 
               comrades. A big smile breaks out across his face.

               Dunbar stares after the disappearing horse and rider. He 
               feels the weight of the gun and lets it drop to the ground.

               For two or three steps he staggers toward the quarters, but 
               his legs give way and he falls face first in a dead faint.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               Wind In His Hair is riding hard and happy. He really fixed 
               that white god. But as he clears the brow of a rise, a 
               riderless horse blows past him, running in the opposite 
               direction.

               Cisco's running back, to the fort at full speed, the lines 
               of two ropes flying behind him.

               The big warrior's smile is gone. He wheels his pony and 
               charges over the rise, nearly colliding with another warrior 
               who has been in hot pursuit of Cisco. The warrior pulls up 
               and looks helplessly at Wind In His Hair. But Wind In His 
               Hair's attention is focused on the rest of his party. The 
               three remaining warriors who rode with him are all on foot. 
               One is bending over a man lying unconscious on the ground. 
               The third is limping badly, trying to catch his horse.

               Wind In His Hair glances back in the direction of the fort, 
               but the buckskin is already gone.

               He starts down the incline to help his friends.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               Wind In His Hair and his friends, two of them riding double, 
               are going slowly home when they see a COURIER coming in their 
               direction. They rein in waiting for the young man cantering 
               toward them.

               He speaks directly to Wind In His Hair.

                                     COURIER
                         The party that went against the Pawnee 
                         is coming in...

               Wind In His Hair says nothing.

                                     COURIER
                         There are many hearts on the ground.

               EXT. INDIAN CAMP - DUSK

               Several travois are parked in a clearing. It's a scene of 
               terrible woe. On the travois are dead bodies. Women members 
               of several families are grieving as they collect the dead 
               men.

               Some are shrieking, some are crying softly, and some are 
               beating themselves.

               One group is just beginning to hoist a body off its litter 
               when a strange looking woman appears in the clearing. She's 
               been running. Her light, cherry-colored hair is tangled.

               Her face is creased with pain and disbelief as she rushes 
               forward, crying out in Sioux. She pushes through the other 
               women and tackles the body, taking it to the ground.

               She climbs atop the dead man, cradles his head against her 
               face and says a single word softly.

               It is his name and she whispers it again.

               Of course there is no answer. With each saying of the name 
               she is more desperate, her voice growing louder and louder.

               She arches her back eerily and wails the name to the heavens 
               before flinging herself back at the lifeless face.

               At last the other mourners feel compelled to drag her away. 
               The little woman does not go easily.

               Her name is STANDS WITH A FIST.

               EXT. SEDGEWICK - NIGHT

               The lieutenant rides, a silhouette against a harvest moon.

                                     DUNBAR (V.O.)
                         I realize now that I have been wrong. 
                         All this time I have been waiting. 
                         Waiting for what? For someone to 
                         find me? For Indians to take my horse? 
                         To see a buffalo?

               INT. QUARTERS - NIGHT

               Lieutenant Dunbar has gotten a beautiful shine out of his 
               best boots. He's putting the finishing touches on one of the 
               toes.

               Dunbar places the boot next to its mate and turns to inspect 
               a dress tunic laid out on the bunk. His open journal is lying 
               next to it. He picks at little pieces of lint and brushes at 
               the smudges.

                                     DUNBAR (V.O.)
                         Since I arrived at this post I have 
                         been walking on eggs. It has become 
                         a bad habit and I am sick of it. 
                         Tomorrow morning I will ride out to 
                         the Indians. I do not know the outcome 
                         or the wisdom of this thinking. But 
                         I have become a target and a target 
                         makes a poor impression. I am through 
                         waiting.

               EXT. CORRAL - DAY

               The buckskin's ears are pricked and his eyes are set. 
               Something has his complete attention.

               The "something" is Lieutenant John Dunbar. He looks like a 
               recruiting poster: full dress uniform, red sash, saber 
               clanking at his side, hair tied in a neat pony tail, knee-
               length riding boots. And all of it is gleaming... from the 
               brass buttons to the gold epaulettes to the army issue belt 
               buckle.

               The red sash flutters and Cisco shies to one side. Dunbar 
               slaps at the sash, calms his horse and jumps on.

               We stop with them at the supply house. Old Glory is standing 
               against one of the crumbling walls. The flag has been affixed 
               to a long willow branch. Dunbar sweeps it up and sticks the 
               staff into one of his boots.

               They start off at a jog, the flag popping in the stiff morning 
               breeze. Just as they are getting small in the distance, Two 
               Socks comes into view.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               Lieutenant Dunbar has ridden deep into the prairie. Watching 
               the sky, he takes a drink out of his canteen. The lieutenant 
               hears something, he turns Cisco in that direction. He listens 
               harder. A weird sort of singing. Warily he goes ahead.

               EXT. KNOLL - DAY

               Stands With A Fist is sitting under a solitary cottonwood. 
               Her hands are folded on her lap. A blood-stained knife is 
               held between them. She has ritually slashed her arms. The 
               cuts are not deep -- but all are running with blood. Blood 
               pours from a deep cut in her thigh.

               She lets her song fade to nothing and bows her head. She 
               dabs at a large pool of blood spreading in the ground next 
               to her thigh. Suddenly she's alert. Stands With A Fist has 
               heard something too... a strange popping sound. She turns.

               The gleaming buckskin horse is standing thirty or forty feet 
               behind her on the top of the knoll. A white soldier is sitting 
               on the horse. A white soldier with a sword, a bright uniform 
               and a red sash. And most amazing of all, no face.

               A shift in the breeze has wrapped the popping red, white, 
               and blue flag around his head. One of the soldier's hands is 
               trying to claw it away from his face.

               Dunbar pulls the flag away.

               It's an Indian woman alright. But now that she is staring at 
               him open-mouthed and afraid, he can see that there is 
               something odd about her.

               Too late for further study. She's risen and has taken a slow 
               step backward from the knoll. She's covered with blood.

               Reflexively, he offers a helping hand and calls after her.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Wait...

               She's still backing down the hill, her steps a little faster 
               now. He's following her at a walk.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Wait... you're hurt.

               She's reached the base of the knoll and has begun to run. 
               Dunbar is trotting after her.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Let me help you.

               She's too weak to run and falls face first in the grass. She 
               starts to crawl.

               Dunbar slips off Cisco and reaches down tentatively for her 
               shoulder. She screams at his touch and he pulls away. But he 
               follows on foot as she crawls.

                                     DUNBAR
                         You're hurt... you need help.

               He takes her again, this time holding her firmly. She 
               struggles mightily, twisting onto her back. She lashes out 
               at his face but he grabs her hands, holding them tight. 
               They're nose to nose.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         Don't...

               He can't believe he heard it and she can't believe she said 
               it.

               She spits out a Stream of Sioux curses, throws her head back 
               and wails like a wolf. Then she passes out.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               She's lying in the same spot, still unconscious. The cuts on 
               her arms have been bandaged up with strips of Old Glory.

               Modestly, Dunbar lifts her dress to get at the bad thigh 
               wound. As he ties it off, the lieutenant notices how white 
               her skin is. He runs a finger over it. She is very still and 
               he presses an ear to her heart. She's still breathing.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               Dunbar is on Cisco. His big impression is gone. The uniform, 
               and his hands and face are smeared with Stands With A Fist's 
               blood. The girl is slung in front of him.

               His arms are holding her. Her face is pressed against his 
               chest. They've come a good distance and are approaching a 
               smokey cloud.

               EXT. PONY HERD - DAY

               Smiles A Lot, Worm and Otter (who now sports a crude splint 
               on his arm) are occupying an open space in the midst of a 
               huge pony herd.

               They should be on guard against enemies but the three boys 
               are sitting on the ground, absorbed in a gambling game.

               EXT. PONY HERD - DAY

               Dunbar is skirting the edge of the herd. Leaving the horses 
               behind him, the lieutenant makes his way up a gentle slope.

               A powerful vision is upon him.

               Ten Bears' village is rising slowly, like a curtain going 
               up. The smoke from many fires, the willow poles fanning 
               against the sky, the conical houses covered with well-used 
               hides, the horses along the river, the children, the women, 
               the men. An ancient tableau, fully alive before his eyes.

               EXT. VILLAGE OUTSKIRTS - DAY

               Dunbar has stopped on the slope leading down to the village, 
               taking it all in. No one has seen him. He can hear human 
               voices drifting up from the camp.

               Stands With A Fist coughs lightly against his tunic and the 
               lieutenant moves Cisco ahead at a walk.

               EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

               A woman and her children have come out of the breaks along 
               the river and are marching back to the village when one of 
               the kids sees him. With an ear-splitting shriek, the woman 
               grabs up her children and runs screaming for the safety of 
               the village.

               There's pandemonium amongst the lodges. Everyone seems to be 
               running everywhere at once.

               Dunbar pulls Cisco to a halt a hundred yards from the first 
               of the conical houses and slides off, taking the girl up in 
               his arms.

               The people of Ten Bear's village, realizing now that there 
               is only one white man and that he is carrying someone, are 
               massing with great curiosity on the outskirts of the town.

               Warriors, some of them mounted, have taken the front ranks. 
               The women and children and elderly are standing just behind.

               Initial panic has given way to a steady buzzing as everyone 
               jockeys for a better look.

               Still holding Stands With A Fist in his arms, Dunbar suddenly 
               stops on a familiar face... Wind In His Hair.

               He lifts the girl resting in his arms and holds her out... 
               as in offering.

                                     DUNBAR
                         She's hurt.

               The Sioux buzz is stronger now. The mounted warriors are 
               getting excited.

               Suddenly, Wind In His Hair breaks ranks and starts for Dunbar 
               at a determined walk. A nasty war club is held tightly in 
               hand.

               Dunbar stands his ground.

               Wind In His Hair halts only a few steps in front of Dunbar. 
               He barks at the intruder as he takes another step or two.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         You are not welcome here.

               Another step and he is close enough to touch the white man.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         Go away from us...

               Dunbar doesn't flinch. And Wind In His Hair's harangue is 
               definitely part bluster. He's very curious about the woman 
               in Dunbar's arms and now he peers down at her face.

               The lieutenant looks down too and in a flash she is torn out 
               of his grasp.

               Holding her in one strong arm, Wind In His Hair backs a pace 
               or two and shouts once more at the lieutenant.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         Go away from us... go now.

               He raises his club and shakes it at Dunbar.

               Though he doesn't understand the words, Dunbar gets the 
               message. As he goes for his horse, Wind In His Hair marches 
               back to his people with Stands With A Fist.

               There is great commotion as the crowd surges in around Wind 
               In His Hair.

               With a look of profound disappointment, Dunbar walks away on 
               Cisco.

               EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

               Otter, Worm and Smiles A Lot are riding in, drawn by the 
               ruckus in the village. They see the white soldier oh his 
               horse leaving the camp. They see the tumult in the village 
               and realize they are in trouble, again.

               Some of the young, mounted warriors are shouting taunts at 
               the departing soldier, calling for him to come back and fight. 
               They seem set to take out after him when Kicking Bird suddenly 
               appears in front of their ponies.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         The soldier did not come to fight -- 
                         he is going away and we will let 
                         him.

               No one is going to argue with one of the band's leading men. 
               The young warriors shout a few more taunts and turn away.

               The medicine man glances after the boys who just came in. 
               Each boy, confronted now by an angry father or uncle, is 
               being jerked off his pony. There's going to be discipline.

               Kicking Bird looks back at the lieutenant.

               Dunbar's head is down and his shoulders are slumped. It is a 
               sight that makes the wheels in Kicking Bird's head turn.

               INT. TEN BEARS' LODGE - NIGHT

               Another council is in progress. As before, the leading men 
               are seated around Ten Bears' fire while the other warriors 
               stand packed in the shadows. Wind In His Hair is seated close 
               to the elders.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         I am in agreement with Kicking Bird. 
                         We will go down and talk to the white 
                         man and find out what kind of white 
                         man he is.

               Wind In His Hair jumps into the conversation.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         If this council decides to talk with 
                         the man at the soldier fort then it 
                         will be so. But in my mind it is not 
                         right that a Sioux chief, a chief as 
                         great as Ten Bears, goes to ask the 
                         business of a puny, trespassing white 
                         man... a white soldier who has only 
                         a smart horse and a few white man 
                         clothes.

               There are many yeses in response to this. As is his custom, 
               Ten Bears lets the outburst subside, seeming unruffled all 
               the while. Casually, he pops a piece of meat into his mouth 
               and begins to chew.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         I will not go... you will go... you 
                         and Kicking Bird. That is all I have 
                         to say.

               EXT. SEDGEWICK - DAY

               Dunbar is sitting cross-legged in the grass. His mouth is 
               occupied with chewing. In one hand is a knife, in the other 
               is a chunk of slab bacon. He saws off a slice and extends 
               it, waiting patiently.

               The wolf is sitting only a few feet away. He wants the offered 
               meat but cannot bring himself to eat from a human hand. 
               Finally, Dunbar flips the bacon into the grass and Two Socks 
               pounces on it. He takes his prize toward the river and out 
               of view.

               Dunbar starts for his quarters. He stops. The hair on the 
               back of his neck is standing straight up.

               EXT. SEDGEWICK - DAY

               Six Sioux warriors, THE ESCORT, are sitting atop their ponies 
               high on the ridge.

               Dunbar buttons his tunic and casts a quick, backward glance 
               at the quarters. A rifle is standing near the door.

               Dunbar decides not to go after it. He straightens his bearings 
               and he watches the approaching riders. It's only two -- Wind 
               In His Hair and Kicking Bird. The lieutenant bows at the 
               waist.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Welcome...
                              (gesturing at them)
                         Come... please... sit down.

               The two men slide off their ponies. Dunbar throws an 
               unreturned wave to the escort warriors.

               There is a moment or two of silence.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Would you like some coffee? Coffee?

               There is no response.

                                     DUNBAR
                         I'll get some cups.

               Dunbar disappears inside his quarters.

               EXT. SEDGEWICK - DAY

               Wind In His Hair and Kicking Bird are sitting comfortably 
               under the awning, each holding steaming army-issue cups. 
               They are staring straight ahead with a curious expression.

               Dunbar is turning a handle on a machine. It is a coffee 
               grinder.

               The last of the beans goes down and Dunbar pauses for dramatic 
               effect. Then he pulls out the drawer containing the fresh 
               grounds and passes it to the medicine man. Kicking Bird and 
               Wind In His Hair both sniff the contents.

               Dunbar gestures at their still full mugs -- neither one of 
               them has taken a drink.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Is the coffee not good? Too strong 
                         maybe? Here...

               Dunbar reaches for a sack by the fire. Holding it in front 
               of him, Dunbar suggests that Wind In His Hair put some of 
               its contents into his mug.

               Wind In His Hair finally does, but his blank expression 
               indicates that he doesn't know what difference this could 
               make.

               Dunbar takes a lick at his fingers, suggesting that Wind In 
               His Hair should do the same. A smile creeps over his face as 
               the universal appeal of sugar is taking hold. Wind In His 
               Hair has licked every bit off each finger.

                                     DUNBAR
                              (to Kicking Bird)
                         Do you want some?

               Wind In His Hair doesn't wait for Kicking Bird's answer. He 
               reaches over and dumps a good amount in Kicking Bird's cup, 
               adding some more to his own for good measure.

                                     DUNBAR
                         So what are you guys doing? Looking 
                         for buffalo?

               There is no response. Wind In His Hair's attention is now on 
               Cisco.

                                     DUNBAR
                         He's a good one... good horse. My 
                         horse.

               Wind In His Hair's interest borders on rude. Prompted by a 
               light tap on his leg from Kicking Bird, Wind In His Hair 
               turns his attention back to Dunbar.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Good horse.

               No argument from Wind In His Hair.

                                     DUNBAR
                         My horse. You see any buffalo?

               Kicking Bird and Wind In His Hair are baffled.

               The lieutenant is trying to jam a wadded blanket under the 
               back of his tunic.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Wait just a bit.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                              (to Kicking Bird)
                         His mind is gone.

               Kicking Bird doesn't respond. He's still intent on the 
               lieutenant. In wedging the blanket under his tunic, Dunbar 
               has become a hunchback. He bends over in a weird attitude, 
               and with a finger peeking over each side of his head, he 
               begins a bizarre display of dancing, punctuated with snorts 
               and bellows.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Buffalo.

                                     DUNBAR
                              (incorrectly in Sioux)
                         Buffalo?

                                     KICKING BIRD
                              (slowly)
                         Buffalo.

                                     DUNBAR
                              (getting it right)
                         Buffalo.

               Kicking Bird nods his assent and Dunbar flashes a pleased 
               smile.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Buffalo.

               EXT. SEDGEWICK - DAY

               Dunbar is watching Kicking Bird and Wind In His Hair walk 
               their horses up the ridge to meet the waiting escort. Each 
               horse has a gift of coffee and sugar slung over its withers. 
               Occasionally, Wind In His Hair dips a hand into one of the 
               bags and carefully licks each finger.

               Dunbar waves up at them but there is no response.

                                     DUNBAR (V.O.)
                         The sugar didn't figure to last at 
                         that rate any way. I don't believe 
                         I'd go too far in saying that a 
                         foundation for good relations is 
                         being laid.

               DISSOLVE INTO:

               EXT. SEDGEWICK - DAY

                                     DUNBAR (V.O.)
                         They have come again, as always the 
                         same two with an escort of six.

               Dunbar is standing in the same spot, it is a new day

               Leaving their ever present escort behind, Kicking Bird and 
               Wind In His Hair ride into the fort.

               Kicking Bird's pony is carrying something large and bulky on 
               his withers. A buffalo robe. Dunbar walks up to greet them. 
               Kicking Bird returns the welcome and signs to him as he 
               speaks.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Have you seen any buffalo?

               Dunbar can only shake his head no.

               Kicking Bird accepts this and dismounts.

               Dunbar throws his customary wave but the escort remains 
               noncommittal.

               EXT. HILL - DUSK

               Dunbar is lying on his buffalo robe, his hand runs against 
               the grain of the thick fur. He begins writing in his journal.

                                     DUNBAR (V.O.)
                         I believe I am dealing with Kiowa 
                         Indians as I have heard that word on 
                         several occasions.

               He rolls on his back, and lays aside the journal, practicing 
               the hand signals.

                                     DUNBAR (V.O.)
                         I am learning the Kiowa words for 
                         head, hand, horse, fire, coffee, 
                         buffalo, hello and goodbye.

               EXT. SEDGEWICK - DAY

               It's raining. High on a hill, the Indian escort waits 
               stoically, horses heads bowed in the drizzle. On the haunches 
               of one of the ponies is a single deer.

               Down below, Wind In His Hair and Kicking Bird are still 
               mounted and converse with Dunbar using sign talk.

                                     DUNBAR
                         No, I haven't seen any buffalo. Are 
                         you hungry? I have food... are you 
                         hungry?

               Dunbar suggests they take some of his supplies but Kicking 
               Bird will not stand for this. He waves Dunbar off. The three 
               men say their goodbyes, and Dunbar as usual throws a wave to 
               the six men on the hill.

               Unexpectedly, one of them returns it and the other five react 
               with surprise.

                                     ESCORT 1
                         He waved.

                                     DUNBAR (V.O.)
                         Nothing I have been told about these 
                         people is correct. They are not 
                         beggars and thieves. They are not 
                         the bogeymen they have been made out 
                         to be.

               Kicking Bird and Wind In His Hair disappear over the hill, 
               followed by their escort.

               Lightning bursts far out on the prairie.

               INT. QUARTERS - NIGHT

               Dunbar huddles beneath the warmth of his buffalo robe. He is 
               finishing up the second of two drawings. It is a portrait of 
               Wind In His Hair, he carefully titles it "The Fierce One." 
               He has already completed a likeness of Kicking Bird and 
               underneath it the words "The Quiet One."

               EXT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - DAY

               Several children are playing close-by as Stands With A Fist 
               works over a staked-out hide, scraping away the excess flesh. 
               Though her arms are lined with scabs her work is methodical 
               and unforced. She seems recovered.

                                     KICKING BIRD (O.S.)
                         Stands With A Fist.

               She looks up to see the medicine man looming over her.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         We will talk awhile.

               INT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - DAY

               Except for Kicking Bird and Stands With A Fist, the tipi is 
               empty. They are just seating themselves at the firepit in 
               the center of the lodge. A brief silence, during which Kicking 
               Bird studies the girl with the bowed head.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Your wounds are healing well?

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         Yes.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         You are happy here, with my family?

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         I am glad to be here. I am missing 
                         my husband.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Perhaps you will marry again when 
                         the time is right.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         Perhaps.

               Kicking Bird is leading up to something and Stands With A 
               Fist fears it. She keeps her head bowed.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         We have word from many places that 
                         the whites are...

               Kicking Bird stops himself, he knows this must be hard. She 
               brings her green eyes to bear on the medicine man, waiting 
               to hear more.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         They are coming into everyone's 
                         country. They will soon be in ours I 
                         think. This white man who lives at 
                         the old soldier fort, the one who 
                         calls himself loo ten tant... I have 
                         visited him and I believe his heart 
                         is a good one. He knows things about 
                         the whites which we do not.

               He pauses letting this sink in.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         I am afraid of the man at the fort.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         He is only one man.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         I am afraid that he will tell some 
                         whites that I am here. I am afraid 
                         that they will try to take me away.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Every warrior in camp would fight 
                         them if they tried.

               She is not much reassured by this. In the way of a defeatist 
               she lowers her eyes once more.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         I cannot make the white man talk. 
                         Loo ten tant does not know Sioux.

               Kicking Bird waits. Still she does not raise her head.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         You have a certain medicine which no 
                         other Sioux -- man or woman -- has.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         It has been a long time since I made 
                         the talk.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         I do not ask this for myself... I 
                         ask this for all our people.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         It's dead in me.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         I want you to try and remember the 
                         the word.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         I don't know how.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         You don't want to know.

               This outburst shocks Stands With A Fist, she runs out of the 
               lodge.

               EXT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - DAY

               Stands With A Fist rushes past BLACK SHAWL, her face covered 
               with tears. Now Kicking Bird comes out. Black Shawl looks at 
               Kicking Bird, his face is not happy.

                                     BLACK SHAWL
                         Will she make the white words?

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Perhaps I am asking too much.

               EXT. RIVER - DAY

               Stands With A Fist is tearing through the thick willows 
               growing alongside the river. She's crying her heart out.

               EXT. RIVER - DAY

               The big cry is over, but Stands With A Fist is still sniffling 
               as she emerges on a little patch of beach-next to the river. 
               She sits herself down under a cottonwood and looks hollowly 
               at the surface of the water in front of her.

               Somewhere in the distance is the sound of many drums, with a 
               sigh she drops her head.

               Then, as if shocked by some unseen force, her eyes spring 
               open. Wide and unblinking, her eyes stare deeply into space.

               Someone is calling. The voice is so faint at first that the 
               word can't be heard. But the calling grows and suddenly the 
               word is upon her.

                                     VOICE
                         Christine...

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY (FLASHBACK)

               A little girl of seven, CHRISTINE, is lying in the grass of 
               a sod roof. Next to her is ten year-old WILLIE. They are 
               planning their wedding and staring up at the sky.

               Like many youngsters she's not eager to heed the persistent 
               call of her mother.

                                     MOTHER (O.S.)
                         Christine... where are you?

               Reluctantly, the little girl gets up and looks over the edge 
               of the roof to see her mother holding yet another child. She 
               seems anxious.

                                     CHRISTINE
                         I'm right here mother...

                                     MOTHER
                         Get inside both of you.

                                     CHRISTINE
                         Why?

                                     MOTHER
                         Just do what I... oh God! Stay where 
                         you are. Keep down do you hear me?

               FOUR PAWNEE are riding up in the background. TWO MEN are 
               moving out to meet them.

                                     CHRISTINE
                         Who is it Willie?

               Willie is peeking over the edge of the roof. An old muzzle-
               loading rifle is by his side. He whispers to her.

                                     WILLIE
                         They look like Pawnee... my father 
                         and your father are talking to them.

               Down in the yard, out beyond a rough table set with the 
               leavings of a Sunday dinner, two white men on foot are talking 
               to the four mounted Pawnee warriors.

               It's an argument. As a baby cries somewhere inside the house 
               the two white men sign the Indians to go away. The Pawnee 
               make no move to go however, and with their patience at an 
               end, the two white men turn back to the house.

               One of the warriors brings his hatchet down and nails a white 
               man between the shoulder blades. The injured man grunts and 
               hops sideways. The other runs for the house but is cut down 
               by arrows.

               Women begin to scream.

               Willie is scooting down the roof, his face white with fear.

                                     WILLIE
                         Run Christine...

                                     CHRISTINE
                         Why?

                                     WILLIE
                         Just run!

               He gives her a hard shove which sends her rolling down the 
               roof.

                                     WILLIE
                         Run!

               Christine runs past the point where the roof meets the natural 
               hillside and down into the draw. She's running toward us. In 
               the background we can see Willie on the edge of the roof, 
               aiming his squirrel gun into the yard. He fires once, then 
               grasping the gun like a club, he leaps off the roof and 
               disappears.

               Christine never looks back. She runs up the draw as fast as 
               her skinny young legs can carry her.

               EXT. HOLE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

               The moon is up. Christine is feebly clawing at the ground, 
               trying to pry herself out of a tiny hole. She gives up. Then, 
               from the burrow's dark entrance comes the thin, cracking 
               voice of a little girl.

                                     CHRISTINE
                         Now I lay me down to sleep. I pray 
                         the lord my soul to keep. If I die 
                         before I wake, I pray the lord my 
                         soul to take.

               EXT. RIVER - DAY

               Stands With A Fist is still in shock. The drumming in the 
               village is very loud now. She rises unsteadily to her feet 
               and starts back to camp.

               EXT. SEDGEWICK - NIGHT

               The moon is full. As we look down on the fort we can hear a 
               new sound coming off the prairie. A light rumbling.

               INT. QUARTERS - NIGHT

               Lieutenant Dunbar is asleep in the moonlight. The rumbling 
               is getting louder. It wakes him. He gropes about, lights the 
               lantern and listens to the strange, powerful sound.

               Something's in the air. He holds the lantern toward the 
               ceiling. Particles of dirt and dust are being shaken from 
               the roof. It's the earth that's trembling.

               EXT. SEDGEWICK - NIGHT

               Dressed in only pants and boots, Dunbar walks along the bluff 
               above the river, his lantern held out in front of him. The 
               sound is tremendous now. Dunbar stops as a great wall of 
               dust rises before him.

               At the same time, he realizes something is alive behind the 
               wall of dust, he recognizes the sound... the sound of 
               thousands of hoofbeats.

               He sees one veer out. And now another. And another, darting 
               briefly from the great cloud of dust. The most powerful force 
               on the prairie now seems like the most powerful force on 
               earth as it thunders by.

               The buffalo.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - NIGHT

               Dunbar and Cisco are running flat out in the moonlight.

               EXT. INDIAN VILLAGE - NIGHT

               The village is coming up. A great fire is blazing at the far 
               end. Horse and rider speed past the first lodge.

               It's an important mission for the lieutenant. As he gallops 
               through the village, he says one word over and over, trying 
               to remember the correct pronunciation. It's the Sioux word 
               for buffalo.

               EXT. FIRE - NIGHT

               Everyone has gathered around the great blaze. In the center 
               of the circle close to the fire, the buffalo men are dancing. 
               Others are dancing too. The music is very loud.

               The little buckskin is out of his head with speed. He doesn't 
               answer the bit when Dunbar first tries to pull him up.

               People scatter in all directions, as Dunbar and Cisco charge 
               into their midst.

               Dunbar pulls back with all his might, and the buckskin sits 
               down. He's wet from his long ride, and Dunbar can't stay on 
               his back. As Cisco rears, he slides off and tumbles onto his 
               back.

               Angry warriors pile on top of him. Dunbar shouts out the 
               word for buffalo, yelling it over and over as the warriors 
               pummel him.

               So many men have rushed into the fray that none can deal the 
               lieutenant a decisive blow. They roll about in the dust. 
               Just as Dunbar's cries have begun to lose their strength, he 
               feels a sudden lessening of the weight upon him.

               As the men pile off, Dunbar is left flat on his back. His 
               lip is split and blood is streaming from his nose.

               He's looking into a familiar face. The man's head is covered 
               with the full skin and feathers of an eagle. Kicking Bird.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Buffalo...

               Kicking Bird doesn't understand or can't hear. He brings his 
               face close to Dunbar's.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Buffalo...
                              (making horns with 
                              his fingers)
                         Buffalo.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Buffalo?

                                     DUNBAR
                         Yes. Buffalo.

               Kicking Bird raises up and yells it out to his people.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         The buffalo have come.

               For a fleeting moment there is shocked silence. Then the 
               Sioux explode with excitement.

               Still dazed, Dunbar is pulled to his feet. The people are 
               surging in around him with yelps of joy.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               A wide stretch of prairie, falling away to nothing.

               The buffalo have left a trail in the form of a tremendous 
               swath of torn-up ground, several hundred yards from side to 
               side.

               Indians on horseback move into the picture.

               Most of Ten Bears' camp is moving out in a long, noisy column. 
               Spirits are high. First come the lead scouts, followed by 
               Ten Bears and his advisors, Kicking Bird and wind In His 
               Hair among them. A large body of warriors come next. Behind 
               these men are the women, children and elderly. Dunbar is 
               riding at the head of the last group.

               The attitudes of the people have changed significantly. People 
               who catch his eye are openly smiling at the lieutenant.

               An old woman comes alongside and offers him a piece of dried 
               meat, patting his hand as he takes it.

               Here comes Smiles A Lot, Worm and Otter, all on ponies, 
               galloping up beside him. They want to play.

                                     SMILES A LOT
                         Loo ten tant...

               He motions for Dunbar to break ranks and while the lieutenant 
               is puzzling this out, a chorus of cries comes from the 
               column's front.

               Three far-ranging scouts are coming in at a run.

               EXT. COLUMN - DAY

               The scouts pull up in front of Ten Bears to make their report. 
               There's no way to know what's going on but something important 
               is happening.

               Wind In His Hair suddenly breaks ranks and rides back to the 
               main body of warriors. A dozen warriors strip off their shirts 
               and leggings. They're ready in moments. Then, with Wind In 
               His Hair leading them, the party breaks away from the column 
               and rides east at a gallop.

               The column resumes its southward march.

               EXT. COLUMN - DAY

               The day has grown hot as the column continues its march 
               through changing terrain.

               Dunbar is suffering some. The heat and dust are monstrous. 
               At the moment however, he's most concerned with Stands With 
               A Fist. She's riding closeby and he watches her with interest.

               It's easier to see now that she was once white.

               Suddenly she looks in his direction. The lieutenant quickly 
               tips his hat, but she turns her shy eyes away before he has 
               finished the motion.

               Kicking Bird is riding down the line. The medicine man 
               gestures Dunbar forward and the lieutenant guides Cisco out 
               of line.

               Through her tangled hair, Stands With A Fist watches the 
               soldier and the medicine man ride up the line.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               Dunbar and Kicking Bird are riding together at the flank of 
               Ten Bears' entourage.

               Far in the distance, the lieutenant sees something strange 
               on the prairie... pink bumps are dotting the landscape up 
               ahead. And black specks are moving about on the bumps.

               EXT. KILLING GROUND - DAY

               Beneath droves of scavenging black birds lies the body of a 
               buffalo. His hide has been peeled off and his tongue has 
               been cut out. The rest of his body has been left to rot in 
               the sun.

               The column, so noisy and happy before, winds its way through 
               the killing ground in silence. There must be twenty-five 
               buffalo like the one we saw close up, all of them stripped 
               and rotting.

               Dunbar looks queasy. The lieutenant glances at the medicine 
               man riding next to him. Kicking Bird looks sick too. Dunbar 
               looks away. The entire column is stretched along the killing 
               ground, looking.

               A naked cow, covered with birds, lies on her side. Her new 
               born calf, doomed to death, cries for his dead mother. And 
               next to the calf, Dunbar sees something else. He sees wagon 
               tracks and the booted footprints of white men.

               EXT. KILLING GROUND - DAY

               The column is clear of the killing ground and heading deeper 
               into the prairie. They have left everything untouched.

               EXT. TEMPORARY CAMP - DAY

               While Kicking Bird's lodge rises behind her, Stands With A 
               Fist digs out a firepit. She looks up from her work.

               Watching bashfully from several yards away is Lieutenant 
               Dunbar. Now that she has seen him he starts forward, perhaps 
               to try some more talk.

                                     KICKING BIRD (O.S.)
                         Loo ten tant...

               Dunbar turns to find Kicking Bird sitting on a pony just 
               behind him. Two dozen mounted BUFFALO SCOUTS are gathered 
               around him. Kicking Bird points at Cisco, indicating that 
               Dunbar should join them.

               Tipping his hat to Stands With A Fist, Dunbar hustles away 
               to his horse.

               Stands With A Fist faces the pit she's digging, not bothering 
               to look up as hoofbeats drum their way out of the temporary 
               camp. She seems to have lost herself in her own hands... the 
               hands that are digging out the soft prairie earth.

               There is crying but when Stands With A Fist looks up there 
               is just one of Kicking Bird's children standing there smiling 
               at her. She goes back to her digging.

               INT. HOLE - DAY (FLASHBACK)

               The first light streaks through the burrow entrance.

               Christine is exerting herself mightily in an effort to move. 
               But she can't and again she begins to cry.

               More sounds from down below in the canyon. Hoofbeats. And a 
               whinny or two. No way to tell whether this is friend or foe. 
               But she can't stay in the burrow.

                                     CHRISTINE
                         Help...

               She listens. The hoofbeats are gone.

                                     CHRISTINE
                              (louder)
                         Help me...
                              (screaming)
                         Please... I need to get out.

               Someone is coming up the slope.

               A moment later, hands are clawing at the walls of the burrow 
               and she is looking into three, surprised Sioux faces. The 
               face in the center is recognizable. A YOUNGER KICKING BIRD.

               EXT. BUFFALO DRAW - DUSK

               Two dozen riderless Indian ponies are tethered at the base 
               of the draw.

               EXT. BUFFALO DRAW - DUSK

               With Kicking Bird and the other buffalo scouts, Lieutenant 
               Dunbar is sneaking up one side of the draw. They all reach 
               the summit together and peer over.

               They are there by the thousands, grazing quietly in the 
               twilight. The buffalo.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - NIGHT

               The buffalo scouts, Dunbar included, are galloping back to 
               the temporary camp. It looms ahead of them, the hide-covered 
               lodges glowing like candles in the last light of day. A big 
               fire is blazing in the center of camp.

               Dunbar hangs back as the other riders go into the noisy camp. 
               A special event of some kind is taking place. As he looks 
               this scene over, Dunbar sees something remarkable.

               Back in the shadows, behind the fire, is a wagon.

               Dunbar and Cisco pace back and forth on the fringes of the 
               camp. The lieutenant searches for any sign of the white people 
               who came in the wagon, but finding none, he focuses on the 
               dancers moving in a circle around the big fire.

               One of the men waving his lance is Wind In His Hair. Dunbar's 
               eyes track up the lance and there he finds the white people. 
               Hanging from Wind In His Hair's lance tip is a fresh scalp, 
               blonde and wavy. Several of the other men have scalps too. 
               None of the hair is Indian.

               Dunbar can see into the wagonbed now. A couple of dozen fresh 
               buffalo hides are stacked in the wagonbed. It's all come 
               clear. The white men who killed the buffalo for hides and 
               tongues have themselves been killed.

               Dunbar slowly retreats into the shadows.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - NIGHT

               Cisco has been hobbled nearby, and with the temporary camp 
               glowing on the plains a half-mile away, Dunbar spreads his 
               blanket on the open plain.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAWN

               A huddled body lies covered by the army issue blanket. A 
               moccasined foot comes into view and prods the blanketed shape. 
               Lieutenant Dunbar's waking face pops out of the blanket.

               Standing over him is Wind In His Hair, stripped of all but 
               his breechclout. The barrel of his rifle is hanging downward, 
               swaying in front of the lieutenant's face.

               It is occurring to the lieutenant that his time may have run 
               out.

               The warrior swings his rifle into a shooting position, sights 
               after some imaginary game and imitates the rifle's recoil.

               He stares down at Dunbar with a smile, lifts his rifle 
               overhead and barks out a cry of victory.

               EXT. TEMPORARY CAMP - DAY

               The band's best hunters, two dozen of them, are making ready 
               to chase the buffalo. It's the big time, no event is more 
               important. The villagers -- mostly women, children, and 
               elderly -- have gathered around each of the hunters.

               The largest audience has gathered around Lieutenant Dunbar 
               and Wind In His Hair. Wind In His Hair's pony is ready. Great 
               bolts of yellow lightning adorn his shoulders and rump. Right 
               now the warrior is drawing the same design along Cisco's 
               rump.

               Dunbar reads this correctly as a great honor and stands by 
               silently. Wind In His Hair is finished. He looks at Dunbar 
               and nods at the paint as if asking for a response.

                                     DUNBAR
                         I wish I knew what to say.

               A Sioux voice, using english words, sails out of the circle 
               of watchers.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         Say... thank you.

               Startled the men turn to the sound. The other Sioux are 
               stunned too.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                              (indicating the paint)
                         His speed... his power... you have.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Thank you.

               He takes the warrior's hand in his own and shakes it crisply.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               It's the first time we've seen the buffalo up close. They're 
               fantastic creatures, powerful, brutish, untameable animals 
               from another age. A great bull turns away from the others 
               and lifts his purple, horned head to sniff the breeze. He 
               can detect no sign of trouble and eventually returns to his 
               browsing.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               The hunters are advancing across the prairie, spreading out 
               in a formation that will encircle part of the herd.

               The lightning bolts on Wind In His Hair's pony are in motion. 
               Cisco's bolts are moving too.

               There's a lump in Dunbar's throat. He knows nothing of what 
               is expected of him but he's doing it anyway. He glances to -- 
               his right at Wind In His Hair and to his left at Kicking 
               Bird. They're both concentrated on what lies ahead.

               From the corner of his eye, he sees Kicking Bird look back. 
               The lieutenant looks too.

               It's a minor flap. Three or four youngsters, eager to 
               distinguish themselves have trailed too close to the hunters 
               and are being turned back. Dunbar recognizes one of them as 
               the boy who took charge of Cisco at the village... Smiles A 
               Lot.

               Like Kicking Bird, Dunbar swings his face back to the front. 
               They're close enough now to hear the low bellowing of the 
               herd.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               A strike far up on the horned formation. Their ponies leap 
               forward. The mad dash is on.

               Dunbar's hat flies off at first spurt and now the lieutenant 
               and his horse are hurling over the prairie. The little 
               buckskin seems to know what is expected of him and has put 
               every ounce of his muscle to speed. They're burning up the 
               ground.

               When Dunbar looks back over his shoulder, he's shocked to 
               find that the best buffalo ponies the Sioux's have are far 
               behind. He and Cisco are on their own.

               The herd is in full flight and the sound of their stampede 
               is overwhelming. The buffalo are very fast but Cisco is 
               gaining with every stride. They've formed a great running 
               wall in front of him and now Dunbar can see their rumps and 
               tails and flying hooves.

               Dunbar takes a solid grip on his rifle and shuts his eyes as 
               if in prayer. The sound of thousands of hooves is deafening.

               Dunbar and Cisco have caught the buffalo. A few more strides 
               and they'll be in.

               Dunbar and Cisco are running with the buffalo. A shaggy head 
               moves in and swipes at Cisco, but the little horse is too 
               quick and too smart. He dodges away, nearly dumping the 
               lieutenant in the process.

               Dunbar rights himself and fires. It's a wild shot, only 
               grazing the buffalo's shoulder. The report of the gun 
               instantly scatters the herd and Dunbar pulls up, dust swirling 
               all around him.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               Sioux hunters stream past him, every man for himself zeroing 
               in on targets.

               Dunbar starts to dismount but something he sees stops him.

               A hundred yards away a small hunter is after a handful of 
               buffalo who have splintered off from the rest. It's Smiles A 
               Lot, trying to make a kill of his own. As Dunbar watches, 
               the boy's inexperienced horse shies away and bucks, pitching 
               the kid to the ground.

               A big bull breaks away from the splinter group, lowers his 
               head and charges.

               Dunbar kicks Cisco into a run, spits a spare bullet from his 
               mouth and rams it into the chamber.

               Smiles A Lot is picking himself off the ground. The bull is 
               in full charge.

               Dunbar is riding with his knees. Both hands are holding the 
               rifle. He'll never make it to the boy in time. He's got to 
               make the shot. He squeezes the trigger.

               The bullet plows home, exploding the bull's heart. The big 
               buffalo's legs collapse but the momentum of his charge puts 
               him into a skid. He comes to rest only a few yards away from 
               Smiles A Lot.

               The boy stands as the lieutenant rides up. Smiles A Lot is 
               dazed but he's okay.

               Dunbar hops off next to the dead buffalo. He's a huge one, a 
               real grandfather and the lieutenant loses himself for a few 
               moments in contemplation of this tremendous kill. Now he 
               looks back to check the boy.

               Smiles A Lot has caught his pony and is racing away from the 
               scene of his humiliation.

               The sounds of approaching riders turns Dunbar's attention in 
               a different direction.

               The entire village is streaming onto the plains for the 
               butchering.

               The riders bearing down on him are being lead by Wind In His 
               Hair.

               Wind In His Hair jumps off his pony and, smiling broadly, 
               slaps Dunbar's back with a good-natured blow of 
               congratulations.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               The buffalo has been split open and Wind In His Hair, kneeling 
               at the bull's side, is feeling around in the cavity. He finds 
               what he's looking for and gives it a jerk.

               It's the liver, still warm and steaming. He offers it to 
               Dunbar but the lieutenant, not having the faintest idea, 
               only looks at it blankly.

               A sizable crowd has gathered to watch this ritual.

               Wind In His Hair sticks the fresh liver in his mouth and 
               happily bites off a chunk, letting the juices run from the 
               edges of his mouth. Now he figures the lieutenant knows what 
               to do, and hands the liver back to him.

               Dunbar doesn't want to do this, but with the pressure of so 
               many eyes and so much good will, he has little choice. 
               Tentatively, he bites off a small piece and chews it 
               thoughtfully. It's good.

               Encouraged by this good taste, Dunbar takes a man-sized bite. 
               Shrill Sioux voices rise all around him as they cheer the 
               lieutenant. Dunbar holds the liver triumphantly over his 
               head.

               EXT. KILLING GROUND - DAY

               Little butchering parties cluster around each fallen buffalo.

               EXT. TEMPORARY CAMP - NIGHT

               Flame begins to lick at each of the bodies and we match 
               dissolve -- the clusters of people have become groups 
               surrounding fires at the temporary camp.

               EXT. FEASTING FIRE - NIGHT

               All over camp people are crowding around fires, feasting on 
               fresh meat. Children are playing everywhere, the dogs are 
               having a field day with scraps and the voices of the people 
               are happy.

               At a little distance, we see Lieutenant Dunbar and Wind In 
               His Hair excusing themselves from one of the fires. They 
               start toward us. Wind In His Hair is sucking on a rib bone 
               and seems to show no sign of slowing down his celebrating. 
               Dunbar, following a couple paces behind, is a different story. 
               He's had it. He spreads his hands to indicate an over-sized 
               belly.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Look I'm full... I can't tell the 
                         story again.

               Wind In His Hair doesn't seem to hear. He points at the 
               epaulettes on Dunbar's tunic.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Go ahead.

               Wind In His Hair reaches out and fingers the gold lieutenant's 
               bars. He fingers a couple of the brass buttons as well. The 
               tunic is something he obviously puts much store in.

                                     DUNBAR
                              (signing)
                         You want to try... put it on.

               He unbuttons the tunic.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Here.

               He sloughs off the tunic and hands it over. Wind In His Hair 
               slips out of the magnificent bone-pipe breastplate he's 
               wearing and gives it to Dunbar as he wriggles into the tunic. 
               The fit is too tight, the material too scratchy but those 
               things are of little consequence to Wind In His Hair. He 
               loves the tunic.

               With urging signs he asks the lieutenant to put on the 
               breastplate. Dunbar slips it over his head and Wind In His 
               Hair helps him with the ties.

               Now it's the lieutenant's turn to be amazed. The breastplate 
               as craftsmanship at its finest. He runs his fingers over the 
               ridges of bone now covering him from neck to waist. He looks 
               up at Wind In His Hair.

               The warrior nods approvingly, as though a good deal has heen 
               struck.

                                     DUNBAR
                         This is too much... I can't take 
                         this...

               But for Wind In His Hair it is already a trade.

               Wind In His Hair spots the next fireside and veers toward 
               it. Dunbar holds him back.

                                     DUNBAR
                         I can't... No more...

               Wind In His Hair grins. He holds up a single finger.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         One more... eat...

                                     DUNBAR
                         I can't, I'm full... very full...

               Still holding up the finger, he guides Dunbar into the 
               firelight of the next party.

               Immediately, men jump up to greet the celebrities. Women 
               begin to saw off more meat.

               EXT. FEASTING FIRE - NIGHT

               As Dunbar gnaws on a rib, he glances at the friendly faces 
               around the fire. His eyes suddenly stop their roving.

               A BIG WARRIOR is wearing the military hat he lost on the 
               hunt. It's a little too big. The brim touches the top of the 
               big warrior's ears.

               Now the Big Warrior notices that Dunbar is staring at him. 
               Their eyes meet.

                                     DUNBAR
                         That's my hat.

               At the sound of these words the cheerful talk around the 
               fire begins to fade.

               Dunbar touches the top of his head and points to his hat.

                                     DUNBAR
                         My hat.

                                     BIG WARRIOR
                         I found it on the prairie. It's mine.

               A silence falls between the two men. wind In His Hair speaks.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         That hat belongs to my friend here.

                                     BIG WARRIOR
                         He left it on the prairie. He didn't 
                         want it.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         You can see that he wants it now.

               The Big Warrior shakes his head. He won't budge.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         We all know that is a soldier hat. 
                         We all know who wears it. If you 
                         want to keep it that's alright. But 
                         give something for it.

               The other men around the fire murmur their assent. The Big 
               Warrior thinks for a moment then abruptly gets to his feet.

               He looks at his waist and unfastens a knife in a beautiful 
               worked scabbard. He tosses it across to Dunbar.

               The lieutenant examines the trade item a moment. Now he looks 
               back at the big warrior. A smile breaks slowly across his 
               face and Dunbar nods. At last he smiles back. It's a trade.

               And at that, the cheerful voices around the fire are at it 
               again.

               Dunbar takes his new knife out and as he watches the light 
               flicker off the blade a voice comes into his ear.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                              (pointing to his head)
                         Good trade.

               Dunbar looks into his smiling face. He laughs.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Yes, it's good. But, I have to sleep.

               He excuses himself and walks away from the light of the fire, 
               finds himself alone in the shadows, still marveling at his 
               breastplate.

               EXT. TEMPORARY CAMP - NIGHT

               Wind In His Hair finishes sucking on the rib bone and tosses 
               it to a dog that's been trailing him. Kicking Bird is walking 
               toward him. He notices the new tunic and gives wind In His 
               Hair a dubious look.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Where is loo ten tant?

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         I ate him.

               Kicking Bird reaches out and feels the strange material on 
               either side of Wind In His Hair's chest.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         I traded for it.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Does it scratch the skin?

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         A little. But do you see how good it 
                         looks. Everyone says it looks good. 
                         Everyone.

               EXT. TEMPORARY CAMP - NIGHT

               Dunbar keeps to the shadows as he makes his way through camp. 
               Now he slows his step.

               Light from another fire is spilling into his path. There's 
               music too. And singing. The voices are high and feminine.

               Dunbar peers around a lodge. A group of young women are 
               dancing in a clockwise circle. Their steps are light-hearted. 
               This is dancing purely for the fun of it.

               One of the young women spots him standing behind the lodge 
               and there's a wave of shy giggling as news of "loo ten tant's" 
               presence is passed along. Embarrassed, Dunbar starts along 
               the fringe of the fires, nodding politely to the women as he 
               goes.

               One has more courage than the others. She breaks out, takes 
               his hand and steers him gently into the dance circle. Whatever 
               resistance he might have is buried by the girl's insistent 
               encouragement. She keeps showing him the step and the 
               lieutenant tries to pick it up.

               The movement is simple and the music is mesmerizing. Awkward 
               at first, Dunbar quickly gets the hang of it. In short order, 
               he's keeping up with the others. And he's enjoying himself.

               Soon he has relaxed enough to shut his eyes, carried along 
               by the eternal sound of the drums. He doesn't notice that 
               the circle has begun to shrink. There is a touch of the devil 
               in their eyes.

               He bumps into somebody and the woman behind bumps into him. 
               But the girls just laugh and so does Dunbar. It was a pleasant 
               accident. But quickly there's another accident. And then all 
               their bodies are squeezing against his. The girls are 
               murmuring good things to him. Their hands are touching him 
               everywhere.

               It's okay with Dunbar. Everybody's having a good time. The 
               drumming suddenly stops however, and the women scatter away 
               from the fire, leaving Dunbar suddenly alone. Kicking Bird 
               is standing not far off.

                                     DUNBAR
                         They asked me to dance...

               The medicine man says nothing.

                                     DUNBAR
                         I was just dancing...

               The lieutenant does a step or two, trying to explain. Finally, 
               that strange half-smile appears on Kicking Bird's face.

               EXT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - NIGHT

               Stands With A Fist has been watching everything from the 
               tipi flap. Now she ducks back inside.

               INT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - NIGHT

               The fire is still burning in the center of the lodge. Dunbar 
               is sleeping soundly.

               It's not a moment later that we hear the soft sounds of 
               mumbling somewhere in the lodge. Then it's quiet. There's 
               that mumbling again. And now a woman's giggle.

               Dunbar stirs, waking and curious, sits up a little and looks 
               across the fire. There is movement on Kicking Bird's platform. 
               The medicine man's head and that of his wife come into view 
               for a second or two before they sink back down into shadow. 
               The movements and sound that follow become more forceful. 
               They're having sex.

               Embarrassed, the lieutenant averts his eyes, they happen 
               over the forms of Kicking Bird's deeply sleeping children, 
               the low-burning fire, and settle on Stands With A Fist's 
               back.

               Lieutenant Dunbar, the sounds of lovemaking floating over 
               him, peers again in that direction only to meet the smiling 
               eyes of Kicking Bird and his wife.

               Embarrassed again, he stares open-eyed at the ceiling. He 
               looks like a man who knows something is happening but doesn't 
               know what it is.

               Stands With A Fist's eyes are open too. She doesn't move.

               EXT. VILLAGE - DAWN

               The faintest seam of light is starting to glow on the eastern 
               horizon.

               EXT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - DAWN

               The camera pans off the tipi to the eastern horizon.

               It's the pony herd. And Dunbar is walking in that direction. 
               His feet leave a trail in the wet grass.

               First one, then two, then whole groups of ponies lift their 
               heads and prick their ears at Dunbar's approach.

               Dunbar walks to the edge of this great sea of horses, he 
               stops and gives a long whistle.

               A figure, previously unseen, sits up on the back of a pony. 
               It's Smiles A Lot. He and Dunbar glance blankly at each other. 
               But in a moment, both are distracted by movement in the herd.

               Horses are being gently eased out of the way by Cisco who is 
               answering Dunbar's call. A moment later and they are reunited 
               at the edge of the herd.

               Grasping a hunk of Cisco's mane, Dunbar starts to lead him 
               back to the village. The temporary camp is starting to come 
               to life. And with Cisco at his side, Dunbar pauses to take 
               in the scene.

               EXT. SEDGEWICK - DUSK

               An escort of six warriors is galloping up the bluff to join 
               the rest of the column as they make their way back to camp. 
               Dunbar looks on, a travois of meat next to him and gives a 
               last wave.

                                     DUNBAR (V.O.)
                         To stay any longer would've been 
                         useless. We had all the meat we could 
                         possibly carry. We had hunted for 
                         three days, losing half a dozen ponies 
                         and only three men injured. Many 
                         times I have felt alone but until 
                         this afternoon, I have never felt 
                         completely lonely.

               INT. QUARTERS - DAY

               The person we see from the waist up bears little resemblance 
               to the Lieutenant Dunbar we've known.

               His long hair hides his face on his slightly bent head. His 
               skin is not so white anymore, and the great bone-pipe 
               breastplate covers his torso.

               Dunbar starts to write and stops, he repeats this action. It 
               is clear that as Lieutenant Dunbar, he can find nothing to 
               say. He lays the pen down momentarily.

                                     DUNBAR (V.O.)
                         Made a long patrol today. There is 
                         nothing to report. The truth is I am 
                         bored.

               There is the scurry of movement and the scratch of tiny paws. 
               His eyes roam to the place in the corner where sacks of flour 
               and hard biscuits and other provisions are stored. Watching 
               the sacks more closely, he sees that they are infested with 
               mice.

               Restlessly, he walks to the doorway, gazing out onto the old 
               fort. The awning is beginning to tear at the corner. And 
               then he spots something.

               EXT. QUARTERS - DAY

               A large prairie chicken is lying in front of the quarters. 
               Dunbar squats next to it. It's neck carries punctures, and 
               when he dabs a finger on the wounds, he finds that the blood 
               is still wet. The lieutenant rises slowly, his sharp eyes 
               sweeping the fort.

               He's waiting patiently in his usual spot on the bluff 
               overlooking the river. Two Socks.

               Dunbar smiles and shakes his head. Watching his old friend, 
               he picks up the bird and begins to pluck with an ease that 
               suggests he's had some experience.

               EXT. QUARTERS - NIGHT

               Dunbar is gnawing happily at the last of the bird, still on 
               its skewer. After a couple of bites, he slips the carcass 
               off the stick and chucks it out to Two Socks. He licks his 
               fingers and gazes out into the night.

                                     DUNBAR (V.O.)
                         Though only two days it seems like a 
                         week. I am missing the company of my 
                         new friends. I can see all of their 
                         faces, but somehow it is not enough. 
                         Tomorrow, I will make an unannounced 
                         visit. After all, they are my 
                         neighbors, what can it hurt?

               EXT. BLUFF - NIGHT

               Two Socks has taken his dinner and retreated to the shadows. 
               He munches contentedly until a strange sound jolts him to 
               attention.

               At the fort is an odd sight. Dunbar is dancing around the 
               fire, occasionally singing out an energetic whoop.

               Two Socks is caught up in the scene and lets out a howl of 
               his own. It could be the stone age.

               EXT. BLUFF - NIGHT

               The silhouettes of three Indians are watching the strange 
               performance below. One of them is Wind In His Hair. Down 
               below Dunbar continues to dance.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               There is nothing for miles.

               Cisco and Dunbar are walking toward us. His boots are pretty 
               worn and his striped trousers have faded to almost nothing. 
               The breastplate shines in the sun. His rifle lies in the 
               crook of his arm, Indian style.

               Dunbar twists around on Cisco and looks back across the 
               prairie. He calls out.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Go home.

               Dunbar watches a moment to see if he's done any good, then 
               turns forward with a sour look.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Damn him.

               Dunbar makes his way through a small, grassy valley borders 
               by rolling slopes. He looks across the prairie. Two Socks is 
               about fifty yards out, trotting parallel to Cisco and Dunbar.

               Exasperated Dunbar pulls Cisco up and slides off. Two Socks 
               sits, waiting and watching.

               EXT. BLUFF - DAY

               Far down in the valley the figure of Lieutenant Dunbar is 
               striding through the grass. He looks angry. When he's within 
               a few feet of Two Socks, Dunbar waves his arms and stamps a 
               foot Two Socks scurries to one side but doesn't go far.

                                     DUNBAR
                         C'mon Two Socks... you can't go... 
                         so go home.

               Dunbar repeats his shooing motion and the wolf hops a few 
               feet.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Alright then, don't go home. But 
                         stay... stay right here.

               Dunbar turns away and as he does a long, low and mournful 
               howl swells behind him. He looks back. Two Socks muzzle is 
               high in the air and one eye is trained on Dunbar hoping for 
               a good reaction.

               Like an angry father who's had too much, Dunbar charges Two 
               Sock with a roar.

                                     DUNBAR
                         You go home.

               The wolf races away this time and Dunbar immediately runs 
               for Cisco, hoping to reach his horse and ditch Two Socks. 
               But he's running long before the wolf comes bouncing 
               alongside. Dunbar weaves out at him, startling Two Socks. He 
               sidles away but as he does the lieutenant reaches out and 
               gives the base of his tail a good hard squeeze.

               It might as well be a firecracker. Tow Socks gives a yelp 
               and shoots off with his tail tucked. Dunbar laughs out loud. 
               He watches until the wolf has gone a fair distance without 
               sign of slowing down.

               Then still chuckling to himself, he turns once again and 
               starts for Cisco at a trot. But moments later, something 
               grabs at one of his ankles, the lieutenant's legs tangle and 
               he goes down face first into the grass.

               Dunbar's lying on his belly. Not knowing what hit him, he 
               rolls onto his side for a closer look. There's Two Socks, 
               sitting in the grass a few feet back. Dunbar sits up cross-
               legged and smiles at his old friend.

               Two Socks catches something suddenly, perhaps from a shift 
               in the wind, and starts to slink away. Dunbar peers over the 
               grass up at the bluff. It's Stone Calf, Kicking Bird and 
               Wind In His Hair.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               The Indian entourage is riding slowly toward Lieutenant 
               Dunbar. Stone Calf is at Kicking Bird's side.

                                     STONE CALF
                         You were right about loo ten tant -- 
                         he is a special white man.

               Kicking Bird watches Dunbar as he replies.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Yes, he is special... he should have 
                         a real name.

               EXT. INDIAN VILLAGE - DAY

               Lieutenant Dunbar's arrival this day is different from the 
               ones which have gone before.

               Young mounted warriors have ridden out to swarm around him, 
               but they're full of good cheer reserved for a special friend. 
               There's much backslapping and a few of them lean in to shake 
               hands as they have seen him do.

               But some of the men have chosen to remain in front of their 
               lodges. Their expressionless faces anything but friendly. 
               None of this is lost on Wind In His Hair. He has the look of 
               a secret service man watching a president, as the parade 
               moves through the village.

               EXT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - DAY

               The escorts dismount and so does the lieutenant. Smiles A 
               Lot suddenly comes forward and grasps Cisco's reins. There's 
               a brief tug of war. But before it gets out of hand, Kicking 
               Bird is reassuring Dunbar with calm words and a smile, with 
               the lieutenant watching, the boy takes Cisco's muzzle between 
               his hands and blows breath into each nostril. He too gives 
               Dunbar a reassuring smile.

               In the next moment, the lieutenant finds himself being gently 
               pushed into Kicking Bird's lodge.

               As Kicking Bird is about to duck in behind him, a hand on 
               his arm stops him. It is Wind In His Hair and his tone is 
               strong with friendly advice.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         Not everyone thinks it is a good 
                         idea that he is here.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         I know.

               Wind In His Hair turns to the people that have gathered about.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         Kicking Bird has business with the 
                         white man. Let him do it.

               INT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - DAY

               Kicking Bird's pipe is a beautiful piece of work. It's being 
               smoked.

               Kicking Bird puffs away a few times and hands the pipe to 
               Dunbar. The lieutenant, aware that the pipe is something 
               special, handles it with care.

               He looks to Kicking Bird for guidance as he puts his mouth 
               to the tip. The medicine man reassures him with a wave of 
               the hand and Dunbar begins to puff.

               Dunbar coughs lightly at the harsh tobacco but he smokes 
               well, watching the bowl pulse with life at each puff.

               He stops now and lowers the pipe. He stares down. The pipe 
               seems almost alive as it lays in his hands.

               Dunbar hands the pipe back, and as Kicking Bird takes it he 
               hears the light tinkling of bells.

               Dunbar hears it too. As he looks toward the sound, a shadow 
               falls across the arbor's entrance.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         We were waiting for you.

               Stands With A Fist ducks through the arbor's entrance and 
               seats herself between Dunbar and Kicking Bird.

               Stands With A Fist is wearing a band of bells around one 
               ankle. She has a pair of simple but pretty moccasins on her 
               feet. Her dress is old but well-cared for. Animal teeth are 
               sewn along her bodice. On her wrist is a solid brass bracelet. 
               Her hair is tied back loosely with a bret, accenting the 
               feminine in her face.

               Her whiteness seems to show more than ever. But it is not 
               dominant. The Sioux is dominant.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                              (to Dunbar)
                         Welcome. It is good that you are 
                         here.

               Kicking Bird looks to Stands With A Fist. She takes her time 
               and the words are accented but they are close enough.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         Hullo. You here... good.

               The words are sweet music to the lieutenant. He replies with 
               a feeling of great relief.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Thank you... I feel good.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                              (to Kicking Bird)
                         He thanks you. It is good.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Ask him why he is at the soldier 
                         fort.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                              (to Dunbar)
                         Uhh... you... come...

               Dunbar jumps in. There are things he wants to know, has waited 
               a long time to know.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Wait... what is your name?

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         Our... names?

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         What does he say?

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         He wants to know how we are called.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Ahhh... He's right. I'm sorry.

               The medicine man nods agreeably. He smiles at Dunbar, quite 
               right, introductions should come first.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         He... he... Kick...

                                     DUNBAR
                         Kick?

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         More.

               She kicks at the ground with the toe of her moccasin. Dunbar 
               doesn't get it. She kicks a little harder.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Kicking?

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         Kicking... yes... Kicking... Bird.

                                     DUNBAR
                              (to Kicking Bird)
                         Kicking Bird...
                              (to Stands With A 
                              Fist)
                         What does he... is he a chief?

               Stands With A Fist has the word but it takes a few seconds 
               to make it come out of her mouth.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         Hul... hal... ho-lee... holy... holy 
                         man.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Oh...
                              (glancing at Kicking 
                              Bird)

               A brief silence. Kicking Bird seems ready to speak but Dunbar 
               is too quick.

                                     DUNBAR
                              (to Stands With A 
                              Fist)
                         Your name... you.

               She thinks. It's hard. She smiles thinly.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         I don't know.

               An idea comes to her. She stands up quickly.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Up? Get up?

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         No.

               She repeats the movement again.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Stand.

               Her smile is a little wider this time.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         Yes... Stands.

               Dunbar starts to speak but she cuts him off.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         More...
                              (thinking)
                         Wiff...
                              (quickly)
                         With.

               She draw something in the dirt. It's an "A".

                                     DUNBAR
                         Stands With A...

               Now she makes a fist and holds it close to Dunbar's face.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Fist?

               She nods.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Stands With A Fist. I'm John... John 
                         Dunbar.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         John Dunbar.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Yes.

               EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

               Kicking Bird and Dunbar are strolling through camp engaged 
               in a real conversation, Stands With A Fist is just behind 
               them.

                                     DUNBAR (V.O.)
                         I try to answer all of Kicking Bird's 
                         questions but I know he is frustrated 
                         with me. He always wants to know how 
                         many more white people are coming. I 
                         tell him that it is impossible for 
                         me to say. When he persists I tell 
                         him that the white people will most 
                         likely pass through this country and 
                         nothing more.

               Kicking Bird and Stands With A Fist are walking away from 
               Dunbar, who takes a few steps in the opposite direction before 
               pausing. Toward the end of the following speech he glances 
               back at them and Stands With A Fist glances back at him.

                                     DUNBAR (V.O.)
                         But I am speaking to him in half-
                         truths. One day there will be too 
                         many, but I cannot bring myself to 
                         tell him that. I am sure that Stands 
                         With A Fist knows.

               INT. DUNBAR'S LODGE - NIGHT

               His surroundings are completely Indian, Dunbar is cleaning 
               the big navy revolver.

                                     DUNBAR (V.O.)
                         A war party is going against the 
                         Pawnee soon and I have asked to go. 
                         I sensed that I have made a mistake 
                         in doing so but I could not bring 
                         myself to take it back. They are my 
                         friends and from what little I gather 
                         the Pawnee have been very hard on 
                         these people. I hope I have not 
                         overstepped my bounds.

               The lodge flap rustles and in comes Stands With A Fist and 
               Kicking Bird. Dunbar stands to greet them.

                                     DUNBAR
                         I'm glad to see you... please sit.

               Kicking Bird speaks and Stands With A Fist translates.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                              (translating)
                         Kicking Bird wants to know why you 
                         want to make war on the Pawnee. They 
                         have done nothing to you.

                                     DUNBAR
                         They are Sioux enemies.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                              (translating)
                         Only Sioux warriors will go.

                                     DUNBAR
                         I asked that he would think about my 
                         going.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         He has.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Then tell him this. I have been a 
                         warrior for longer than many of the 
                         young men that will go on this war 
                         party. Tell him.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                              (translating)
                         He says that the Sioux way of being 
                         a warrior is not the white way. You 
                         are not ready.

                                     DUNBAR
                         I know, I understand. But I cannot 
                         learn these ways in camp.

               She translates this to Kicking Bird. The medicine man 
               hesitates then speaks once more.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         He asks that you watch over his family 
                         while he is gone.

               Dunbar looks to Kicking Bird then to Stands With A Fist unable 
               to mask his disappointment.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                              (on her own)
                         This thing he asks you... it is a 
                         great honor for you.

               Dunbar thinks a moment longer and speaks directly to Kicking 
               Bird.

                                     DUNBAR
                         I will be happy to watch over your 
                         family.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                              (translating)
                         He thanks Dances With Wolves for 
                         coming.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Who is Dances With Wolves?

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         It is the name which everyone is 
                         calling you now.

               He thinks and remembers the night with Two Socks.

                                     DUNBAR
                         Dances With Wolves... that's right.
                              (to Stands With A 
                              Fist)
                         How do you say it?

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                              (in Sioux)
                         Dances With Wolves.

                                     DUNBAR
                              (in Sioux to Kicking 
                              Bird)
                         Dances With Wolves.

               The medicine man smiles.

               EXT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - DAWN

               Black Shawl is hurrying out of the lodge with her husband's 
               bow and arrows.

               A war party of twenty warriors is mounted and everyone except 
               sleeping children is out to say goodbye.

               Stands With A Fist is helping to load Kicking Bird's horse 
               with last minute preparations. Out of the tipi comes Kicking 
               Bird's eldest child. He is sleepy but almost on the verge of 
               tears as he knows what is happening.

               Kicking Bird picks up the boy. What is said is between father 
               and son. And it is just a look.

               He hands the child to Stands With A Fist, and pauses to speak 
               with his wife. She comes close to tears but there will be no 
               crying. None from Kicking Bird either. He steps back to his 
               horse.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                              (to Stands With A 
                              Fist)
                         Keep on with the white man talk if 
                         it pleases you.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         I like to make the white man talk.

               Dances With Wolves is standing alone in front of his lodge. 
               Wind In His Hair is riding past. He reaches down and shakes 
               Dances With Wolves' hand. The big warrior smiles.

               Dances With Wolves watches the warriors go by, but his eyes 
               begin to wander. He's looking for someone among the faces of 
               the women. Who ever it is, he can't find her.

               INT. ARBOR - DAY

               Dances With Wolves sits alone in the arbor. He's fidgety. 
               Now he hears a light tinkling of bells, the sounds he's been 
               waiting to hear.

               Her feet appear in the doorway.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST (O.S.)
                         Dances With Wolves?

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         I'm here.

               EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

               Dances with Wolves and Stands With A Fist are walking through 
               the village, talking and pointing things out to each other.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                              (slowly in english)
                         Grass grows on the prairie.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                              (not sure in Sioux)
                         Fire lives on the prairie.

               Stands With A Fist chuckles but politely checks herself.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         Wrong.

               She smiles and tries again.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                              (in english)
                         That man is a fighter.

               He really wants to get one right on the first try. His brows 
               come together as he concentrates.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         Again.

               He listens hard.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         That man is a fighter.

               Dances With Wolves thinks some more. When he speaks it is 
               with quiet confidence.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                              (in english)
                         Alright... I have it...
                              (in Sioux)
                         That man...

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         Yes...

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         Is...

               Dances With Wolves' eyes get big. He leans forward for 
               emphasis his whole face lit with the joy of having the right 
               answer.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         A... bone!

               Stands With A Fist doubles up and falls onto her side, 
               laughing all the way.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         A bone... right?

               Stands With A Fist doesn't really hear. She's rocking back 
               and forth on the floor of the arbor, laughing so hard that 
               her eyes are tearing.

               Her laughter subsides to an occasional chuckle but Dances 
               With Wolves is quiet. He gazes at her face.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         What is the word for beautiful?

               Stands With A Fist hesitates in her answer, meeting his gaze. 
               A little boy pokes his head in.

                                     LITTLE BOY
                         What are you doing here?

               The moment is broken. Stands With A Fist brings herself to 
               respond.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         It is hot. We are sitting in the 
                         shade.

               This makes so much sense to the little boy that he trots in 
               and flings himself on Stands With a Fist's lap. Then a squirm 
               or two.

                                     LITTLE BOY
                         I'm hungry.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         Alright.

               Stands With A Fist leads the little boy off to a lodge. Dances 
               With Wolves watches her walk away. From out of nowhere, Smiles 
               A Lot appears. He's been milling about the arbor 
               eavesdropping, and looks over to Dunbar with a teasing smile.

                                     SMILES A LOT
                         ...a bone.

               INT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - NIGHT

               Black Shawl is settling the youngest children in for bed, 
               Stands With A Fist is playing with the oldest of the children. 
               They're setting up a child's tipi.

                                     BLACK SHAWL
                         How is Dances With Wolves?

               Stands With A Fist stares straight ahead as if she were 
               wondering the same thing. Which she was.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         What do you mean?

                                     BLACK SHAWL
                         How is he learning?

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         He learns well... he is fast.

               Case closed, she goes back to playing and Black Shawl 
               continues putting the kids to bed.

               She looks again at Stands With A Fist wondering "what did 
               you think I meant?"

               EXT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - DAY

               Dunbar is sitting on Cisco. It's plain he's been waiting for 
               someone.

               Stands With A Fist pulls aside the lodge flap, she's lugging 
               a couple water bags.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         You go for water?

               His Sioux is perfect, and she smiles.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         Yes.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         Let us take you.

               EXT. RIVER TRAIL - DAY

               Cisco makes his way down the river trail, he shies at the 
               flurry of wings as a covey of quail fly up before them. Stands 
               With A Fist tightens her grip around Dances With Wolves waist.

               EXT. RIVER - DAY

               Stands With A Fist draws water into a set of bladder bags. 
               Dances With Wolves squats next to her, staring at the eddying 
               stream.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         How did you get your name?

               Stands With A Fist smiles to herself as she fills up the 
               last of the bags.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         I was not very old when I came to be 
                         with the people... I was made to 
                         work.

               She lugs the filled bags onto shore and sits next to Dances 
               With Wolves.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         I worked every day... very hard... 
                         there was a woman who didn't like 
                         me. She called me bad names... 
                         sometimes she beat me. One day she 
                         was calling me these bad names, her 
                         face in my face, and I hit her. I 
                         was not very big, but she fell down. 
                         She fell hard and didn't move. I 
                         stood over her with my fist and asked 
                         if any other woman wanted to call me 
                         bad names...
                              (laughing at the 
                              recollection)
                         No one bothered me after that day.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         I would not think so.

               A little silence.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         Show me where you hit her.

               He taps his jaw. She makes a fist and brushes very gently at 
               the point of his jaw. Dances With Wolves' eyes flutter. They 
               roll up in his head and he keels over backward... out cold.

               She goes with the joke. Bending over him she slaps lightly 
               at each side of his cheeks, until Dances With Wolves revives. 
               He sits up, rubbing his jaw.

               Neither one acknowledges the joke and, a sudden awkwardness 
               falls between them. Stands With A Fist fiddles shyly with 
               the ties on the water bags while Dances With Wolves draws 
               lines in the earth with a stick.

               Finally he works up the courage to ask a delicate question.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         Why are you not married?

               The question comes as a jolt to Stands With A Fist. She stops 
               her fiddling. A visible stiffness overtakes her. She quickly 
               stands up.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         I must go.

               Dances With Wolves doesn't know what to do. He only knows 
               that he should not have asked the question. She slings the 
               heavy bags over her shoulders and starts back up the path. 
               Dances With Wolves jumps to his feet.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         I'm sorry. Let me help...

               But the words are delivered to her back. She is already 
               hurrying up the path with her heavy load.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         No.

               Five ponies have wondered into the middle of the path. She 
               kicks violently at the nearest innocent bystander. The horses 
               shy out of the way.

               He's left alone at the waters edge, frustrated and confused. 
               He watches her go for a moment. Then he lets the stick drop 
               from his hand. He stares at it for a second then gives it a 
               vicious little kick.

               INT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - DAY

               Stands With A Fist is sitting in the middle of the lodge, 
               she starts when Black Shawl walks in.

                                     BLACK SHAWL
                         You are not talking today?

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         No, I'm not.

               Black Shawl gives her a deeper look, then lets it go.

               INT. ARBOR - DUSK

               The sun is setting and the village is settling in for the 
               evening.

               INT. DANCES WITH WOLVES' LODGE - NIGHT

               Lying on his bed, Dances With Wolves looks sleepy as he stares-
               across at the small fire. Even, in his drowsiness, it is 
               easy to see he's concentrating... in this case on a certain 
               someone.

               INT. ARBOR - DAY

               Again, Dances With Wolves is waiting. This time, not so 
               patiently. He gives up and leaves in search of something.

               EXT. INDIAN VILLAGE - DAY

               Dances With Wolves is wandering through the village, half-
               heartedly looking for Stands With A Fist. The day is very 
               hot and the village is quiet. Most of the people have gone 
               to shade.

               He sees Stone Calf sitting in the shade behind a lodge. A 
               newly made shield hangs from a tripod and he is painting a 
               design on it.

               EXT. STONE CALF'S LODGE - DAY

               Dances With Wolves sits in the shade with Stone Calf, watching 
               the older man paint.

                                     STONE CALF
                         Some of your words are wrong... but 
                         you are learning fast. That is good. 
                         What can I tell you today?

               Dances With Wolves is a little taken aback. The elder has 
               read his mind. He decides to speak it.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         I want to know about Stands With A 
                         Fist.

               For the first time, Stone Calf leaves his work. He gives his 
               visitor a quick and penetrating look. Then he goes back to 
               his shield.

                                     STONE CALF
                         What is your question?

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         There is no man with her.

               Stone Calf considers before he speaks. It is not something 
               he wants to get into.

                                     STONE CALF
                         She is in mourning.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         I do not understand "mourning".

                                     STONE CALF
                         She is crying for someone.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         Crying for who?

                                     STONE CALF
                         It is not polite to speak of the 
                         dead... But I will tell you... you 
                         are new. She cries for her husband. 
                         He was killed not long ago.

               The blood has gone out of Dances With Wolves' face. He tries 
               to digest this.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         How long will she cry?

                                     STONE CALF
                         It is Kicking Bird's place to say 
                         when she is finished.

               INT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - DAY

               Stands With A Fist kneels before Black Shawl, the older woman 
               is combing out the tangles in her hair. Black Shawl senses a 
               tension in the girl and gently tries to pry it out of her.

                                     BLACK SHAWL
                         People are talking about you...

               Stands With A Fist stiffens a bit.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         What are they saying?

                                     BLACK SHAWL
                         They are proud of the medicine you 
                         are making with Dances With Wolves.

               Stands With A Fist is quiet.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         I have hurt him and I must go talk 
                         to him.

                                     BLACK SHAWL
                         You can't, he is gone.

               Stands With A Fist bolts up, racing to the lodge flap -- she 
               pulls it aside and is stunned by the sight of Dances With 
               Wolves' abandoned lodge -- Cisco is nowhere to be seen.

               She turns away, tears coming to her eyes. Black Shawl is 
               beside her watching -- the girl's emotions have betrayed 
               her.

               Black Shawl takes the crying girl into her arms. A child 
               runs into the lodge but Black Shawl indicates "not now."

               The message is clearly understood, and the child digs in his 
               heels and heads the other way.

               EXT. FORT - DAY

               The breeze is up and the remaining shreds of canvas that 
               were once the awning are flying like tattered flags.

               Leading Cisco, Dances With Wolves walks into view. It will 
               be his last visit to his old home and he is taking his time.

               He watches the blowing canvas. The sound of it snapping is 
               all that can be heard.

               He steps over to the supply house. He starts to peer in, but 
               when he places a hand against the sod, part of the wall gives 
               way.

               INT. QUARTERS - PAY

               Part of the old bed has collapsed but some of it is still 
               strong enough for support and here Dances With Wolves is 
               sitting as he leafs through his beloved journal.

               He reads a little entry here and there, sometimes smiling at 
               the memory.

               A few blank pages remain at the back of the book. Reaching 
               these he closes the journal and holds it on his lap, letting 
               his mind run for a moment.

               Now he notices the old pen and ink. He picks them up and 
               opens the journal for one last entry.

               He writes: "I love Stands With A Fist" and signs himself 
               "Dances With Wolves."

               Something is moving outside and Dunbar stops, drawing his 
               gun out. He drops the book on the bed and carefully moves 
               outside.

               EXT. QUARTERS - DAY

               Lying in the sun a few feet away is Two Socks. He looks up 
               hopefully at Dances With Wolves. The two partners stare at 
               each other for a moment.

               Then Dances With Wolves reaches into a little day pouch at 
               his side and pulls out a strip of jerky. He squats close to 
               the ground and offers the meat to the wolf.

               Two Socks is up now. He takes several tentative steps. His 
               nose sniffs at the meat and he opens his mouth. Teeth and 
               fingers touch as the wolf takes the meat delicately.

               Now, in his customary style, he moves away, heading out onto 
               the prairie with his prize.

               Dances With Wolves watches a moment longer. Then he vaults 
               onto Cisco's back and they canter off in the direction of 
               the village.

               EXT. RIVERSIDE - DAY

               Stands With A Fist is wading through the water, her mind is 
               far away.

               In a moment there is a shift in the wind. The rustling of 
               the trees alerts her to a presence she had not thought to 
               feel before.

               Gradually, she raises her eyes to see the figure of a man 
               moving through the trees... Dances With Wolves.

               Stands With A Fist walks slowly out of the water. He opens 
               his arms and she melts into them, letting her head rest 
               against his chest.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         I am in mourning.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         I know... Stone Calf told me.

               She presses her body full against his, feeling all of him.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         No one can know... we must be careful.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         Yes.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         We must be careful.

               She climbs higher into his arms for a moment. Then, supporting 
               each other, the lovers move into the cover of the willow 
               breaks along the river.

               EXT. RIVER PATH - DAY

               The path leading to the river is deserted.

               Suddenly, a couple steps out of the cover of the willows 
               alongside the path. Stands With A Fist and Dances With Wolves 
               look up and down the path. They start for the village, holding 
               hands.

               As they near the top of the trail their hands part. A few 
               steps later and someone calls from the bushes startling Dances 
               with Wolves.

                                     SMILES A LOT
                         What are you doing?

               Smiles A Lot, Worm and Otter are sitting pathside. Worm is 
               holding a sack.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         Nothin'.

               Smiles A Lot looks to Stands With A Fist.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         Nothin'.

               Worm opens the sack. A large, wriggling snake lies in the 
               bottom.

                                     WORM
                         We got a snake.

                                     OTTER
                         We're gonna see if it can swim the 
                         river. You wanna come?

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         Okay.

               The two parties split up and everyone says goodbye to Stands 
               With A Fist. She makes her way up to the village.

               Dances With Wolves watches her go. Turning back to head down 
               to the river, he is greeted by the open hissing mouth of 
               Worm's snake.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         Don't do that!

               Worm and Otter laugh and race off down the path.

               Smiles A Lot and Dances With Wolves follow, Dances With Wolves 
               a little ahead. Something on his back, something curious, 
               has captured Smiles A Lot's attention.

               There's a strange coating of fuzz on Dances With Wolves' 
               back.

               Something occurs to Smiles A Lot. He stops and turns, his 
               eyes going up the trail.

               Stands With A Fist is walking toward the village, it's there 
               on her back too... cattail fuzz.

               Smiles A Lot laughs and runs to catch Dances With Wolves. 
               The boy slaps Dunbar with a knowing pat and a big grin.

               INT. DANCES WITH WOLVES' LODGE - NIGHT

               Dances with Wolves sits at his cozy fire, working on a pipe. 
               He follows a low rumble of thunder as it rolls overhead. 
               Thunder booms again and suddenly Stands With A Fist comes 
               through the lodge flap.

               Dances With Wolves comes to his feet. They stare across at 
               each other. Dances With Wolves walks slowly to her and they 
               embrace lightly. Stands With A Fist starts to slip out of 
               her dress.

               EXT. INDIAN VILLAGE - NIGHT

               Indian riders are coming into camp. There are three or four 
               of them. One man is slung over a pony's back. He's dead. All 
               of the others are wounded.

               INT. DANCES WITH WOLVES' LODGE - NIGHT

               Dances With Wolves and Stands With A Fist are having sex. 
               The sounds of their love-making are suddenly joined by more 
               insistent sounds from outside. Urgent yelling.

               The lovers freeze. Stands With A Fist props herself on an 
               elbow, listening.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         Trouble...

               EXT. INDIAN VILLAGE - NIGHT

               Dances With Wolves hurries through a light rain to the scene 
               of a commotion going on at Ten Bears' lodge. There's a real 
               sense of panic in the air by the time he reaches the fire 
               outside Ten Bears' lodge.

               It's a wild scene. Ten Bears is trying to huddle with his 
               advisors, the wounded men are trying to tend their injuries 
               and the rest of the warriors in camp are holding little skull 
               sessions amidst much shouting. Women are running to and fro, 
               rounding up their children.

               Dances With Wolves spots Stands With A Fist making her way 
               toward him. Her eyes are big with terror.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         Pawnee... a big party... thirty or 
                         forty men.
                              (indicating wounded)
                         The Kiowa hunters found them not far 
                         to the north. The Pawnee are coming 
                         his way. Soon they will find our 
                         camp.

               Stone Calf is just passing by. Dances With Wolves stops him.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         Stone Calf... I follow you.

               The older man doesn't mince words.

                                     STONE CALF
                         The Pawnee do not come for horses, 
                         they come for blood... and with many 
                         men gone, we are few.

               Dances With Wolves nods.

                                     STONE CALF
                         Get your weapons and come to my lodge.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                              (to Dances With Wolves)
                         I will go.

               She rushes off and Dances With Wolves falls into step behind 
               Stone Calf. He hasn't gone two steps before a revelation 
               hits him.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         Stone Calf... wait...

               The older warrior faces him.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         I have guns... many far-shooting 
                         guns.

               EXT. TEN BEARS' LODGE - NIGHT

               Amid the pandemonium of the village, Dances With Wolves and 
               Ten Bears are talking. Stone Calf stands at Ten Bears' side, 
               listening.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         No, the ride is long... the weather 
                         is bad. We can spare no men.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         Guns would make one warrior like 
                         two.

               The idea intrigues Ten Bears. As he thinks, he looks to Stone 
               Calf. But the elder warrior says nothing.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         Take one man and go quickly.

               Dances With Wolves turns away now, hoping to make a quick 
               choice. But in their excitement all the warriors are busy 
               running to and fro. Only one person is standing resolutely. 
               He is staring straight at Dances With Wolves. It is Smiles A 
               Lot, and from the look on his face it's easy to see that he 
               wants to be chosen.

               Dances With Wolves returns the boy's stare, trying to make 
               up his mind. He turns to Ten Bears.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         I will take Smiles A Lot.

               Ten Bears looks briefly at Smiles A Lot. He too can see 
               resolve in the boy's face. Now he looks once again at Dances 
               With Wolves. He nods.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - NIGHT

               Rain is pouring now. Thunder is still booming. A great fork 
               of lightning illuminates the ruins of the old fort. And 
               nearby, it reveals two riders out in the grass.

               Dances With Wolves and Smiles A Lot have brought a couple 
               extra horses with travois, but is is dark and in the rain 
               they've been reduced to looking for a needle in a haystack.

               Dances With Wolves' face is grim with frustration as it covers 
               the ground at Cisco's feet.

               Smiles A Lot and his pony are walking the soggy ground. Over 
               the tumult of the storm there is the faint but distinct sound 
               of a "snap".

               He's staring curiously at the ground beneath his pony's feet. 
               Smiles a Lot jumps off and, going on all fours, he paws over 
               the ground.

               His hand grasps something and he holds it up to his face. 
               It's a sliver of bone shattered at one end. Quickly he gropes 
               some more and finds the other half. Together they are a 
               buffalo rib.

                                     SMILES A LOT
                              (shouting over the 
                              storm)
                         Dances With Wolves... Dances With 
                         Wolves.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - NIGHT

               Frenzied hands claw away mud and sod. Something wooden is 
               uncovered; the lid of a rifle crate.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAWN

               The sky is still full of thunder and lightning but in the 
               breaking dawn the storm can be seen to be lifting.

               The village is just ahead down a long slope as the gun finders 
               come into view.

               A great bolt of lightning hits just as Dances With Wolves 
               starts down the slope. He sees something.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         Wait.

               Smiles A Lot stops. Dances With Wolves squints into the feeble 
               light. He can see the outline of the village below, but 
               upriver the light is still too murky to make anything out.

               Another bolt of lightning flashes. There they are. A long 
               line of horsemen crossing river a mile or so upstream from 
               the village. The Pawnee.

               EXT. INDIAN VILLAGE - DAWN

               In front of Ten Bears' lodge, Dances With Wolves is passing 
               out the last of the rifles. Warriors are grabbing handfuls 
               of bullets out of an open ammo box.

               Ten Bears is watching this procedure. And while he watches, 
               he thinks.

               The guns have been passed out and, except for a slight murmur 
               among the warriors, it's strangely quiet. The band's best 
               fighters are gone and many men don't know what to do next. 
               They're looking to Ten Bears for leadership.

               But the old man is looking at Dances With Wolves. He holds 
               up a hand for quiet.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         Hear us now.
                              (to Dances With Wolves)
                         A white soldier with many far-shooting 
                         guns... how would he fight the Pawnee?

               Everyone is waiting.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         I would hide in the village.

               The warriors send up a chorus of derisive cries but Ten Bears 
               angrily quiets them.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         Dances With Wolves has not finished.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         I would let the enemy think we are 
                         asleep... let him come close. Then 
                         we would shoot together and run to 
                         fight them, drive them into the river 
                         and kill so many that they would 
                         never trouble us again.

               Ten Bears smiles.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         I am of the same mind as Dances With 
                         Wolves... we should kill so many 
                         that they never trouble us again.

               EXT. RIVER - DAWN

               Two of the camp dogs are lapping water at the river's edge, 
               behind them lies the quiet village. Suddenly both heads jerk 
               up.

               INT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - DAWN

               Dances With Wolves steps into the lodge, followed by Smiles 
               A Lot. They both have rifles and Dances With Wolves' old 
               long-barreled revolver is holstered at his waist.

               Before him is a quiet, tense scene.

               The women are huddled together on a single sleeping platform. 
               Kicking Bird's three children nestled between them. Two of 
               the kids are crying softly.

               Black Shawl grips a hatchet and Stands With A Fist has a 
               rifle. They will both fight. But they are both scared. 
               Everyone in the village has a life at stake. In one glimpse, 
               Dances With Wolves understands what he will be fighting for.

               He looks once more at the women and children and ducks out 
               of the lodge.

               EXT. RIVER - DAWN

               The feet of the enemy are moving past the dogs, whose bodies 
               are still and riddled with arrows. In front of them the river 
               is full of Pawnee crossing over toward the village. There is 
               no sound.

               EXT. INDIAN VILLAGE - DAWN

               It has stopped raining but the ground is still soaked and an 
               early morning fog is swirling through the camp. Clumped in 
               groups of five or six, behind the lodges nearest the river, 
               are Sioux warriors with rifles. They're absolutely quiet as 
               they wait for the enemy.

               Dances With Wolves looks across a clearing that slopes down 
               to the breaks fronting the river. Nothing.

               Wait. A movement. And another. Another. The heads of men 
               lurking in the fog. He glances at the defenders.

               Most of the warriors are huddled behind the line of lodges 
               watching him. Ten Bears raises a hand.

               The Pawnee are visible now, a war party at its fiercest, 
               painted and feathered and armed to the teeth.

               Coming on foot, the first of them have reached the edge of 
               the clearing. They start into a stealthy trot, more and more 
               of them breaking into a run.

               A Pawnee war cry goes up and, as the others join in. Ten 
               Bears lowers his hand.

               EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAWN

               In ragged formation, the Sioux pour from behind the lodges 
               and thirty rifles fire into the vanguard of the Pawnee charge.

               The smoke of many rifles mixes with the ground fog as the 
               Sioux run screaming down on the Pawnee. Dances With Wolves 
               screams too as he runs flat out down the slope.

               A Pawnee warrior suddenly looms out of the smoke and they 
               crash together violently.

               The two fighters tumble over the ground, each grappling for 
               an advantage. The hand to hand fighting all around them is 
               furious and, shrouded in smoke and fog, it has a surreal 
               quality.

               Dances With Wolves works the Navy revolver from its holster 
               and shoots the Pawnee in the face.

               EXT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - DAWN

               A child sticks his head out from under the edge of the lodge. 
               Momentarily he is jerked back into the lodge out of sight.

               INT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - DAWN

               Now there's a ripping at the lodge entrance. The flap is 
               being torn away. Black Shawl is desperately pulling the child 
               back from the edge of the lodge.

               Suddenly, there he is... a Pawnee warrior. But now it's his 
               turn to be surprised. He sees Stands with A Fist taking aim, 
               and it's too late. She fires the rifle and the Pawnee explodes 
               back out of the lodge.

               EXT. VILLAGE - DAWN

               Through the smoke, Dances With Wolves can just catch a glimpse 
               of Ten Bears. He is moving through the village at a trot, 
               loading his gun.

               He spots a Sioux warrior grappling with a Pawnee, sights and 
               shoots the Pawnee point blank. He trots off, reloading once 
               more.

               EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAWN

               Dances With Wolves is bumped from behind and is knocked to 
               his knees. It's a frantic Pawnee war horse, loose on the 
               battlefield. Dances With Wolves grabs a hunk of mane and 
               swings onto his back.

               He has a real view now. The Pawnee are taking a terrible 
               licking. Already they are being beaten back to the river.

               A turbaned enemy is falling back to the river, firing arrows 
               as he goes. Dances With Wolves goes after him.

               EXT. TEN BEARS' LODGE - DAWN

               Still clutching his hatchet, a wounded Pawnee half staggers 
               toward Ten Bears' lodge. He is bleeding profusely and in a 
               very bad mood. He reaches the closed lodge flap.

               INT. TEN BEARS' LODGE - DAWN

               Pretty Shield stands in front of a group of children, ready 
               to defend them.

               The Pawnee is inside now. He has a wild desperate look and 
               in a moment his hatchet will be flailing its way through 
               these people.

               But he never takes a step. Instead he suddenly sinks to his 
               knees and we see another arrow join the one that is already 
               buried in his back. The warrior keels over and Pretty Shield 
               looks through the open flap to see the grinning face of Stone 
               Calf.

               Without hesitation, Pretty Shield snatches a half-burned log 
               from the fire and finishes the Pawnee.

               The children watch, their faces a mixture of horror and 
               intrigue.

               EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAWN

               Coming off the pony like a rodeo bulldogger, Dances With 
               Wolves crashes through the river taking the Pawnee in a 
               headlock.

               Somehow they both keep their feet and hurtle down the hill 
               at a weird run. A small cottonwood stops their momentum, the 
               Pawnee taking most of the blow.

               Dances With Wolves grabs either side of the man's head and 
               starts banging his skull against the tree trunk. Shortly, he 
               notices that the man's eyes are dead.

               The Pawnee was impaled on impact by the stub of a broken 
               branch low on the trunk.

               Dances With Wolves shrinks back from this gruesome sight and 
               staggers toward the village.

               EXT. VILLAGE - DAWN

               Stone Calf, his bow and arrow at the ready, is looking for 
               more enemies to kill.

               Suddenly from the corner of his eye the old man senses an 
               attack. But he is too late. A Pawnee war club crushes his 
               skull and the old man collapses.

               Now we can see his attacker. It is the fierce Pawnee warrior 
               who killed Timmons the wagon driver. He glowers down at the 
               body of Stone Calf and swings his club toward the old man's 
               head once again.

               EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAWN

               Dances With Wolves squints toward the village just in time 
               to see the Toughest take another shot at the prostrate, white-
               headed form of Stone Calf.

               Dances With Wolves begins to run.

               EXT. VILLAGE - DAWN

               The Toughest has his knife to Stone Calf's forehead and is 
               preparing to scalp his victim when something strikes him in 
               the lower leg.

               He looks down to find a small arrow imbedded in his calf. He 
               looks up to see three boys, Otter, Worm, and Smiles A Lot, 
               huddled at the edge of the battlefield.

               He turns back to finish the job when another arrow hits him. 
               Enraged he breaks off the arrow, leaps onto a horse and 
               charges the kids.

               Their faces go ashen as the Toughest bears down on them.

               Otter's arrow flies weakly into the air. The boys turn and 
               run for their lives.

               The Toughest would catch them with ease but now, he sees 
               half a dozen howling Sioux warriors angling in to cut him 
               off. He knows in a glance that the fight has been lost. He 
               also knows that he can still escape if he changes direction. 
               He veers for the river.

               The Sioux are distraught. The Toughest will get away.

               But wait, Dances with Wolves is at full speed now. He is 
               streaking across the battlefield.

               Suddenly, the Pawnee himself is hurtling through space, driven 
               there by the full force impact of Dances With Wolves' shoulder 
               which has caught him rib high.

               Both men hit the ground grappling and rolling.

               A knife flashes in the Toughest's hand and Dances With Wolves 
               can only react quick enough to keep the knife from a vital 
               spot. As it is, the blade lays open a huge gash on his arm.

               They square off. The Toughest knows the advantage is his. He 
               smiles grimly at Dances With Wolves and grunts sadistically.

               But the sound from his throat is cut short by the simultaneous 
               arrival of five Sioux arrows. Before the Pawnee can fall, 
               six Sioux warriors are on him tearing him to pieces.

               EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY

               Dances With Wolves climbs to his feet and discovers that the 
               battlefield is no longer so. The fighting has stopped.

               It's a scene of carnage and joy. The Pawnee attackers lay 
               where they fell.

                                     SIOUX 1
                         I killed this one.

                                     SIOUX 2
                         This one still breathes.

               The Sioux victors are in high spirits as they hop around 
               finishing off the wounded and counting coup on the dead.

               Dances With Wolves looks down at himself. His body is streaked 
               with blood, much of it his own. His arm is bleeding freely 
               but he is too repulsed to move forward and too exhausted to 
               retreat into the breaks.

               Dances With Wolves now looks up to see the lifeless body of 
               Stone Calf. Ten Bears is hugging him. Pretty Shield starts 
               to kneel beside her mourning husband.

                                     SIOUX 3 (O.S.)
                         Dances With Wolves...

               Before he knows it, Sioux fighters are moving all around 
               him, chanting his name. Like ants rolling a pebble up a hill, 
               they push him into the middle of the battlefield. In a daze 
               he allows himself to be carried along.

               When he looks up again he can see women and children emerging 
               from the lodges.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES (V.O.)
                         It was hard to know how to feel. I 
                         had never been in a battle like this 
                         one. This had not been a fight for 
                         territory or riches or to make men 
                         free. This battle had no ego. It had 
                         been fought to preserve the food 
                         stores that would see us through 
                         winter, to protect the lives of women 
                         and children and loved ones only a 
                         few feet away. I felt a pride I had 
                         never felt before.

               Dances With Wolves looks down and recognizes the face of a 
               man he has just killed. Several warriors are crowding around 
               him now. Dances With Wolves points at the body.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         I shot this one.

                                     1ST WARRIOR
                         Yes, I saw you shoot him.

                                     2ND WARRIOR
                         You killed that one too.

               As the sun breaks fully through the clouds, the little knot 
               of warriors, Dances With Wolves in their midst, continues 
               its triumphant tour of the battleground. The men are hugging 
               and slapping each other on the back.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES (V.O.)
                         I had never really known who John 
                         Dunbar was. Perhaps because the name 
                         itself had no meaning. But as I heard 
                         my Sioux name being called over and 
                         over, I knew for the first time who 
                         I really was.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               The war party with Kicking Bird and Wind In His Hair at its 
               head has halted in the middle of nowhere. The Sioux riders 
               are coming toward them at a run. They pull up, excited with 
               what they have to tell.

               The returning war party and the two riders who met them start 
               ahead at a gallop.

               INT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - NIGHT

               Black Shawl and Stands With A Fist are clearing things away. 
               The medicine man has hosted a dinner party which is now 
               winding down.

               Wind In His Hair is there, Dances With Wolves and several 
               other prominent warriors. It's purely social and all the men 
               are enjoying themselves.

               Dances With Wolves sneaks a look of affection at Stands With 
               A Fist, and she returns it.

               Then, with more theatricality than is really necessary, he 
               stretches his arms and yawns. Wind In His Hair looks at his 
               friend with surprise.

               Dances With Wolves gets to his feet.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         There is gambling tonight... at Horse 
                         Back's lodge. Horse Back's games are 
                         always good.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         I am tired... and Horse Back already 
                         has a good rifle of mine.
                              (to Kicking Bird)
                         thank you...
                              (to all)
                         goodnight.

               He slips out. In a few seconds, the men have pick up another 
               topic to jawbone.

               They pay no attention to Stands With A Fist's momentary exit, 
               But Black Shawl does, it doesn't bother her, but she notices.

               INT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - NIGHT

               The medicine man's wife is already in bed as he slips under 
               the covers with a grunt.

                                     BLACK SHAWL
                         How long will Stands With A Fist 
                         mourn?

               Kicking Bird gives his wife an odd look.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         I don't know.

                                     BLACK SHAWL
                         I hope it will not be too long.

               Kicking Bird rises on his elbows.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Something has happened? Well what?

                                     BLACK SHAWL
                         She has found love again.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         With who?

                                     BLACK SHAWL
                         Dances With Wolves.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Are you certain of this?

                                     BLACK SHAWL
                         When you see them together you will 
                         know.

               Kicking Bird stares wearily across the floor.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         What are people saying? They're not 
                         angry?

                                     BLACK SHAWL
                         No. They like the match. It makes 
                         sense. They are both white.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         I suppose I will be the one to say 
                         something.

               A brief silence.

                                     BLACK SHAWL
                         She's your daughter now.

               Kicking Bird glances up frustrated with himself.

                                     BLACK SHAWL
                         You can't see everything coming.

               EXT. INDIAN VILLAGE - DAY

               Stands With A Fist is walking through the village with Kicking 
               Bird's youngest child. They're both carrying armloads of 
               firewood.

               Here comes Kicking Bird. He's out of breath.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Stands With A Fist.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         Yes.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         You are no longer a widow.

               Kicking Bird turns abruptly and stalks off, leaving Stands 
               With A Fist to ponder the meaning of his curt announcement. 
               A smile gradually works onto her face.

               INT. DANCES WITH WOLVES' LODGE - DAY

               Dances With Wolves sits waiting as a voice comes to him from 
               the outside.

               Wind In His Hair's face pokes through the entrance. He steps 
               inside, followed by Smiles A Lot.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         There's talk that you want to get 
                         married.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         To who?

               Wind In His Hair and Smiles A Lot share a smile.

                                     SMILES A LOT
                         To Stands With A Fist.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         That's the one isn't it?

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         She's in mourning.

                                     SMILES A LOT
                         Not today.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         She has been released. Kicking Bird 
                         did it.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         He did?

               Wind In His Hair isn't really listening. He glances around 
               the lodge curiously.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         What are you doing?

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         Kicking Bird told me to wait.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         You might be waiting a long time. 
                         Smiles A Lot says he saw Kicking 
                         Bird riding on the prairie...

               Smiles A Lot whispers in the warrior's ear.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         He says he was talking to himself. 
                         When a medicine man is the last to 
                         know he can take it pretty hard.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         What do I do?

               Wind In His Hair looks around at the sparse furnishing.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         You are pretty poor my friend and a 
                         Sioux girl is not for free. I don't 
                         know if you can get married.

               A long silence. Dances With Wolves looks around his lodge. 
               Wind In His Hair is right. He really has nothing.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         I have the buckskin...

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         That's too much medicine.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                              (to Smiles A Lot)
                         Do you think the buckskin is too 
                         much medicine?

               Smiles A Lot is on the hot seat. He looks to Wind In His 
               Hair, but no luck -- he's on his own.

                                     SMILES A LOT
                         For a girl.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         Maybe we can help you... wait here 
                         for us.

               Wind In His Hair and Smiles A Lot leave.

               EXT. DANCES WITH WOLVES' LODGE - DAY

               Wind In His Hair and Smiles A Lot are greeted by seven 
               chuckling warriors. They've been listening to the exchange 
               and move off with the two "helpers".

               EXT. DANCES WITH WOLVES' LODGE - DAY

               Dances With Wolves is inspecting several new ponies which 
               are tied outside his tipi. Now he notices an old couple 
               approaching.

               The old couple leaves a gift along with others that have 
               already been brought. The old folks are shy and so is Dances 
               With Wolves. They glance at one another and smile but do not 
               speak.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES (V.O.)
                         I thought we had been discreet but 
                         apparently we fooled no one.

               EXT. VILLAGE - DUSK

               Dances With Wolves ties the last of the ponies in front of 
               Kicking Bird's lodge and starts back toward his own home.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES (V.O.)
                         Wind In His Hair said if the match 
                         was acccepted the ponies would be 
                         gone in the morning.

               Dances With Wolves looks over his shoulder at the standing 
               ponies then he continues on.

               INT. DANCES WITH WOLVES' LODGE - NIGHT

               Dances With Wolves tosses and turns in his bed. He slips out 
               of the covers and ducks his head through the lodge flap, 
               checking again on the ponies.

               EXT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - DAY

               The ponies are gone.

               INT. DANCES WITH WOLVES' LODGE - DAY

               Dances With Wolves' hair is shiny. His breastplate gleams, 
               the officer's pants have been dusted and his old boots have 
               something resembling a shine. The groom is ready.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         Turn around...

               Dances With Wolves does a three-sixty.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         Pretty good...

               A brief silence as Wind In His Hair contemplates something 
               he wants to say.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         You know, the man she mourned for 
                         was my best friend.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         I didn't know that.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         He was a good man. It's been hard 
                         for me. I am not the thinker Kicking 
                         Bird is. But I think he went away 
                         from her because you were coming. 
                         That is how I see it now.

               The sound of music and people outside distracts both men.

               EXT. DANCES WITH WOLVES' LODGE - DAY

               Kicking Bird is leading the wedding party. Stands With A 
               Fist by his side. She glows with the special beauty of a 
               bride.

               Many people are standing about quietly, more like simple 
               observers than participants. The whole village is as peaceful 
               as we will ever see it.

               Kicking Bird steps forward, his wife and Stands With A Fist 
               following in his footsteps.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         This is a good day for me.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         And for me.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Stands With A Fist... if you want 
                         this man, take his hand in yours.

               Shyly, she holds out a slender, graceful hand. Dances with 
               Wolves meets it with one of his own.

               The medicine man looks Dances With Wolves in the eyes for 
               several seconds.

               Dances With Wolves also begins to speak... internally. At 
               first the volume of his voice and that of the medicine man 
               are nearly equal, but Kicking Bird's voice quickly begins to 
               fade.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES (V.O.)
                         I had never been married before. I 
                         don't know if all grooms have the 
                         same experience. But as Kicking Bird 
                         began to speak about what was expected 
                         of a Sioux husband, my mind began to 
                         swim in a way that shut out everything 
                         but her. The tiny details of her 
                         costume. The contours of her shape. 
                         The light in her eyes. The smallness 
                         of her feet. I knew that the love 
                         between us would be served.

               The medicine man's voice cuts back in. He's had to say it 
               twice.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Have you heard all that I have said?

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         Yes.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Good, then take her inside... she is 
                         your wife.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         Oh... good... thank you... goodbye...

               The newlyweds disappear into their new home. The flap is 
               dropped and there it stays. The light begins to change, 
               growing darker, the wind comes up, blowing leaves against 
               the door. In the distance there is thunder.

               EXT. INDIAN VILLAGE - DAY

               The lodge flap is still closed. But now it is covered in 
               sunshine.

               Smiles A Lot, Worm and Otter are just across the way, bundled 
               now against the chill of oncoming winter. They're watching 
               too. Smiles A Lot is standing next to Worm, -- Otter is on 
               his haunches. Both are gnawing at a breakfast of dried meat 
               as they talk nonchalantly.

                                     WORM
                         Dances With Wolves' door is closed 
                         alot these days.

                                     SMILES A LOT
                         They're trying to make a baby.

               The two older boys look down at Otter.

                                     OTTER
                         I know that.

                                     SMILES A LOT
                         You would think they could have made 
                         a baby by now.

                                     WORM
                         Maybe they're having a hard time. 
                         Some people have a hard time.

                                     SMILES A LOT
                         I don't think they're having a hard 
                         time.

                                     OTTER
                         Me neither.

               A silence as the boys watch smoke curl out of the lodge. 
               Worm laughs to himself.

                                     OTTER
                         Maybe we should pull the smoke flap 
                         closed. Then they would come out.

               The boys look at each other for the first time, their eyes 
               brightening. What a great idea!

               The two boys are stalking toward Dances With Wolves' lodge 
               when they see something that makes them peel off in another 
               direction.

               It's Kicking Bird, coming to call.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Dances With Wolves, are you in there?

               In a moment the lodge flap opens and Dances With Wolves steps 
               outside. He's fully dressed but a little disheveled.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         I am riding today to a far away place. 
                         It is a place I haven't seen for a 
                         long time. A sacred place. I would 
                         like you to come with me.

               Dances With Wolves ponders this.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               Kicking Bird and Dances With Wolves are cantering side by 
               side across the open prairie.

               They pull their horses to a walk and Kicking Bird glances 
               Dances With Wolves' direction.

               Dances With Wolves' glances back and smiles.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         It's good to be out.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Yes it must be.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         We are trying for a baby.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         No waiting?

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         No waiting.

               The medicine man keeps looking at his protege. There is 
               virtually no semblance of Lieutenant Dunbar left.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         I was just thinking that of all the 
                         trails in this life, there is one 
                         that matters more than all the others. 
                         It is the trail of a true human being. 
                         I think you are on this trail and it 
                         is good to see.

               Dances With Wolves doesn't reply, but he is blushing a little.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               Dances With Wolves and Kicking Bird gallop their horses to 
               the crest of a steep hill and rein to a halt.

               Down below, miles distant, is the curving line of a river. 
               But there is a section of river, directly before them, that 
               cannot be seen. It is screened by a mammoth stand of trees, 
               some of them towering a hundred feet or more.

               He glances at Dances With Wolves but his companion doesn't 
               see. He's staring in wonder at the great forest before him.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         It is said that all the animals were 
                         born here... that from here they 
                         spread over the prairies to feed all 
                         the people. Even our enemies say 
                         this is a sacred place.

               They start toward the river at a walk.

               EXT. BROKEN FOREST - DAY

               The two riders come out of the sunlight and onto a shaded 
               path leading into the forest. They've only gone a few yards 
               when Kicking Bird pulls to a stop. The men sit on their horses 
               in complete silence. Dances With Wolves is still fully 
               entranced.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         It's quiet.

               But Kicking Bird does not acknowledge his companion's words. 
               He seems to be concentrating on the quiet. The quiet is wrong 
               and Kicking Bird knows it. He moves forward slowly.

               Following behind Kicking Bird, Dances With Wolves' attention 
               is focused on the tree tops above him. A curious buzzing 
               sound has started up and is growing louder by the moment. 
               Perhaps there are bees swarming in the branches overhead.

               Now he is distracted by Cisco coming to a stop. Kicking Bird 
               too has stopped. Just ahead the forest opens into an 
               incredible cathedral-like expanse. Sunlight streams down 
               onto the floor in beautiful pools.

               But still there is a deathly quiet and Dances With Wolves 
               can see now that this remarkable place has been horribly 
               desecrated.

               Trees have been felled everywhere, most of them left to rot 
               for no explicable reason.

               At the same time he sees this destruction Dances With Wolves 
               realizes that the strange buzzing sound is not coming from 
               overhead but from the forest floor.

               The insects are not bees. They are flies and they are swarming 
               over dozens of carcasses strewn over the ground. Badgers, 
               skunks, squirrels and other small animals, nearly all of 
               them killed merely for target practice.

               The men and their ponies move on. Deer carcasses are 
               everywhere, many of them horribly mutilated. A choice flank 
               portion is cut away here and there, while ninety-five percent 
               of the bodies have been left to rot.

               Heads and legs have been chopped off. Dances With Wolves 
               passes by a spot where several deer heads have been placed 
               nose to nose as if the heads were having a conversation. 
               Someone's perverted idea of humor.

               The men ride through the carnage in a sad daze.

               Now they reach the center of the cathedral and here they 
               find a few crude leantos, hewn from freshly cut wood. The 
               people who stayed here had bigger plans for all the felled 
               wood, but lost ambition and settled for these ugly hovels.

               A great pile of wild turkeys, perhaps twenty birds in all, 
               sit to one side. They haven't even been plucked. Just shot 
               and left to rot.

               Dances With Wolves notices half a dozen liquor bottles in a 
               heap of trash.

               He cannot bring himself to look at Kicking Bird. Any man 
               would be repulsed at these sights, but in Dances With Wolves' 
               case there is a feeling of shame as well.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         We must wait for these people...

               Kicking Bird says nothing for a long time.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         No, they've been gone a week maybe 
                         more... we will water the horses and 
                         go home.

               He turns his pony away.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               Kicking Bird and Dances With Wolves are alone on a great sea 
               of prairie.

               There's a little fire going. A sage hen is being roasted, 
               but for some time we hear nothing but the light crackle of 
               the fire. Each man is preoccupied with his own thoughts, 
               thoughts of the broken forest.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         You have asked me many times about 
                         the white people... you always ask 
                         how many more are coming.

               Dances With Wolves looks at his friend and mentor.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         There will be a lot my friend... 
                         more than can be counted.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Help me to know how many.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         Like the stars.

               This is what Kicking Bird wanted to know. And it hits him 
               like a rock.

               Kicking Bird bows his head in thought while Dances With Wolves 
               raises his. He never wanted to say this, he wishes it wasn't 
               true.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         It makes me afraid for all the Sioux.

               INT. TEN BEARS' LODGE - DAY

               The old man puffs away at his trusty pipe. Now he lays it 
               down. Kicking Bird and Dances With Wolves are waiting 
               patiently.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         It's hard to know what to do.

               The old man gets up, walks to his bedside, reaches up into 
               the sacred rigging above an takes down a melon-sized rawhide 
               bundle. He brings this back to the fire and unwraps it slowly. 
               Inside is a rusted hunk of metal, the helmet of a Spanish 
               conquistador.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         The men who wore this came in the 
                         time of my grandfather's grandfather. 
                         Eventually, we drove them out. Then 
                         the Mexicans came. In my own time 
                         the whites came... the Texans. They 
                         have been like all the others who 
                         find something they want in our 
                         country. They take it without asking. 
                         I have always been a peaceful man, 
                         happy to be in my own country and 
                         wanting nothing from the white people. 
                         Nothing at all. But I think you are 
                         right. I think they will keep coming. 
                         When I think of that, I look at this 
                         bundle. Our country is all that we 
                         want. We will fight to keep it.

               He picks up his pipe and puffs deeply.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         Tomorrow morning we will strike the 
                         village and go to the winter camp.

               EXT. INDIAN VILLAGE - DAY

               The whole camp is being struck. There is activity everywhere.

               INT. DANCES WITH WOLVES' LODGE - DAY

               Stands With A Fist is packing and so is Dances With Wolves. 
               He is putting away the shield that Stone Calf once worked 
               on. She pauses to stroke her husband's leg tenderly.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         You have everything from the soldier 
                         fort?

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         No, there is nothing for me there.

               Stands with A Fist laughs as she starts out of the lodge.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         That's good.

               But as he tightens the leather thongs on the shield case, 
               Dances With Wolves' face begins to cloud.

               EXT. DANCES WITH WOLVES' LODGE - DAY

               Dances With Wolves bolts out of the lodge and snatches up 
               Cisco's reins. He calls urgently to Stands with A Fist.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         Stands With A Fist... wait...

               EXT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - DAY

               The village is about ready to move, just a few last minute 
               flurries of activity.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         The words in the book are like a 
                         trail for people to follow. It tells 
                         everything about my life here. I 
                         must get it.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         We cannot wait for you.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         I will catch up.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               Dances With Wolves and Cisco are cantering quickly over the 
               open prairie.

               EXT. SEDGEWICK - DAY

               Old Fort Sedgewick is just beyond the next rise. Dances With 
               Wolves eases Cisco into a full run.

               They fly so quickly over the rise that Dances With Wolves 
               has no time to react.

               There must be forty or fifty of them; talking, walking, 
               working and playing. Old Fort Sedgewick is crawling with 
               them. Blue-coated soldiers.

               Just in front of him is a deep-bedded wagon carrying a cargo 
               of SOLDIERS. They've been out cutting wood. But now the men 
               in the wagon are scrambling for their rifles and screaming 
               out the alarm... "Indians!"

               Dances With Wolves puts everything he has into pulling Cisco 
               up.

               The soldiers in the wagon, a collection of pimply-faced teen-
               agers and middle-aged rabble, are aiming their rifles. Cisco 
               rears high in the air as the volley is fired from the wagon.

               Dances With Wolves is pitched off to one side, landing hard 
               on the ground. When he gets his senses back the first thing 
               he sees is Cisco. The buckskin is lying very still.

               Oblivious to the shouts of the soldiers racing toward him, 
               Dances With Wolves runs crab-like to his horse's side.

               Cisco's been shot several times, one bullet taking him in 
               the heart. He's dead.

               Dances With Wolves whirls to face the soldiers.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         You killed him...

               That's the last thing he says. A rifle stock slams into the 
               side of his face and as soldiers swarm over him, everything 
               goes black.

               EXT. COLUMN - DAY

               Ten Bears village is on the trail. Kicking Bird is riding 
               down the line. He notices Stands With A Fist. She is terribly 
               distraught.

               Kicking Bird glances at the sun. The day is more than half-
               over. He kicks his pony back up the line next to Wind In His 
               Hair.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Something has happened... Dances 
                         With Wolves is not coming.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         He must have trouble.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         Pick two good men with fast ponies 
                         and send them back to the soldier 
                         fort.

               INT. SUPPLY HOUSE - DAY

               Dances With Wolves lies unconscious on the floor of the ruined 
               supply house. One side of his face is grotesquely swollen 
               from the blow he took. Blood still seeps from a long split 
               of the skin along his cheek.

               He groans. Voice are playing about his ears, the voices of 
               white men. He opens his eyes.

               A bearish, bearded SERGEANT BAUER, is squatting directly in 
               front of him. Behind the sergeant, peering over the crumbled 
               walls like visitors at a zoo, are a crowd of ordinary 
               soldiers.

                                     BAUER
                         Spivey...

               A pitiful looking man, SPIVEY, who is a soldier by name only, 
               answers up.

                                     SPIVEY
                         Yessir sergeant...

                                     SERGEANT BAUER
                         Tell the major he's wakin' up... and 
                         move your worthless ass.

               The sergeant's smallish eyes are fixed on Dances With Wolves. 
               With some effort he manages to get himself into a sitting 
               position against the back wall.

                                     SERGEANT BAUER
                         Got yourself a helluva shiner, didn't 
                         ya?

               Dances With Wolves only blinks at him. His cheek is crushed 
               and so is his spirit.

               Someone calls attention and two officers walk into the 
               roofless supply house. One is a MAJOR, one is a young 
               lieutenant -- Lieutenant Elgin -- the officer Dances With 
               Wolves bumped into at Fort Hays. Neither one recognizes the 
               other.

                                     MAJOR
                         Does he speak english?

                                     SERGEANT BAUER
                         Don't know sir... you speak english? 
                         Talk english?
                              (kicking at one of 
                              Dances With Wolves' 
                              boots)
                         Talk?

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         I speak english...

               Everyone is shocked at the clarity of the words.

                                     MAJOR
                         Who are you?

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         Lieutenant John. J. Dunbar. This is 
                         my post.

                                     MAJOR
                         Why are you dressed like this?

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         I came out from Fort Hays last April. 
                         But there was no one here.

               The major and the lieutenant exchange whispers.

                                     ELGIN
                         You have proof of that?

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         My journal is on the bunk in my 
                         quarters. My orders are in the 
                         journal. It will tell you everything.

                                     ELGIN
                         Spivey, you and Edwards were here 
                         first. Did you find anything... a 
                         journal.

               Spivey shifts uncomfortably.

                                     SPIVEY
                         We didn't see nothin' sir.

                                     ELGIN
                         Where's Edwards?

                                     SPIVEY
                         He's outside. But he didn't see 
                         nothin' either.

               Elgin indicates to the major that he will get to the bottom 
               of this and walks out the door -- the major follows.

               Dances With Wolves lets his head slump forward. The men 
               gathered around the supply house murmur among themselves, 
               commenting on the prisoner. They can't take their eyes off 
               him. Neither can Sergeant Bauer. He watches the prisoner 
               from a distance. Then he walks across the floor, squats in 
               front of him and whispers coarsely in his face.

                                     SERGEANT BAUER
                         You turned Injun, din'cha?

               Dances With Wolves lifts his head and stares at the sergeant.

                                     SERGEANT BAUER
                         Din'cha?

               The major and the lieutenant suddenly reappear.

                                     ELGIN
                         What is your name?

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         Dunbar... D.U.N.B.A.R... John.

                                     ELGIN
                         You say you are an officer?

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         Did you read my orders?

                                     ELGIN
                         No.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         It was in my journal.

                                     ELGIN
                         There are no orders and there is no 
                         journal.

               There is a silence as Dances With Wolves takes this in.

               Elgin tries again.

                                     ELGIN
                         Why are you out of uniform?

               Dances With Wolves takes a long time to answer.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         I have to relieve myself.

               EXT. SEDGEWICK - DAY

               Surrounded by guards, Dances With Wolves is being walked 
               toward a clump of bushes.

               He glances out at the prairie. Cisco's body lies where it 
               fell. Black birds are pecking it.

                                     GUARD
                         Here you... eyes front.

               A rifle butt bangs him hard between the shoulder blades and 
               Dances With Wolves attacks. Before anyone else can move he 
               has taken the offending soldier to the ground and is 
               strangling him.

               Another rifle butt crashes against his skull and again 
               everything goes black.

               INT. SUPPLY HOUSE - DAY

               Water drips from Dances With Wolves' head and he comes to 
               again. As he moves he hears a jangling and discovers that 
               his hands and feet are in chains. Everyone has assembled.

                                     ELGIN
                         Why are you out of uniform?

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         What is the army doing out here?

               Sergeant Bauer shoves Dances With Wolves with his gun.

                                     BAUER
                         Lieutenant's askin' the questions 
                         here.

               Elgin quickly steps in.

                                     ELGIN
                         We are charged with apprehending 
                         hostiles, recovering stolen property 
                         and retrieving white captives taken 
                         in hostile raidings.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         There are no hostiles.

                                     MAJOR
                         We will ascertain that for ourselves. 
                         Now if you guide us to these camps 
                         and serve as an interpreter, your 
                         conduct will be reevaluated.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         What conduct?

                                     MAJOR
                         Your status as a traitor might improve 
                         should you choose to cooperate with 
                         the United States Army.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                              (quietly)
                         There is nothing for you to do out 
                         here.

               Elgin can see that the major's attitude and inexperience has 
               killed any chance of communication. He makes one last try on 
               his own.

                                     ELGIN
                         Are you willing to cooperate or not?

                                     MAJOR
                         Well, speak up...

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                              (lowly in Sioux)
                         I am Dances With Wolves...

                                     MAJOR
                         What's that?

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                              (loudly in Sioux)
                         I am Dances With Wolves... I have 
                         nothing to say to you. You are not 
                         worth talking to.

               The major is surprised. Elgin is not. The major turns on his 
               heel and walks out. Lieutenant Elgin stares at Dances With 
               Wolves.

                                     ELGIN
                         Sergeant... have a detail take him 
                         down to the river... let him clean 
                         up his face.

               EXT. RIVER - DAY

               Dances With Wolves kneels by the river, splashing water 
               lightly on his battered face. Half a dozen soldiers are 
               lounging around watching him.

               EXT. BUSHES - DAY

               Trooper Spivey is crapping in the bushes. Another soldier, 
               CRAPPER, is crapping not far away. Spivey can see Dances 
               With Wolves in the distance, still splashing water on his 
               face.

               Now he slips something out of his tunic. It's the journal. 
               He opens it and starts to tear out a page, trying hard not 
               to make noise.

                                     CRAPPER (O.S.)
                         You got paper over there Spivey?

                                     SPIVEY
                         What's it to you?

                                     CRAPPER
                         Well gimme some shitbird.

               Spivey thinks.

                                     SPIVEY
                         Can you read?

                                     CRAPPER
                         Naw, I can't read. What the hell do 
                         you care... you can't either.

               Spivey looks down at the stolen journal, thinking.

                                     SPIVEY
                         Alright... hold your horses.

               EXT. SEDGEWICK - DAY

               Two Sioux scouts watch from the brow of a slope above the 
               fort. Having spotted Dances With Wolves, they withdraw.

               We see Dances With Wolves at a distance, being marched back 
               to his "cell" by the detail of soldiers. He's moving awkwardly 
               in his chains.

               INT. SUPPLY HOUSE - DAY

               Dances With Wolves is half-dozing against the wall when Spivey 
               walks in with a plate of army gruel. He's followed by Sergeant 
               Bauer. Spivey sets the plate in front of the prisoner. He 
               admires the breastplate and like a crow eyeing something 
               shiny, he thinks to grab for it.

               Suddenly a pair of manacled hands lock on his wrists. Dances 
               With Wolves face is inches away from Spiveys. Terrified, 
               Spivey pulls away, kicking over the plate of food as he 
               scrambles to safety across the room.

                                     SERGEANT BAUER
                         Lap it up Injun.

               Dances With Wolves sticks a toe under the lip of the plate 
               and flips it over. Most of it hits Spivey, a little splashes 
               on Bauer. Spivey moves to kick the prisoner, but Bauer 
               intercedes with his rifle.

                                     SERGEANT BAUER
                         Go on ahead Injun... You'll just get 
                         hungrier is all... but mebbe that 
                         don't matter. Word is they're gonna 
                         ship you back to Hays. And they'll 
                         hang you once you get there.

               Bauer and Spivey leave him and Dances With Wolves kicks out 
               viciously at the spilled plate.

               EXT. TEMPORARY CAMP - DAY

               There's a tremendous upheaval. Ten Bears' band has halted 
               its march. SIX PAINTED WARRIORS all heavily armed are jumping 
               onto their ponies and being handed the lines to spare mounts. 
               Wind In His Hair is their leader.

               The whole village is up to see them off.

               Smiles A Lot, painted and carrying a bow and quiver rides 
               into the midst of the group. Wind In His Hair studies the 
               resolute boy.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         You will hold our horses... nothing 
                         more.

               Smiles A Lot nods.

               With a great whooping from the villagers, the rescue party 
               roars out of camp.

               EXT. SEDGEWICK - DAY

               The wagon is pulling out with an escort of SEVEN SOLDIERS.

               Dances With Wolves' spirits are very low as he sits in the 
               bed of the jolting wagon. Spivey is guarding him.  Elgin is 
               leading the detail.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY.

               Dances with Wolves watches a ridge in the distance for any 
               sign of riders.

                                     SPIVEY
                         I don't see nobody.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               Elgin and one of the escort soldiers are scouting far out on 
               the prairie. The lieutenant pauses and looks back at the 
               wagon. It is far behind in the distance, but still coming.

               EXT. WAGON - DAY

               Dances With Wolves is dozing as the wagon jolts across the 
               ground. Suddenly a shot rings out. Dances With Wolves opens 
               his eyes.

               The wagon driver is aiming his rifle out at something on the 
               prairie. He fires again.

               Dances With Wolves looks over the wagon bed and sees Two 
               Socks. He's standing still, fifty yards away. Staring in his 
               old inquisitive way at the wagon.

                                     SPIVEY
                         Lookit the stupid bastard... he ain't 
                         even runnin'.

               Two shots ring out in rapid succession.

                                     BAUER
                         Don't shoot, I seen 'em first... 
                         it's my shot.

               Sergeant Bauer fires his own round. Everyone has missed. 
               Bauer is jamming another cartridge into the chamber.

                                     DRIVER
                         It's my shot goddamit.

               Now Spivey decides to get into the act. He rises up with his 
               rifle aiming.

                                     SPIVEY
                         You dumb sons a bitches.

               Before he can fire, there's a rattling of chains. And the 
               next moment, Spivey's feet are being pulled out from under 
               him by Dances With Wolves. His rifle fires harmlessly into 
               space.

               Bauer turns from the wagon seat and slams the back of the 
               prisoner's head with the gunstock. Dances With Wolves falls 
               back, letting go of the shaken Spivey.

               Bauer smiles at Spivey contemptuously.

                                     BAUER
                         He mighta killed you.

               In the next instant, Spivey gives Dances With Wolves a 
               resounding crack in the sternum with the butt of his rifle 
               and he goes down on his back.

               More shots are fired. Dazedly, Dances With Wolves looks out 
               and sees Two Socks still running parallel to the wagon.

               There's another shot and then shouting.

                                     SOLDIER 1
                         I got him...

                                     SOLDIER 2
                         The hell you did...

                                     SOLDIER 1
                         I got him... dead shot boys.

               Spivey is still poking Dances With Wolves.

                                     SPIVEY
                         You want more?... get up... get up.

                                     ELGIN
                         Spivey!

               Elgin has ridden alongside the wagon.

                                     ELGIN
                         I see you bash the prisoner once 
                         more and I'll put those shackles on 
                         you...

               Elgin's men are headed up towards Two Socks when shots ring 
               out.

                                     ELGIN
                         You men! Get back to your places.

               The camera continues over the hill to Two Socks' body, but 
               it is no where in sight. Instead the Indian war party of six 
               is waiting silently in ambush. Frustrated, they will try 
               again.

               EXT. RIVERBANK - DAY

               The wagon is making its way steadily down, toward the river. 
               Dances With Wolves watches the line of growth along the river 
               get closer, his eyes and ears and nose full alert.

               If they come this will be the place to do it. Dances With 
               Wolves will make the most of this hope.

               The wagon moves down a narrow pathway, not much more than a 
               game trail. The lieutenant raises his hand and the wagon 
               halts at the river's edge.

               A soldier rides back and forth in the water on the other 
               side of the river. He's checking for any signs of ambush. 
               The soldier starts back to them.

                                     SOLDIER
                         All clear lieutenant...

               Elgin starts into the water, followed by the wagon. The "all 
               clear" sign means nothing to Dances With Wolves. He's all 
               keyed up.

               EXT. RIVER - DAY

               Elgin and a soldier are leading the way. They're only a few 
               yards from the opposite bank when the lieutenant is taken. 
               Elgin is completely surprised to find an arrow buried in his 
               chest.

               The outrider is about to pull up his gun when an arrow hits 
               him square in the gut. He brings his head up to see the full 
               force of Wind In His Hair, stringing up another arrow and 
               taking aim.

               Just as the outrider is struggling to raise his gun, Wind In 
               His Hair fires off another arrow deep into the man's heart. 
               The impact sends him flying out of the saddle, dead.

               Wind In His Hair comes on, leading five Sioux warriors.

               EXT. WAGON - DAY

               Dances With Wolves has looped the shackles around Spivey's 
               neck in a death grip when he sees Bauer leveling his rifle 
               at the approaching riders.

               Dances With Wolves aims a vicious kick at Bauer, sending the 
               rifle flying, and Bauer over the edge of the wagon. Bauer 
               flounders in the water, fumbling for his pistol. He sends 
               off a round taking one of the on rushing warriors in the 
               shoulder. The Sioux looses his seat and tumbles off the pony 
               into the water, wounded.

               EXT. WAGON - DAY

               Dances With Wolves snaps the loop around Spivey's neck as 
               hard as he can and bone breaks.

               Dances With Wolves is beating Spivey furiously with his 
               chains. He keeps whacking until the blood is spreading on 
               the surface of the water.

               The frantic driver is about to make a run for it when he is 
               impaled with a Sioux lance.

               EXT. RIVER - DAY

               The two soldiers in the back of the wagon have turned tail 
               and are splashing back across the river.

               As they scramble up the bank, two Sioux warriors meet them 
               and cut them down with hatchets.

               EXT. RIVER - DAY

               In the midst of the smoke and confusion of the battle, Bauer 
               has made his way to the cover of the weeds along the river 
               bank.

               Crashing through the thicket, he comes to a clearing and 
               there in the shallows, comes face to face with Smiles A Lot. 
               The boy is standing in the shallows holding the extra horses.

               The boy is so frightened at the sudden sight of this white 
               soldier that he doesn't move. Bauer sticks his revolver into 
               Smiles A Lot's face and pulls the trigger. But the hammer 
               only clicks. The gun is empty.

               Bauer pistol-whips the boy, knocking him to the ground and 
               grabs for the closest of the horses. But the ponies are all 
               stirred up now and starting to run down the river.

               Bauer succeeds in grabbing a hunk of mane, but the horse 
               he's gotten hold of is moving too fast for him to get on. 
               But now Bauer hears a bone-chilling whoop. Wind In His Hair 
               is coming.

               His pony plows through the water at full speed. A skullcracker 
               dangles from one hand. The warrior begins to whirl it around.

               Terrified, Bauer turns to run. Before he can take a step, a 
               hatchet buries itself to the hilt. Smiles A Lot is at the 
               other end. But Bauer is not through.

               His hands are around the boy's neck, choking him with his 
               last seconds of life. A larger than life Wind In His Hair 
               draws even and swings his club. Bauer's head explodes, 
               covering Smiles A Lot in blood -- the sergeant's hands cannot 
               be seen.

               EXT. RIVER - DAY

               Still in chains, Dances With Wolves and Wind In His Hair are 
               dragging Elgin's body onto shore. Dances With Wolves rifles 
               through the dead man's pockets. He finds a set of keys and 
               plops down to unlock his shackles.

               The wounded Indian warrior is being tended to. Smiles A Lot 
               is downstream washing Bauer's blood off.

               EXT. RIVER - DAY

               A warrior is stripping down Spivey. He holds up the dead 
               man's tunic, but doesn't notice that something plops out.

               It's the journal. It floats off into the current, well out 
               of Dances With Wolves field of vision. It is lost forever.

               EXT. RIVER - DAY

               The journal continues its downstream journey. Suddenly a 
               small hand reaches down and scoops it out of the water.

               Smiles A Lot holds the book close to his face amazed at the 
               sight of words.

               EXT. RIVER - DAY

               The party is mounting. Smiles A Lot rides up next to Dances 
               With Wolves.

                                     SMILES A LOT
                         Dances With Wolves... look.

               He offers the book. Dances With Wolves takes it, regarding 
               the journal.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DUSK

               The rescue party is cantering across the prairie.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                              (to Wind In His Hair)
                         We go South?

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         We will ride South for two days... 
                         then turn East. No one must follow.

               This doesn't seem to bother Wind In His Hair. But it sets 
               Dances With Wolves to thinking.

               EXT. CANYON TRAIL - DAY

               The sound of a single drum calls attention to eight 
               silhouettes on horseback making their way down the ridge. 
               The entire village begins to rumble with excitement as the 
               news spreads.

               EXT. CANYON TRAIL - DAY

               The rescue party is walking down the trail single file. Dances 
               With Wolves is a few slots back. All the village is racing 
               up the canyon to greet them.

               Stands With A Fist leads them all. She runs to Dances With 
               Wolves. She jumps all over her husband and finally he lifts 
               her up on his pony.

               INT. DANCES WITH WOLVES' LODGE - DAY

               The couple we have come to know are sitting on their bed.

               Dances With Wolves is combing Stands With A Fist's hair. 
               It's something he is doing with care and affection. She is 
               loving it as much as he. They are together as two people can 
               be and yet it is a hard time.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         You have nothing to say?

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         What can I tell you?

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         What ever is on your mind.

                                     STANDS WITH A FIST
                         We have decided. You are my husband. 
                         I am your wife. That is all I know.

               Dances With Wolves lays his forehead on her back. He sighs. 
               Then he pulls away, slips a robe around his shoulders and 
               walks out of the lodge.

               Sadly, she watches him go.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               We follow a pair of boots walking in the snow. Pan up to 
               find an ORDERLY bringing coffee to a MAJOR. He is surrounded 
               by other officers and in front of him a large column of men 
               is moving toward the snow covered mountains.

               The Major tosses the remaining coffee in a fire and he 
               prepares to mount.

               We pan up with the smoke and the steam.

               EXT. TEN BEARS' LODGE - DAY

               It's cold in the Sioux camp. A warm column of smoke is 
               spiraling out of Ten Bears' lodge.

               INT. TEN BEARS' LODGE - DAY

               Several men are gathered around Ten Bears' fire, including 
               Kicking Bird, Wind In His Hair and Dances With Wolves.

               All the men are draped with blankets. The wind is howling 
               outside. The men are engaged in small talk as the pipe goes 
               around the circle.

               The pipe comes around to Dances With Wolves, and the man 
               next to him must nudge him to attention. Dances With Wolves 
               takes the pipe and begins to smoke.

               Ten Bears watches him closely.

                                     TEN BEARS
                              (to Dances With Wolves)
                         Dances With Wolves is quiet these 
                         days.

               He does not reply. He smokes a little more and passes the 
               pipe.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         Is his heart bad?

               Dances With Wolves glances at the men around the fire.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         Killing the soldiers at the river 
                         was a good thing. It made me free 
                         and my heart was big to see my friends 
                         coming to help me. I did not mind 
                         killing those men. I was glad to do 
                         it.

               He searches for the right words.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         But the soldiers hate me now like 
                         they hate no other. I am more than 
                         an enemy to them, I am a traitor. 
                         They will hunt for me. They will not 
                         give up. And when they find me they 
                         find you and that cannot happen.

               Objections break out all around the fire. Wind In His Hair 
               jumps to his feet and even Kicking Bird is protesting.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         Quiet!... sit down Wind In His Hair. 
                         You are hurting an old man's ears 
                         with your loud talk.

               EXT. FOREST - DAY

               The column of soldiers can be heard but not seen. They are 
               moving forward, singing the Battle Hymn of The Republic.

               INT. DANCES WITH WOLVES' LODGE - DUSK

               Stands With A Fist is building up the fire in their cozy 
               home. Dances With Wolves works on a long-stemmed pipe which 
               is in the last stages of completion.

                                     TEN BEARS (O.S.)
                         Dances With Wolves?

               Dances With Wolves gets up, opens the flap and admits the 
               old chief. A few snowflakes cling to his wispy hair.

               He goes straight to the fire and sits.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         Ahh... this is a nice fire... at my 
                         age a good fire is better than 
                         anything.

               Stands With A Fist brings two small bowls of food, places 
               them next to the men and busies herself with something else. 
               Though neither one is much interested they begin to eat.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         I wondered how your bad heart was 
                         doing and though I would come by and 
                         see for myself. This place doesn't 
                         look so bad-hearted.

               Dances With Wolves smiles.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         No, we are happy.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         But you are leaving anyway?

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         I have talked with Stands With a 
                         Fist and we will go together.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         Have you told this to Kicking Bird 
                         or to Wind In His Hair.

               It's anguish for Dances with Wolves to think about his 
               friends. He shakes his head "no". Ten Bears thinks again in 
               silence.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         You are the only white man I have 
                         ever known. I have thought about you 
                         alot. More than you know.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         That does not surprise me.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         You have always spoken with your 
                         heart. And like all of us, you are a 
                         free man and can do anything you 
                         like. When I look across this fire, 
                         I do not see a white soldier. I see 
                         only a Sioux named Dances With Wolves. 
                         And there is nothing they hate so 
                         much as a Sioux.

               Ten Bears words always have purpose and as always, he makes 
               his point.

               He pauses for a moment and notices Dances with Wolves' nearly 
               finished pipe.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         You are making a pipe?

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         Yes?

               Ten Bears holds out a hand and Dances with Wolves hands the 
               pipe to him. Ten Bears inspects it briefly.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         This might be a pretty good pipe... 
                         how does it smoke?

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         I don't know, I haven't tried it 
                         yet.

                                     TEN BEARS
                         Let's smoke it awhile... it is good 
                         to pass the time this way.

               EXT. WINTER CAMP - DAWN

               From a little distance, Wind In His Hair is watching Dances 
               With Wolves' lodge. His face is full of uncertainty and a 
               kind of pain we have never seen before. He is in agony.

               He starts forward but after a few yards he stops to think. 
               He turns back but has only gone a few steps when he stops 
               and turns to face Dances With Wolves' lodge once more. He 
               starts for the tipi again, but he can't go thru with it. The 
               proud warrior turns away and walks quickly out of sight.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               The column is moving at a leisurely walk when the horses 
               start to bunch up. They're stopping.

               Everyone waits while far up ahead, a group of ten or twelve 
               men examine the ground. White officers sits atop their horses, 
               while their scouts scour the ground. They've found a 
               significant trail.

               The scouts are Indian, and by their distinctive dress, we 
               recognize them. They are Pawnee.

               The Pawnee scouts come racing up. Their horses are wet and 
               have come a good distance. The scouts are very excited.

               The men have dismounted. They prepare for battle, removing 
               any equipment that might rattle -- tin cups, plates, etc., 
               tossing the discards into a growing pile.

               INT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - DAWN

               Black Shawl watches as Kicking Bird slips a magnificent pipe 
               into its buckskin case. Now he looks at her. The medicine 
               man too is in a kind of pain we have not seen before.

               EXT. WINTER CAMP - DAWN

               Carrying the pipe he made, Dances With Wolves walks through 
               the village. Suddenly he stops. Kicking Bird is standing in 
               the middle of the empty avenue.

               Like gunfighters, the two men approach each other at a slow 
               and deliberate walk.

               Gradually they realize that each has selected the same parting 
               gift. It's heartbreaking. Kicking Bird tries to cover with a 
               casual question, but it's all fake.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         You've finished your pipe? How does 
                         it smoke?

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         I'm told it smokes well.

               Dances With Wolves moves to make the exchange. Kicking Bird 
               does the same. From one hand to the other. Men couldn't be 
               closer.

                                     KICKING BIRD
                         It doesn't seem possible that we 
                         could come this far.

                                     DANCES WITH WOLVES
                         You were the first man I ever wanted 
                         to be like. I will not forget you.

               Neither can speak. There is only goodbye.

               EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

               The column of soldiers is not in a rush, but they're trotting 
               now to make better time.

               EXT. WINTER CAMP - DAY

               Stands With A Fist sits on a pony outside the lodge. Two 
               pack horses are loaded with their things.

               Dances With Wolves swings onto his pony's back and we follow 
               as they start out of the village. No one is standing in rose 
               to watch them leave. No one is crying. In fact, people are 
               making the motions of going about their regular work.

               But it's all fake too. The whole village is sad and the most 
               obvious sign is that there is no sound. In the awful quiet, 
               most people avert their eyes as the two pass by.

               EXT. CANYON TRAIL - DAY

               Dances With Wolves and Stands With A Fist have reached the 
               head of the trail leading out of the winter camp. They have 
               just begun to ascend when a voice, calling from afar, brings 
               them to a halt. The sound echoes through the canyons, through 
               the village.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR (O.S.)
                              (calling)
                         Dances With Wolves...

               EXT. CANYON - DAY

               His pony is jacked up and, as always, Wind In His Hair looks 
               the perfect warrior. But now his face is full of stress as 
               he screams out the message he could not deliver in person.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR
                         I am Wind In His Hair...

               EXT. WINTER CAMP - DAY

               Everyone in the camp has stopped to listen.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR (O.S.)
                         Can you not see that I am your friend?

               EXT. CANYON TRAIL - DAY

               Dances With Wolves looks ready to crack.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR (O.S.)
                         Can you not see that you will always 
                         be my friend?

               Dances With Wolves lets the unhappy echo of these words fade 
               away before he starts his pony again. We follow for a few 
               yards. Then the call comes a second time. If anything, more 
               urgent than before.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR (O.S.)
                         Dances With Wolves...

               Dances With Wolves stops. He drops his head painfully as the 
               sound of his own name booms through his head.

               EXT. CANYON TRAIL - DUSK

               Troops are moving through the trees quietly, sabers drawn.

               EXT. CANYON RIM - DUSK

               The rest of the troops have moved to the edge. They too are 
               quiet. Down below, the Pawnee scouts are milling about looking 
               for sign.

               The soldiers from the canyon floor are silently arriving on 
               the scene. The Pawnee look to the lead scout on the canyon 
               rim. They have no answer, and the lead scout has none to 
               give the general at his side. Ten Bears' village is gone.

               EXT. CANYON RIM - DUSK

               Wind In His Hair and several other warriors are just drawing 
               back from unseen vantage points on the canyon rim. Wind In 
               His Hair glances back and hesitates, as though waiting for 
               someone. A great, yellow full moon has just appeared above 
               the opposite rim of the canyon. The yellow is brilliant, a 
               great spotlight of golden color.

               A wolf steps into the light on the opposite rim. He's walking 
               in the backdrop of the moon. The wolf suddenly arches his 
               back, sticks his muzzle in the air and produces a spine-
               tingling howl. The sound bounces all over the canyon.

               Dances With Wolves is at the canyon's rim. He listens a long 
               time, fully entranced by the wolf's howl. He is still 
               listening when it is gone. A whisper floats out of the night 
               behind him.

                                     WIND IN HIS HAIR (O.S.)
                         Dances With Wolves...

               Dances With Wolves shrinks back from the canyon's rim, turns 
               and trots off into the darkness, following his friends.

                                                              FADE TO BLACK

   EXT: ARCTIC CIRCLE - DAY

   Snow and ice as far as the eye can see. What looks like a
   windowless MILITARY BASE surrounded by barbed wire fences
   sits in the middle of the wasteland.

   TITLE CARD: TOP SECRET RESEARCH LABORATORY.   ARCTIC CIRCLE.

   At the GUARD GATE, two RUSSIAN GUARDS play poker using an
   overturned barrel as a table.

   Russian Guard 1 shows a five of diamonds... and four Aces.
   The other Guard folds. Russian Guard 1 LAUGHS and drags in
   the pile of coins.

   While he SPEAKS IN RUSSIAN and does a celebratory dance, the
   coins fly up into the air. Russian Guard 1 stops dancing and
   sees that the coins are gone. He accuses the other Guard of
   stealing them. Russian Guard 2 swears he didn't take them.

   Russian Guard 1 grabs a shovel and wields it menacingly,
   until it flies up into the air. They both look up to see
   where it's gone. Then the metal barrel they were using as a
   table flies up, knocking them over.

   Russian Guard 2 looks up to see a GIGANTIC MAGNET SHIP
   LOWERING DOWN FROM ABOVE AND HOVERING OVER THE LABORATORY.

   A watchtower guard shouts. A door below opens as a bunch of
   Guards run out and point their guns at the magnet ship.
   Then...WOOSH! All of their guns are pulled up towards the
   ship, including the guards themselves, who are strapped to
   their guns.

   A SNOWMOBILE lifts off the ground and flies up to the magnet.
   Other vehicles and small buildings begin to pull away from
   the ground.

   Then--

   THE ENTIRE LAB STARTS TO GET PULLED UP OUT OF THE GROUND.

   CLANK! The lab makes contact with the ship. It flies up and
   down, shaking the scientists and guards off. They fall to
   the ground. The magnet ship flies away with their lab,
   vehicles, and weapons.

   The remaining guards and scientists are strewn across the
   snow with the remnants of the damaged base. We see a porta-
   potty door open. A Confused Guard is sitting on the can
   reading a newspaper, having missed the entire incident. He
   closes the door.

   INT: AVL HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

   SECURITY FOOTAGE of the research station named PX LABS being
   carried away by the magnet ship plays on the screens at AVL
   Headquarters.

   We see the back of several heads watching the footage.

   There's a heavy sigh.

                    SILAS
          Three weeks and we're still no
          closer to cracking this?

No response.

                    SILAS (CONT'D)
          Right... bring him in.

          Yes, sir.


EXT: SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

Gru steps toward camera, holding some sort of menacing gun,
which he loads and cocks. He pulls the trigger, which shoots
out an inflatable unicorn balloon.

Smiling, he ties it to the windowsill next to some others.



EXT: GRU'S BACKYARD - DAY

A banner reads: "Happy Birthday Agnes!" and a massive
backyard party is in full swing. The yard is decorated with
pink balloons and streamers, and a BOUNCY HOUSE shaped like a
castle.

AGNES and several other LITTLE GIRLS slide down a slide.
They are all dressed as princesses, but Agnes is dressed as a
princess riding a unicorn.

                    AGNES
          This is the best party EVER!!!

Edith, dressed as a ninja, emerges from beneath a table and
climbs across the monkey bars as a series of jousts, blades,
and boxing gloves come up from the ground underneath her.
She jumps down, narrowly avoiding a bear trap.

                     EDITH
          Haha!   Yeah!
          DESPICABLE ME 2           CINCO & KEN DRAFT       3.


Two LITTLE GIRLS fish in a small kiddie pool. One of the
girls pulls up a toy duck and then razzes the other girl, but
then a LIVE PIRANHA jumps out and eats the toy duck.

A BOY and a GIRL sword fight. The Boy does a bunch of fancy
moves. The Girl waits for him to finish and then pounds him
on the head with a club.

Two kids in the background are on a see-saw made of bombs.
Agnes runs into the middle of the yard and points offscreen.

                     AGNES
          Oh no!   A dragon is approaching!

All of the kids turn and see KYLE dressed as a dragon. He
GRUMBLES and then they SCREAM and huddle around Agnes. Then
Margo enters wearing a SUIT OF ARMOR and wielding a SWORD.

                    MARGO
          Fear not, for here come the gallant
          knights to save us!

She gestures to a group of minions wearing tiny suits of
armor and wielding various MEDIEVAL WEAPONS. The Kids CHEER
as the minions charge toward Kyle. One accidentally hits
another with his sword. A fight ensues in which they use the
medieval weapons on each other.

One minion pounds another with a MACE. One Minion wanders off
from the fight with his helmet on backwards, wildly swinging
his mace.

Across the yard, Gru is busy grilling burgers and talking on
the phone. Not happy.

                    GRU
          No, no, no! What do you mean she's
          not coming?! I have a backyard
          full of these little girls who are
          counting on a visit from a fairy
          princess!

The mace-swinging Minion walks by and accidently, repeatedly
hits Gru with the mace in the shin.

                     GRU (CONT'D)
          Ah!   Hurts! Ah! Stop it!

Gru kicks the minion's helmet and chases him off with a
spatula, sending him towards the party swinging his mace.
Gru SIGHS and returns to the call.
          DESPICABLE ME 2              CINCO & KEN DRAFT   4.


                    GRU (CONT'D)
          Listen! I don't want a refund! I
          want a fairy princess... please!
          Please, I am begging you.
              (Resigned)
          You know what? I hope that you can
          sleep at night, you crusher of
          little girls' dreams!!!

Gru hits the phone with his spatula and hangs up.    Turns and
sees Agnes standing there.

                     AGNES
          Ooh ooh!   When's the Fairy Princess
          coming?

Gru stares down at Agnes' big excited eyes. He opens his
mouth to tell her the truth, but can't do it.

                    GRU
          Any minute now!

Agnes squeals with excitement and runs off.

                     AGNES
          Yayyy!

Gru looks worried--what do I do now?    He signals two minions.

                    GRU
          Stall them.


EXT: BACKYARD - LATER

A hand-painted piece of cardboard reading "THE MAGIC SHOW" is
placed on an easel. Agnes and all of the little kids sit in
a semicircle on the grass. Two minions dressed as magicians
are doing a magic act with Edith as their assistant. One
minion blows up a balloon and puts it in Edith's mouth. Then
the other whips out a CHAINSAW and fires it up, heading
toward her.

Margo sees this and quickly intervenes.

                    MARGO
          Whoa! Whoa! Okay, okay, alright.
          That's enough of the magic show!

The minions don't hide their disappointment.

                     MINIONS
          Awwww.
          DESPICABLE ME 2            CINCO & KEN DRAFT   5.


Margo suddenly looks around as if she just heard something.

                    MARGO
          Wait, did you hear that? It
          sounded like the twinkling sounds
          of magical fairy dust.

                    AGNES
              (gasps)
          It's the fairy princess!   She's
          coming!

Margo gasps and points up to the sky.

                      MARGO
          Look!

Edith spits out her magic balloon in horror and we follow it
up to reveal--

Gru. Dressed in a PUFFY PINK DRESS, fairy wings, glittery
eyelashes and tiara and magical wand.

Up on top of Gru's house, the minions struggle to lower him
down on a rope. Edith's balloon floats by and distracts
them.

They let go of the rope and Gru swings wildly, smashing into
the wall of the house and crashing to the ground.

                      GRU
          Aaaaaahh!

He stands up and tries to cover.

Agnes SIGHS HAPPILY, in awe of the fairy princess.

                    GRU (CONT'D)
              (in falsetto)
          It is I, Gru...zinkerbell! The
          most magical fairy princess of all!
          And I am here to wish Princess
          Agnes a very happy birthday!

Gru sprinkles the girls with glitter and they continue to
stare, frozen. Then a LITTLE GIRL raises her hand and speaks
with a lisp.

                    LITTLE GIRL
          How come you're tho fat?

Gru grits his teeth, then forces a smile and speaks with a
high-pitched, dreamy voice.
          DESPICABLE ME 2            CINCO & KEN DRAFT    6.


                    GRU
          Because my house is made of candy
          and sometimes I eat instead of
          facing my problems.

The girl starts to ask another question.

                    LITTLE GIRL
          How come you have-

Gru cuts her off with a puff of fairy dust to the face.   She
COUGHS.

                     GRU
          Okay!   Time for cake!

As the kids run to the table, Agnes approaches Gru.

                    AGNES
          Thank you, Gru-zinkerbell. You're
          the best fairy princess ever!

Gru smiles.

                    GRU
              (in falsetto)
          You are welcome, little girl.

She runs off, but quickly returns.

                    AGNES
              (whispers in his ear)
          I know it's really you, Gru. I'm
          just pretending for the other kids.

She runs off again to join her friends. Gru watches her go.
Couldn't be happier. Then he is approached by JILLIAN, a
heavily-Botoxed mom.

                    JILLIAN
          Hey there, Gru, Mr. Life of the
          Party!

                    GRU
              (forcing a smile)
          Hello, Jillian.

                    JILLIAN
          Sooooo, I'm gonna go out on a limb
          here, but my friend Natalie is
          recently single, and...
           DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT   7.


In the background, a homely NATALIE leans against a buffet
table and seductively raises her eyebrows at Gru. The table
collapses to the ground beneath her.

                     GRU
               (realizes what's going on)
           No, no, no, get off of the limb
           right now. No limb.

                     JILLIAN
           Oh, come on...she's a riot. She
           sings karaoke, she has a lot of
           free time, looks aren't that
           important to her...

In the background, Natalie inadvertently walks in front of a
bottle pitch game, is struck by a ball, and falls to the
ground.

                     GRU
           No, Jill's, that is not happening.
           Seriously. I'm fine.

                     JILLIAN
               (calling after Gru)
           Okay, fine. Forget Natalie.        How
           about my cousin Linda?

Gru walks off, passing by Edith and Margo.

                        GRU
           No.

                     JILLIAN
           Oh, oh! I know someone whose
           husband just died!

SPLASH!   Suddenly Jillian is sprayed in the face with water.

Reveal Gru holding a HOSE with a SPRAY NOZZLE.

                        GRU
           I'm sorry.     I did not see you
           there.

SPLASH!   He sprays her again.    She falls down.

                        GRU (CONT'D)
           Or there.

He drops the hose and walks away, CHUCKLING softly.

EXT: GRU'S HOUSE - DUSK

Gru takes Kyle out to the front yard.

CAMERA POV

A camera with nightvision is watching them. The screen
analyzes Kyle and a readout comes out as "SPECIES: UNKNOWN."
Kyle sniffs Gru's flowers.

                       GRU
             Kyle... Kyle!

Then it analyzes Gru and the readout says "TARGET ACQUIRED."

                       GRU (CONT'D)
             Ky--Kyle!   No, do not do your
             business on the petunias!

Kyle lifts up his leg next to Gru's flowers.

He picks Kyle up and places him next to his neighbor's bush.

                       GRU (CONT'D)
             There you go. Those are Fred's.
             Go crazy.

Kyle does and the bush immediately withers and dies.         Gru
CHUCKLES.

                         GRU (CONT'D)
             Good boy.

                         VOICE (O.S.)
             Mr. Gru?

Gru turns and sees Lucy Wilde standing there.

                        GRU
             Wha?   I didn't... What... Yes?

                       LUCY
                 (holds up her badge)
             Hi! Agent Lucy Wilde of the AVL.
                 (realizes her badge is
                  upside down)
             Oh. Whoops.
                 (clears her throat, all
                  business)
             Sorry, you're gonna have to come
             with me.

                       GRU
             Oh, sorry, I--Freeze Ray!
          DESPICABLE ME 2                 CINCO & KEN DRAFT      9.


Gru whips out his FREEZE RAY and fires it.       A WALL OF ICE
heads for Lucy.

But before it gets to her, Lucy pulls out a retractable gun
from her purse, which acts as a FLAMETHROWER. Melting the
ice.

                    LUCY
          You know you really should announce
          your weapons after you fire them,
          Mr. Gru. For example--

She pulls out a LIPSTICK. Fires it at Gru. The tip flies
through the air and connects with his chest, latching on.
ZZZZZAPPP! It tases him, which sends his body flailing in
different funny poses before passing out.

                    LUCY (CONT'D)
          Lipstick Taser! Oh, it works so
          good.


EXT: STREET - LATER

Lucy tries to drag Gru to her car, but he's too heavy.

                         LUCY
          Man.    Ugh.     Large...person.

She gets an idea.

Lucy gets into her car. In the background, we see Gru begin
to come to, but he is struck by Lucy's car as she pulls back
and is knocked out again.

                    LUCY (CONT'D)
          Oh...sorry!

Closer now, Lucy gets out and stuffs his body into the trunk.

Just then Tom and Stuart come out of Gru's garage and see
their boss being loaded in. Lucy struggles to close the
trunk.

                    LUCY (CONT'D)
          Get...in...there...you...big...man!

SLAM! Lucy finally slams the trunk then quickly gets into
the vehicle.

Tom and Stuart exchange horrified looks.

                         TOM AND STUART
          Boss!
         DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT   10.


They take off running after the car as it pulls away, running
as fast as their tiny legs will carry them. They get right
behind it and Tom LEAPS up onto the trunk. He reaches his
hand out to Stuart, who is falling behind.

                    TOM
          Koom ey lah!

                    STUART
          Koom ey lah! Koom ey lah!

Stuart leaps for the bumper and Tom catches him by his
overall straps. Tom holds on tight as Stuart dangles from
the back of the car, his overall straps stretching way out.

                    STUART (CONT'D)
          Aaaaaaiiieeeaaaiiieeeaaaah!

As Lucy turns a corner, he slams into some garbage cans and
ends up skiing behind the car in a cardboard box.

Now in the box, Stuart continues to ride behind the car, and
even starts to get the hang of that, too. He waves at Tom,
and Tom waves back.

                    STUART (CONT'D)
          Woooo!

                    TOM
          Ooooh!

All is good until they go past a clothesline and a sheet gets
stuck on Stuart.

The sheet forms a parasail which lifts Stuart up into the
air. He strikes a Superman flying pose. Then a flock of
GEESE fly toward him and one actually slams into his face.

                    STUART
          Quack quack!

It SQUAWKS at him as it flies off.

Lucy spots the commotion in her side view mirror and slams on
the brakes. SCREECH! Both minions fly forward--


INT: LUCY'S CAR - SAME

Lucy sees this, drives forward, and opens the convertible
top, causing the Minions to land right in the passenger's
seat. They strike threatening karate poses.

                        TOM AND STUART
           Hi-YAH!!

Lucy tases them and they pass out.       She floors it.


EXT: STREET - SAME

Lucy's car continues driving until it reaches a crowded PIER.
And doesn't stop. It drives right off the end of the pier.
A confused fisherman leaps for his life.

                        CONFUSED FISHERMAN
           What the--     Oh!

SPLASH!


INT: OCEAN - SAME

Lucy's car now transforms into an UNDERWATER VEHICLE. As the
minions come to, one of them tries playing with the radio
until Lucy slaps his hand away. They speed through the sea
and an octopus slams into her windshield. She turns on the
wipers, which hits the octopus in the face until he's had
enough and swims off in a cloud of ink.

She HONKS her HORN as she passes through a school of fish.

                        MINIONS
           Whoa...

As the fish pass the Minions look ahead to see a shark
heading for them with his mouth open. They SCREAM. Lucy
quickly steers the car out of harm's way. They pass by
several more sharks until they arrive at a GIANT SUBMARINE
with the letters "AVL" on the side.

A HATCH opens and Lucy's car goes inside.       The hatch closes
behind her.


INT: AVL SUB - SAME

The water drains out from the holding dock. A buffer and
hair dryer come out to dry off the car. A squeegee wipes off
the windshield.

Then the platform the car is on lowers down.
         DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT   12.


INT: AVL ROOM - DAY

Lucy's car lowers into the center of the room as a large
circular table assembles around it, effectively locking them
in.

Lucy and the Minions get out of the car. She pushes a button
on her remote and Gru, with a starfish attached to his head,
is ejected from the trunk.

                     GRU
              (groggily)
          Ugh...ooh...what...where...ah...oh,

          needles...

                    SILAS (O.S.)
          Good afternoon, Mr. Gru.

                      GRU
          Ehhh...

                    SILAS
          I apologize for our methods in
          getting you here.

                    LUCY
          I don't. I'd do it again in a
          heartbeat. I am not gonna lie--I
          enjoyed that. Every second of it.
          Gave me a bit of a buzz, actually.

                    SILAS
          That's enough, Agent Wilde.

                    LUCY
          Sorry, sir.

                    GRU
          Okay, this is bogus!

Gru peels the starfish off his head and drops it onto Tom's.
Stuart LAUGHS at him.

                    GRU (CONT'D)
          I don't know who you people think
          you are, but--

A WAITER comes over with tea for Silas.

                    SILAS
          We are the Anti-Villain League.
         DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT   13.


As Silas summons a map that shows all of the AVL offices
around the world, Lucy's car drops out of the way. Stuart is
trapped on the lowering platform and he scrambles to get back
onto stable ground. Silas continues.

                    SILAS (CONT'D)

          Then we notice.

                    GRU
          First of all, you've got no proof
          that I did that. Second, after I
          did do that, I put it back!

                     SILAS
          We're well aware of that, Mr. Gru.
          That's why we've brought you here.
              (beat)
          I am the League's director, Silas
          Ramsbottom.

Upon hearing the name, Tom and Stuart start giggling.

                       TOM
          Bottom.

                    TOM AND STUART
          Heeheheeeeheeehee.

Silas bristles at this, and glances over at Lucy.

                       SILAS
          Hilarious.     Agent Wilde...

                    LUCY
          Oh, me now...?

She continues the de-briefing, turning to the screens, which
show an image of the Magnet Ship stealing the lab.

                     LUCY (CONT'D)
          Um, recently an entire top secret
          lab disappeared from the Arctic
          Circle. Yeah, the entire lab.
          Just whoosh. Voom! Gone. Where
          did it go?
         DESPICABLE ME 2              CINCO & KEN DRAFT    14.


                    GRU
          I don't care.

The screen shows FOOTAGE of a TINY LITTLE BUNNY in a
scientific lab. Furry and adorable.

                    LUCY
          The lab was devoted to experiments
          involving PX-41, a transmutation
          serum. What is PX-41, you ask?
          Mmmm, it's pretty bad... Look.

A LABCOAT TECHNICIAN approaches the bunny with a SYRINGE
containing the purple liquid. Injects some in its butt.

                     TOM AND STUART
          Aaah!

Instantly the bunny transforms into a HIDEOUS PURPLE MONSTER
BUNNY. Gru and the Minions smile, impressed.

Then it goes crazy and attacks the scientist.    Gru covers his
eyes and the Minions pass out.

                     GRU
          Oh!

The bunny attacks the technician, then the camera...and the
film is over.

                    GRU (CONT'D)
          Hmm, you usually don't see that in
          bunnies.

                     SILAS
          As you can see, in the wrong hands,
          the PX-41 serum could be the most
          devastating weapon on earth.
              (struggles to get through
                the opening in the table)
          Fortunately it has a very distinct
          chemical footprint, and using the
          latest chemtracking technology, we
          found traces of it in the Paradise
          Mall.

On the screens we see images depicting a highly technical
diagram of the shopping mall.

                     GRU
          Ha!   A mall?

                    SILAS
          Precisely. And we believe that one
          of these shop owners is a master
          criminal.

Silas scrolls through pictures of the mall's shop owners.

                    SILAS (CONT'D)
          And that's where you come in. As
          an ex-villain, you know how a
          villain thinks, how a villain acts.

                    LUCY
          The plan is to set you up
          undercover at a shop in the mall,
          where hopefully you'll be able to--

                    GRU
          Okay, I see where this is going,
          with all the Mission Impossible
          stuff, but no. No! I am a father
          now. And a legitimate businessman.
          I am developing a line of delicious
          jams and jellies.

Silas shoots him a look.    He CHUCKLES.

                    SILAS
          Jams and...jellies?

                     GRU
          Oh, attitude! That's right! So
          thanks, but no thanks.
              (beat)
          And here's a tip--instead of tasing
          people and kidnapping them, maybe
          you should just give them a call!
          Good day, Mr. Sheepsbutt!

                    SILAS

                    GRU
              (chuckles)
          Oh, yeah, like that's any better!

Gru turns and heads for the door, followed by Tom and Stuart,
who continue to GIGGLE about Ramsbottom's name.

Lucy leans out the door and taps him on the shoulder.

                    LUCY
          Look, I probably shouldn't be
          saying this, but your work as a
          villain was kind of amazing, so if
          you ever want to get back to doing
          something awesome--give us a call.

She hands Gru her BUSINESS CARD.   Gru takes it and stares at
it.

Gru rows back to shore as Tom yells to him like a coxswain.
Gru GRUNTS with each stroke.

Gru stares back at Edith.     Gets a far-away look in his eyes.


EXT: PLAYGROUND - FLASHBACK - DAY

We flash back to LITTLE GRU on the school playground. He
stares, lovesick, at a CUTE LITTLE BLONDE GIRL, named LISA.

                    LISA
              (to her friends)

But she doesn't notice him.    He tries again.

The playground erupts with SCREAMS and everyone turns and
runs away.

Little Gru is left alone.     Crushed.

Gru comes out of the flashback.

                    GRU
          Scared? Of what? Women?! No,

          No, no, it doesn't matter... Unless
          it's a boy!

                    AGNES
          I know what makes you a boy.

Gru turns to Agnes, concerned.

                    GRU
          Uh...oooh...you...do?

                    AGNES

          Oh, yes...

Gru sighs and gives her a kiss.

                    GRU
          Goodnight, Agnes.   Never get older.

Gru turns out the light and leaves the room.


INT: LAB - DAY

Gru rides the elevator tube down to his lab, passing minions
in various stages of jelly making. A sign reading, JELLY
TESTING AREA" has been hastily pasted over a nuclear warning
sign.

A SUPERVISOR MINION checks his clipboard as the MINION next
to him steals a banana from his pocket. He turns, but the
Minion who stole the banana has hidden it in his mouth. We
see the ends of the banana pushing out his cheeks.

                      SUPERVISOR MINION
          Hey, oh!    Me banana!
         DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT   20.


The Minion with the banana in his mouth shrugs.

A single apple is passed down a line of Minions in the least
efficient way possible.

A few Minions mash fruits in large vats ala "I Love Lucy."

One wears a bunch of fruit on his head like Carmen Miranda
and sings the CHIQUITA BANANA song. His supervisor comes
over and tells him to get back to work.

The Minion tries to get out of the vat of fruit, but slips
and falls down into a large test-tube filled with mashed
fruit.

Then all of the mashed fruit is flushed down a large hole
where it is injected into jelly jars passing by on a conveyor
belt. The trapped Minion is injected into one of the jars.

Gru enters the lab and greets the minions.

          Hey, Tim, nice haircut!

He points at Tim.

                    GRU (CONT'D)
          Donnie, hang in there, baby!    It's
          almost Friday.

Gru high-fives Donnie as he approaches Dr. Nefario.

                    GRU (CONT'D)
          So, how's today's batch, Dr.
          Nefario?

                    DR.    NEFARIO
          I developed a    new formula which
          allowed me to    get every known kind
          of berry into    one flavor of jelly.

Gru sticks his finger in and tastes the purple goo in the
jar. Makes a disgusted face, then attempts a smile.

                     GRU
              (faking it)
          That tastes good...
              (gags)
          Love the flavor of that...

                    DR. NEFARIO
          It's horrible, isn't it?
         DESPICABLE ME 2           CINCO & KEN DRAFT    21.


                    GRU
          No! No! Oh, we're making great
          progress!
              (to the Minions)
          Here, try some of this.

He hands a jar to a minion, who tries it. He GAGS!   Another
minion tastes some and scrapes it off his tongue. They smash
the jar and all the minions run away, disgusted.

                    GRU (CONT'D)
          Whoa... okay, just because
          everybody hates it doesn't mean
          it's not good.

Dr. Nefario hangs his head.

                    DR. NEFARIO
          Listen, Gru. There's something
          I've been meaning to talk to you
          about for some time now.

                     GRU
          What?   What's wrong?

                    DR. NEFARIO
              (clears his throat)
          I miss being evil. Sinister plots,
          large-scale crimes...It's what I
          live for! I mean, don't you think
          there's more to our future than
          jelly?

                     GRU
          Well, I'm also considering a line
          of jams...

                     DR. NEFARIO
          Um...the thing is, Gru...
              (deep breath)
          I've had an offer of employment
          elsewhere.

                    GRU
          Dr. Nefario! Come on, you're
          kidding, right?

                    DR. NEFARIO
          It's a great opportunity for me,
          bigger lab, more evil, full
          dental...

Dr. Nefario presses a button and his stuff folds itself up
into a traveling suitcase.
          DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT     22.


Dr. Nefario hangs his head.    Gru stares back at his old
friend.

                     GRU
           Very well. Let us give you the
           proper send-off.
               (calls off screen)
           Minions!


INT: GRU'S LAB - LATER

Seven minions are lined up with seven fart guns. Dr. Nefario
sits in his scooter.

                     GRU
           The highest honor awarded. To Dr.
           Nefario for your years of service.
           The twenty-one fart gun salute!

FART!   FART!   FART!

Dr. Nefario COUGHS.     His eyes are watering (and not only from
the smell).

                     DR. NEFARIO
           Uh, I counted twenty-two.

Dave CHUCKLES, guilty.    Dr. Nefario fires up the scooter.

                     DR. NEFARIO (CONT'D)
           Farewell, my friends.

The minions CRY. Dr. Nefario pushes another button on the
scooter, transforming it into flying mode. He GUNS the
engine and it begins flying away. At the slowest pace
possible. Everyone just stands there awkwardly.

                     DR. NEFARIO (CONT'D)
           This may take a while. Go about
           your business.

Everyone walks off.

                     DR. NEFARIO (CONT'D)
           I miss you already!

Gru examines Lucy's business card.     Makes a decision.

The shadow of a mysterious figure approaches Gru's front
door.

EXT: GRU'S FOYER - NIGHT

A Minion wears a French Maid's outfit and SINGS as he vacuums
the floor. The doorbell rings.

The Minion opens the door to see who it is.

                    FRENCH MAID MINION
          Hello?

A shadow falls across the terrified minion as something
unseen abducts him.


EXT: GRU'S FOYER - LATER

The vacuum moves back and forth across the floor by itself.
Another Minion walks by wearing a different Maid outfit. He
doesn't see the other Minion and closes the door.

Then he opens it again, cleans the doorknob, and closes it.


INT: FAMILY ROOM - DAY

It's morning at Gru's house. Margo and Agnes sit on the
couch with a LAPTOP. Edith leans over the top of the couch,
looking on.

          Yes, it's for his own good.

On the screen is a DATING WEBSITE (CREATE-A-DATE.NET)--the
girls are creating a profile for Gru.

                    MARGO (CONT'D)
          Okay, we need to choose a picture.

Margo clicks through pictures of Gru.    Each one is worse than
the last.

          No.

CLICK.

CLICK. The next picture is of Gru in a bathing suit.   The
girls react in horror.

                       GIRLS
          Aaaaaah!!!

Margo covers Agnes's eyes.

                    AGNES
          What is that?!

Gru enters the family room.

                    GRU
          Good morning, girls! I have an
          announcement to make.

                    MARGO
          Hey, what celebrity do you look
          like?

                    GRU
          Ummm...Bruce Willis.

The girls stare at him blankly.

                       MARGO
          Mmmm...no.

                    EDITH
          Ooh, Gollum!

The girls LAUGH.

                    GRU
          Okay, what are you doing?

                    AGNES
          We're signing you up for online

Gru grabs the laptop away from the girls.

                    MARGO
          And it's time for you to get out
          there.

                       GRU
          No! Stop!      No one is ever getting
          out there!     Ever!

Gru hands a Minion the laptop, accidentally hitting him in
the face.

                    GRU (CONT'D)
          Okay, now for the announcement:    I
          have accepted a new job.

                    MARGO
          Whoa--really?

                    GRU
          Yes, I have been recruited by a top
          secret agency to go undercover and
          save the world!

                    EDITH
          You're gonna be a spy?!

                    GRU
          That's right, baby! Gru's back in
          the game! With gadgets and weapons
          and cool cars...the whole deal.

                       EDITH
          Awesome!

Agnes looks up at him in awe.

                    AGNES
          Are you really gonna save the
          world?

Gru looks at Agnes.

                     GRU
          Yes.   Yes I am.

He coolly puts on a pair of sunglasses.

We pan to Dave mimicking Gru with a pair of sunglasses.

EXT: MALL - DAY

Establishing.


INT: MALL - SAME

Gru comes down the escalator wearing the sunglasses, with the
three disguised Minions behind him. Stuart gets his dress
caught in the escalator. It comes off and he hides in a
nearby potted plant.

Gru glances at a store called the "EAGLE HAIR CLUB." He then
arrives at a charming, pink CUPCAKE STORE. The sign reads,
"BAKE MY DAY" Gru frowns and takes off his sunglasses.

                       GRU
          Hm.     "Bake My Day."   Blech.


INT: BAKE MY DAY - CONTINUOUS

Gru unlocks the door and enters. JINGLE! BELLS on the door
ring. The inside is sugary and clean and quaint. Gru takes
it all in. Then turns to the minions.

                    GRU
          Alright, here is the cupcake recipe
          I got off the internet.

The minions excitedly grab the recipe and head for the
kitchen. Gru kicks Stuart, who is still staggering around in
the potted plant.

                     GRU (CONT'D)
          And don't go nuts with the
          sprinkles!

Gru is left alone. He looks around. Sees a BUNNY CUPCAKE in
a glass cake dish. Then a SHARK CUPCAKE in the next cake
dish. And in the next dish he sees Lucy's head. She makes a
funny face.
         DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT     27.


Gru SCREAMS, which causes Lucy to SCREAM and jump up, hitting
her head on one of the shelves, sending all of the CUPCAKES
flying.

Lucy immediately goes into action, using incredible and
frankly weird-looking MARTIAL ARTS MOVES to dispatch the
cupcakes as they fly toward her.

                       LUCY
          Ha! Yaa!      Ho! Ooof!   Zaaa!   Ay-ay-
          ay-ay-ay!

She successfully eliminates all of the cupcakes, then turns
to Gru, out of breath.

                     LUCY (CONT'D)
          Whoo. Wasn't expecting that.
              (strikes a martial arts
               pose)
          Or was I?

Gru has a cupcake stuck to the top of his head, frosting side
down. Lucy gestures as if he's got a little food on his
face.

                    LUCY (CONT'D)
          Ooh... you got... You got... a
          little...

The cupcake slowly slides down, then falls to the floor.    It
leaves a long smear on Gru's face.

                    LUCY (CONT'D)
          Here, I'll-- I'll get it.

Gru stands frozen as she tries to clean him up.

                    LUCY (CONT'D)
          Oh, that's just spreading...um...

                    GRU
          Alright, alright.    I got it.    I got
          it!... Stop it!

Lucy backs off.

                       LUCY
          Oh!     I'll let you get it.

Gru SIGHS and wipes the frosting off his face.

          Yeah, what you just saw there was a
          little something new I've been
          working on. It's a combination of
          Jujitsu, Krav Maga, Aztec warfare,
          and krumping.

                    GRU
          Okay, that's weird--why are you
          here?

                    LUCY
          On assignment from Silas.   I'm your
          new partner. Yay!

                    GRU
          What?! No, no "yay." Ramsbottom
          didn't say anything about a
          partner.

                     LUCY
          Well, seems that because of your
          checkered past, everyone else
          refused to work with you. But not
          me. I stepped up. And I'm new, so
          I kind of have to do what they tell
          me anyway.

Gru is about to respond when Dave the minion comes out the
kitchen door. He carries a cupcake in the shape of a Minion.

                    DAVE
          Walla!

Immediately Lucy moves with lightning-quick reflexes. She
smashes his cupcake, flips him into the air, and pins him to
the counter. Dave SCREAMS.

                    LUCY
          You know this guy?

                    GRU
          Yes, he's one of my minions.

                    LUCY
          Oh, I'm sorry. I should have
          known.

She releases him.

Dave goes back into the kitchen, never taking his eyes off of
Lucy.

Kinney shoves the teddy bear's butt onto a sharp metal tube.

          villain named El Macho. From about
          twenty years ago.


EXT: DESERT - DAY - FLASHBACK

Classic Spaghetti western sepia-toned shot of El Macho
looking menacing. He looks like the large Hispanic man from
the mall, only younger and wearing a Lucha Libre outfit and
mask (a mask which looks similar to the one Gru imagined).

El Macho pushes the BARKEEP out of the way and grabs a large
bottle from behind the bar.

                    GRU (V.O.)
          He was ruthless. He was dangerous.
          And as the name implies, very
          macho.

El Macho pours himself a shot and then smashes the bottle
over his own head.

He reaches down and pulls up a rattlesnake from below the
bar. He squeezes its head, squirting venom into the shot
glass. He drinks it down and then eats the glass.

He sticks the snake's fangs into a few dollars that he leaves
on the bar, before breaking through the wall behind him,
leaving an EL Macho-shaped hole.


EXT: STREET - DAY - FLASHBACK

El Macho head butts an armored truck and approaches the
passenger side window.

                    GRU (V.O.)
          He had a reputation for pulling off
          heists using only his bare hands.

When the ARMED GUARDS look over he punches through the bullet-
proof glass, knocking them both out of the truck. Then he
lifts the truck onto his back and runs down the street with
it.

                    GRU (V.O.)
          Ah, but sadly, like all the greats,
          El Macho was gone too soon.

EXT: SKY - DAY - PAST

A bird, flying in the air, is suddenly struck by an airplane.

                    GRU (V.O.)
          He died in the most macho way
          possible.

El Macho leaps out of the plane riding a SHARK, a ton of
DYNAMITE strapped to him. He plummets toward the mouth of an
ACTIVE VOLCANO.

                    GRU (V.O.)
          Riding a shark with 250 pounds of
          dynamite strapped to his chest into
          the mouth of an active volcano.

He pulls two grenades from behind his back, yanks the pins,
and holds onto them as he plunges into the volcano.

There is a MASSIVE EXPLOSION.

                    GRU (V.O.)
          It was glorious.

Lucy stares at Gru, confused.

                    LUCY
          Yeah, sounds like El Macho's pretty
          dead...

                     GRU
          They never found the body. Oh no.
          All that was ever retrieved was a
          pile of singed chest hair.
              (beat)
          But... that face. It has got to be
          El Macho.

Lucy gets an excited look on her face.

                    LUCY
          Then what do you say you and I
          break into his restaurant?
          Tonight.

          Yes, that's good, because I'm
          telling you--if anybody in this
          place has the PX-41 serum...

Gru looks out the window and points at Eduardo riding up on
the escalator, scratching his butt.

                    GRU (CONT'D)
          ...it's him.

Gru enters and pushes the girls into their beds like a tour
guide anxious to finish a tour.

          Alright, alright, homework done,

                    GRU
          I just... I have a lot of work to
          do.

                    EDITH
          Work, what kind of work?

                    GRU

Gru turns to leave, but Agnes is standing at the doorway.

          But you said you'd help me
          practice my part for the Mother's

             Wow! That was...something else. I
             really liked the way you smiled at
             the end. Let's try this one more
             time, but a teensy bit less like a
             zombie, okay?

                       AGNES
             Okay.

As he heads for the door--

                       AGNES
             I don't think I should do this.

This stops Gru.

                       GRU
             Well, what do you mean?    Why not?

Ouch.   But Gru tries not to let this affect him.

Agnes smiles.

She gives him a kiss and runs off.   Gru watches her go, deep
in thought.


INT: REC ROOM - NIGHT

TWO MINIONS raise their ice cream sundaes and clink them
together!

          Hey!

Pull back to reveal many minions singing and dancing.

We move through the crowd, passing by the mace-wielding
minion with his helmet still backwards and a smaller server
minion with a tray of ice cream sundaes in mugs.

We cut up to the rafters, where more minions are dancing and
singing in formation, jumping and hopping all over the place
in elaborate dance routines.

Back on the floor, three arm-in-arm minions take the chorus.
One of them clearly having had one too many sundaes is being
held up by the other two.

Another minion tries to carry empty mugs down a spiral
staircase, but he's knocked off by a bunch of minions running
up the other way.

Several minions sit around a communal bowl of ice cream,
lazily sipping at it through long straws.

Gru enters and takes it all in.

Other minions raid an ice cream cart, hanging from the
canopy, drinking directly from the spouts.

Dave downs a jar of maraschino cherries and sprays whip cream
into his mouth before running after them, with a toothpick
umbrella in his mouth for good measure.

                      GRU (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Come on!

Once they are gone, the Minions go back to singing and
laughing.

Kevin and Jerry step out into the yard and look around
nervously, armed only with the golf club and tee.

They walk over to the garbage cans. The cans begins to
rattle. Kevin and Jerry SCREAM as a CAT pops up from one of
the cans. The cat MEOWS.

Kevin LAUGHS at him and imitates Jerry's scared face.

                       KEVIN
          Looka too!

Jerry slaps him.    Kevin slaps him back.   They start to slap
fight until--

A SPOTLIGHT comes down from above, lighting up the terrified
minions. Before they can scream...

WOOSH! Jerry is sucked up into the air as if being abducted
by aliens. Kevin grabs onto a flower, and then the cat to
try and anchor himself down, but they both fly up into the
air.

The light goes out. A few seconds later the light comes back
on and drops the cat back down. It turns off again and the
Minions are gone.

          Oh. There's a chicken. Are you
          lost little guy? You must be lost!

                     GRU

Suddenly, the chicken leaps into the air and lands on Gru,
pecking his bald head.

                    GRU (CONT'D)
          Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaiiiigh!

Gru runs in circles, trying to get the chicken off.

          Get it off of me! Get it off of
          me! Get it off of me!

Gru SCREAMS as the chicken goes up his shirt and bursts out
of his sweater through the chest, "Alien"-style. He grabs
it.

                       GRU (CONT'D)
          I got you!

It pecks him on the head, escapes, and continues to attack
him.

Lucy thinks fast and grabs a tablecloth from a table.      She
lunges and covers the chicken with the table cloth.

                       LUCY
          I got it!     Ha!

She tightens the tablecloth around Gru's neck, trapping the
chicken and Gru's head inside. A muffled scream comes from
under the table cloth and Lucy realizes what she's done. Gru
runs around trying to get the tablecloth off his head.

Lucy does a karate flip/body slam on Gru and the chicken.
She removes the table cloth. Gru's head has been replaced by
the chicken!

          Oh!

The chicken regroups, CLUCKS, and attacks.

Lucy acts fast and presses a button on her watch, squirting
FOAM onto the chicken.

FSSSSSSHT!   The foam instantly hardens into a glass ball
around the chicken. Only its head sticks out. It wobbles
back and forth like a Weeble. Lucy turns to Gru.

                    LUCY
          Gru, call one of your munchkins!

Gru produces a communicator and calls into it.

                    GRU
          We've been spotted!    Come get us!


INT: LUCY'S CAR - SAME

One minion sits on the hood of the car.   The other leans
against a tire, toothpick in his mouth.

                       DAVE
          Huh?
                 (to the other minion)
          Hey!     Loo-koo-meow-plah!

INT: MALL - SAME

SMASH! The car crashes through the glass doors and speeds
through the mall. They crash into a bunch of cleaning
supplies being pushed by a janitor.

Gru and Lucy watch them from the balcony above.

                     LUCY
          Hm.   Subtle.

They both run over to meet the car at the escalators.

The car heads for the escalators. As they reach the bottom,
Gru and Lucy realize the minions are about to go up the other
one!

                    GRU
          Over here, over here!    Over...
          here.

Too late. The minions shake as they go up the bumpy stairs.
Once they reach the top they take a left and start driving in
circles around the balcony. Gru pulls out a grappling hook
and aims for the balcony railing.

                    GRU (CONT'D)
              (grabbing Lucy)
          Hold tight!

They shoot up and land right back where they started - at
Salsa & Salsa! The minions zoom by in the car and Gru SIGHS
in exasperation.

Just then, Eduardo emerges from the restaurant with fire in
his eyes and a knife in his hand. Eduardo produces many more
KNIVES and heads straight for them.

                    EDUARDO
          I have you now!

BAM! Eduardo is struck unconscious by Lucy's car.       Just in
time.

Lucy opens the car door. One of the minions holds a
toothpick in his hand and leans on the steering wheel,
seductively.

                    DAVE
          Rawr, rawr!

The other minion revs the engine suggestively.

Eduardo starts to wake up.    The car zooms past him.

EXT: MALL DOME - SAME

CRASH! Lucy's car plummets towards the ground. Gru SCREAMS
hysterically, but Lucy just hits a button and the car
TRANSFORMS into a jet.

They fly off into the night sky.


EXT: GRU'S NEIGHBORHOOD - MORNING

It's a beautiful morning. An ICE CREAM TRUCK makes its way
down the street (playing the song the minions were singing
earlier). It stops and a couple of CHILDREN run to meet it.

Stuart opens Gru's front door, having heard the commotion.
Two other minions approach as well. Stuart spots the ice
cream truck and points to it, excited.

                      STUART
          Oh!   Oh!   Gelato!

And then suddenly a MOB OF MINIONS appears running for the
ice cream truck alongside the group of children. The minions
shove the children aside and clamor around the truck holding
out their money.

                       MINIONS
          Gelato!     Gelato! Gelato!

Stuart pushes himself to the top of the unruly pack and tries
to maintain order.

                      STUART
          Stopa!    Stopa!!

A hush comes over the minions.

                    STUART (CONT'D)
              (knocking on the truck)
          Hey-ho! Gelato!

Suddenly the ice cream cone on top of the truck transforms
into a LARGE TUBE and extends itself above the minions.
Stuart offers the tube a wad of cash and attempts to order
gelato, but the it begins SUCKING the minions into it. ZUP!
ZUP! ZUP!

One by one the minions (dozens of them, including the minion
with his head still trapped in the jelly jar) are sucked into
the truck until there is only one left. He tries to make a
break for it, but the truck lowers a popsicle in front of
him.

He licks it, his tongue sticks, and he is yanked back into
the ice cream cone. The it closes and the truck drives away.

The children look on puzzled.


EXT: PARADISE MALL - DAY

The hole that Lucy's car crashed through last night has been
patched with plywood boards.


INT: PARADISE MALL - DAY

PULL BACK TO REVEAL that Gru is inside a GARBAGE CAN
DISGUISE. Next to him is Lucy, also in a GARBAGE CAN
DISGUISE, using binoculars.

                    LUCY (O.S.)
          All right, there he is.   Suspect
          #8: Floyd Eaglesan.

BINOCULARS POV

Floyd Eaglesan attempts to entice a customer to visit his
business, Eagle Hair Club.

                         GRU
          Oh.    Okay.

                    LUCY
          See if you can get closer.
          Go...go.

Gru quickly stands up, revealing his legs, and takes several
steps toward Eagle Hair Club. Floyd looks over his shoulder,
and Gru stops. Floyd enters Eagle Hair Club and Gru inches
closer.

                    GRU
          Alright, what do--

BINOCULARS POV

Suddenly a MAN approaches the trash can with a steaming cup
of coffee. The binoculars readout says "WARNING! EXTREMELY
HOT."

                    GRU (CONT'D)
              (to himself)
          Oh no. That's not good.

The man goes to throw the coffee in the trash and we see
Gru's legs pop out from beneath the can.
         DESPICABLE ME 2            CINCO & KEN DRAFT      48.


The man looks confused and tries again.     Gru dodges and takes
off running. The man chases after him.

Gru accidentally knocks into a bent-over woman's rear end.
Insulted, she turns around, sees the man with the coffee, and
slaps him across the face. Unfortunately, Gru doesn't see
the escalator ahead and goes tumbling down the moving stairs.

CRASH! BANG! CLANG! Finally, Gru pops out of the trash can
and lands at the bottom of the escalator with a THUD! Flat
on his face, he hears a familiar voice call out.

                     AGNES (O.S.)
          Hey Gru!

Gru looks up and sees Margo, Edith and Agnes.

                   GRU
          Oh! Girls! What are you doing
          here?

                    MARGO
          Well, we thought we'd come visit
          you at work.
              (looks at Gru and the
               trash can)
          So, you're saving the world in a
          garbage can?

                    GRU
              (sarcastically)
          Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha...funny.

Lucy arrives on the scene, joining them.

                    LUCY
          Hey, there you are.   Oh, who's
          this?

                    GRU
          Lucy, these are my girls, Margo,
          Edith and Agnes. Girls, Lucy.
          Lucy, girls.

Agnes gazes lovingly at Lucy.   A magical glow appears around
Lucy, who smiles back.

             Are you single?

                        LUCY
             Oh!   Goodness...

Gru, immediately uncomfortable, claps his hands together.

                       GRU
             Oh! Hey! I have an idea! Since
             Lucy and I have lots of work to do,
             why don't you girls go and explore
             the mall!

Gru quickly shuffles the girls away from Lucy, trying to get
out of the uncomfortable situation. Gru pulls out his
wallet.

                       GRU (CONT'D)
             Here is some money. Go buy some
             useless mall junk! Some headbands,
             and--

                       AGNES
             Are you gonna marry Lucy?

             Are you out of your gourd?    No!
             She just works with me.

                       GRU
             Okay, stop! That is a song of

                 (points to mall)
             Now go have fun!

Gru SIGHS.    The girls run off, but quickly return to hug Gru.

                       AGNES
             Almost forgot! Hugs!

                       MARGO

Lucy watches the group hug.      Smiles.   Gru heads back over to
Lucy, embarrassed by Agnes.

                    GRU
          Ha, ha, ha! Kids...right?
          They're...funny.

                    LUCY

          Huh.

          I am pretty fun.


INT: SHOPPING MALL - DAY

The girls are at the MALL FOUNTAIN. Agnes has her eyes
closed and a very intense look on her face, as if she's
really concentrating on something. There is something in her
tightly clenched fist. She tosses a PENNY. Then opens her
eyes, waiting for her wish to come true.

Then Edith emerges from the water wearing a DIVING MASK AND
SNORKEL, hands full of COINS.

                    AGNES
          Is that stealing?

                    EDITH
          Not if my wish was that I would get
          a lot of free coins.

Margo is busy texting.       Then something offscreen catches her
eye.

It's a boy. This is ANTONIO. Suave, cool, and a bit
dangerous. We watch in SLOW MOTION as he strolls behind the
fountain, and then disappears in its spraying water.

Margo looks for Antonio.       Backs into the fountain and nearly
falls into it.

                       MARGO
          Whoa!

Antonio catches her.

                    ANTONIO

          Uh, sure.    I'm...Margo.

They begin walking away together, then Margo is reminded of
her sisters when Edith loudly clears her throat.

          Um...I'll catch up with you guys

She turns and runs after Antonio.

Agnes grabs Edith and shakes her.

              (chuckles)
          Welcome to Eagle Hair Club.

At the reception desk, a large chair shaped like an eagle
spins around. Sitting in the chair is Floyd, looking
sinister and petting a FURRY OBJECT that looks like a cat.

The music continues and Eduardo dances across the floor and
out into the mall where he grabs a passing SHOPPER and pulls
her into the restaurant.

The confused woman holds on for the ride    as Eduardo twirls
and dances her all around the floor. He     dips her and she

pose.

a big warm hug.

                    EDUARDO
          So good to see you again, mi
          compadre!

Gru tries to get out of the hug as quickly as he can.

                    ANTONIO
          Oh, I see you have already met my
          father.

                    GRU
          What the-- Father?!

                    EDUARDO
          Si! Look at this crazy small world
          we live in, eh? Come, sit, let me
          get you something.

Gru looks down and sees Eduardo's chicken glaring at him.    It
SQUAWKS. It's unsettling.

                    GRU
          Oh... look at you.

Eduardo scoops the chicken up.

                    GRU (CONT'D)
              (nervous)
          Haha. He likes me!

Gru tries to pet the chicken but Pollito lunges at him.

                    EDUARDO
          Oh, oh, I'm sorry, Pollito is
          usually very friendly.
              (cradling Pollito)
          He had a rough night.

The chicken stares relentlessly.   Gru CHUCKLES nervously.

                    GRU
          Well, we really should be going.
          Girls, come on.

Gru tries to gather the girls, but Eduardo stops him, pushing
Antonio and Margo closer together.

                    EDUARDO
          That is a pity. Young love is
          beautiful, no?

                    GRU
          No!
              (chuckling nervously)
          You know, they're not in love.
          They hardly know each other!

Eduardo suddenly lights up, having an idea.

                    EDUARDO
          You are right, Cabeza de Huevo!
          They must get to know each other
          better. Antonio, why don't you
          invite your girlfriend and her
          family to our Cinco de Mayo party?

                    GRU
          No, no, I am--

                    GIRLS
          Si!

The girls are all thrilled at this, as is Antonio. As if on
cue, MUSIC begins playing and they all begin dancing
together.

Antonio takes Margo's hand and twirls her across the floor.
Gru stares at Antonio with a look that could kill. A waiter
comes by to give Gru a party drink, and he promptly crushes
the glass with his bare hands. His eye twitches.

INT: AVL HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

Gru and Lucy sit across from Silas at headquarters.

                    SILAS
          I'm sorry, El Macho? Hadn't we
          eliminated him as a suspect? After
          the whole salsa incident?

                    GRU
          Yes, but there has been a new
          development, and I'm telling you,
          this is the guy. You need to
          arrest him immediately. And his
          deviously charming son. I'm pretty
          sure that the son is involved, too.
          The son also. You've got to get
          the son.

Gru approaches Silas.

                    GRU (CONT'D)
              (whispers)
          I think that the son is the
          mastermind. There's a look.
          There's a devilish look in his eyes
          and I don't like it!

                    SILAS
          Yes, but I don't really see any
          evidence for--

                    GRU
          Evidence schmevidence! I go with
          my gut, and my gut tells me that
          this guy is El Macho! Lock him up!
          Lock up the son. Don't forget
          about the son. The kid gives me
          the creeps!

Silas takes a deep breath and rubs his temples.

                    SILAS
          Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear...

Lucy jumps in, trying to save the situation.

                    LUCY

                    LUCY
          Yeah, and you know who made that
          happen? Huh?
              (points to Gru)
          This guy. Nailed it. Amazing,
          right?

                    GRU
          No. I mean, sure, but it's not
          him. It is...
              (whispers)
          ...El Macho.

                       SILAS
          Mr. Gru.     Please--

                     GRU
          No.   It is him!   And I will prove
          it!

And Gru storms out.

                    LUCY
              (calls after him)
          Gru, c'mon!

Once he's gone, Silas gives Lucy a look.

                    LUCY (CONT'D)
              (laughs nervously)
          He really thinks it's El Macho.
          Can you tell?

Silas is not amused.


EXT: BEACH - DAY

The minion with the popsicle stuck to his tongue wakes up on
a beach, disoriented. He slowly sits up--

--and sees hundreds of minions partying!

This is where all the abducted minions were taken!

There are minions sitting at a Tiki bar, being tended by a
bartender minion...

...The French maid minion and a ukelele-playing minion are
dancing in the sand. They wave at him...

Meanwhile, Jerry approaches the popsicle minion with two
bananas. He gives him one, does a Hawaiian dance with the
other, then runs off for the water. Popsicle minion tears
off his overalls and follows suit.

                        POPSICLE MINION
             Koonga!

The Popsicle Minion, now nude, runs across the sand and jumps
into a clear, blue ocean. We pull back to reveal that
unbeknownst to any of the minions, this is all happening
inside a large terrarium, and they are being watched by a
mysterious figure in silhouette.


INT: FAMILY ROOM - DAY

Gru sits with his laptop. He's on the eVillain site. He
clicks through various images of El Macho. Edith chases
Kevin, who has the wig in his mouth. A minion sets a stack
of magazines on the coffee table.

Then "YOU ARE NO LONGER CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET" appears on
Gru's screen. He grimaces and calls out.

                       GRU
             Kevin, the wi-fi's out!     Kevin?

He looks to the minion at the coffee table.

                       GRU (CONT'D)
             Hey, Lance! Where the heck is
             Kevin?

The minion just shrugs and walks away.

                       GRU (CONT'D)
             Alright, we need to revisit the
             number of vacation days you guys

             Gru!   It's Jillian!

Gru pretends to shoot himself.

Jillian and her artificially beautiful friend SHANNON stand
outside on Gru's porch. Shannon texts on her phone, looking
bored.

                    JILLIAN
          I have my friend Shannon here with
          me! I was thinking you two could
          get some grub, you know, tear it

                    JILLIAN (O.S.)
          Uhh, open up!

He sees Agnes walking by, singing softly and playing with her
unicorn. He whisper-shouts to her.

                    GRU
          Agnes! Agnes!     Tell Jillian I'm
          not here!

Agnes turns to the door.

                    AGNES
          Gru's not here!

                    JILLIAN
          Are you sure?

                     AGNES
          Yes!   He just told me!

Gru, panicking, shakes his head and wags his fingers.

                    AGNES (CONT'D)
          I mean no, he didn't just tell me!

              (laughs)
          Agnes--where is Gru?

Gru makes the "zip your lips" gesture.

          He's putting on lipstick!

Gru waves his arms.

          He's...chopping his head off!

Gru clenches his fists and grunts in frustration.

                    AGNES (CONT'D)
          He's...pooping?

Outside, Jillian and Shannon look confused.

                    JILLIAN (O.S.)
          I know you're in there, Gru!
          There's no way you're getting out

Kyle enters the room, carrying the bag with the wig in his
mouth.


EXT: RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Establishing.


INT: RESTAURANT - SAME

Shannon sits at a table talking to Gru, who's offscreen.    A
waiter drops off a plate of spaghetti.

                    SHANNON
          I have to tell you, I was so
          nervous about tonight. I mean
          there's just so many phonies out
          there!

from Floyd. And looking extremely uncomfortable.

          Physical fitness is very important
          to Shannon. As you can tell,
          right? Huh?

Shannon drops to the floor and starts doing push-ups.

                     GRU
          Ah.   I can tell.

                    SHANNON
              (mid-push-up)
          Solid.

She switches to one-armed push-ups.

                    GRU
          We are in a restaurant, you know.

Gru looks even more uncomfortable.

Just then Lucy (unseen by Gru) enters the restaurant.     She
approaches the HOSTESS.

                     LUCY
          Hi.   Takeout for Lucy?

                    HOSTESS
          Sure, just a sec.

The Hostess leaves. Lucy looks around and then spots Gru.
Sees him with the wig and Shannon who is now doing crunches
on the floor. Lucy narrows her eyes, then has an idea. She
presses a button on her watch, which transforms into a HIGH
TECH EAVESDROPPING DEVICE, and puts it in her ear. Now she's
able to hear Gru and Shannon talking. She watches them,
intrigued. Shannon has returned to her seat.

                    SHANNON
          Your accent is so exotic.

                   GRU
          Ah. Well, thank you very much.      I
          was--

          I know someone who can fix that for
          you. And you'll be talking normal
          in no time.

Gru is starting to sweat.

                   GRU
          Hahaha. Hoooo. Is it hot in here?

          Wait a minute. Wait a minute.      Are
          you wearing a wig?

              (really sweating it)
          What? Ah!
              (readjusts the wig)
          I don't think so.

                       SHANNON
          I knew it.     You're a phony.   I hate
          phonies.

                    GRU
          Oh. What? No.      These locks are
          all mine...

                    SHANNON
          No they're not! You know what I'm
          gonna do? I'm gonna rip that thing
          off your head and show everyone
          what a bald-headed phony you are.

                    LUCY
          I don't think so, Miss Lady.

Lucy presses a button on her watch and a target sight pops
out.

Gru watches in horror as Shannon reaches across the table for
the wig.

Quickly Lucy presses another button on her watch which fires
a MINI-DART GUN at Shannon.

PLIP. The mini-dart goes into Shannon's butt, knocking her
out instantly. And saving Gru from certain humiliation. Gru
stares at the now sleeping Shannon, confused.

                    GRU
          Hello... Hello, are you...?

                       LUCY (O.S.)

          Wow, looks like your date's out for
          the count. It's like she's been

              (winks)
          Yeah, I'm winking `cuz that's what

EXT: RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Gru and Lucy carry an unconscious Shannon out of the
restaurant. Her head gets stuck in the swinging doors on the
way out. They try to dislodge her and accidentally end up
throwing her headfirst into a lamp post. They pick her up
between them, Weekend at Bernie's-style. They wave to a
passing COP. The cop tips his hat.


EXT: SUBURBAN STREET - LATER

Gru and Lucy get in her car. But it's cramped with Shannon
in there too. She doesn't really fit.

has been strapped to the roof like a deer.

Gru and Lucy arrive at Shannon's house. Lucy comes to an
abrupt stop and Shannon flies off the roof and slams into the

Gru and Lucy sit on the front steps of Shannon's house.

                    LUCY
          Well, I think you did it. You just
          officially had the worst date ever.

          High-five!

Then a POLICEMAN, with whom he exchanges mimed gunfire.

Then a NUN, with whom he bumps rumps.

                       GRU (CONT'D)
          Bump it.

Seeing something offscreen, Gru GASPS.

--he stops traffic so a happy family of DUCKS can cross the
street.

--he plays ultimate frisbee with a bunch of COLLEGE KIDS,
balancing the spinning disc on his pointy nose.

--he joins a group of OLD LADIES doing Tai Chi.

--he "air" drums with a couple of BUCKET DRUMMERS on the
curb.

--he picks a flower, then walks by a MAN and a WOMAN sitting
alone with their backs to each other at a cafe. He quickly
turns their chairs around so they find each other and hands
the man the flower for the woman. They smile and Gru goes
his merry way.


INT: SHOPPING MALL - DAY

Gru continues happily dancing through the mall on his way to
the cupcake shop. He shimmies with a FAT WOMAN on the
escalator, then GAPS and stops suddenly upon seeing Eagle
Hair Club closed. The MUSIC abruptly ends.

Gru sees Silas speaking with an AVL AGENT.    Gru approaches
him.

                    GRU
              (confused)
          Mr. Ramsbottom?

                       SILAS
          Oh, hello.

                    GRU
          What are you doing here?

                    SILAS
          We got him.

                     GRU
          Got who?

                    SILAS
          Floyd Eaglesan! Our agents located
          a secret room in his shop last
          night, and uh, discovered this!

He snaps his fingers and an AVL agent hands him a METAL
CANISTER in a ziploc bag. Silas holds it up.

                    SILAS (CONT'D)
          It's empty, but we found traces of
          the PX-41 serum in it. He's our
          man. So somehow, in spite of your
          incompetence, we solved this one.

TWO AVL AGENTS carry Floyd away in handcuffs.

                    FLOYD
          I was framed! You won't get away
          with this! Get your mitts off of
          me! I am a legitimate businessman!

Gru turns back to Silas.    He is stunned by this.

                     GRU
          Ah.   Alright. So...what now?

                    SILAS
          Well, now you're free to go back to
          your "business." Mmmm. Jams and
          jellies. And it looks like Agent
          Wilde will be transferring to our
          Australian branch.

                    GRU
              (in shock)
          Australia...?

                     SILAS
          Yes. But thank you--for
          everything. And by everything of
          course I mean...nothing.

Silas walks away to join the AVL agents.   Gru stares blankly,
sadly. And then Lucy approaches him.

                       LUCY
          Hey there.

                       GRU
          Hey.

                    LUCY
          So...we got him.

          Yay.  That's great.
              (beat)
          And now you're going to Australia?

                     LUCY
          Well, it's not definite yet. Still
          figuring it out. Already been

                    LUCY
          Thanks. You too.
              (remembering)
          Oh. Here. I wanted to give you
          this.

She holds out her lipstick taser.

                    GRU
          Your lipstick taser?

                    LUCY
          Yeah, it's just a memento. Just,
          you know, from the first time we
          met.

                      GRU
          Oh.    Thank you, Lucy.

Gru accepts the lipstick taser.

Lucy ignores this and just waits, not wanting to leave.     She
and Gru stand there awkwardly.

                     GRU
          Well... it looks like they need
          you, so...

                    LUCY
          Yeah, I uh, I better go.    Bye, Gru.

And she leaves Gru.    He stands there.   Completely miserable.


EXT: STREET - DAY

Gru walks back home, completely depressed.

Walks past the college kids playing frisbee.      Catches the
frisbee and tosses it down the sewer.

Walks past the group of bucket drummers.    As he passes he
KICKS one of the buckets.

Walks past the old ladies doing Tai Chi. As they balance on
one leg he pushes them all and they all fall over.


EXT: GRU'S HOUSE - NIGHT

It's pouring rain.    Gru sits alone outside his house.
Miserable.

And then an UMBRELLA approaches him. It looks like it's
traveling on its own. But when it gets closer it lifts up,
revealing Agnes.

                    AGNES
          I brought you an umbrella.

Gru takes the umbrella and Agnes joins him.    They both huddle
under it.

                    GRU
          Ah, thank you.

                    AGNES
          What're you doing out here?

                    GRU
          Remember when you said that I liked
          Lucy? Well, it turns out...you're
          right.

                    GRU
          Yes, but...well, she's moving away.
              (sadly)
          I'm never going to see her again.

Agnes's face falls. All her hopes and dreams shattered.     But
she tries to encourage Gru.

                    AGNES
          Is there anything I can do to help?

                    GRU
          Oh, I don't--I don't think so,
          sweetheart.

                    AGNES
          Well, is there anything you could
          do?

Gru thinks.


INT: GRU'S OFFICE - DAY

Gru is on the PHONE.

                    GRU
          "Hello, Lucy. This is Gru. I know
          up to this point our relationship

          you're leaving for Australia and
          all, but..."
              (struggles to get it out)
          Okay, here is the question. "Would
          you like to--to go out on a date?"

PULL BACK TO REVEAL Dave the minion standing across from Gru,
pretending to be on a cell phone on the other end of the
line. And wearing a RED-HAIRED WIG. He shrugs.

                       DAVE
          Eh, no.

                    GRU
          Okay, that's not helping.

He hangs up.

                       GRU (CONT'D)
          All right.     Here we go.   For real

He stares at Lucy's card. Then turns to the phone. It's a
stand-off. He does stretches and calisthenics to psych
himself up. He SIGHS.

                    GRU (CONT'D)
          I can do this.

He stares down the phone again. It sits there, taunting him.
We cut back and forth between Gru and the phone, until
finally--

                      GRU (CONT'D)
          Agh!    I hate you!

He produces a FLAMETHROWER and burns up the phone.    Dave
dives out of the way.

                       GRU (CONT'D)
                 (satisfied)
          Ah.

RIIIIIING !!!    The FIRE ALARM goes off.

CHOP! Suddenly AXES chop through the wall. Several minions
in FIREMEN'S GEAR enter.  Another minion imitates a siren
through a bullhorn.

                      SIREN MINION
          Beedo!    Beedo! Beedo! Beedo!

One continues chopping everything in sight with his axe, then
chops his way right through the wall of the house and falls
outside. Another minion brings in a MASSIVE HOSE, turns it
on, and goes flying around the room as it whips around like a
snake. Dave tests out a fire extinguisher.

                      SIREN MINION (CONT'D)
          Beedo!    Beedo! Beedo! Beedo!

Gru takes away the bullhorn from the Siren minion.    But he
keeps on making the noise.

                      SIREN MINION (CONT'D)
          Beedo!    Beedo! Beedo!

Dave fires the extinguisher at the Siren minion. He makes
the noise again and Dave sprays him with the fire
extinguisher, sending him flying offscreen.

INT: MINION BEACH HABITAT - DAY

The minions enjoy another day at the beach. Kevin the Golf
minion drifts out in the water on an inner tube. He fixes
his coconut bra, then unpeels a banana and eats it.


INT: CONTROL ROOOM - SAME

A hand pulls a lever in a control room.


INT: MINION BEACH HABITAT - SAME

Suddenly a WHIRLPOOL appears in the water right next to him.
He gets sucked into it.

Kevin is pulled down to the bottom of the habitat and into a
TUBE.

Kevin pops out of the tube and lands in a waiting metallic
chair. His hat follows him down the tube and lands on his
head.

CLICK! A metal strap fastens around his waist.    He shrugs
and continues to eat the banana.

                     FRENCH MAID MINION (O.S.)
          Kevin?

Kevin looks over and sees the French Maid Minion strapped
into a chair nearby. He has a banana too.

                     KEVIN
          Tom?

They raise their bananas in the air.

                     KEVIN & FRENCH MAID MINION
          Bello!   Compai!

And then a GIANT DEVICE appears, looking like a huge, scary
HYPODERMIC NEEDLE filled with purple liquid. The needle
comes toward the French Maid Minion.

Kevin points and LAUGHS at him. He doesn't see the needle
come down behind him. It injects him with the serum as well.

EXT: EDUARDO'S HOUSE - DAY

Gru's vehicle makes its way up the winding road to Eduardo's
house.


INT: GRU'S VEHICLE - SAME

Gru drives the vehicle, looking deeply depressed. The girls
sit in the back, dressed up for the Cinco de Mayo party.

                    MARGO, EDITH & AGNES
          Cinco de May-yay-yo! Cinco de May-
          yay-yo! Cinco de May-yay-yo!

Gru's expression doesn't change.   They pull up to the front
gate.


EXT: EDUARDO'S HOUSE GATE - SAME

Gru's vehicle pulls up in front of the open gate in front of
Eduardo's house. His car almost knocks a bunch of parked
cars off the cliff.

The grounds are set up for the most elaborate and fun Cinco
de Mayo party of all time. Sumptuous spreads of MEXICAN FOOD
everywhere. LANTERNS hanging from trees. PEOPLE having a
great time.

Gru and the girls enter the compound.

                     EDITH
          Whoa!   This place is awesome!

                    GRU

          Margo--

As Gru turns to Margo he sees that she is holding hands with
Antonio, face-to-face, almost close enough to kiss.

                    ANTONIO
          Hello, Mr. Gru.

Gru furrows his brow.

                      GRU
          Aghhh!    Okay...

He grabs Antonio and drags him far away from Margo.

                       MARGO
          Gru!

EXT: EDUARDO'S HOUSE - LATER

Gru, sneaking through the party, spots Antonio and Margo
dancing.

Gru sneaks up on Antonio, using the flashing strobe lights to
cover his approach. Suddenly Antonio is gone and Gru is the
one dancing with Margo, who has her back to him and is
oblivious to what's going on.

Antonio reappears and kicks Gru in the crotch from behind.
He dances once again with Margo while Gru hunches over in
pain.

Gru then gets the upper hand and starts choking Antonio and
shaking him. Margo turns around and sees this.

Gru and Antonio see they are being watched by Margo and start
casually dancing next to each other as if nothing is wrong.

As the song ends, Margo takes Antonio's hand and pulls him
away from Gru off the dance floor.

Gru is defeated and all alone.


INT: EDUARDO'S HOUSE - LATER

Gru sits by himself in the corner, sulking and staring at
Lucy's lipstick taser. A WAITER walks by and places a
tortilla chip sombrero on his head with the rim filled with
guacamole. He breaks off a piece, dips it, and eats it.

                    EDUARDO (O.S.)
          So glad you could make it, mi

Gru looks up and sees Eduardo standing there.   Gru quickly
hides the taser.

          Oh, nothing. Nothing is wrong.
          I'm just chilling with the

          How did you know?

          Believe me, my friend, I too have
          spent many nights trying to drown
          my sorrows in guacamole.

          Yes. But we are survivors.
          There's much more to us than meets
          the eye. Enjoy the party.

Eduardo gives Gru a meaningful look. And then walks away.
Gru watches him go. Deep in thought.

Gru notices Eduardo suspiciously sneak away from the party
and head into the house.

Gru gets up from the table and follows Eduardo. As he walks
through the party, several partygoers break tortilla pieces
off his sombrero to eat.


INT: EDUARDO HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Eduardo enters a dimly-lit room. Gru sneaks behind and peers
through a crack in the door.


INT: SECRET MAYAN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Eduardo stands in the center of a secret room, which is lined
with Mayan-style totem poles. He dances on the tile floor,
which lights up and plays "La Cucaracha" with each strategic
step.

The musical pattern is a code which opens a secret passageway
through the largest totem's mouth. Eduardo enters and the
mouth closes behind him.

Gru tentatively enters the room. He pauses at the tile
floor. He tries to replicate Eduardo's "La Cucaracha" code,
but a glob of guacamole from his sombrero falls to the floor
and hits the wrong tile. This activates a booby-trapped
totem pole, which halves Gru's sombrero with a spear.

Gru observes the destroyed sombrero in his hands.

          Huh.

Gru attempts the code again, but missteps.    An axe from the
wall swings at him and misses.

                       GRU (CONT'D)
          Oooh!

Gru missteps again and one of the totems lights up and spits
fire at him, burning his face.

                     GRU (CONT'D)
              (dazed)
          Aaaahhh...

He missteps again and a club whacks him over the head.

                       GRU (CONT'D)
          Oh!

One of the totems shoots darts at him, piercing his nose.

              (in pain)
          Aaaahhh!

Gru falls to the floor.

                       GRU (CONT'D)
          Oooohhh.

His head hits the correct tile, and the Mayan passageway
opens. Gru walks to the door, pointing at the totems and
gloating.

She grabs an in flight magazine and opens it up to an ad for
wristwatches. It reads; "IN THE SKY, HE IS THE ONE MAN

Lucy reacts, shakes her head, and now the picture is just a

Lucy turns the page. It's another ad, saying simply "Gru

waterfall. She GASPS and slams the magazine shut, then
slowly reopens it to find the picture is really just a random
muscular guy diving. It says "GO NOW - TO HAWAII!"

                    FLIGHT ATTENDANT (O.S.)
          Would you like some peanuts or
          pretzels?

Lucy looks up from her magazine to see the flight attendant,
who looks like Gru. She REACTS. Then looks across the aisle
and sees a lady that looks and sounds like Gru, talking to
another man who looks like Gru.

                    FEMALE GRU PASSENGER
          Ha ha ha ha ha! That's a good
          joke.

Then Lucy looks behind her and sees the young mother looks
like Gru. The baby turns around and also looks like Gru.

                    GRU BABY
          I just did a boom boom.

The flight attendant tries to get Lucy's attention.

                    FLIGHT ATTENDANT
          I really need you to make a choice,
          hon.

Close on Lucy as she has a moment of epiphany.

                    LUCY
          I choose Gru.
              (to everyone)
          I CHOOSE GRU!

Lucy runs to the exit door and flings it open.   WOOSH!   Air
rushes throughout the cabin.

                    LUCY (CONT'D)
          Thank you, Gru stewardess!

The flight attendant stands up, recovering from her twirl.

                    FLIGHT ATTENDANT
          You're welcome!

The other passengers wave as the plane's oxygen masks fall
from each overhead console. And with that, Lucy jumps from
the plane, holding her purse.


EXT: SKY - DAY

As Lucy falls from the sky she presses a button on her purse
and it transforms into a hanglider. She flies off with
purpose.


INT: TUNNEL - DAY

Elevator doors open revealing EL MACHO'S UNDERGROUND LAIR.
Gru stands in the doorway, pulling the dart out of his nose.
The lair is a massive villainous complex that looks a lot
like hell. Gru takes the place in. It's awesome and
terrifying. The magnet ship is there!

                    EDUARDO (O.S.)
          You have not lost your touch, my
          friend.

Gru turns around and sees Eduardo dressed in El Macho's old
wrestling outfit, like we saw in the flashback.

                      GRU
          Ha ha!    I knew it!   You are El
          Macho!

                    EL MACHO
          That's right!

                    GRU
          Nobody believed me! Ho ho!     But I
          knew you weren't dead!

                     EL MACHO
              (laughing)
          Of course not. I merely faked my
          death, ha, ha!
              (beat)
          But now it's time for me to make a
          spectacular return to evil!
          Doctor, I think it's time we showed
          Gru what we're up to here.

Standing in the middle of the lair's walkway is the one, the
only...Dr. Nefario.

                    GRU
          Dr. Nefario?

                    DR. NEFARIO
          Nice to see you, Gru.

                    GRU
          Whaaat? This-- So, this is your
          new job opportunity?

                    DR. NEFARIO
          Absolutely. You're gonna like
          this.

Dr. Nefario pulls a lever. A platform rises with the Purple
Minion version of Kevin strapped to a chair on it.

                    EL MACHO
          Sorry--I had to borrow some of your
          minions, but it was for a worthy
          cause.

                     GRU
          Oh!   Kevin? Agh!

                    EL MACHO
          No, he's not Kevin anymore. Now he
          is an indestructible, mindless
          killing machine!

                    KEVIN
          Blah!

                    EL MACHO
          Just watch this!

He then presses a BUTTON.

--a machine gun lowers and the purple minion's RIDDLED with
BULLETS, but unhurt.
         DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT     83.


--a FLAMETHROWER shoots fire at the purple minion, but he's
completely unharmed.

--an axe is swung at him, but he just eats it.

--an atom bomb falls on him, but he just swallows it and it
explodes harmlessly in his belly.

--a POLICE CAR is dropped onto him, and he devours it whole.

Gru stares, stunned.

                    EL MACHO (CONT'D)
          And here's the best part! I've got
          an ARMY OF THEM!

The lights come on above El Macho, revealing hundreds of
caged PURPLE MINIONS.

Gru can't believe his eyes.    El Macho LAUGHS.

                     EL MACHO (CONT'D)
          Soon I will unleash them on the
          world--and if anyone, anyone,
          tries to stop them...YEOW! Their
          city gets eaten!
              (beat)
          We can do it together!

                       GRU
          Together?

                    EL MACHO
          Together! I have admired your work
          for years, amigo. Stealing the
          moon?! Are you kidding?! We would
          be unstoppable! Men like you, men
          like me, we should be ruling the
          world!
              (excitedly)
          So, are you in?

Dr. Nefario pops a celebratory noisemaker in the background.

                       DR. NEFARIO
          Woo-hoo!

El Macho eagerly awaits Gru's reply.   Gru just stares at him.
How does he get out of this?

                    GRU
          Uh...yeah...probably...

El Macho is taken aback.

                        EL MACHO
           Probably?

Gru realizes he's in danger and quickly tries to backpedal.

                     GRU
           I mean, yes! Yes. Of course, yes,
           I just have a lot going on right
           now...I just need to get some
           things off my plate before we start
           taking over the world, that's all.

                        EL MACHO
           `Scuse me?

                     GRU
           No--no, forget it! One hundred
           percent! I am in!
               (pretending to hear
                something)
           I think--what is--do you hear that--
           I do. That's Agnes calling me from
           on the surf--

Gru steps into the elevator and the door shuts. Then opens.
He's frantically trying to press the button that will return
him to the surface.

                     GRU (CONT'D)
           Totally in!

The doors close and Gru is gone.       El Macho stares, deep in
thought. Clearly suspicious.

                     EL MACHO
           You know what? I am not so
           convinced that he is in.

El Macho presses a button that releases the Purple Minion.

                        KEVIN
           Blah!



EXT: EL MACHO'S HOUSE - SAME

Edith knocks a piñata down with a BAT, then beats the crap
out of it.

          Ooof!

Edith takes off her blindfold.

                    EDITH
          Sorry.

                    GRU
          We need to go home now!    Where's
          Margo?

          But I didn't get a turn!


EXT: OTHER SIDE OF EL MACHO'S HOUSE - DAY

Margo sits at a table alone and depressed, wearing the chip
hat. She looks like she's been crying.

                    GRU
          Margo!

Gru approaches her with the other girls in tow.

                    GRU (CONT'D)
          Come on, we're leav--hey, what's
          wrong?

                    MARGO
          I hate boys.

Gru turns and sees Antonio dancing with a PRETTY GIRL.   Gru
frowns.

                    GRU
          Yes...they stink.   Sorry, honey,
          we've got to go.

He takes her hand and leads her offscreen before popping back
into frame and firing the freeze ray at Antonio. We see he
is now frozen in a block of ice.

SCREEECH! Gru's car pulls out of the driveway and speeds

Lucy looks around, but doesn't see Gru.   She maneuvers her
way through the crowd.

                    LUCY
          Oops, sorry!

She makes it through, but still no sign of Gru.

Suddenly Pollito appears and exchanges looks with Lucy. He
SCREECHES and flies towards her. She strikes a martial arts
pose ready to defend herself. As she does, her purse falls
to the ground.

The attack never comes and she looks down to see Pollito
pecking at her purse.

                     EL MACHO (O.S.)
          Pollito!   What's the matter?

El Macho appears and picks up the chicken, petting it.

                     LUCY
          Oh, hey!   Eduardo!

                    EL MACHO
          Lucia! I apologize. Pollito, he's
          usually not like this. The same
          thing happened the other day
          with... with Gru and...

El Macho drops off, deep in thought.   Connecting the dots.
Lucy is oblivious.

                    LUCY
          Oh, speaking of Gru...uh, have you
          seen him? I really need to talk to

                    EL MACHO
          Yes, I think he's somewhere around

                    LUCY
          Oh, I don't know. I mean close...
          I wouldn't say we were close. Why,

          It's more what he didn't say. For
          instance, he never mentioned...that
          you were both working for the Anti-
          Villain League!!!

Suddenly El Macho turns Pollito around revealing that he has
her AVL credentials in his beak. El Macho grabs Lucy.

                    EL MACHO (CONT'D)
              (threateningly)
          You're coming with me.

He leads her away.

                       LUCY
          Hey!

We see Dr. Nefario watching this, in shock.      He's holding a
drink and a Mexican flag cupcake.

          Crikey.


EXT: GRU'S HOUSE - DAY

The vehicle pulls into the driveway.


INT: GRU'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Gru walks the girls into the family room. Two minions sit in
front of the big screen TV playing a video game.

                    EDITH
          So Eduardo's actually El Macho?
          Cool!

                    GRU
          No, it is not cool. Plus, I pretty
          much knew it was him all along, so
          if anyone's cool, it's me.

The BIGSCREEN TV BEEPS. Gru and the others turn to look.
It's Dr. Nefario. He's at El Macho's, whispering and looking
anxiously around him from under a table.

                       DR. NEFARIO (ON SCREEN)
                 (whispering)

          El Macho's on to you. He knows
          you're working for the AVL. And
          he's got your partner!

Gru is confused.

                    GRU
          Lucy? Wha--that's impossible!
          She's on her way to Australia...

                     EL MACHO (O.S.)
          Nefario!

Dr. Nefario looks nervously offscreen.    El Macho's coming.

                    DR. NEFARIO (ON SCREEN)
          Sorry, gotta go!

Nefario disconnects the camera.   The screen goes blank.

Agnes GASPS and turns to Gru.

                    AGNES
          He's got Lucy?

                    GRU
              (determined)
          Not for long.

Gru begins to walk out of the room.    He turns to the minions.

                     GRU (CONT'D)
          Come on.
              (beat)
          We're getting her out of there.

Gru marches out of the room, fire in his eyes.    A man on a
mission. To save the woman he loves.

The minions are visibly disappointed to leave their video
game. One of them clutches the controller in his hand and
continues to play until the moment he exits the frame.

A playhouse in Gru's front yard drops away, revealing a hatch
in the ground. Out drives Gru. Two minions sit behind him
holding on.

He speeds down the road.    Ready to kick some butt.


EXT: EL MACHO'S COMPOUND - DAY

The yard is now filled with ROCKET SHIPS.

From behind, we watch El Macho emerge from his home to survey
the troops.

Some minions file into the rocket ships.    El Macho watches
them and LAUGHS maniacally.


EXT: GRU'S HOUSE - DAY

EVIL MINION POV: The evil minion Kevin runs down the street,
nearing Gru's house. He is scared by his own reflection in a
shiny parked car. He spots a tricycle and eats it.

Then Kyle spots him and GROWLS.

Kyle runs off and evil minion Kevin gives chase.   He stops
when he sees the front door.


INT: GRU'S HOUSE - DAY

Margo and Agnes sit on the floor playing a princess board
game. Next to Agnes is her unicorn.

They hear a SCRATCHING SOUND outside the window.   Agnes looks
scared.

                    AGNES
          What was that?

Margo stands up. Makes her way toward the window, which is
covered with drapes. Then reaches a nervous hand and pulls
back the drapes.

                    MARGO
          I don't see anything.

lands in the family room surrounded by shattered glass and
tangled up in the curtain. He turns to the girls, who slowly
back away. He looks at Agnes and ROARS.

                       MARGO (CONT'D)
          Run!

Margo grabs Agnes and they run out of the room, accidentally
dropping the stuffed unicorn behind.

Agnes stops and runs back for it.

          My unicorn!

                       MARGO

Agnes stops and sees evil minion Kevin already has it in his
mouth.

Agnes screams a crazy HIGH-PITCHED SCREAM. It SHATTERS all
the glass in the room, including the glass in evil minion
Kevin's goggles. He spits out the unicorn. He is slowed him
down for a bit, so Agnes safely grabs the unicorn, and Margo
grabs Agnes's hand.

They run for the elevator to the lower level, with the purple
minion hot on their tails.   The elevator drops just in time.
Evil minion Kevin slams into the glass door.

It drops down into the lab and lands on a dazed yellow

them.

Evil minion Kevin stomps toward the girls.    They are backed
into a corner. It's all over.

Then suddenly a HYPODERMIC NEEDLE enters frame and injects
evil minion Kevin. He falls over, writhing on the floor.
Then he sits up and--

Has turned back into a YELLOW MINION.    It's Kevin!

He walks over to a vat of the jelly.

Gru makes his way up the road leading to El Macho's house.
He is wearing handcuffs, and being led at spear-point by Dave

still have a few yellow spots.

The minions somber up.

                    MINIONS
          Okay, okay.

Gru covers a smeared yellow spot with purple paint.

They approach the front gate, which is closed. Dave boosts
himself onto a stray box and speaks gibberish into the
intercom. He hears Evil Minion gibberish in response. He
responds back in Evil Minion gibberish.

The intercom buzzes and the gate begins to open.

The gate opens and there are DOZENS of PURPLE MINIONS milling
about. They eye Gru and his captors suspiciously.

Dave and Stuart poke Gru with a spear.

                    GRU
              (attempting to act)
          Curses. Foiled again. These guys
          captured me.

The Evil Minions CHEER at seeing this.

Gru, Dave and Stuart have to walk all the way to the house
surrounded on all sides by evil purple minions. The painted
yellow minions are very nervous. The purple minions eye them
as they pass. They GROWL and the yellow minions attempt to
GROWL back.

It's extremely intense, but it looks like they're going to
make it.

Then one of the evil minions makes a slobbery raspberry at
one of the painted ones. They get into a raspberry fight
until the painted minion is grossed out and tries to rub the
slobber off him. It rubs off the purple paint.

One of the evil purple minions points and SCREAMS. They're
exposed! All of the purple minions run towards Gru, Dave and
Stuart. Teeth bared. Ready to chomp.

                       GRU (CONT'D)
          Run!

They take off running.

EXT: EL MACHO'S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

Gru and the yellow minions burst into El Macho's backyard.
The Evil Minions give chase.

                    GRU
          Up that tree! Hurry, hurry!

They climb a tree up to the roof of the house, only to be
pursued by more minions up there. And the Evil Minions have
devoured the tree so they can't go back that way either.

With no escape, Gru and the minions run up a tower until they
reach the top--a dead end.

Here come the purple minions. They're trapped. Gru kicks
them away and the yellow minions try to fight off the purple
ones. But they are clearly doomed.

And then Gru's ship appears hovering above them! Modified as
a jelly-dispensing weapon and with Dr. Nefario at the
controls! The minions hang on the sides holding JELLY
BLASTERS.

The ship opens fire on the evil minions, transforming them.
POP! POP! POP! POP! One by one they transform back into
yellow minions. One of the Minions wipes the horrible
tasting jelly off his tongue.

Dr. Nefario sticks his head out the side of the ship.

                    DR. NEFARIO
          Hello, Gru!

                      GRU
          Hey, hey!    Nice work, Dr. Nefario!

Gru leaps onto the ship.

                     DR. NEFARIO
          I put an antidote in the jelly.
              (beat)
          I mean, I'm happy to create an evil
          army to destroy the world, but
          nobody messes with my family.

                    GRU
          Thank you, Doctor!   Now let's go

Gru looks over to see Margo, Edith and Agnes onboard the
ship, holding jelly blasters.

                       AGNES
          Hi!

Gru is flabbergasted.    He turns to Nefario.

                    GRU
          You brought the girls?

                       DR. NEFARIO
          Yes!
                 (beat)
          Oh.     Was that wrong?

Gru's ship flies toward El Macho, blasting purple minions all
along the way.

From behind a large jelly gun Edith unloads round after
round.

                      EDITH
          Wooooo!    Yeeeaaahhh!

El Macho witnesses his evil minions being converted back to
regular ones.

                      EL MACHO
          Oh no! What's happening to my
          minions?
               (beat)
          Gru?

Gru turns to Nefario and the girls.

                     GRU
          You guys take care of the rest of
          the minions.
              (beat)
          I'm going to find Lucy.

Gru leaps out of the ship down to the roof El Macho is on.
He has two big jelly weapons in his hands.

Meanwhile the ship flies off with its jelly blasters firing,
and comes to land on the ground below.

The minions and the girls start jumping from the ship.    Agnes
takes aim.

                    AGNES
          Eat jelly, you purple freaks!
          Waaaaah!
         DESPICABLE ME 2           CINCO & KEN DRAFT     95.


Agnes' gun is a little too big for her and the kick sends her
a bit out of control. But she still manages to hit a number
of Evil Minions. The tide is turning.

Meanwhile, Gru has gone ballistic on the evil minions.   BLAM!
BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! He takes the remaining few out.

El Macho kicks an evil minion at Gru, but he manages to hit
it with jelly and transform it back to yellow. Gru holds his
gun up to El Macho and gives him a threatening look.

                    GRU
          It's over, El Macho.   Now where is
          Lucy?

                    EL MACHO
              (chuckles)
          Let me show you.

He turns to a computer and pushes a button.

A fountain stops spewing water and underneath it STEEL DOORS
open from the ground. And out of them rises a ROCKET.
Strapped to it is Lucy. Tied to a SHARK with TWO HUNDRED AND
FIFTY POUNDS OF DYNAMITE strapped to her.

Gru is horrified.   He GASPS.

                     LUCY
          Oh, hey Gru! Turns out you were
          right about the whole El Macho
          thing, huh?
               (unconvincingly)
          Yay!

El Macho calls to Gru, brandishing a remote.

                    EL MACHO
          One push of this button and I send
          that rocket straight into the same
          volcano where I faked my death.
          Only this time--it's for real!

                      GRU
                (horrified)
          No!

Dave swoops in on a rope and grabs the remote, Tarzan-
style...

                      DAVE
          Tally ho!
         DESPICABLE ME 2            CINCO & KEN DRAFT    96.


But unfortunately he smacks a roof support and drops the
remote. It bonks a bunch of minions on the head and lands on
the ground.

El Macho stares down Gru.   Fire in his eyes.

                     EL MACHO
          We could've ruled the world
          together, Gru. But now--you're
          gonna die.

He pulls out a vial of PX-41 and drinks it. Gru GASPS. El
Macho transforms into a giant, purple, furry creature. He
ROARS.

Gru pulls the trigger on his jelly gun, but he is out of
ammunition. He then pulls out the FREEZE RAY and fires,
encasing El Macho's fists in blocks of ice. El Macho GROWLS
and slams his fists to the ground, shattering the ice and
knocking Gru off the platform and onto a scaffolding. Gru
SCREAMS.

The scaffolding tips over. El Macho grabs the scaffolding
and holds it above his head, ready to crush Gru.

Suddenly Gru pulls out Lucy's lipstick taser and fires it at
Purple El Macho! The jolt of electricity has him shaking and
dancing and ultimately sizzling and smoking, until he finally
collapses on the ground.

                    GRU
          Lipstick taser!

Lucy smiles at this.

                    LUCY
          Aw...he copied me.

Gru runs off to save her.   The minions surround El Macho,
cocking their jelly guns.

                    EL MACHO
              (dazed)
          I am not afraid of your jelly guns.

                    DR. NEFARIO
          Oh, this ain't a jelly gun,
          sunshine.

Dr. Nefario fires the Fart Gun directly into El Macho's face,
causing him to pass out. The minions CHEER, firing their
jelly guns into the air.
         DESPICABLE ME 2            CINCO & KEN DRAFT     97.


One of the minions stands on top of El Macho and poses for a
big game hunter-style photo. Dr. Nefario smiles for the
camera as well.

Gru runs toward the rocket.

                     LUCY
          Don't worry about me, Gru! I'll be
          fine. I have survived lots worse
          than this.
              (beat)
          Okay, that's not entirely true.
          I'm actually kind of freaking out
          up here!

                    GRU
          Don't worry--I will get you out of
          this!

Gru attempts to untie Lucy. And then sees Pollito has walked
over to the remote. Gru and Lucy GASP. The chicken looks at
Gru and Lucy, then pecks the button.

                    GRU (CONT'D)
          I really hate that chicken.

The rocket blasts off into the air. The Minions and Girls
watch in horror as Gru and Lucy fly off on the rocket.


EXT: SKY - CONTINUOUS

Gru uses his knife to cut Lucy's ropes. They SCREAM as the
shark gets loose and falls down to a SUSHI BAR below where
all of the CUSTOMERS and SUSHI CHEF CHEER.

Meanwhile, on the rocket Gru rips a panel off the side,
revealing a mess of WIRES inside.

                    LUCY
          Is there a red one?   It's usually
          the red one.

Gru starts to pull out wires left and right.   To no avail.

                    LUCY (CONT'D)
          Gru, anytime now!

Gru GASPS, realizing they are approaching the VOLCANO. Time
is running out. Death is imminent. He looks Lucy in the
eyes.

                     GRU
           Listen, Lucy--we may not get out of
           this alive, so I need to ask you a
           question.

                     LUCY
           Uh, better make it quick!

                     GRU
           If I'd asked you out on a date,
           what would you have said?

                     LUCY
           Are you kidding me?!   Yes!

Gru smiles. Then realizes that the rocket is still careening
toward the volcano. He grabs Lucy.

                       GRU
           JUMP!!!

Gru and Lucy grab hands and leap off the rocket.

The rocket plunges into the volcano.

Gru and Lucy plummet through the air.

KA-BLAAAAM!!! The volcano explodes in a massive tempest of
fire and smoke and lava.

The impact of the blast hits Gru and Lucy and sends them
flying.

SPLASH!   They hit the water.

BAM!   BOOM!   The volcano continues exploding.

SPLASH! Gru emerges, soaking and out of breath.     Fire and
lava flying all around him. He can't find Lucy.

                      GRU (CONT'D)
           Oh!  Lucy!
               (looks around, panicking)
           Lucy! Where are you?!

After a few moments, Lucy also emerges.    Gru is incredibly
relieved.

                       GRU (CONT'D)
           Oh, Lucy!

Lucy smiles and hugs Gru. They both go underwater.       Then
come back up. Sputtering. And in love.

                    LUCY (CONT'D)
          Sorry...I guess you kind of need
          your arms to tread water, huh?

The Minions appear in the rowboat.

              ("Stroke!")
          Mack-oh! Mack-oh!      Mack-oh!

But they pass right by them.

          They'll be back...

Romantic music plays under the title card.


EXT: HILLSIDE - DAY

Four minions, dressed in matching suits, begin to sing a All-
4-One's "I Swear," pronounced "Underwear" in Minionese.

We are at Gru and Lucy's wedding reception. We PULL BACK to
the WEDDING CAKE, and then to Gru and Lucy dancing. As they
dance we see all of the wedding guests watching: Gru's Mom,
Dr. Nefario, Silas, Jillian, Shannon, Natalie, etc.

Gru dips Lucy and they attempt their kiss, but their noses
keep bumping. They finally manage to kiss and the crowd
CHEERS.

We see the three girls watching in their beautiful bridesmaid
dresses. Agnes can barely contain her glee. PAN OVER TO
Edith, who makes a face.

                    EDITH
          Can I be the first to say--ewwww!

The minions finish the song.

The girls sit at their table.    Agnes clearly has something on
her mind. She SIGHS.

          Okay.

She stands up on the table.

Looks out at the crowd, but they can't hear her.

                     AGNES (CONT'D)
          Um...hi!   Excuse me!

She still doesn't have the crowd's attention, so Margo taps
on her glass. Everyone looks to Agnes, who is visibly
nervous.

                    AGNES (CONT'D)
          Uh...hi, everybody! I'd like to
          make some toast. Uh...

She looks out at the crowd. Is really nervous. Looks over
at Gru. He smiles. Mouths "okay." This helps, and Agnes
pulls herself together and recites the Mothers Day poem from
earlier.

                    AGNES (CONT'D)
          She um...she um, kisses my boo-boos.
          She braids my hair.
          We love you mothers, everywhere!

Agnes turns to Lucy and looks her right in the eyes.

                    AGNES (CONT'D)
          And my new mom Lucy is beyond
          compare.

Lucy smiles, melting. The crowd goes "awwwww." Agnes and
Lucy spin around in a hug. The crowd cheers and applauds.
Gru, Margo and Edith join Agnes and Lucy in a group hug. The
family is complete.

A minion begins to spin The Village People's "YMCA" at the DJ
table. The minions, several of whom are dressed as The

dressed as the Chiquita banana lady also joins in.

Then the entire family boogies across the dance floor,

               FADE IN:

               INT. MRS. BRUCE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Decorated in Carol Brady chic. When it's not gaudy, tacky, 
               and loud, it's blander than toast. Colors like lime green 
               and sunshine orange should be reserved for popsicles only.

               MRS. BRUCE, late 30's, enters looking exhausted. She carries 
               a glass of wine in one hand and a book in the other, Erma 
               Bombeck's The Grass Is Always Greener Over The Septic Tank.

               HUMMING "We've Only Just Begun," Mrs. Bruce crouches next to 
               her wildly-ancient entertainment center complete with 8-track.  
               She flips the first record forward on her Ronco Record Mate. 
               Album after album flaps forward. Olivia Newton-John, Neil 
               Diamond, the Osmond Brothers. She stops on the Carpenters 
               and sighs at the serene cover art. Just what the doctor 
               ordered.

               Placing the vinyl on the turntable, she CLICKS the dustcover 
               closed and FLICKS "Play." Reclining in her Lazyboy, she sips 
               her wine, opens the book and awaits the mellow tones of Karen 
               Carpenter.

               Suddenly, her eardrums are hammered by machine gun GUITAR.  
               Caustic ROCK 'N' ROLL assaults her senses. She jumps, spilling 
               her wine all over herself. This isn't the Carpenters...

               IT'S KISS!

               Racing to the entertainment center, she turns the volume 
               control knob so violently, it comes off in her hand. The 
               music is even louder now.

               Flustered by the awful noise, she tries lifting the dustcover.  
               It's stuck. She screams and covers her ears. This is Hell. 
               Running to the rear of the huge console, she stretches to 
               reach the plug, but can't. Fingertips millimeters away.

               As the cacophony POUNDS she shakes the entire stereo with 
               all her frantic might.

               SCREEEEEECH! The needle scrapes across the vinyl with a 
               shrill, finally coming to a stop. Whew, silence!

               Then, POP, the dustcover opens unceremoniously. Shaken, she 
               grabs the record with trembling hands and reads the label...

                                KISS - LOVE GUN, SIDE TWO

               Mrs. Bruce's blood boils.

                                     MRS. BRUCE
                         KISS! The devil's music!

               EXT. LEX'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               A small, two-story house amid a suburban neighborhood of 
               other two-story houses. Uninspired architecture. Spindly 
               trees. 

               Two-car garage.

               A faint yellow glow emanates from a cellar window across 
               which shadows frantically dart. Over the CRICKETS, we hear 
               MUFFLED, BADLY-RENDERED ROCK 'N' ROLL. SCRATCHY, GUTTURAL, 
               inhuman.

               CAMERA MOVES to the cellar window. Inside we see four TEENAGE 
               BOYS who are to blame for the racket. Band practice.

               INT. LEX'S BASEMENT/BEDROOM - NIGHT

               An inner-sanctum of KISS devotion. Faux-wood paneling is 
               plastered with countless KISS posters, pictures, fold-outs.  
               The ceiling is wallpapered with more KISS posters. KISS dolls, 
               magazines, records, comic books clutter the shag-carpeted 
               floor. Fast food wrappers heap over the KISS garbage pail.

               The four high schoolers rock their hearts out as they blast 
               a familiar tune offensively off-key.

                                     BOYS SINGING
                         "I wanna rock 'n' roll all night and 
                         party every day!"

               They stink, but they sure are trying hard. Meet the band 
               "Mystery." Concert tee-shirts, holey jeans, total burn-outs.

               HAWK, a scraggily-haired, disenchanted youth, strains his 
               vocal chords on the microphone as he SCRATCHES at his rhythm 
               guitar. Hawk is sort of the brains of this operation, but 
               knowing the others, that doesn't say much.

               LEX POUNDS a bass with earnest determination. Lanky with bad 
               posture, Lex is already sporting worry lines. He takes 
               everything way-too-seriously.

               TRIP STRUMS lead guitar like he's hammering nails. All id, 
               Trip is slightly out of his mind. But, is it the chemicals 
               or just his chemistry. He always wears a knit cap.

               JAM, a sensitive kid (but no wuss), BASHES on his drums like 
               a madman making the bass drum pulsate like a spastic heart. 
               The big drum bears the word "Mystery" painted on its skin 
               with a lightning "S" just like the KISS logo.

               They bring the classic tune to a shrieking conclusion and 
               thrust their hands over their heads in the KISS symbol.  
               Hawk screams into the mike at their imaginary audience.

                                     HAWK
                         Thank you, Cleveland! You're a great 
                         crowd. But after three and a half 
                         hours of kick-ass rock and seven 
                         encores on top of that, I'm sorry to 
                         say that this time we really gotta 
                         get back to our hotel rooms and fuck 
                         some groupies.

               Behind him, Trip grabs Lex's bass and swings it by the neck 
               at an amp pretending to bash it over and over again. Lex 
               quickly yanks it away from him.

                                     LEX
                         What the fuck, Trip? That's my bass!

               Jam emerges from behind the pile of drums smiling.

                                     JAM
                         That was curly!

                                     TRIP
                         Just one more day of school to get 
                         through, girls, before tomorrow 
                         night... Live!
                              (getting excited)
                         COBO Hall! Detroit, Michigan!
                              (like an announcer)
                         You wanted the best!

                                     ALL FOUR BOYS
                         You got the best! The hottest band 
                         in the world... KISS!!

               They all make that BREATH SOUND that mimics a screaming crowd.  
               Suddenly, headlights swing by in the window above them like 
               a spotlight. Lex hops onto the unmade bed and looks out the 
               cellar window.

               LEX'S POV

               A baby-shit green, Ford station wagon with fake wood sides 
               SCREECHES into the driveway. Mrs. Bruce gets out and STOMPS 
               toward the house. Lex gasps at the sight.

                                     LEX
                         Shit! It's Jam's mom!

               Jam GULPS as if he's just shat out an whole can of Lincoln 
               logs.

                                     JAM
                         My mom? Oh, no! What's she doing 
                         here?

               Lex quickly throws a KISS towel over a TV tray hiding a bong, 
               cigarettes, overloaded ashtray. Trip kicks half-empty beer 
               bottles under the bed. Hawk sprays Lysol frantically around 
               the room as Jam shovels gum into his mouth.

               KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK! Mrs. Bruce pounds on the cellar window 
               crouching to see in. She looks like a crazed, underlit psycho.

                                     MRS. BRUCE
                              (muffled through glass)
                         Jeremiah! Jeremiah Bruce! You get 
                         out here this instant!

               The boys looks up like innocent, wide-eyed angels. Jam waves.

                                     JAM
                         Oh, hi, mom.

                                     MRS. BRUCE
                              (screams)
                         NOW!

               Jam quickly pockets his drumsticks and grabs his worn, denim 
               jacket off the pile of jackets on the floor, then runs 
               upstairs. The others follow.

               EXT. LEX'S HOUSE/FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

               The front door opens. Jam steps out to greet his mom with a 
               nervous smile. Hawk, Lex, and Trip stand at a safe distance 
               in the foyer behind him.

                                     JAM
                         What's up?

               Mrs. Bruce grabs her son by the ear and holds up the KISS 
               LOVE GUN record waving it in his face.

                                     MRS. BRUCE
                         The devil's body count, that's what's 
                         up! Don't you know what KISS stands 
                         for? "Knights in Satan's Service!"

               She hauls Jam across the lawn. Hawk, Lex, and Trip step onto 
               the porch looking on in sympathetic embarrassment. Mrs. Bruce 
               stuffs the record in the trash can then throws Jam in the 
               front seat. SCREECH, the station wagon pulls away.

                                     TRIP
                         Jam has yet to do an overnight with 
                         us.

                                     LEX
                         I had a nightmare once that something 
                         like this might happen. I hope he 
                         doesn't get grounded again. If he 
                         misses Peter Criss's drum solo, I 
                         don't know if he'll be able to handle 
                         it.

                                     HAWK
                         Lex, quit trying to always jinx 
                         things. Don't worry, dudes. Nobody's 
                         missing that concert tomorrow night.

               INT. JAM'S BEDROOM - DAY

               The sun's early morning rays beam through the KISS "Destroyer" 
               poster taped onto a window shade. The phone RINGS. Jam bolts 
               upright, his profile blocking the poster. He has just awakened 
               under the only other decoration in his room: a crucifix.

               Still dressed in last night's clothes, a plain black tee-
               shirt and blue jeans, Jam leaps out of bed unwittingly 
               planting a foot in the handle of a Bullworker (a piece of 
               exercise equipment comprised of a powerful spring with two 
               handles on either end) whose other handle is stuck under one 
               of the bed's legs.

               Jam runs to a phone on his dresser, drawing the Bullworker's 
               powerful springs out to maximum tension. No sooner does he 
               pick up, when he is yanked to the floor and dragged across 
               it as if tied to the bumper of a speeding car. Despite the 
               Bullworker pulling him back toward his bed, Jam does manage 
               to get the phone to his ear.

                                     JAM
                         Hello?

               The phone's cord stretches taut causing its cradle to leap 
               from the dresser and WHACK Jam on the head.

               INT. LEX'S BASEMENT/BEDROOM - DAY

               Hawk is on the phone as Lex and Trip scour every inch of the 
               cluttered room on their hands and knees searching frantically 
               for something.

                                     HAWK
                         Jam, listen up.

                                     JAM (O.S.)
                         Hawk?

                                     HAWK
                         Just listen up, man, cause we are in 
                         a quandary.

               INT. JAM'S BEDROOM - DAY

               Jam clutches the phone with his shoulder GRUNTING as he does 
               battle with the Bullworker for possession of his foot.

                                     HAWK (O.S.)
                         Are you on the crapper with one of 
                         those antenna phones? Sounds like 
                         you're taking a dump the size of 
                         Butte, Montana.

                                     JAM
                         It's my Bullworker.

                                     HAWK (O.S.)
                         Anyway, listen up. They're gone!

                                     JAM
                         What's gone?

                                     HAWK (O.S.)
                         The KISS tickets, you nimrod! They're 
                         just fuckin' gone! Please tell me 
                         you have'm!

                                     JAM
                              (panicked)
                         Gone!? Why would I have the KISS 
                         tick...?

                                     HAWK (O.S.)
                         Just check whatever you were wearing 
                         last night. Now!

               Jam briefly scans his surroundings double-taking at the denim 
               jacket lying on the floor. He checks the pockets and sees 
               four tickets labelled KISS - JUNE 7, 1978 - COBO HALL, 
               DETROIT.

                                     JAM
                         Whew! Oh, God, Hawk... I got'm!  
                         Somehow I musta taken Trip's jacket 
                         by mistake!

               INT. LEX'S BASEMENT/BEDROOM - DAY

               Hawk SIGHS like a deathrow convict pardoned at the last 
               second.

                                     HAWK
                              (to others)
                         He's got'm!

               Lex and Trip collapse with relief.

                                     HAWK
                         Trip, he took your jacket by mistake.  
                         You must be wearing Jam's.

               Trip reaches in a breast pocket and pulls out Rosary beads.  
               Spooked, he drops them like they were a bug.

                                     HAWK
                              (into phone)
                         Cool.

                                     JAM (O.S.)
                         I'm really sorry about that, man.

                                     HAWK
                         Don't be a fembot. So, are you like 
                         grounded because of last night, or 
                         what?

               INT. JAM'S ROOM - DAY

                                     JAM
                         Of course, but has that ever stopped 
                         me before? Besides, my mom's going 
                         to some church meeting and won't be 
                         back till late. No sweat... See you 
                         guys in school.

               CLICK. DIAL TONE. Jam hangs up.

               INT. LEX'S BASEMENT/BEDROOM - DAY

               Lex buckles his belt with its huge KISS belt buckle.

                                     LEX
                         Poor, Jam, man. Imagine having to 
                         stash your KISS records inside Carly 
                         Simon album covers. No question, 
                         Mrs. Bruce is a psycho-bitch from 
                         hell.

                                     TRIP
                         You're one to talk, Lex. Your mom's 
                         a fuckin' dyke.

               Trip pockets his wallet which is affixed to a long chain 
               attached to a side belt loop.

                         Trip, a female gynecologist does not 
                         a lesbian make. And even if it did, 
                         at least my mom didn't give birth to 
                         me while she was on LSD.

                         Shrooms! And even if it was LSD, I 
                         can still give my mom a kiss without 
                         smelling the catch of the day.

                                     HAWK
                         Both you assholes, SHADDAP!

               Lex and Trip shaddap.

                                     HAWK
                         Enough of the mom-bashing, all right?  
                         Lex's mom is cool about us crashing 
                         over here while she's out of town. 
                         And if it weren't for Trip's mom, we 
                         wouldn'ta smoked that fine Panama 
                         Red last night. So leave the women 
                         who gave you life out of it. They're 
                         both cool.

               Trip and Lex cease and desist the mom-bashing and continue 
               getting ready for school. Suddenly, Lex pushes Trip angrily.

                                     LEX
                         Trip, you fuckin' asshole.

                         What?

               Lex points to a wet mess on the pillow.

                                     LEX
                         You spilled my Sea Monkeys all over

               Jam gives the Bullworker one final yank. This time it comes 
               loose... not from his foot, but from under the bed. Its handle 
               lashes up SLAPPING him across the face. Ouch.

               Fully awake now, Jam throws on Trip's denim jacket. He stuffs 
               a drumstick into his left sock. We see "Mystery" written on 
               it. Just as he's about to stick the other one in his right 
               sock...

               Without a second of warning, or even a knock, Mrs. Bruce 
               suddenly ENTERS. Immediately Jam stands.

                                     MRS. BRUCE
                         Jeremiah, what are you doing?

                                     JAM
                         Uhh... nothing.

               She turns to his closet, the door blocking her view of the 
               KISS poster. Jam leaps to the window and yanks the "Destroyer" 
               shade. It shoots up, FLAPPING around its rod. He's done this 
               before.

               Mrs. Bruce peeks at Jam from around his closet door. He 
               stretches in front of the window.

                                     JAM
                         Ahh, sunshine.

                                     MRS. BRUCE
                         You're going to be late if you don't 
                         hurry up and change soon.

                                     JAM
                         Change? What's wrong with what I got 
                         on?

                                     MRS. BRUCE
                         It's dirty laundry for one thing and 
                         for another, you still haven't worn 
                         the clothes I bought you. You're 
                         skating on thin ice already, young 
                         man, so I wouldn't push my luck. Now 
                         get out of those rags.

                                     JAM
                         But, mom!

                                     MRS. BRUCE
                         Besides, those jeans are so tight I 
                         can see your penis.

               Jam reluctantly takes off the denim jacket as Mrs. Bruce 
               grabs the single drumstick from his hand and shakes it at 
               him.

                                     MRS. BRUCE
                         Someday you'll see the futility in 
                         forging a musical career with those 
                         idiots.

               She turns and rummages through the closet.

                                     JAM
                              (to himself)
                         They're not idiots.

                                     MRS. BRUCE
                         Now don't forget you're on the honor 
                         system tonight. I'll be home a little 
                         after one and if you've been partying 
                         or playing that satanic KISS music... 
                         well, need I remind you of the 
                         consequences?

                                     JAM
                         Grounded for the rest of the year?

                                     MRS. BRUCE
                         You're a smart boy, Jeremiah. And so 
                         handsome.

               She pulls two Sears department store boxes from the closet 
               and lays them on the bed. Jam is visibly horrified.

                          THIS IS YOUR MOTHER! / THE GIRL'S ROOM

               EXT. ROBERT F. KENNEDY HIGH - DAY

               The suburban high school is teeming with morning activity. 
               School buses pull up to the curb. KIDS arrive in droves and 
               immediately find their cliques. The JOCKS and PRIMADONNAS 
               make up the popular crowd. There's DISCO DUDES, FRESHMEN who 
               look like grade schoolers, and GEEKS.

               At the smoking section hang the BURNOUTS. Hawk, Trip, and 
               Lex stand amid the other long-hairs.

                                     TRIP
                         School. What a fuckin' waste of time.

               Two GIRLS with tons of make-up, hair so feathered it could 
               fly, and tight clothes, saunter by SNAPPING gum.

                                     HAWK
                         Will somebody please tell those chicks 
                         disco is dead.

                                     LEX
                         Stellas. I hate stellas almost as 
                         much as I hate dogs.

                                     TRIP
                         Same species when you think about 
                         it.

               Their words say one thing, but their eyes say another. They 
               can't stop gawking at the chicks' asses. Girl #1 sneers back.

                                     GIRL #1
                         Don't stare too long, you'll go blind.

               The boys quickly cover.

                                     LEX
                              (defensive)
                         Yeah, right. She wishes. Look at 
                         that big ass.

                                     TRIP
                         You know what they say about a big 
                         ass... big shit.

               They chuckle. Just then, Jam steps off a school bus in an 
               unbelievably geeky outfit, white corduroy slacks, plaid shirt 
               buttoned to the top, argyle socks and brown deck shoes.

                                     TRIP
                         Hey, that dork looks just like Jam.

               Hawk and Lex look and laugh when they see him.

                                     LEX
                         Shit, that dork is Jam.

                                     HAWK
                              (to Jam)
                         YO, DOOFUS!

               Jam gives them the finger.

               INT. SCHOOL LOCKER AREA - DAY

               Hawk, Trip, Lex, and Jam grab books from their lockers.  
               KISS stickers, photos, and rock magazine cut-outs line the 
               insides. Jam's locker door is covered with Peter Criss only.

                                     TRIP
                         So, Jam, who did your wardrobe, Tad 
                         the preppie sailboat captain?

                                     JAM
                         Hey, my mom had me over a barrel, 
                         all right. After last night, I had 
                         to let her dress me today. It's a 
                         give and take relationship.

                                     LEX
                         Yeah, she gives you shit and you 
                         take it.

                                     HAWK
                         Okay, enough. Enough. Gimme the 
                         tickets. I wanna hold onto them.

                                     JAM
                         They're still at my house in Trip's 
                         jacket.

                                     HAWK
                         They're what?

                                     JAM
                         She was standing right over me when 
                         I was changing for fuck's sake.

                                     TRIP
                         That's some sick shit right there.  
                         Did she comb your ass hair for you 
                         too?

                                     LEX
                         If your mom so much as smells those 
                         tickets, they're history, and we get 
                         screwed outta seeing KISS for the 
                         third year in a row, the third year!

                                     JAM
                         Don't worry about it. They're 
                         perfectly safe. We can pick them up 
                         after school. My mom won't be home. 
                         It's no problem.

                                     HAWK
                         All right. After school we double-
                         time it to your house for the tix 
                         before heading to the train station 
                         for the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City.

                                     JAM
                         Check.

               The BELL RINGS.

                                     HAWK
                         As they say in the Tampon biz, see 
                         you next period.

               SLAM! They shut their lockers in unison.

               INT. STUDY HALL - DAY

               The STUDY HALL TEACHER grades papers. On the wall a picture 
               of President Carter hangs next to Old Glory. The words "Be 
               Quiet" are written on the blackboard.

               Students study, read, doodle, sleep. Jam is at his desk 
               touching up the word "Mystery" on his drumstick. Next to him 
               sits BETH. Quirky, but cute, she stares longingly at him 
               wanting to say something, but not having the guts.

               Pleased with his work, Jam puts the drumsticks on the desk 
               and opens a Peter Criss album cover notebook depicting 
               countless doodles of the KISS logo, the Mystery logo, and 
               renderings of Peter Criss.

               Beth SIGHS and opens her own notebook. Drawings of hearts 
               fill the pages. In them is written "Beth + Jeremiah" and "I 
               love Jeremiah."

               Then, one of Jam's drumsticks rolls off the desk and onto 
               the floor. Beth quickly reaches down to grab it for him just 
               as he bends to get it too. THUD, they bash heads.

                                     JAM
                         Oof!
                              (whispering)
                         Sorry.

               Rubbing her head, she smiles and hands him the drumstick.

                                     BETH
                         No problem.

                                     JAM
                         Thanks.

               He stuffs his drumsticks in his socks pulling his pantlegs 
               down. Jam and Beth stare at each other. There's a mutual 
               crush, but both are apprehensive about making the first move. 
               Both want to speak, neither does. They awkwardly go back to 
               their notebooks.

               Mustering the nerve, Jam breaks the ice and whispers...

                                     JAM
                         Beth?

               Beth spins too quickly. Her pen flies out of her hand.

                                     BETH
                         Yes?

               BOINK! The pen hits Jam in the eye.

                                     JAM
                         Ow!

               Feeling awful, Beth moves in to help. The teacher looks up 
               sternly.

                                     STUDY HALL TEACHER
                         Mr. Bruce, Miss Bumsteen, is there a 
                         problem?

                                     BETH
                         No. No problem.

               Jam points to his eye.

                                     JAM
                         Just a little pink eye. No reason to 
                         panic.

               Unamused, the teacher goes back to grading.

                                     BETH
                              (whispering)
                         Sorry.

                                     JAM
                              (handing back pen)
                         It's okay.

               Beth resumes doodling feeling like an idiot. Jam does too. 
               Ah, teenage awkwardness. Finally, Beth musters up some 
               courage.

                                     BETH
                         Jeremiah?

                                     JAM
                         Yeah?

               She hems and haw, then...

                                     BETH
                         I wanted to tell you something... 
                         I...

               Suddenly, Beth is rudely interrupted by HIGH-PITCHED FEEDBACK 
               coming from the P.A. The PRINCIPAL'S VOICE ECHOES over it.

                                     PRINCIPAL'S VOICE
                         Jeremiah Bruce, come to the office 
                         immediately...

               Jam throws a startled glance to the speaker as the class 
               sings in unison.

                                     WHOLE CLASS
                         Oooo, you're in troubaaaallll.

                                     PRINCIPAL'S VOICE
                         Your mother's here and would like to 
                         see you right away...

               More FEEDBACK as the mike on the other end changes hands.

                         Give me that microphone... Jeremiah, 
                         you get your sorry self down to this 
                         office, mister!

               All the kids except for Beth burst into hysterical laughter.

               Mrs. Bruce's tirade continues over QUICK SHOTS of...

               INT. HAWK'S SCIENCE CLASS - DAY

               Hawk sits at his lab table burning an eraser with his Bunsen 
               burner. His eyes widen with horror behind his goggles as the 
               other STUDENTS laugh till they hurt.

                                     MRS. BRUCE'S VOICE
                         I found some things in the pockets 
                         of your jacket while I was picking 
                         up your disgusting laundry today...

               INT. LEX'S GYM CLASS - DAY

               Lex's eyes bug with terror. The basketball game is at a 
               standstill as everyone is crippled with laughter.

                                     MRS. BRUCE'S VOICE
                         Cigarettes! Marijuana! Prophylactics!

               INT. TRIP'S HEALTH CLASS - DAY

               Trip dozes at his desk as an out-of-date film about VD 
               sputters on. The room is deafening with laughter. Then, as 
               if hit by a ton of bricks, Trip wakes up alarmed by the 
               familiar, shrilly voice.

                                     MRS. BRUCE'S VOICE
                         And something much, much worse!

                                     TRIP
                         Holy shit, my jacket!

               4-WAY SPLIT SCREEN

               We see Jam, Hawk, Lex, and Trip agog in dread.

                                     MRS. BRUCE'S VOICE
                         If you know what's good for you, 
                         you'll get down here... NOW!

               INT. JAM'S STUDY HALL - DAY

               Jam slowly sinks in his chair under the profoundly humiliating 
               weight of an ENTIRE SCHOOL'S ECHOED LAUGHTER.

               INT. WAITING AREA - DAY

               Mrs. Bruce sits next to a stand-up ashtray in the high 
               school's waiting area. Scowling, she fans the KISS tickets 
               out with one hand. Jam sits across from her, one leg jittering 
               anxiously.

               They sit for an uncomfortably long time until... Mrs. Bruce 
               pulls a cigarette and lighter out of her purse.

                                     MRS. BRUCE
                         I made an appointment with Father 
                         Phillip McNulty at St. Bernard's.  
                         We're to see him directly where he 
                         will register you on the spot.

                                     JAM
                         You mean, you're sending me to... b-
                         b-boarding school?

                                     MRS. BRUCE
                         What else can I do? Oh, records and 
                         magazines and comic books are one 
                         thing, but tickets? TICKETS? Jeremiah, 
                         do you realize what this means? That 
                         you're no longer content merely 
                         hearing their awful songs or looking 
                         at photos of their horrific faces! 
                         Now you want to see the devil in the 
                         flesh. You want to reach out and 
                         touch pure evil... and in Detroit no 
                         less!

               She flicks the lighter, not yet lighting the cigarette.

                                     JAM
                         Mom, three of those tickets don't 
                         even belong to me. They're for the 
                         guys.

               Mrs. Bruce holds the tickets over the lighter's flame.

                                     MRS. BRUCE
                         And if the "guys" have parents who 
                         truly love them, they will elevate 
                         me to sainthood for getting rid of 
                         these blasted things.

               Mrs. Bruce lights her smoke with the flaming tickets, then 
               drops them in the ashtray where they burn for a cruel 
               eternity. Jam stares semi-catatonic through his mom's sour 
               expression.

                                     MRS. BRUCE
                         It's been a long time coming, son, 
                         but you're finally going to get the 
                         kind of discipline you deserve.

               She stands and pulls him out the front entrance by his arm.

               REVERSE ANGLE ON NEARBY CORNER

               Hawk, Trip, and Lex peek around it, their heads forming a 
               totem pole. One-by-one they pull back.

               AROUND THE CORNER

               They slump against the wall devastated.

                                     LEX
                         I knew it! I knew this was gonna 
                         happen! I had a bad feeling since 
                         last night. Remember? We are so 
                         totally fucked!

                                     TRIP
                         Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! Maybe 
                         we can glue the tickets back together!

                                     HAWK
                         What are you, high?

                                     TRIP
                         Yeah.

                                     HAWK
                         For once Lex is right. It's over. 
                         Things can't get any worse from here.

               Suddenly, a caustic voice BLURTS from down the hall.

                                     VOICE
                         I hope you rodents have hall passes!

               The boys whip their heads around to see a potbellied, yellow-
               toothed, security officer with long sideburns and slicked 
               back hair at the far end of the hall, fists on his hips.  
               Meet ELVIS.

                                     LEX
                         Wanna bet.

                                     ELVIS
                         Could that be three detentions I 
                         smell?

               Elvis laughs and breaks into a run barreling down on them 
               like a maniac. Keys JANGLING furiously.

                                     HAWK
                         Second floor girls' john! Two minutes! 
                         He'll never look there!

                                     LEX
                         Check!

               They take off in three different directions. Still laughing, 
               Elvis stops where the boys just were. Which one to follow? 
               He bolts after Hawk who has taken the nearest staircase.

               INT./EXT. JAM'S STUDY HALL - DAY

               Beth looks sadly out the window watching Mrs. Bruce push Jam 
               in the car. Beth puts her hand on the pane wanting to touch 
               him.

               INT. STAIRWAY - DAY

               Meanwhile, Elvis HUFFS and PUFFS up a flight of stairs 
               arriving at a set of swinging doors. He goes to push one in, 
               but it swings out at him with a vengeance knocking him 
               backward.

               From behind it pops Hawk wielding a fire extinguisher. BLAST! 
               A hail of foam covers Elvis's face. Hawk shoves the 
               extinguisher into the man's arms and pushes Elvis backwards 
               down the stairs. He topples ass-over-head till he hits the 
               landing.

                                     HAWK
                         You're way out of your league, Elvis.

               Elvis rises and shakes the CO2 off like a wet dog. Looking 
               up, he sees the door gently swinging in and out. No sign of 
               Hawk.

               INT. GIRLS' BATHROOM - DAY

               Trip kicks a bathroom stall violently.

                                     TRIP
                         Fuck! Shit!

               Lex sits on the toilet in the stall.

                                     LEX
                         Hey, take it easy, man. This is the 
                         girls' crapper, remember?

                                     TRIP
                         Wake up, Lex! We just watched Jam's 
                         mom torch our fuckin' KISS tickets! 
                         Not REO Speedwagon! Not Journey! Not 
                         the Bay City Rollers! KISS! If you 
                         can think of a better reason to trash 
                         a bathroom, I'd sure like to hear 
                         it!

                                     LEX
                         Trip, it's not the end of the world, 
                         okay? Quit acting all squeezed out.

               Trip grabs Lex by the collar, yanks him off the toilet and 
               shoves him against the wall.

                                     TRIP
                         Oh, everything's hunky-dory now that 
                         the shit hit the fan just like you 
                         said it would, you snug sonofabitch! 
                         You fuckin' jinxed us!

                                     LEX
                         Smug, Trip! Not snug, smug.

               Hawk bursts into the bathroom.

                                     HAWK
                         We're clear, dudes.

               They run to exit. Hawk first. Suddenly, Hawk backs up again 
               into Trip and Lex as if a swarm of killer bees was out there.

                                     HAWK
                         A skirt just came around the corner.

               Hawk, Trip, and Lex run back and pile into the last stall.  
               All three stand on the toilet bracing their arms against the 
               walls for balance.

               A FOXY GIRL hurries into the stall next to theirs. We see 
               the top halves of three heads peek over the stall's partition.  
               The three boys don't make a sound as they watch her sit down.

               As she glances up, they recoil fast. They whisper super-quiet.

                                     HAWK
                         That's Sherry VanHafton.

                         I've been in love with her since the 
                         second grade.

               Then, a SOUND OF TINKLING. They all throw their hands over 
               their mouths to stifle the giggles. Suddenly, POOT! She lets 
               out an ECHOED FART. The boys are awestruck.

                                     HAWK
                         Whoa... she just farted.

                                     LEX
                         I have never heard a girl squeeze 
                         cheese in my entire life.

                                     HAWK
                         Weird...

               Pause.

                                     TRIP
                         Peeeyeewww! That stinks!

               Just then, the SOUND OF CRACKING PORCELAIN, as the toilet 
               they're standing on breaks into pieces with a SMASH. They 
               topple over pulling the stall walls down with them exposing 
               the foxy chick sitting on the can. Water GUSHES everywhere 
               as she screams bloody murder, getting doused ruining her 
               Farrah-do.

               They bolt out the door slipping and sliding across the torrent 
               of toilet water. Lex turns and shrugs to the traumatized 
               girl.

                                     LEX
                         Heh-heh, sorry.

               He's gone.

               Mrs. Bruce uses a finished cigarette to light another.

                                     MRS. BRUCE
                         Someday you'll have a son just like 
                         you, Jeremiah. A boy who lies through 
                         his teeth, buys demonic records, and 
                         smokes the dope just like you.

                                     JAM
                              (numbly)
                         If I'm anything like you, I'll deserve 
                         him.

                                     MRS. BRUCE
                         What?!

                         I said, I'm sorry!

                                     MRS. BRUCE
                         If you truly are sorry, son, then 
                         you better pray like you've never 
                         prayed before. God willed me to find 
                         those tickets because He wanted to 
                         hear from you.  He knows you need 
                         help and He wants you to ask Him for 
                         it.

               Mrs. Bruce's car turns off the road and drives through an 
               imposing set of wrought iron gates. The sign reads: St. 
               Bernard's Veil of Tears. A School for Catholic Boys.

               INT. MRS. BRUCE'S CAR - DAY

               Jam looks at what lies ahead. His face becomes a mask of 
               pure terror. We hear a THUNDER CLAP as Jam puts his hands 
               together and closes his eyes humbling himself. He whispers.

                                     JAM
                         Please, God, help.

               The car winds up the path leading to a dark, Gothic edifice 
               over which tumultuous storm clouds continuously hover. THUNDER 
               BELCHES and bolts of lightning shoot at the blackened 
               crucifixes along the structure. We hear a SCARY ORGAN theme.

               INT. VOC/TECH DEPT. - DAY

               Except for the tinkering NOISES that are heard as the STUDENTS 
               work on their projects, there is silence in Electronics Class.

               The teacher, MR. JOHANSEN, sips from a coffee cup and reads 
               a newspaper, his feet on the desk. The headline says: "Mass 
               Suicide in Jonestown. Cyanide in the Kool-Aid." Above him is 
               a long banner reading: "Sorry, Absolutely no bathroom breaks".

               Hawk, Trip, and Lex sit before a half-built radio on a work 
               bench, sheer desperation etched on their faces.

               Lex solders two copper wires together. Hawk attaches a dial. 
               Trip absently plays with a squeeze pump attached to a long 
               plastic tube. He blows air into his face repeatedly with it.

                                     TRIP
                              (re:squeeze pump/tube)
                         Wonder if you could smoke shit out 
                         of this?

                                     HAWK
                         Maybe some tunage'll chase those 
                         blues away.

               Hawk turns the radio on and a HIGH FREQUENCY WHINE pours 
               from its speaker. He adjusts the volume, then the tuner, 
               until a DJ's VOICE comes through crisp and clear.

                                     DJ'S VOICE
                         ...and this is Simple Simon on the 
                         rock of Detroit, W.A.R.P., home of 
                         the biggest KISS giveaway in the 
                         history of the universe!

               Detroit? DETROIT? Hawk, Trip, and Lex react like they've 
               just been hit by phasers on stun. God is intervening.

                                     DJ'S VOICE
                         I got four, count 'em, four front 
                         row tickets along with four backstage 
                         passes to the concert tonight at 
                         Cobo Hall and I'm giving them to the 
                         106th caller who can tell me the 
                         real names of each KISS band member!

               HIGH FREQUENCY NOISES again, then the radio loses reception.  
               Hawk exchanges an anxious glance with Trip and Lex.

                                     LEX
                         Too bad we're stuck in electronics 
                         or...

                                     HAWK
                         Never mind with the too bad shit. I 
                         got a crazy plan, but only the 
                         craziest among us can pull it off.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO: MOMENTS LATER

               Mr. Johansen still sits with his feet up, reading. The next 
               page's headline reads: First Test Tube Baby Born.

               Trip runs up to Mr. J's desk, one hand behind his back, the 
               other on his crotch. His face is drawn in an expression of 
               sheer agony. Hawk and Lex watch anxiously in the background.

                                     MR.J
                         Mr. Verudi, get back to your bench.

               Trip puts one leg over the other always keeping a hand behind 
               his back.

                                     TRIP
                         But I gotta take a piss like you 
                         would not believe, Mr. Johansen!

                                     MR.J
                         Put a clothespin on it till the end 
                         of class, Verudi. You know my rule.

                                     TRIP
                         But ever since my doctor put me on 
                         salt pills, it's been like Niagara 
                         Falls every half hour! Please, Mr. 
                         J! Have mercy!

               Suddenly, a wet stain grows across the crotch of Trip's pants.

                                     MR.J
                         Salt pills? Don't insult my 
                         intelligence, Verudi...

               Mr. J. stops when he sees the stain starting to spread.

                                     TRIP
                         Jeezis, I'm taking a leak in my pants!

               We now see Trip is squeezing the pump from before. He holds 
               it behind him feeding water into the tube running down the 
               back of his pants.

               The stain travels fast, hitting Trip's knee in a nanosecond.  
               In a state of shock, Mr. J. slowly opens a long forgotten 
               drawer on his desk, finding a cobweb and dust-covered pad of 
               bathroom passes. He tears one off and dust flies everywhere.

               He holds the pass out to Trip like it was a cross he was 
               holding before an advancing vampire.

                                     MR.J
                              (hoarsely)
                         Get the hell out of here, Verudi! 
                         You disgust me!

               Hawk and Lex observe that Trip has been successful, then do 
               a Three Stooges-style handshake, whispering "Curly!"

               INT. FRONT OFFICE - DAY

               The SECRETARY sits at her desk in the reception area filing 
               paperwork. She pauses when she hears RUNNING FOOTSTEPS. Trip 
               charges past, a big, wet stain on his crotch.

               The secretary notices the pump and tube flopping from the 
               back of his pants as Trip turns a corner.

               INT. MAIN CORRIDOR - DAY

               Trip runs up to a pay phone on the wall, pumps every nickel 
               he has into it, puts the phone to his ear and dials.

                                     TRIP
                         I need to be connected to the W.A.R.P. 
                         contest hotline... Now... lady!... 
                         Hello, is this me? I'm Trip.

               INT. SCHOOL SECURITY OFFICE - DAY

               A cubby-of-an-office. Cluttered beyond belief. Elvis leans 
               back on his chair against the wall reading a PLOP Magazine. 
               A transistor radio plays W.A.R.P. He bolts at the sound of 
               Trip's name causing his chair to slide out from under him. 
               THWAM!

                                     TRIP ON RADIO
                         Am I on the air?... Yeah... Gene 
                         Klein, Stanley Eisen, Paul Frehley, 
                         and Peter, uh, Criscoula... yeah, 
                         that's it!

               INT. FRONT OFFICE - DAY

               The secretary hears an ecstatic "YEEEHAAWW" and turns to see 
               Trip wheeling back around the corner, leaping in the air as 
               he runs, YOWLING like a rodeo cowboy. He bounds past her. 
               She watches him and shakes her head.

                                     SECRETARY

               INT. SECURITY OFFICE - DAY

               Still on the floor, Elvis grabs the little radio with rage, 
               flips it off and screams at it.

                                     ELVIS
                         Why you little...! Over my dead body!

               The bell RINGS.

               INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE VOC/TECH ROOM - DAY

               Students pour into the hall. Hawk and Lex exit the class 
               just as Trip comes zigzagging down the corridor dodging the 
               hordes. All three converge as Trip can't contain his 
               enthusiasm.

                                     TRIP
                         I did it! I did it! We won!

                         Fuckin' A! Woooooo!

               The three burnouts jump, scream, HOOT, and play air 
               instruments like loons as if they're the only ones in the 
               hall. They can't stop. The rest of the student body are not 
               amused

               INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

               Hawk, Trip, and Lex hold their trays over the counter as the 
               LUNCH LADIES fill them with Salisbury steak, hard dinner 
               rolls and scoops of bluish pudding. Ah, public school 
               nutrition.

                         This is the best thing that ever 
                         happened to me at school! Not only 
                         are we on again for KISS in Detroit, 
                         but we're actually sitting right at 
                         the fifty yard line! I dare you dudes 
                         to find a curlier scenario.

                         Yeah? I have a saying too, Lex. It 
                         goes, "Catch my jizz in your mouth 
                         and stop jinxing us, asshole." We're 
                         going this time and that's all there

                         There is a catch.

               Hawk's really got their attention now.

                         with us tonight and give him one 
                         last curl before he starts serving 
                         his sentence.

                                     TRIP
                         Just for the record, I understood 
                         the last part of what you said, but 
                         for a while there you guys were making 
                         no fucking sense whatsoever.

                                     HAWK
                         I was just explaining to Lex here 
                         what you and I already know. Just 
                         had to make it a little more 
                         complicated so he'd understand.

                                     LEX
                         Very funny, Hawk. Okay, I'm in on 
                         this hare-brained scheme, but if 
                         anything happens to my mom's car, 
                         I'm blaming you. I'll say you drugged 
                         me or something.

                                     HAWK
                         Curly.

               Hawk scopes out the cafeteria to make sure the coast is clear.

                                     HAWK
                         Ok, dudes, follow my lead.

                                     LEX
                         Wait a minute. We ditching the rest 
                         of school?

                                     TRIP
                         About fuckin' time if you ask me. 
                         I'm just going through the motions 
                         till I drop out anyway.

                                     LEX
                         Hello summer detention.

                                     HAWK
                         As I was saying, follow my lead. And 
                         maintain. Elvis just showed up.

               Hawk points across the cafeteria and sure enough Elvis has 
               just entered. Luckily, he hasn't noticed the boys yet.

               Elvis swaggers to a table of CHEERLEADERS, puts his leg on a 
               chair and starts a one-sided conversation with them. They 
               promptly push their trays away, having lost their appetites.

               Meanwhile, back at the condiment tray, Hawk and Trip each 
               grab a big handful of ketchup packets and head to a table. 
               Lex reluctantly follows suit grabbing a big handful of ketchup 
               packets too. All three of them put their trays down and sit.

                                     HAWK
                              (eyeing Elvis)
                         Five second rule, boys. See you on 
                         the other side.

               Hawk approaches the exit door, glances either way, then 
               leaves.

               Trip and Lex look at their watches for five seconds. Then 
               Trip heads for the exit door also.

               Lex still stares at his watch. After five, he looks at Elvis, 
               who stops talking to the cheerleaders. As if possessing some 
               sixth sense, Elvis turns quickly and looks STRAIGHT INTO 
               CAMERA.

               ELVIS'S POV -- He spots the swinging exit door and an empty 
               table with three full lunch trays sitting on it.

                                     ELVIS
                         Excuse me, ladies.

               Relieved he's gone, the cheerleaders start eating again.

               Elvis moves through the cafeteria in SLOW MOTION toward the 
               exit door. The hunter in action.

               INT. HALLWAY - DAY

               Elvis pushes through the door and into a hall, dead-eye stare 
               focused up ahead where the hallway turns sharply. He catches 
               a glimpse of Lex. Smiling like the devil, Elvis bolts.

               INT. OTHER HALLWAY - DAY

               Lex catches up with Hawk and Trip just as Elvis swings around 
               the corner and marauds after them CACKLING maniacally. A mad 
               chase ensues. Down hallways. Around corners. Upstairs. Down 
               ramps.

               Hawk, Trip, and Lex scramble as fast as they can to escape 
               the clutches of their sideburn-clad nemesis.

               As the boys pass a classroom, a NERD comes out pushing a 
               projector on an AV cart. Thinking fast, Hawk grabs it out of 
               the nerd's hands and pushes it down the hall at Elvis.

                                     NERD
                         Hey, I'm responsible for that!

               CRASH! Elvis bashes face-first into the rolling cart. He and 
               the projector go tumbling. Not wasting a second, Elvis is 
               back on his feet and after them again. The nerd grabs his 
               hair in horror at the sight of the smashed projector.

               AROUND A CORNER

               Elvis SKIDS around the corner and trips on a fire hose 
               stretched across the floor from its glass box to a water 
               fountain pipe. He slides on his belly along the polished 
               floor unable to stop.

               INT. ENGLISH CLASS - DAY

               Old MISS HIBBS is lecturing on MOBY DICK. The kids are dozing.

                                     MISS HIBBS
                         Then a cry from the crow's nest... 
                         "Thar she blows!"

               Suddenly, a screaming Elvis slides into the open door on his 
               stomach and bowls Miss Hibbs over like a Brunswick. He clamors 
               to his feet and shoots out the room leaving everyone stunned.

               INT. HALLWAY - DAY

               Pausing at the corner, Elvis takes a breath and leaps around 
               it. He smiles at what he sees.

               Up ahead, Hawk, Lex, and Trip stand on a 3-stair stoop, 
               desperately pulling at a locked door. Elvis smiles. They 
               GULP.

                                     ELVIS
                         KISS concert? Kiss my ass morelike. 
                         A nice, fat detention oughta put a 
                         crimp in this evening's plans.

               Elvis takes his key ring off his belt and begins twirling 
               it. The boys turn and face him. He savors the moment.

                                     ELVIS
                         Looking for something, rodents?

                                     HAWK
                         Yeah, Elvis...

               Hawk's brow furrows as he pulls about fifty ketchup packets 
               out of his pocket. Trip and Lex do the same.

                                     HAWK
                         ..Your ass on a lunch tray.

               Elvis laughs and lurches forward -- the boys' cue to drop 
               the ketchup packets at their feet and...

                                     HAWK
                         On your marks and...

               Trip and Lex ready themselves, then...

                                     HAWK
                         Fire!

               They start stomping on the packets, squirting Elvis's face 
               and torso with tomato-based condiment causing him to let out 
               a scream that lasts the rest of the scene. Ketchup spatters 
               across his body in SUPER SLOW MOTION. A shot hits him in the 
               mouth and he COUGHS it back out in mid-scream.

               The boys stomp relentlessly, mercilessly, blasting their 
               nemesis with hideous cafeteria red as Elvis throws his arms 
               back, body quaking at every splat. It's kind of like the 
               scene in "The Godfather" where Sonny gets it.

               Beaten and spent, his scream now dried up to a hoarse GASPING, 
               Elvis slips on some ketchup at his feet. He hits the floor 
               with a THUD right in the goop. He lays there letting out DRY 
               SOBS looking like a bunless wiener.

               Hawk jumps off the stoop. Taking Elvis's key chain away, he 
               hops back up and unlocks the door letting Trip and Lex out. 
               Hawk whips the keys back at Elvis, hitting him in the head, 
               then flashes a pearly Error Flynn smile.

                                     HAWK
                         Elvis, you ain't nothin' but a hot 
                         dog.

               Hawk bolts out the door. Elvis tries to get up only to slip 
               in the muck again and fall back down twice as hard.

                                     ELVIS
                         Nooooo!!

                                        JAILBREAK

               EXT. STREET IN THE NEXT COUNTY - DAY

               C/U on the grill of a moving car, Ohio vanity plate reading: 
               Ob-GYN.

               PULL BACK to reveal it's on a brand spanking-new, brown Volvo 
               242 DL hauling ass. Hawk drives, Lex rides shotgun, and Trip 
               sits in the back, arms draped over the front seat.

               EXT. ST. BERNARD'S - DAY

               The Volvo turns and barrels up St. Bernard's gated entrance.

                         school again.

                         Huh. St. Bernard's. Figures it's 
                         named after a canine.

               Hawk and Trip roll their eyes.

               INT. ST. BERNARD'S BOARDING SCHOOL - DAY

               Mrs. Bruce and FATHER McNULTY stand outside his office. The 
               door is open a tad. Jam sits just beyond it, but all we see 
               are his corduroyed legs which shake. Jam is one nervous kid.

                                     MRS. BRUCE
                         Again, many thanks and praise to you 
                         for seeing Jeremiah on such short 
                         notice.

               Father McNulty has a look of utter compassion on his face.

                                     FATHER MCNULTY
                         Anything for a potential tuition... 
                         to be given to charity of course.

                                     MRS. BRUCE
                         God bless you, Father McNulty.

                                     FATHER MCNULTY
                         He already has.

               They hug. She exits. And the look of utter compassion on 
               Father McNulty's face disappears.

               INT. FATHER MCNULTY'S OFFICE - DAY

               The priest enters, SLAMS the door shut, startling Jam, and 
               sits in front of a painting of the Virgin Mary on his wall. 
               The name plate on his desk reads: FR. PHILIP McNULTY.

                                     FATHER MCNULTY
                         Before enrolling you, Jeremiah, let 
                         me just say it would be greatly 
                         appreciated if your career at St. 
                         Bernard's was an uneventful one. 
                         Some students believe they can get 
                         expelled through disobedience and 
                         recklessness. What they don't 
                         understand is even after God's 
                         vengeance is meted out, He forgives. 
                         That His devastating anger is followed 
                         by His nurturing compassion. In a 
                         nutshell, St. Bernard's may punish 
                         you even for the slightest digression, 
                         but will never cast you out, even 
                         for the largest. So here you are, 
                         Jeremiah... here to stay!

               Father McNulty sticks the pencil into an electric pencil 
               sharpener and it makes the same NOISE a DENTIST'S DRILL does 
               when burrowing into a molar. Jam shudders.

               The Father removes the pencil and blows the shavings away 
               from the needle-sharp tip.

                                     FATHER MCNULTY
                         Let's begin the enrollment, shall 
                         we?

               EXT. ST. BERNARD'S - DAY

               Mrs. Bruce exits the building and approaches her car. She 
               stops when she sees the '78 brown Volvo parked behind her. 
               It's empty. She shrugs and gets into her car, driving off.

               Inside the Volvo Hawk, Trip, and Lex poke their heads up. 
               The coast is clear so they can sit straight again. They stare 
               up at a second story window where they see part of Jam's 
               profile.

                                     LEX
                         Now, how are we gonna do this?

                                     HAWK
                         Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think.

               They hear an ENGINE and turn to see a delivery truck labelled 
               PIZZA PIG parking behind them. A DELIVERY BOY holding a pizza 
               box steps out. Trip's mouth waters.

                                     TRIP
                              (licking his chops)
                         Mmm, pizza...

               Seeing the boys, the delivery boy stops at the Volvo.

                                     DELIVERY BOY
                         Hey, you guys know where...
                              (looks at slip on box)
                         Philip McNutly's office is?

               Hawk, Trip, and Lex exchange an anxious glance, then Hawk 
               smiles. He is officially inspired as he turns to the boy.

                                     HAWK
                         Yeah, I'm Philip McNutly.

               INT. FATHER MCNULTY'S OFFICE - DAY

               The Father TAPS his pencil looking impatiently at Jam who 
               has totally withdrawn. He sits motionless staring into space.

                                     FATHER MCNULTY
                         Jeremiah, are you aware you need to 
                         answer these questions, not just 
                         listen to them? Jeremiah?

               Jam doesn't respond.

                                     FATHER MCNULTY
                         Please don't become difficult this 
                         early in your stay. I hate 
                         disciplining boys before I get to 
                         know them.

               A NUN enters KNOCKING.

                                     NUN
                         Forgive me, Father. A young man here 
                         with a pizza for you?

                                     FATHER MCNULTY
                         Ah, yes! Send him in Sister Conimaria.

               The nun exits and a second later Hawk enters wearing Lex's 
               baseball cap pulled down over his eyes.

                                     FATHER MCNULTY
                         Well, what's the damage, pizza fellow?

                                     HAWK
                         Ten even.

               The priest swivels his chair around and unlocks a box labelled 
               "Donations." While he looks for cash, Hawk gives Jam a 
               discreet kick in the shin. Jam looks up and recognizes Hawk. 
               He then looks out the window seeing Trip, Lex, and the Volvo 
               below.

               For the first time we see what Jam looks like with a big, 
               fat, shit-eating grin on his face.

                                     HAWK
                              (whispering to Jam)
                         If he offers you a slice, you're not 
                         the least bit hungry, check?

                                     JAM
                              (whispering)
                         Check.

               Father McNulty swivels back around with a ten.

                                     FATHER MCNULTY
                         Here's ten and I'm donating your tip 
                         to the church. The Lord thanks you.

                                     HAWK
                         Tell the Big Guy not to mention it.

               Hawk takes the ten, tips the brim of the baseball cap and 
               leaves, giving Jam a cautious wink as he goes.

                                     FATHER MCNULTY
                         And not a moment too soon. I'm 
                         famished. I hope you brought a lunch 
                         for yourself.

                                     JAM
                         No, but I'm not hungry anyway.

               Father McNulty raises his eyebrows, then opens the pizza 
               box.

                                     FATHER MCNULTY
                         Well! It finally speaks. There's one 
                         barrier we've broken through.

               Father McNulty smiles, taking a big bite. Jam smiles for an 
               entirely different reason. The priest mumbles with a mouthful.

                                     FATHER MCNULTY
                         You know, your coming here reminds 
                         me of a gospel called The Prodigal 
                         Son.

               Jam grins a bit feigning interest.

                                     FATHER MCNULTY
                         There was once a farmer who had two 
                         sons. Both grew up on the farm, 
                         helping their father until...
                              (suddenly alarmed)
                         GYYAACK!

               Father McNulty GAGS sticking his pizza-covered tongue out. 
               He pours himself a glass of wine and sucks it down looking 
               concerned for the moment. Finally, he BELCHES.

                                     FATHER MCNULTY
                         That was a very stale mushroom.
                              (beat)
                         Where was I?... Ah, yes, one day the 
                         elder son decided to leave the farm...

               INT. VOLVO - DAY

               Hawk, Trip, and Lex look up at Father McNulty's window.

                                     TRIP
                         Usually takes anywhere from ten 
                         minutes to half an hour.

               They look at their watches, then back at the window.

                                     HAWK
                         Shit! This is such a lousy view. How 
                         the hell are we gonna know when he's 
                         lit?

               Just then, INSANE LAUGHTER bellows from the window above.

                                     TRIP
                         He's lit.

               INT. FATHER MCNULTY'S OFFICE - DAY

               The Father has undergone a metamorphosis. He's redder than a 
               boiling lobster, his eyes bulge and he's laughing the deepest 
               laugh a man can without risking psychological evaluation.

               Jam watches fascinated as the priest tries to finish the 
               story. It's not every day you see a holy man tripping on 
               shrooms.

                                     FATHER MCNULTY
                              (in mid-guffaw)
                         So then, the younger one says, "But 
                         dad... I've been helping you on the 
                         farm my entire life!
                              (belly laugh)
                         You never once slaughtered the fatted 
                         calf for me!" And then...
                              (more belly laughter)
                         Forgive me, Jeremiah, it's just 
                         that... I've been telling this gospel 
                         for years and... I just now realized 
                         it's the work of some comedy 
                         mastermind! The Prodigal Son is a 
                         barrel of fucking monkeys!

               Father McNulty belly laughs so hard this time, he slides off 
               his chair hitting his chin on the edge of his desk. He is in 
               pain only momentarily, then laughs again, this time at his 
               own pratfall. He hoists himself back into his chair.

               Hawk, Trip, and Lex suddenly barge into the office, followed 
               by the outraged nun.

                                     NUN
                         You kids can't go in there!

                                     HAWK
                         It's okay, we're old buds of Father 
                         McNulty... How's it hangin', padre?

                                     FATHER MCNULTY
                         A little to the right, pizza fellow.

               Father McNulty laughs some more.

                                     HAWK
                         That was another dude. Anyway, we're 
                         here to take our bud Jam to the big 
                         satanic KISS concert tonight. Okay 
                         with you?

                                     FATHER MCNULTY
                              (waving)
                         Rock on!

               Jam gets up and all four boys exit.

                                     FATHER MCNULTY
                              (yelling after them)
                         Give my regards to the guy with the 
                         really big tongue!

               The nun looks at the priest, deep concern in her eyes.

                                     FATHER MCNULTY
                         What the hell are you doing, Sister 
                         Gonorrhea, waiting for a bus?

               He lets out a belly laugh as the shocked nun runs from the 
               office. Father McNulty laughs even louder at her behavior, 
               POUNDING his fists on the desk, tears rolling down his cheeks, 
               until...

               He suddenly glimpses at the painting of the Virgin Mary and 
               abruptly stops laughing. What appears to be extreme contrition 
               washes over his face as he moves closer to the painting.

                                     FATHER MCNULTY
                         Jesus H. Christ, look at all the 
                         colors.

                                          GUIDOS

               INT. VOLVO - DAY

               Hawk drives, Trip rides shotgun, Lex and Jam sit in the back.  
               Stoked beyond belief, Jam POUNDS his drumsticks on the 
               upholstery to the beat of a rockin' KISS tune playing on the 
               8-track.

                                     JAM
                         Oh, man, my mom is gonna send me to 
                         Alcatraz for this and I don't even 
                         care! I'm gonna see Peter Criss's 
                         drum solo!

               Lex taps Jam on the shoulder.

                                     LEX
                         Not looking like that, Mr. Rogers.

               Lex hands him a paper bag with jeans and a tee-shirt in it.

                                     LEX
                         We got you a change of duds when we 
                         picked up the car.

                                     HAWK
                         Next stop: the 2:45 to Detroit Rock 
                         City!

               The boys do their Three Stooges handshake and say "Curly!"

               Jam starts to change. Just then, the Volvo passes a two-tone 
               Chevy Impala with luggage tied to the roof. The passenger in 
               the back seat turns and spots Jam pulling off his pants. 
               It's Beth. Her eyes bulge. Beth parents are in the front.

               Jam spots her and beams. Their eyes lock. She waves and starts 
               to yell something, when... suddenly... BANG!

               The boys look out the driver's side of the car to see the 
               rear hubcap rolling away. They've got a flat.

                                     LEX
                              (screams)
                         My mom's hubcap!

               The car fishtails and weaves but Hawk manages to pull over. 
               The Chevy continues on, Beth gazing out the rear window sadly.

                                     HAWK
                         Shit!
                              (looks at car clock)
                         Anybody know how long it takes to 
                         fix a flat?

               EXT. LOCAL TRAIN STOP - DAY

               ANGLE ON a status report. The 2:45 is now leaving. We see is 
               Hawk, Trip, Lex, and Jam running alongside a train as it 
               picks up speed by the second. They YELL for it to stop, but 
               it's hopeless. The train is gone. So much for the 2:45.

               INT. VOLVO - DAY

               Lex looks at the speedometer. Hawk's got it up to ninety-
               five.

                                     LEX
                         Jeezis, Hawk, can you at least keep 
                         it within twenty miles of the speed 
                         limit?

                                     HAWK
                         Lex, am I gonna have to lock you in 
                         the trunk till we reach Detroit? 
                         Don't worry, these babies are built 
                         for speed.

               Trip holds his stomach as we hear it GROWL.

                                     TRIP
                         I'm starvin' and it's way past 
                         lunchtime.

                                     HAWK
                         Totally. All I've had for chow was a 
                         packet of Pop Rocks and a Yoo-hoo.

               Trip spots a sign on the side of the road: Next Exit, 
               Sandusky.

                                     TRIP
                         Let's stop in Sandusky, Hawk.

                         What's in Sandusky?

                                     TRIP
                         Pizza, and I been jones-in' for a 
                         pizza ever since we left St. 
                         Bernard's.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               MOMENTS LATER

               INT. VOLVO - DAY

               The boys chomp on their pizza slices and chug cans of Hawaiian 
               Punch. Another raucous KISS tune BLARES.

               Behind them, a car horn starts HONKING rhythmically. Hawk 
               looks into the rearview mirror and sees two guys and two 
               girls in a tailgating Trans Am.

               The guys have 90 M.P.H. haircuts, tacky, wide-collared shirts, 
               and massive amounts of jewelry on their necks.

               The girls wear 10-layer make-up, mega-jewelry, and hair teased 
               so high, it touches the car's roof.

                                     HAWK
                         Only a car full of guidos and stellas 
                         would ride someone's ass on a two-
                         lane road and beep.

               INT. TRANS AM - DAY

               The speakers BLAST a DISCO SONG to which the four passengers 
               sing. KENNY, the driver, HONKS to the disco beat.

               They're slightly older than our heroes and very full of 
               themselves. Kenny and his best girl CHRISTINE sit in the 
               front. BOBBY and BARBARA are in the back. It's a double disco 
               date.

               INT. VOLVO - DAY

               Trip lifts a rubbery slice of pizza to his mouth and the top 
               layer slides off PLOPPING into his lap.

                                     TRIP
                         Eyowch! This is one hot pizza!

                                     LEX
                         Trip, huck that out before it stains 
                         the upholstery!

               Trip grabs the wad of goop and throws it out the window.

               Just as the DISCO TUNE playing in the Trans Am hits the next 
               chorus, a fistful of pizza SPLATTERS across the windshield. 
               Freaked, Kenny swerves and zigzags all over the road.

               Righting himself, Kenny's entire family might as well have 
               been insulted.

                                     KENNY
                         Stop singing... NOW!

               He turns off the stereo and floors the accelerator, swerving 
               into the left lane and passing the Volvo. Bobby is just now 
               noticing the mess on the windshield.

               He starts to laugh.

                                     BOBBY
                         Hey, Kenny, look! There's a hunk of 
                         fawkin' cheese on your windsheel!

               INT. VOLVO - DAY

               Lex is looking at the mess on the Trans Am's windshield and 
               the anger in the eyes of its passengers.

                                     LEX
                         Holy shit! We just pissed off the 
                         Incredible Hulk, his idiot half 
                         brother and two circus clowns.

               The Trans Am runs alongside the Volvo and Hawk turns to see 
               Kenny pointing to the breakdown lane.

                                     KENNY
                         Stop the friggin' car NOW!

               Hawk rolls up his window. Kenny yells, VOICE MUFFLED, and 
               points to Hawk who pays absolutely no attention whatsoever.

                                     JAM
                         Don't you think we should at least 
                         pull over and offer to clean it off?

                                     HAWK
                         What?! Are you mentally deranged, 
                         Jam?

               Just then, SLAM, the Trans Am bangs up against the side of 
               the Volvo pushing it onto the shoulder.

                                     HAWK
                         What the fuck!

                                     LEX
                              (freaking out)
                         The paint!

               EXT. FREEWAY - DAY

               The Trans Am muscles the Volvo into the breakdown lane. 
               Parking the ass end of the Pontiac out a bit, Kenny blocks 
               the Volvo in. Kenny and Bobby climb from their car and storm 
               over to the boys.

               Hawk opens his door just as Kenny's hairy-knuckled hands 
               pull him out through the window. He grabs Trip, yanking him 
               out too. Bobby opens the back door and does the same with 
               Lex and Jam.

               With a kid in each hand now, Kenny and Bobby SLAM the four 
               boys against the Volvo in a line. The size difference between 
               the burnouts and the guidos is painfully obvious now. Kenny 
               and Bobby are Neanderthals.

                                     KENNY
                         Do you realize the sheer, goddamn, 
                         unadulterated, undiluted, no holds 
                         barred, one hundred percent pure as 
                         Ivory Snow, absolutely friggin' 
                         STUPIDITY of what you just did?

                                     HAWK
                         Hey, disco dude, it's cool...

               Kenny hauls back and SLAPS the row of boys in the faces Three 
               Stooges-style... WHACKWHACKWHACKWHACK!

                                     KENNY
                         DO YOU?!

               Trip, Lex, and Jam clutch their faces in pain. Hawk looks 
               merely disenchanted as Kenny pokes a muscle-bound finger at 
               his chest. Getting in Hawk's face, Kenny yammers loud and 
               fast.

                                     KENNY
                         Lemme paint you a friggin' picture 
                         ahright? Imagine if you will a 1978 
                         Pontiac Trans American in pristine 
                         condition.
                              (beat)
                         An appealing portrait, nesspah?

               Hawk starts to say "yes."

                                     KENNY
                         BUT WAIT! What's that spec on the 
                         windshield? Could it be a wad of 
                         melted mozzarella, tangy tomato sauce, 
                         and various friggin' meat products?

               Hawk is unimpressed.

                                     HAWK
                         Could be.

                                     KENNY
                         And if it ain't cleaned off?

                                     CHRISTINE
                         Kenny, come on with the macho crap 
                         already. Like this kid could take 
                         you in a fight anyway.

                                     KENNY
                              (ignoring Christine)
                         Answer me, hippie girl. And if the 
                         mess ain't cleaned off my car?

                                     HAWK
                         It could... bake on?

               Kenny looks at Bobby and they exchange moronic grins.

                                     KENNY
                         You're a smart little homo, aren't 
                         you, hippie girl? But, while astounded 
                         at your nimble, friggin' insight, I 
                         still detect an issue hanging fire, 
                         namely: where does a sharp-witted 
                         faggot like yourself get off doing 
                         such a dopey thing like that there?

               Hawk figured out that any answer he gives will be incorrect 
               and has decided to wait till Kenny's done.

                                     KENNY
                         No really, I'm perplexed. I mean, 
                         could you have done stupider if you 
                         were born without a FUCKIN' HEAD?!

                                     CHRISTINE
                              (using "oh" to mean 
                              "enough")
                         Oh! With the language!

                                     KENNY
                         Shut-up, Christine!

               Christine snarls at Kenny.

                                     HAWK
                         Okay, Kenny? I don't mean to drain 
                         your keg or anything, but could you 
                         speed up this process?
                              (beat)
                         Don't get me wrong, we'd love to 
                         stand here and get shit on by the 
                         cast of Saturday Night Fever, but 
                         we're also on a schedule. So step on 
                         it.

               Cold silence as Kenny replays Hawk's insult over in his head.

                                     KENNY
                         Are you gettin' wise with me?

                                     HAWK
                         No, I'm dumber than a goddamn slug. 
                         Now can I please clean your windshield 
                         and leave without further ado?

                                     BOBBY
                         Break his fawkin' legs, Kenny!

               Kenny's temper's rising faster than the price of gasoline.  
               Hawk on the other hand is cooler than an Otter Pop.

                                     KENNY
                         Oh, you're dumb all right, you hairy 
                         ass punk. But please, allow me to 
                         clean the friggin' windshield. I 
                         insist.

               And with that, Kenny grabs himself a fistful of Hawk's long 
               hair and pulls him over to the Trans Am. He wipes the pizza 
               off with Hawk's hair, tugging Hawk's head up and down, back 
               and forth. Hawk GRUNTS with each wipe, but doesn't give Kenny 
               the satisfaction of hearing him scream.

               Trip, Lex, and Jam watch helplessly, trapped under Bobby's 
               dull-witted, but equally threatening gaze.

               Kenny gets the last of the big chunks off his windshield and 
               looks at his handiwork.

                                     KENNY
                         There. Nice and clean.

               He throws Hawk to the ground and smiles at Bobby. Then, he 
               suddenly hears the KISS tune coming from the Volvo. Uh-oh!

                                     KENNY
                         Oh, no, no, no! It's the fag band!

               Kenny clenches his jaws and walks up to the Volvo, reaching 
               in the driver's door. Suddenly Jam grabs his wrist.

                                     JAM
                         Whoa! This is about pizza! Let's 
                         leave KISS out of it. Please.

                                     KENNY
                         A bunch of guys who make bad music, 
                         dress like freaks, and wear more 
                         make-up than all my sisters combined?  
                         These assholes must be stopped!

               Kenny pushes Jam away.

                                     CHRISTINE
                         That's it, Kenny! I'm leaving!

               Christine gets out of the car and starts walking down the 
               highway, exiting the scene.

                                     BARBARA
                         Oh, Christine! You googatz in the 
                         head or something? We're on the side 
                         of the freakin' highway!

                                     BOBBY
                         Let her go, Barbara, she'll come 
                         back to Kenny. She always does...
                              (to Kenny)
                         Right, Kenny?

               Kenny meanwhile has his arm in the Volvo.

                                     KENNY
                         Kool and the Gang, now there's real 
                         music.

               Kenny takes the 8-track from the car...

                                     KENNY
                         But this... is crap!

               He flings it into the highway, where it is summarily smashed 
               to bits under the wheels of a passing semi.

               FOLLOW a chunk of cartridge and a strand of mangled tape 
               streaming from it as it sails back toward the side of the 
               road, landing at Jam's feet.

               TILT UP to Jam's face. He raises his eyes and turns to the 
               CAMERA, a single tear rolling down his cheek, just like the 
               Indian in that "Keep America Beautiful" litter ad.

               Hawk rises and Kenny comes face-to-face with him.

                                     KENNY
                         So. All that having been said and 
                         done, I believe we are ready for the 
                         final topic of discussion. Namely: 
                         Have you learned your lesson yet, 
                         puke?

               Hawk pulls a cigarette from his pocket and lights it. He 
               blows some smoke in Kenny's face.

                                     HAWK
                         Well, let's recap, shall we? You 
                         slapped all of us, yelled at me, 
                         used my head for a rag, threw me on 
                         the ground and tossed our LOVE GUN 8-
                         track under the wheels of a passing 
                         semi.
                              (puffing on cig)
                         So, if the lesson was that you're a 
                         dick with ears and a really bad 
                         haircut, then, yes... I'd say we 
                         learned it.

                                     KENNY
                              (beat, in disbelief)
                         Excuse me, I'm a little deef-a-
                         hearin'. Can you repeat yourself?

                                     HAWK
                         Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. 
                         Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.

                                     KENNY
                         Oh, yeah...?

               Out of original material, Kenny goes for an old stand by.

                                     KENNY
                         That's not what your mother said 
                         last night.

               Trip, Lex, and Jam exchange "uh-oh" glances. Meanwhile, Hawk's 
               eyes glaze over.

                                     HAWK
                         It's not, huh? Well, then, tell me...

               Hawk reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out his mostly 
               empty can of Hawaiian Punch, holding it discreetly at his 
               side.

                                     HAWK
                         ...what exactly did my mother say 
                         last night?

               Kenny draws a blank, not being prepared for this one.

                                     HAWK
                         You heard me, prick. What did my 
                         mother say last night?

               Kenny chuckles and looks at Bobby. They have a good little 
               laugh... the homo's got balls! Then Kenny turns back to Hawk.

                                     KENNY
                         Okay, fagmo... I'll tell you what 
                         your mother said last night.
                              (beat)
                         She said that I was the fuck of her 
                         life.

               Hawk is a little mad now. He tosses his cigarette to the 
               ground and squashes it like a bug under his sneaker.

                                     HAWK
                              (very Clint Eastwood)
                         How would you like a nice Hawaiian 
                         Punch?

                                     KENNY
                              (smirking)
                         Sure.

               Quick as a shot, Hawk SLAMS the bottom of the can into Kenny's 
               nose, crushing it flat against his face. Hawaiian backwash 
               spews from its tab hole like blood as Kenny falls backwards 
               from the impact. He hits his head on the ground.

               Taking this as a cue... Trip whips out his wallet on a 
               chain... Lex rips off his KISS belt... And Jam yanks out his 
               drumsticks.

               As if choreographed, Trip swoops the wallet at Bobby's feet, 
               snagging him around the ankles tightly with the chain. Lex 
               THWAMS Bobby in the face with his big KISS belt buckle leaving 
               a reversed, red, KISS logo branded in his forehead.

               Trip yanks the chain pulling Bobby off his feet. When he 
               hits the ground, Jam's right there DRUMMING his balls.

               Bobby shrieks.

               Meanwhile, Hawk advances on Kenny who tries to get the can 
               off his face, but it's stuck on looking like a pig's nose 
               with fruit punch for snot.

               Hawk raises both his hands in Kenny's face, then executes 
               the final insult... Hawk messes Kenny's hair. Kenny lets out 
               a scream that comes from the bottom of his vanity.

               Hawk grabs Kenny by the ears and brings the guido's head 
               swiftly against his kneecap. Kenny falls to the ground, 
               unconscious on top of Bobby. Their heads collide knocking 
               Bobby out cold.

               Terrified, Barbara leaps from the Trans Am and is cornered.

                                     LEX
                         Not so fast, stella.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               MOMENTS LATER

               Kenny, Bobby, and Barbara are now tied to the guardrail with 
               Jam's white corduroy pants, geeky belt, and plaid shirt. 
               Kenny and Bobby rest their unconscious heads on each of 
               Barbara's shoulders.

               Hawk, Trip, Lex, and Jam look down at the two guidos and the 
               stella, snickering.

                                     BARBARA
                         When they wake up, they're gonna 
                         come looking for you jerks. You best 
                         hope they don't find you, cause if 
                         they do, they're gonna kick your 
                         asses.

               Hawk grabs a cinderblock off the side of the road, walking 
               up to the Trans Am.

                                     HAWK
                         Right, stella, and we'll deserve it.  
                         But let's really make it worth their 
                         while.

               Hawk puts the rock on the Trans Am's accelerator letting the 
               engine WHINE in protest. (Again we are cautious not to show 
               the guidos' faces.)

                                     HAWK
                         By the way, when Kenny wakes up could 
                         you give him a message for me. Tell 
                         him, quote, Kool and the gang bite 
                         my bag, motherfucker, unquote.

               He throws the Trans Am into drive.

               All who are conscience listen to the brief SCREECH, then 
               watch the Trans Am as it barrels without a driver into the 
               woods skirting the highway.

               It races into ditches, bounces off trees, and SPLASHES through 
               ponds, all Smokey and the Bandit-like.

               The disco-mobile ramps off the edge of an embankment, tumbles 
               down a steep, rocky incline breaking apart along the way, 
               and finally, BOOM! It explodes on final impact.

               The boys all look at each other and shrug. Hawk walks back 
               to the Volvo and gets in. Trip, Lex, and Jam follow suit and 
               pile in as well. Lex shouts back to Barbara.

                                     LEX
                         Oh, thanks for letting us draw from 
                         your ample make-up supply. You must 
                         have the entire Revlon factory in 
                         your purse!

               ANGLE ON KENNY, BOBBY, AND BARBARA.

               We now see them from the front. Lo-and-behold, Kenny has 
               been made-up like Gene Simmons, Bobby like Paul Stanley.  
               Whoever finds them is gonna get the wrong idea about their 
               musical taste... and kick their asses all over again.

                                     BARBARA
                         Very funny. I hope you choke!

                                     STELLA ON BOARD

               INT. VOLVO - DAY

               Hawk starts the engine and takes off. Trip pulls a baggie of 
               weed and some rolling papers out.

                                     JAM
                         Hey, look, it's that girl.

               Jam points out at the road ahead to Christine. She's a few 
               hundred feet away walking sadly in the breakdown lane.

                                     TRIP
                         That's no girl. That's a stella.

                                     JAM
                         Stella or no stella, we should pull 
                         over and help her out.

                                     HAWK
                         Oh no, Jam. I'm not falling for that 
                         twice.

                                     JAM
                         Well, couldn't you slow down so I 
                         can at least state my case, Hawk? If 
                         you don't like it, you can speed up 
                         and I'll never mention it again.

               Hawk slows down, turning into the breakdown lane, travelling 
               about two miles per hour. Christine doesn't notice as they 
               edge closer to her.

                                     LEX
                         What is it with you, Jam? You got a 
                         thing for that... thing?

                                     JAM
                         She's a teenage girl walking on the 
                         side of the highway. They make very 
                         scary movies that start out like 
                         that.

                                     HAWK
                         Well, they may not make movies about 
                         four dudes going to a KISS concert. 
                         But if they ever did, the four dudes 
                         most certainly would not stop and 
                         pick up a stranded disco bunny.

               Pause.

                                     TRIP
                         Unless there was gonna be a scene 
                         where the disco bunny blows the four 
                         dudes on the way to the show.

               INT. VOLVO - DAY

               Christine sits between Jam and Lex in the back SNAPPING gum.  
               Jam and Lex stare at her like cats looking at a fish bowl.

               Hawk looks in the rearview mirror at Christine checking 
               herself in a compact. She swathes on some 7-Up flavored, 
               Bonnie Bell lip gloss.

               Trip meanwhile twirls the joint he's just finished rolling 
               in his mouth, sealing it. He winks at her disgustingly.

                                     CHRISTINE
                         Oh, great. I just hitched a ride 
                         with a bunch of potheads... I'm 
                         hooking up with some people at this 
                         funky place in downtown Detroit called 
                         Disco Inferno. Mind droppin' me there?

                                     TRIP
                              (smirks)
                         What's it worth to you?

                                     CHRISTINE
                              (grossed out)
                         What the hell is that supposed to 
                         mean?

                                     JAM
                         It doesn't mean anything. Don't pay 
                         attention to him.

                                     HAWK
                              (rolls his eyes)
                         Disco Inferno? Disco's infernal 
                         morelike.

               Trying to be suave, Lex moves in close, putting the make on 
               her.

                                     LEX
                         Your clothes may say disco, but your 
                         eyes say rock 'n' roll, baby.

                                     CHRISTINE
                         Well, your tee-shirt may say rock 
                         'n' roll, but your breath says 
                         pepperoni, baby.

               She pushes him away. Jam laughs.

                         guy to impress her, Jam. She's

                         Whatever... stella.

               Trip lights the joint and takes a lungful of pot. He passes 
               it to Lex and the joint begins to make its rounds with the 
               exception of Christine. The car starts to fill with smoke.

                                     CHRISTINE
                         The name's Christine, not stella.  
                         And there's no need to be such pigs 
                         just cause I prefer Donna Summer or 
                         KC and the Sunshine Boys or the 
                         Village People over KISS?

                         thing straight here. As far as I'm 
                         concerned good tunes is good tunes, 
                         be it disco or rock or polka or 
                         whatever have you, regardless of the 
                         category. True, if I had to choose, 
                         I'd pick the category labelled disco 
                         because I happen to enjoy dancing. 
                         Disco is just easier to dance to.

                         like that in private if you paid me.

                         Now there's an intelligently biting 
                         remark wrought with wit and irony.

               Trip looks confused, then smiles thinking she paid him a 
               compliment.

                                     HAWK
                         Hey, if you don't like that one, 
                         maybe you'll think it's funny when 
                         we throw your ass out the goddamn 
                         car!

                                     CHRISTINE
                         Yeah, why don't you put your money 
                         where your mouth is?

                                     HAWK
                         Why don't you kiss my hairy crack?

                                     CHRISTINE
                         Why don't you bend over, you're 
                         looking right at it!

               All, Christine included, pause to think about what that 
               comment was supposed to mean. Lex takes a hit off the joint.

                                     LEX
                              (holding in smoke)
                         That last remark fell about 30 yards 
                         away from making any sense whatsoever.

               Hawk and Trip immediately bust into the giggles and it doesn't 
               take long for Lex and Jam to follow suit.

                                     CHRISTINE
                              (realization)
                         Hey, you're right. "Bend over you're 
                         looking right at it?!"
                              (starts to laugh)
                         What's that supposed to mean anyway?

               Christine succumbs to the contagious giggle epidemic and the 
               whole car gets a great laugh for a while.

               They finally calm down again and wipe tears from their eyes.  
               Lex still has the joint now as Christine looks at it.

                                     CHRISTINE
                         Man, this is some kickass shit!
                              (beat)
                         Gimme a hit off that jay will ya?

               Lex smiles despite himself and holds the weed out to her as 
               we...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

                             HELLO DETROIT, GOODBYE TICKETS!

               MONTAGE

               The Volvo passing a big sign that says: "Welcome to Michigan, 
               the Great Lakes State."

               The Volvo racing toward the Detroit skyline.

               Detroit landmarks: The General Motors Building, the Ford 
               Building, Motown Records, and finally...

               COBO HALL, where thousands of fans in KISS tees gather, 
               waiting for its doors to open.

               Unbelievable traffic stretches to an intersection at which 
               stand four key landmarks... a cathedral, a convenience store, 
               a parking lot, and a male strip joint. They face one another, 
               each on its own corner.

               A gigantic sign on the auditorium's facade flashes the 
               commandment, "YOU GOTTA LOSE YOUR MIND IN DETROIT ROCK CITY" 
               over and over again.

               EXT. COBO HALL - SUNSET

               The sun hangs low on this day as the Volvo sits in traffic, 
               passing Cobo Hall. Movement is nearly impossible.

               KISS FANS cram every square foot of open macadam, pushing 
               through the jammed cars. STREET VENDORS hawk KISS souvenirs 
               from tee-shirts to pennants. Some are in stands along the 
               sidewalk. Others come right up to car windows.

               INT. VOLVO - SUNSET

               Christine is fast asleep between Jam and Lex.

                                     LEX
                         Man, that weed knocked Christine on 
                         her ass. She's sleeping like a baby 
                         stella.

                                     TRIP
                              (whispers lustfully)
                         Let's lift up her shirt.

                                     HAWK
                              (pointing out 
                              windshield)
                         There it is!

               All look ahead. COBO Hall. A HALO GLOW forms around the 
               building accompanied by a CHOIR OF ANGELS.

                                     JAM
                              (in reverence)
                         We made it!

                                     LEX
                         Curly driving, Hawk. We still got 
                         two hours to spare.

                                     HAWK
                         Ample time to grab our tickets at 
                         the station. See, up ahead. W.A.R.P.

               One block on the left is the W.A.R.P. tower.

                                     HAWK
                         Hey, Look at the front entrance! A 
                         car's pulling out. The parking space 
                         from heaven. God is surely smiling 
                         down upon us tonight, dudes.

                                     JAM
                         Kind of funny, I thought He'd be 
                         pissed as hell at me.

               The opening to the Carpenters' "TOP OF THE WORLD" begins.

               INT. W.A.R.P. TOWER ELEVATOR - NIGHT

               "TOP OF THE WORLD" continues, playing through the speaker of 
               the ascending elevator inside which Hawk, Trip, Lex, and Jam 
               stand. They watch the numbers climb, smiling.

                                     HAWK
                         What was that D.J.'s name again?

                                     TRIP
                         Oh, I'll remember it till the day I 
                         die. His name was... Simpleton the 
                         Simian? No, Samson Samoan... No, 
                         simply, similar...

               INT. SIMPLE SIMON'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Hawk, Trip, Lex, and Jam poke their heads around the corner 
               of an office doorway totem pole-style.

                                     HAWK
                         Simple Simon?

               SIMPLE SIMON strikes a pose before a full-length mirror in a 
               glittery-back Gene Simmons tee-shirt, silver pants, and very 
               high heel boots. He has a huge Afro and bushy moustache. He 
               turns when he hears Hawk.

                                     SIMPLE SIMON
                         The one and only. But can you kids 
                         hurry this up? I'm due at Coco Hall 
                         in half an hour for the warm-up.

               They all enter and stand at Simple Simon's desk.

                                     HAWK
                         We're right behind you, Simo. Just 
                         wanted to thank you in advance for 
                         handing over those burly-ass tix me 
                         and my buds won this morning.

               The boys do a Three Stooges handshake and say "Curly!" Simple 
               Simon on the other hand suddenly appears nonplussed

                                     SIMPLE SIMON
                         Your name isn't Trip is it?

               INT. PRODUCER'S BOOTH - NIGHT

               Hawk, Trip, Lex, and Jam sit in the tiny producer's booth 
               with Simon who fast forwards a reel-to-reel tape through 
               some very loud, high-speed conversation and bits of music.

               Looking at the footage counter on the tape player, he slows 
               down at a certain point and lets the boys listen to this: 
               The CLICK of a phone being answered.

                                     SIMPLE SIMON'S VOICE
                         Simple Simon on the Rock, go caller.

                                     TRIP'S VOICE
                         Hello? Is this me? I'm Trip. Am I on 
                         the air?

                                     SIMPLE SIMON'S VOICE
                         I should hang up on you right now, 
                         but you're the right caller so answer 
                         quick or get your battleship sunk. 
                         What are the names of the four members 
                         of KISS?

                                     TRIP'S VOICE
                         Gene Klein, Stanley Eisen, Paul 
                         Frehley, and Peter...Criscula! Yeah, 
                         that's it!

               Pause.

                                     SIMPLE SIMON'S VOICE
                         Is that your final answer?

                                     TRIP'S VOICE
                              (with trepidation)
                         Yeah.

                                     SIMPLE SIMON'S VOICE
                              (building to crescendo)
                         Trip? You just got yourself four 
                         tickets and four backstage passes to 
                         KISS live at Cobo Hall tonight!

               Pause.

                                     TRIP'S VOICE
                         I did?

                                     SIMPLE SIMON'S VOICE
                         Yeah, you did!

                                     TRIP'S VOICE
                         Yeeeehaaawww!! This is totally fuckin' 
                         curly, man! Thank you God!

               CLI-CLICK.

                                     SIMPLE SIMON'S VOICE
                         Whoa, easy, Trip, this is radio, not 
                         "Taxi Driver." Now listen up cause 
                         this next part is crucial. Stay on 
                         the line so we can get your full 
                         name, information, and...

               DIAL TONE.

                                     SIMPLE SIMON'S VOICE
                         Trip? Trip? Oh, man, you didn't hang 
                         up on me did you? Trip?
                              (beat)
                         What kind of total moron would 
                         hang...?

               Simple Simon stops the tape and looks at the boys who look 
               like they've just been served a life sentence behind bars.

                                     SIMPLE SIMON
                         Well, there you have it. We had no 
                         choice but to give the tickets to 
                         the next caller. I'm sorry.

               Hawk, Trip, Lex, and Jam stare at the floor in silence.

                                     SIMPLE SIMON
                         We got sodas in the fridge if that 
                         helps any.

               INT. W.A.R.P. TOWER ELEVATOR - NIGHT

               Hawk, Trip, Lex, and Jam ride back down the elevator sipping 
               NeHi sodas, watching the floor numbers get lower and lower. 
               Terry Jack's immortal hit "SEASONS IN THE SUN" plays over 
               the elevator speaker.

                                     HAWK
                         Well, here we are, dudes. One hour 
                         and thirty minutes away from the 
                         concert of the century... ticketless. 
                         All thanks to Wile E. Coyote, Super- 
                         Fucking Genius over here.

               Trip looks away from the rest, ashamed.

                                     LEX
                         Really, Trip, can we bore holes in 
                         your head and use it as a bong so it 
                         actually does us some good for a 
                         change?

                                     TRIP
                         Fuck you, Lex! This whole thing 
                         wouldn't have happened if it wasn't 
                         for you jinxing us. I just made an 
                         honest mistake.

                                     HAWK
                         Oh, I'm sorry, Trip. What you made 
                         was a big, brainless, pile of horse 
                         shit. No offense.

                                     JAM
                         Guys, GUYS! Come on, if this is 
                         anyone's fault, it's mine. I was the 
                         one who grabbed Trip's jacket by 
                         mistake. It's my fault and I 
                         apologize.

                                     HAWK
                         Please, Jam, we're trying to vent 
                         some hostility here. Sure the whole 
                         thing may be your fault, but who's 
                         gonna get pissed off at you?

               Jam looks at his feet.

                                     JAM
                         Sometimes I think I don't deserve 
                         friends as good as you guys.

               Hawk, Trip, and Lex cringe.

                                     HAWK
                         I have one question. How could a kid 
                         who wails on the drums like it's the 
                         only thing keeping him alive even 
                         think of such a femmy thing to say?

                                     TRIP
                         Really, Jam, you tryin' to make us 
                         barf?

                                     LEX
                         Yeah, it's like you're possessed by 
                         The Flying Nun, or something.

               The doors to the elevator open and the boys step out.

                                    SHAKE YOUR WEEWEE!

               EXT. W.A.R.P. TOWER - NIGHT

               COBO Hall looms up ahead.

               Hawk, Trip, Lex, and Jam enter the sidewalk. A thickening 
               CROWD of KISS fans continually meander by.

               On their way to the car, they suddenly hear a WOMAN'S VOICE 
               bellowing through a megaphone from somewhere down the street.  
               After a moment they see the voice's source.

               A GROUP OF WOMEN has congregated about forty feet ahead and 
               their LEADER, her back toward the boys, yells to the group 
               through her bullhorn. Flying above them all is a large banner 
               reading: "MATMOK, Mothers Against The Music Of KISS."

                                     LEADER
                         Welcome to the first open meeting of 
                         MATMOK, Mothers Against The Music Of 
                         KISS!"

               The group cheers as the KISS FANS milling around them pretty 
               much ignore the whole MATMOK spectacle.

               Lex looks away from the MATMOKS and into the street. We can't 
               see what he sees, but we can tell he's alarmed.

                                     LEX
                         Uh... dudes?

                                     HAWK
                              (ignoring Lex)
                         Now there's a woman who totally abuses 
                         the privilege of motherhood.

                                     LEX
                         DUDES!

               They all look at Lex.

                                     LEX
                              (eyes focused ahead)
                         Where's the Volvo?

               Hawk, Trip, and Jam look at their parking spot to see a beat-
               up Dodge Dart sitting there instead of the Volvo.

                         It's gone.

                         I can see that, bright boy. What 
                         happened to it?

                                     JAM
                         It was stolen!

                              (incredulous)
                         Christine stole it! Asleep, my ass!

                         But we took the keys?

                         Damn, she musta hot wired it. We 
                         picked up a professional car thief 
                         in the shape of Olivia Newton-John!

                                     LEX
                         Okay, I'm just a little mad now! 
                         Jam, why'd you talk us into picking 
                         that bitch up in the first place!?

                                     JAM
                         I'm sorry, guys. I thought it was a 
                         nice thing to do.

                                     HAWK
                         Jam, not another word out of your 
                         femmy-ass mouth! Okay, we're here, 
                         we got nothing, and we got an hour 
                         and a half. We're totally committed. 
                         It's time to brainstorm.

                                     LEX
                         Here's a suggestion. Let's stop 
                         worrying about the concert for the 
                         time being and get the cops in on 
                         this Volvo situation.

                                     HAWK
                         Wake up, Lex. This is Detroit. The 
                         cops aren't gonna waste city dollars 
                         looking for a Swedish car. Face it, 
                         the Volvo's on a cutting board as we 
                         speak getting sliced, diced, and 
                         julienned by Christine, the chop 
                         shop gourmet.

               Lex is developing a look of resolve. This is Detroit!

                                     HAWK
                         Now listen up. Here's the game plan.

                         handle that...

                         then, step number one, we find us a 
                         scalper. I got...

                         the Volvo.

                                     JAM

                         us.

               Jam holds up a ten keeping his mouth shut.

                                     HAWK
                         So maybe we got enough for one ticket.  
                         Fuck!

                         four really small kids, beat the 
                         shit outta them and steal their 
                         tickets. What do you think?

                                     HAWK

                         I think we should try sneaking in.

                                     HAWK
                         Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get 
                         busted fer sure. Bad plan.

                         Okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four 
                         ticket stubs off some kids in the 
                         audience, comes back out, and we all 
                         "re-enter" the concerto. Voila!

                                     HAWK
                         Still too risky for my money.
                              (looking at watch)
                         We're running out of time here. This 
                         is KISS! A victory for one is a 
                         victory for the team. I'm sure I can 
                         barter with a scalper, but if you 
                         dudes think you got better plans, go 
                         for it. We'll reconvene at that 
                         intersection...

               Hawk points to the intersection where the church, the male 
               strip joint, the parking lot, and the Smiley Mart are located.

                                     HAWK
                         ...at twenty-thirty hours.

                         every dude for himself. Try to get 
                         at least one ticket and at 8:30 P.M. 
                         we'll meet over there.

                                     JAM

                         Jam, shut-up! You're not allowed to 
                         speak, remember? Go use whatever 
                         femmy idea you have to get yourself 
                         a ticket or four. I don't wanna hear 
                         it.

                                     JAM
                              (sadly)
                         But... my plan involves all four of 
                         us acting together.

                                     HAWK
                         See you at 8:30, Jam. Later.
                              (to Lex and Trip)
                         Dudes? Later.

               Hawk, Trip, and Lex split up, leaving Jam alone. He starts 
               walking in the opposite direction, passing MATMOKS. The leader 
               is still on a roll, yelling through the megaphone.

                                     LEADER
                         Look around you tonight, mothers!  
                         Look at all the young faces! They 
                         smile and laugh but their eyes have 
                         lost all hope! Not one among them 
                         appears to possess the love and fear 
                         of God... This satanic group KISS 
                         has stolen their souls.

               The leader's gaze finally falls upon Jam. He lets out a GASP. 
               Yes, the leader is Mrs. Bruce. So this was her church meeting.

               She freezes when she sees her son; her jaw slackens. Meanwhile 
               Jam looks stunned beyond comprehension.

                                     JAM
                         Oh... dear... Lord!!

               Mrs. Bruce quickly hands the megaphone to another MATMOK 
               member, who picks up where Mrs. Bruce left off.

               Jam looks around for someplace to run and hide, but it's too 
               late. Mrs. Bruce slices through the crowd of KISS fans and 
               grabs Jam by the ear. He yelps.

                                     MRS. BRUCE
                         I don't know how you got here tonight 
                         and I don't want to know either. All 
                         I know is you're going to pay dearly 
                         for this one, young man!

               EXT. ST., SEBASTIAN'S CATHEDRAL - NIGHT

               Mrs. Bruce tugs Jam toward the intersection we saw before.  
               They cross the street toward the corner where the Cathedral 
               sits.

               Jam looks up at the cross on the steeple and GULPS with 
               trepidation.

                                     JAM
                         Mom, what're we...?

                                     MRS. BRUCE
                         Just keep your lying, heathenous 
                         trap shut, Jeremiah.

               They climb the steps to the cathedral passing a bulletin 
               board reading: Thank God It's Friday Mass, 6PM-7PM.

               PARISHIONERS exit the beautiful church, shaking hands with a 
               PRIEST as they leave.

                                     PARISHIONERS
                         What a wonderful mass, Father/So 
                         inspirational, Father/Thank you.

                         Thank you/Come again next week.

               Mrs. Bruce pulls Jam up to the priest.

                                     PRIEST
                         Next mass is tomorrow morning, sister.

                                     MRS. BRUCE
                         Can we talk, Father? I'm desperate. 
                         My son was about to defy God by going 
                         to that blasphemous KISS concert.

                                     PRIEST
                         In that case, come right in.

               Meanwhile, across the street...

               EXT. WHITE CASTLE HAMBURGER JOINT - NIGHT

               Parked in front of the busy fast-food establishment we 
               recognize the two-toned Chevy Impala with luggage tied on 
               top. In the window we see Beth and her parents sitting at 
               one of the booths.

               Out the window Beth looks across the street just as Jam, 
               Mrs. Bruce, and the priest enter the cathedral. Her face 
               drops.

                                     BETH
                         Oh my God! That's Jeremiah!

                                     DAD
                         Who?

                                     BETH
                         Jeremiah Bruce from school. He and 
                         his mom just went into that church. 
                         He must be in Detroit for the concert. 
                         Can I go say good-bye to him?

                                     MOM
                         Beth, I am not letting you wander 
                         the streets of Detroit after dark.

                                     BETH
                         I'm not going to wander. I'm just 
                         gonna go over there.

               Beth points to St. Sebastian's.

                                     BETH
                         He's with his mom.

                                     DAD
                         Fine, as long as we know where you 
                         are. But don't be long. We need to 
                         be getting back on the road.

               Beth is already out the door and halfway across the street.  
               Dad pats mom's shoulder.

                                     DAD
                         She's probably got a little crush on 
                         that boy.

               EXT. ST. SEBASTIAN'S CATHEDRAL - NIGHT

               Beth runs up to the cathedral and sneaks in.

               EXT. IT'S RAINING MEN STRIP JOINT - NIGHT

               Hawk walks down the sidewalk badgering everyone passing by 
               for a ticket, getting the same stock answer: "Suffer, dude!"

               He stops and sits on a curb, lighting a cigarette. Behind 
               him stands the marquee for IT'S RAINING MEN, the male strip 
               joint. A DISCO SONG comes from inside. Just when it looks 
               like Hawk's given up, a VOICE is heard above.

                                     VOICE
                         Hey, chief? Need a ticket?

               Hawk can't believe his ears. He looks up at a greasy-looking 
               hybrid, part porn star, part used car salesman, the SCALPER.

                                     SCALPER
                         Second row center, seventy-five clams.

               Trying to act confident, Hawk takes out his money clip showing 
               the scalper twenty-five dollars.

                                     HAWK
                         Dude, this is all I got.

                                     SCALPER
                         Sorry, man, no can do. But I'll be 
                         here for a while if you scare up the 
                         extra gravy.

                                     HAWK
                         Where the hell am I gonna scare up 
                         that kinda gravy in one hour?

                                     SCALPER
                         The easy way.

               The scalper points over his shoulder and Hawk turns to see 
               three GIGGLING WOMEN exiting the strip joint. None are under 
               forty.

               A sign below the bar's logo reads: Amateur Night Giveaway!  
               Guys Over 18 Only! Bare It All And Win 75 Bucks!

                                     SCALPER
                         You look a little scrawny, but it's 
                         worth a shot.

                                     HAWK
                         I can't just walk in and take my 
                         clothes off. It's embarrasskin.

                                     SCALPER
                         Guess you don't want to see the 
                         greatest show on earth. And in Detroit 
                         no less. Well, take care, chief.

               The scalper turns and Hawk grabs his arm.

                                     HAWK
                         Dude, if it were dancing the way 
                         Fred Astaire did it, I'd give it my 
                         best shot. I'd learn the steps and 
                         practice in my spare time. But this... 
                         tribal, ritualistic bullshit, it's 
                         way-too-spontaneous for me.

                                     SCALPER
                         Yeah, you're probably too young 
                         anyhow.

                                     HAWK
                         Hey, I invented fake I.D.s, alright.  
                         That's not the problem... They're 
                         playing disco music in there, man.

                                     SCALPER
                         Chief, here's a little secret. Drink 
                         heavily, your feet will know what to 
                         do. Now shit or get off the pot. Do 
                         you wanna dance or do you wanna see 
                         KISS only on their album covers?

               Hawk gets a look of resolve on his face.

                                     SCALPER
                         You sure you'll have a ticket for 
                         me?

                                     SCALPER
                         You have my solemn oath as a public 
                         servant.

               Hawk turns and walks up to the door, hesitating before opening 
               it. Rummaging through his pockets, he pulls out a handful of 
               expired driver's licenses.

               Choosing the one he thinks best suits himself, he walks in 
               with trepidation. The scalper sees someone else coming up.

                                     SCALPER
                         Hey, chief, you need a ticket? Second 
                         row center, seventy-five clams.

               It's Trip.

                                     TRIP
                         No thanks, dude. I'm beating my ticket 
                         out of some poor, defenseless chump.

               Trip exits FRAME.

                                     SCALPER
                         What's happening to kids today?

               INT. IT'S RAINING MEN STRIP JOINT - NIGHT

               Hawk enters your average, everyday, male strip joint. A crowd 
               of LUSTY WOMEN cheer on a STRIPPER IN A FIREMAN'S SUIT. He 
               dances on a lighted, tile stage under a spinning, mirror 
               ball.

               Hawk shows the MAN AT THE DOOR his fake license and the man 
               nods him in. He approaches the bar in the early stages of 
               being very intimidated.

               The BARTENDER, a man dressed only in tight, black, tuxedo 
               pants, shirt cuffs, and a tie, comes up to Hawk.

                                     HAWK
                              (voice cracking)
                         Like to sign up for the contest.

               The bartender gives Hawk the once over.

                                     BARTENDER
                         You're a little scrawny, but thanks 
                         to the concert we're low on amateurs. 
                         Name?

                                     HAWK
                         Hawk.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Pick a song, Hawk.

                                     HAWK
                         Got any KISS?

                                     BARTENDER
                         You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?

                                     HAWK
                         Yeah, a man's drink...

               Hawk squints at a name tag on the bartender's tie.

                                     HAWK
                         ...Dickey.

               Dickey goes to the bottle rack on the other side of the bar.

                                     HAWK
                              (to himself)
                         I'm gonna need all the help I can 
                         get tonight.

               Dickey returns with the drink and Hawk pulls out his money 
               clip.

                                     HAWK
                              (looking at the drink)
                         What's that?

                                     BARTENDER
                         You mean you never seen a Jack Daniels 
                         on the rocks before?

               Hawk looks at the unfamiliar drink again trying to play it 
               cool.

                                     HAWK
                         Sure, I have. But not one with ice 
                         in it, that's all.

                                     BARTENDER
                              (seeing money clip)
                         Save your money, stud muffin. The 
                         lady at the end of the bar sends her 
                         love.

               Dickey points to a WOMAN sitting at the end of the bar. Mature 
               and sexy. She's a knock-out. Every teenage boy's fantasy. 
               Hawk's eyes pop at this "Mrs. Robinson" before him.

                                     HAWK
                         Whoa... she is a killer.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Amanda Finch. Her ex is one of the 
                         wealthiest businessmen in Detroit. 
                         Play your cards right and you could 
                         hit paydirt. She like 'em young.
                              (leaning in)
                         And since you look a little new at 
                         this, let me give you three words of 
                         advice. Hard to get. Think it, act 
                         it, know it, be it. Nothing a woman 
                         loves more than when you beat her at 
                         her own head games.

               Dicky pats Hawk's shoulder and leaves. Hawk looks away from 
               Amanda and scans the room. He glances back at Amanda. She's 
               still gazing at him the way queens of yore must have eyed 
               particularly cute knights. She winks and toasts Hawk.

               Hawk raises his glass smiling nervously. They both sip at 
               their drinks. She licks her lips suggestively at him. And, 
               Hawk proceeds to COUGH up his mouthful of Jack Daniels, 
               SPRAYING it all over the bar.

                                SMILEY MART / HAULING BASS

               EXT. SMILEY MART - NIGHT

               Your typical 70's convenient store. Out front two SIX YEAR 
               OLDS in Star Wars tee-shirts play tug-o-war with a Stretch 
               Armstrong doll.

               Trip stomps over grabbing them by their mini shirts. When he 
               tries to act tough, it's pathetic. Even six year olds aren't 
               afraid.

                                     TRIP
                         Hey, you little twerps, gimme your 
                         KISS tickets or I'll pop your fuckin' 
                         faces in.

                                     SIX YEAR OLD #1
                         We don't have any KISS tickets.

                                     SIX YEAR OLD #2
                         Yeah, KISS sucks!

                                     TRIP
                         I oughta kick your asses for sayin' 
                         that.

               He grabs the Stretch Armstrong and stuffs it in his pocket.

                                     TRIP
                         But I'm in a hurry so I'll just take 
                         this instead. Now scram.

               The kids run away.

               INT. SMILEY MART - NIGHT

               The store is crawling with KISS FANS, some reading the comic 
               books, others playing pinball against a far wall, still others 
               looking at the poster section. Trip enters on a mission.

               He looks around catching the eye of a pretty CASHIER. She's 
               a rocker, wearing a Who tee-shirt, a mood ring, and just a 
               little too much make-up. She smiles at him. Trip returns the 
               smile with a feeble wave. Her mood ring turns from blue to 
               pink.

               Concentrating on the layout of the store, Trip peers all the 
               way to the back to a darkened corner... where he spies a 
               LITTLE KID wearing a KISS tee-shirt playing a KISS pinball 
               machine.

               Trip smiles. The eagle has spotted a fuzzy, little bunny. He 
               moves in for the kill, walking past a crowd of kids at the 
               magazine rack, past the Hostess aisle, past the dairy cooler 
               and into the darkened corner.

               He stands behind the little kid, relishing this moment. The 
               kid is actually pretty good. We also see now the little kid 
               has his face painted like Ace Frehley.

                                     TRIP
                         Hey, little kid.

               Suddenly distracted, the kid loses the ball.

                                     LITTLE KID
                         Shit! You just skunked my last ball, 
                         you...

               Trip clamps a hand over the little kid's mouth.

                                     TRIP
                         Okay, booger, your KISS ticket or 
                         your life.

               The little kid says something but Trip's hand muffles his 
               words.

                                     TRIP
                         Hunh?

               The kid says what he said before, but it is utterly 
               incomprehensible, once again thanks to Trip's hand.

                                     TRIP
                              (looking at his hand)
                         Oh. Okay... But scream and you'll 
                         never live to see puberty. I'll pop 
                         your fuckin' face in.

               Trip pulls his hand away.

                                     LITTLE KID
                         Please sir, don't beat me up. I do 
                         have a KISS ticket, but not on me.

                                     TRIP
                         A likely story. Hand it over, kid.

                                     LITTLE KID
                              (bottom lip quivering)
                         No really. My brother's hanging onto 
                         it for safe keeping. Please, let me 
                         get him for you.

               The kid turns and yells into the store before Trip can stop 
               him.

                                     LITTLE KID
                         Hey, Chongo!

               A titanic guy at the comic book rack looks up from his issue 
               of "Thing" when he hears his name. CHONGO has a very low 
               forehead and the expression of an angry bull plastered onto 
               his face.

                                     TRIP
                              (getting scared)
                         Hey, kid, that's okay. I don't wanna 
                         see KISS that ba...

                                     LITTLE KID
                         Don't try to run, maggot. Chongo's 
                         an all-state track star in every 
                         event.

                                     TRIP
                         What do you want?

                                     LITTLE KID
                              (gleefully)
                         A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens 
                         me and lives.

                                     TRIP
                         Look, you can have my wallet...

                                     LITTLE KID
                         It's not nearly enough, punk.

               Chongo is getting ever-closer with his tree trunk legs, his 
               barrel chest and hydraulic biceps. He is joined by TWO BUDS.

                                     LITTLE KID
                         Besides, I was gonna take your wallet 
                         anyway. After Chongo and his friends 
                         crush your ribcage like a pack of 
                         Luckys.

               Chongo arrives eyeing Trip with distaste. Trip goes white.

                                     CHONGO
                         This fairy givin' you shit, bro?

                                     LITTLE KID
                         He was gonna mug me for my KISS 
                         ticket.

                                     TRIP
                         Me? Mug? That's nuts. I said, do you 
                         know where I can take a piss.

               Chongo and his two buds laugh. Then, without a second of 
               warning, Chongo belts Trip in the gut. Trip doubles over and 
               falls breathlessly to his knees.

                                     CHONGO
                         Okay, pimple dick, you've got the 
                         option of walking outside with us or 
                         gettin' dragged out. Either way you're 
                         comin' with us.

               Trip catches his breath.

                                     TRIP
                         Please, sir, don't kick my ass! I'll 
                         do anything to get out of a beating!

                                     LITTLE KID
                         Say, Chongo, perhaps we could use 
                         some extra cash for tasty snacks at 
                         the KISS concert our weasly friend 
                         won't be attending.

               Chongo scratches his head.

                                     CHONGO
                         How much cash do you figure?

                                     LITTLE KID
                         Take five for a minute, Chongo. Let 
                         me do the math.

               The little kid taps his finger on his chin and the theme 
               from "JEOPARDY" begins. While the kid thinks, Trip looks 
               nervously up at Chongo and his buds. Chongo reaches into his 
               denim vest pocket and we hear a CRINKLING NOISE. He comes 
               back up with two walnuts, putting them between his bicep and 
               forearm.

               Trip watches in horror as Chongo makes a muscle and the 
               walnuts are shelled between two walls of iron-hard flesh. 
               CREEEAAAACK! Chongo eats the walnuts, shells and all.

               EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               The full-to-capacity parking lot is patrolled by a couple of 
               SECURITY GUARDS.

               Lex cautiously makes his way to the edge of the parking lot 
               and looks at the back side of Cobo Hall just beyond the chain 
               link fence that surrounds the lot.

               He crouches down and walks between two cars parked against 
               the fence, looking both ways. Seeing a guard's flashlight 
               beam, he sits stock still until the beam sweeps past, then 
               SIGHS eased.

                                     LEX
                              (whispering to self)
                         I can't believe I'm actually 
                         entertaining the notion of sneaking 
                         in. I oughta have my cranium examined.

               Lex finds a vertical break in the chain link. He lays on his 
               back, slides through, then stands on the other side of the 
               fence. He's at the edge of a weedy, littery field that also 
               happens to be poorly lit.

                                     LEX
                         Whoa. Danger Will Robinson.

               Spooked, he lays down again intending to slide back through 
               when a flashlight beam hits his eyes.

                                     SECURITY GUARD'S VOICE
                         Hey you! Get back in here!

               Lex sees the guard standing about fifty feet away on the 
               other side of the fence. Panicking, he bolts deeper into the 
               field.

                                     SECURITY GUARD'S VOICE
                         You're not getting far, kid!

               Lex double-times it as we hear the guard yelling into his 
               walkie-talkie.

                                     SECURITY GUARD'S VOICE
                         We got one just ran into the field 
                         from the north lot!

               The field gets darker as Lex closes in on Cobo Hall's well-
               lit loading dock, where ROADIES empty the remaining bits of 
               KISS's monstrous set from an 18-wheeler. Other huge trucks 
               are parked nearby. There's a bustle of last minute activity.

               EXT. LOADING DOCK - NIGHT

               Lex scurries from giant speaker box to a stack of lights to 
               huge trunks, keeping well hidden. He dodges roadies and avoids 
               being seen by OTHER GUARDS.

               He slithers along side the 18-wheeler and nears the loading 
               bay. Up ahead some auxiliary speakers, drum kits, and 
               scaffolding wait their turn to be carried into the building.

                                     SECURITY GUARD'S VOICE
                         There he is!

               Lex spins. The security guard, flanked by two others, barrel 
               right for him.

                                     LEX
                         Shit!

               He dives rolls under the 18-wheeler. The three security guards 
               leap for the pavement and crawl under the semi after him.

               ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SEMI

               The three guards scramble to their feet and grab a SCRAWNY 
               BODY. They spin him around roughly.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Alright, wiseguy, you are so outta 
                         here!

               They suddenly realize they've got the wrong man. It's a 
               roadie.

                                     ROADIE
                         Hey, what the fuck?

               The roadie holds up his all-access laminate angrily.

                                     ROADIE
                         Keep your paws to yourself, ya dumb 
                         fuckin' apes.

               The security guards look around frantically for Lex as other 
               roadies join in to defend their comrade.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Where'd he go? You see him?

               No one pays attention as a bass drum is carried past the 
               guards and up the loading dock ramp. They don't notice Lex 
               crammed inside contorted into a shape befitting a yoga master.

               Praying he won't be spotted, Lex holds his breath as he's 
               carried into the building and disappears.

                                 JAM IN A JAM / KISS THIS

               INT. ST. SEBASTIAN'S CATHEDRAL - NIGHT

               Jam sits in the front pew, head buried in his hands as Mrs. 
               Bruce and the priest talk on the alter.

               Beth moves quietly in the back, unseen and unheard. She looks 
               overwhelmed by the architecture, the detail on the stained 
               glass windows, the icons carved into the columns that support 
               the extravagantly decorated ceiling.

               The priest catches a glimpse of Beth meandering in the back.

                                     PRIEST
                         Uh, next mass isn't until tomorrow 
                         morning, young lady. Run along now.

               Beth smiles nervously and heads back toward the front door 
               passing a confessional booth. She throws a glance back at 
               the priest and Mrs. Bruce who have returned to conferring, 
               their backs to her. She stealthily ducks into the booth.

                                     MRS. BRUCE
                         Now it's been a while since my boy 
                         had holy confession. Could you...?

                                     PRIEST
                              (smiling)
                         Consider it done.

               Mrs. Bruce looks down at Jam and sees his drumsticks poking 
               out of his socks. She immediately takes them out and stuffs 
               them into her jacket. Jam doesn't even move.

                                     MRS. BRUCE
                         It's about time you gave up on that 
                         stupid dream once and for all. No 
                         son of mine is going to be a career 
                         musician.

               Jam is stung. Mrs. Bruce and the priest head back down the 
               center aisle exiting through the gigantic front doors. She 
               eyes Jam.

                                     MRS. BRUCE
                         Thank you, Father. I'll be back for 
                         him before you know it; after I take 
                         care of some unfinished business.

                                     PRIEST
                         Just knock loudly, sister.

               He lets her out and locks the door, leaving the keys in the 
               lock, and walks over to Jam.

                                     PRIEST
                         Come along, son. Get into the booth.

               He helps the despondent Jam up. They walk to the booth and 
               Jam reluctantly gets inside.

               INT. CONFESSIONAL BOOTH - NIGHT

               Jam kneels on the board and a mere two feet behind him, Beth 
               sits on a bench shrouded in darkness. Her posture is that of 
               someone with a crate of nitroglycerine on her lap.

               We hear the SHUFFLING noise of the priest getting into his 
               own compartment next door. A moment later the small, eye-
               level door SLIDES open. The priest's face is barely visible 
               on the other side of the thick screen, but he's there.

                                     JAM
                         Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. 
                         This is my first confession in... 
                         well... a really long time.

                                     PRIEST
                         Prepare to receive the Act of Penance.  
                         How many sins have you committed 
                         since your last confession?

                                     JAM
                         Just one, Father, but boy was it a 
                         doozy.

               Beth leans forward slightly and listens to Jam's confession.

               INT. IT'S RAINING MEN STRIP JOINT - NIGHT

               Hawk's at a bar stool gulping sloppily and woozily from a 
               rocks glass. Four more empty rocks glasses sit in front of 
               him. He stares at the sexy woman who smiles back, blowing 
               him kisses from the other side of the bar.

               The EMCEE enters the stage.

                                     EMCEE
                              (into microphone)
                         Okay, ladies, hang onto your hormones. 
                         Here comes our next amateur. Let's 
                         have a big hand for Hawk!

               The beginning of a rockin' KISS tune comes over the P.A. and 
               Dicky approaches Hawk.

                                     EMCEE
                         You're up, Hawk.

               Hawk wakes up fast. There's nothing more sobering than having 
               to undress in public.

                                     HAWK
                         Oh, Dicky, I c-c-can't...

                                     BARTENDER
                         You're not gonna chicken out on me 
                         now, are you? We've got your KISS 
                         song playing and everything.

                                     HAWK
                         I-I c-can't...

                                     BARTENDER
                              (leans in close)
                         Look, people undress in public 
                         because, A, they're exhibitionists, 
                         B, they're nutcases, or C, they need 
                         the money. I can tell you're not A, 
                         and I hope to hell you're not B. So 
                         my suggestion is, think about why 
                         you're a C and let your body party, 
                         shake your groove thing, boogie oogie 
                         oogie till you just can't boogie no 
                         more.

               Hawk thinks about it, then downs the rest of his drink. He 
               grimaces at it's taste, then opens his eyes with new resolve.

                                     HAWK
                         You're right, Dicky. I gotta do it 
                         for KISS. Gotta put a bag over its 
                         head and 
                              (hiccup)
                         Do it for KISS.

               Hawk swivels his bar stool to the right and gets off, 
               forgetting to stand when his feet hit the floor. He proceeds 
               to fall flat on his face. Dicky looks down concerned, but 
               Hawk stands with a little difficulty and heads for the stage. 
               The crowd of women parts down the middle for him and checks 
               him out as he walks by. They seem to like what they see. 
               Hawk looks nervously at the carnivorous faces leering at his 
               package first, his ass after. What the hell is he doing?

               Hawk reluctantly climbs onto the stage and the gals start 
               CLAPPING to the song. He faces them and starts gyrating his 
               drunken hips at them, feeling no confidence whatsoever, 
               until...

               The CHEERS start to ECHO and the pulsing lights begin to 
               hurt his eyes. Hawk watches the world proceed to spin faster 
               than the disco ball above his head.

               He stops gyrating and clutches his stomach. BELCHING. Uh-oh.

               Hawk spots an almost-empty beer pitcher one of the CHEERING-
               IN-SLOW-MOTION women holds above her head. He runs up to the 
               edge of the stage, grabs the pitcher, and PUKES.

               The cheering and music come to a grinding halt. You can hear 
               a pin drop as Hawk yacks his guts out into the beer pitcher. 
               It goes on for an excruciatingly long time, then finally 
               stops.

               Hawk looks up at the hundreds of astonished eyes staring at 
               him. He wipes his mouth, then a look of ease washes over his 
               face.

                                     HAWK
                         Wow. I feel a hundred times better!

               He hands the vomit-filled pitcher back to the shocked woman.

                                     HAWK
                         Thanks lady.

               He looks over at the emcee, who gazes at Hawk from the DJ 
               booth.

                                     HAWK
                         Maestro? As you were.

               The emcee stands perfectly still, jaw agape.

                                     HAWK
                         Come on, dude, we got a bunch of 
                         frisky felines waiting for some 
                         entertainment! The show must go on!

               Hawk starts gyrating even though the music is still off. The 
               emcee shrugs, re-cuing the song. It starts again as Hawk 
               faces the crowd, dancing with new-found bravado.

               The women come out of their dumbstruck comas and reluctantly 
               start CLAPPING again.

               Hawk pulls off his jacket and twirls it over his head Roger 
               Daltry style. Then he pulls it back down and tosses it into 
               the crowd. The women actually fight over it.

               Encouraged, Hawk then peels off his KISS Army tee-shirt and 
               hurls it at the women, who SQUEAL with delight. Sure, he may 
               be scrawny, but they don't mind. This lad's got personality.

               Adrenaline pumping, confidence building, Hawk starts playing 
               the crowd of very responsive ladies.

               He unbuttons his jeans first. Then, leaving them on, he does 
               an "air guitar" medley: Chuck Berry, ZZ Top, Angus Young 
               from AC/DC, and Elvis Costello in six easy steps.

               Hawk finishes off with a Pete Townshend windmill, shaking 
               his ass at his audience in mid-strum, then licks his finger 
               and touches one of his cheeks: "hot stuff" (he does this in 
               a manly way of course).

               Then Hawk pauses to adjust what looks to be his underwear 
               bunching up in his crack.

               The women WHOO-HOO.

               He segues into a Mick Jagger rooster strut and the ladies go 
               ga-ga. He makes the sign of the horns with each hand and 
               wiggles a protruding tongue like Gene Simmons. The gals scream 
               in orgastic joy.

               Then, Hawk goes for the gold. Yes, he does the Fonzie dance! 
               The women are now overcome by sheer animal lust. Hawk's 
               whipped his audience into a frenzied pack of bitches in heat. 
               Amanda smirks and sucks from her little drink straw 
               suggestively.

               At long last Hawk figures he has to give them what they want.

               He puts his fingers to his fly, pauses, then unzips. His 
               Brittanias fall to his ankles, revealing a pair of bony legs 
               sticking down from some KISS boxer shorts. The ladies go 
               batty.

               Unfortunately Hawk has neglected a cardinal rule of disrobing. 
               Never pull your pants down without taking your shoes off 
               first. He tries to kick off his shoes. The left one goes 
               flying across the bar and THWACK, beans a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN 
               in the face. She flies backwards over a chair.

               Trying to kick the other shoe off, Hawk loses his balance 
               and falls backwards, hitting his head on the edge of the 
               bar.

                                 DRUM ROLL / NEGOTIATION

               INT. SMILEY MART - NIGHT

               Trip looks at the little kid, Chongo, and the two buds in 
               fear.

                                     TRIP
                         Two hundred bucks?

                                     LITTLE KID
                         You heard me, nad breath. My time's 
                         precious and I think that's a 
                         reasonable price to pay for your 
                         sorry life.

                                     TRIP
                         Look, I want to live, but I don't 
                         know where the fuck I'm gonna find 
                         two hundred bucks.

               The little kid shakes his head in disgust.

                                     LITTLE KID
                         Chongo? Take him outside and tear 
                         his ass out through his mouth.

               Chongo advances, muscles flexing.

                                     TRIP
                         Hold on! I know how I can get the 
                         money! I just figured it out! Only 
                         you might wanna wait outside.

               The little kid and Chongo look at each other.

                                     CHONGO
                         I don't trust him.

                                     LITTLE KID
                         I think he's on the level. He's too 
                         stupid to try anything sneaky anyway. 
                         Look at him, he's a moron.

               They look back at Trip.

                                     LITTLE KID
                         You got fifteen minutes and not a 
                         second longer. We have a concert to 
                         go to. See you outside.

               Trip nods sullenly as the kid, Chongo, and the two buds exit.  
               Then he checks to make sure Stretch Armstrong is still with 
               him.

               INT. BASS DRUM - NIGHT

               Lex is twisted like a pretzel as he's carted into the bowels 
               of Cobo Hall. He tries to keep calm, but it's not in his 
               nature.

                                     LEX
                              (under his breath)
                         Keep it together, Lex. Anything worth 
                         fighting for is worth dying for.

               INT. COBO HALL/RECEIVING AREA - NIGHT

               ROADIES and TECHIES run in all directions as last minute 
               preparations are being attended to.

               Two roadies carry the base drum down a long ramp unaware 
               that Lex is hidden inside.

                                     ROADIE #2
                         Boy, this one's heavy.

               Suddenly, Roadie #2 snags his foot on a mess of cable and 
               loses his balance, dropping the oversized drum. In an instant 
               the drum goes rolling down the ramp quickly gaining speed.

                                     ROADIE #2
                         Shit!

               The roadies bolt after the runaway drum. Other workers scurry 
               out of the way to avoid being hit by the speeding instrument.

               INT. BASS DRUM - NIGHT

               Lex spins like in a dryer on speed.

                                     LEX
                         WHOOOOAAA!

               INT. COBO HALL/RECEIVING AREA - NIGHT

               More techies jump out of the way as the wayward drum heads 
               right for a closed set of double doors. The roadies are just 
               about to grab it before impact, when...

               The door unexpectedly swings open. The FOXY GROUPIES on the 
               other side scream at the sight of the careening drum heading 
               straight for them.

                                     ROADIE #2
                         Close that door!

               Too late. The groupies jump away as the drum flies through 
               the open door and down a flight of stairs.

               INT. COBO HALL STAIRWELL - NIGHT

               The drum bounces down the zigzag stairway violently. Lex's 
               GRUNTS of pain can be heard from inside.

               AT THE BOTTOM

               The big drum hits the landing hard, tips over, then spins 
               like a quarter getting faster before it stops.

               ON THE ROADIES

               They barrel down the stairs two at a time. Finally reaching 
               the bottom, they grab the drum.

                                     ROADIE #2
                         Peter's gonna kill us.

               As they carry the drum back up the stairs, we see it is now 
               empty. Once the roadies are gone, CAMERA TILTS UP to the 
               ceiling. There's Lex clutching exposed pipes for dear life, 
               hanging upside down, praying the coast is clear.

                      BETH'S CONFESSION / COMPENSATORY POSSIBILITIES

               INT. CONFESSIONAL - NIGHT

               Jam is at the end of his confession. The priest is still 
               listening on the other side of the screen. Beth sits in the 
               shadows behind Jam.

                                     JAM
                         So, you see if it wasn't for me, me 
                         and my friends would be at that KISS 
                         concert right now... together.

                                     PRIEST
                         That's it?

                                     JAM
                         Yeah.

                                     PRIEST
                         Well, this is a unique confession to 
                         say the least, son. And not exactly 
                         the most interesting one I've ever 
                         heard either. You sure you don't 
                         want to talk about... oh, carnal 
                         knowledge with a neighborhood girl 
                         or impure thoughts about the new 
                         student teacher maybe... or how about 
                         finding a box of magazines under 
                         your dad's bed?

                                     JAM
                         No.

                                     PRIEST
                         Well then, I suggest you have a seat 
                         on the bench behind you and think of 
                         something a little juicier to confess 
                         than losing KISS tickets. I realize 
                         this is Detroit, but I personally 
                         find, what that rock and roll band 
                         is all about, to be boring as 
                         Lucifer's kingdom. I'll return in a 
                         little while.

               The priest SLIDES the door shut again. Jam is all but shrouded 
               in darkness, but can make out the time on his watch. It's 
               getting late. He resignedly sits on the bench behind him... 
               right on Beth's lap.

               Jam yells, but Beth throws her hand over his mouth. His eyes 
               bulge. He can't believe what he's seeing. He climbs off Beth 
               and sits next to her.

                                     JAM
                              (whispering)
                         Beth? I can't believe it.

                                     BETH
                         Believe it.

               Jam thinks for a beat. Something still isn't quite clicking.

                                     JAM
                         Are you waiting for confession? I 
                         thought you were Jewish?

               BETH can hardly speak. She gulps thinking of what to say.

                                     BETH
                         I have a confession. Here it is.

               Beth gives him the biggest, wettest, sloppiest kiss in 
               recorded history. She pulls away finally wiping her mouth.

                                     BETH
                         I didn't mean for that to be so... 
                         intense. Forgive me.

                                     JAM
                         I don't care. I wanna hear more.

               She lunges at him again, kissing him for dear life. Her lips 
               leave his and begin to explore his chin, neck, ear.

                                     BETH
                         I've loved you ever since I first 
                         laid eyes on you, Jeremiah. I've 
                         just always been too scared to show 
                         it.

                                     JAM
                         Beth, I can't believe you just said 
                         that because that's exactly how I've 
                         always felt about you... Call me 
                         Jam. It's my band name.

                                     BETH
                         You don't know how long I've been 
                         waiting to hear that... Jam!

               He kisses her neck. Unable to stop, they start undressing 
               each other, both breathing heavy.

                                     BETH
                         We've got to take this slow...

                                     JAM
                         Right, slow...

                                     BETH
                         Oh, screw it!

               She tears his tee-shirt open with her teeth.

               INT. IT'S RAINING MEN STRIP JOINT - NIGHT

               A really buff STRIPPER dressed as a construction worker is 
               on stage with about ten others who stand in the background.  
               The emcee's hand hovers above the stripper's head.

                                     EMCEE
                         Okay, ladies, it's down to... Troy 
                         the Human Jackhammer...

               The women APPLAUD as we...

               FOLLOW the emcee's hand to Hawk who holds an ice pack on the 
               side of his head.

                                     EMCEE
                         ...and Mr. Massive Head Wound 
                         Accompanied by an Upset Stomach-Hawk!

               The women APPLAUD but not quite as loud.

                                     EMCEE
                         No contest. The grand prize of seventy-
                         five dollars goes to Troy the Human 
                         Jackhammer!

               The women cheer and a DISCO SONG starts as Troy does a reprise 
               of his act. Hawk walks away from the stage with the rest of 
               the rejected strippers, looking the way he feels: pretty 
               damn stupid. He puts on his pants, trying to walk at the 
               same time and falls to his knees.

               A helpful hand grabs him under the arm and helps him up.  
               It's Amanda looking lustier than ever.

                                     HAWK
                         Thanks, miss.

                                     AMANDA
                         You're too kind. I'm Amanda.

                                     HAWK
                         Right, well, thanks for the drinks 
                         and stuff, Amanda, but there's no 
                         reason for me to stick around these 
                         parts anymore.

                                     AMANDA
                         Don't be so glum, Hawk. The night's 
                         still young and filled with plenty 
                         of compensatory possibilities.

                                     HAWK
                         Huh?

                                     AMANDA
                         I'd be in a position to spend some 
                         money on you if you'd get in a 
                         position and spend some time on me.

               Hawk GULPS.

               INT. CONFESSIONAL BOOTH - NIGHT

               Jam and Beth lay buck naked, tightly wrapped around each 
               other in the heat of passion on the confessional booth floor.  
               They kiss, sweat, and PANT heavily.

               Suddenly, the sliding door to the priest's booth opens. Jam 
               and Beth freeze.

                                     PRIEST'S VOICE
                         Where are you, son?

                                     JAM
                         Uhh, tying my shoe.

                                     PRIEST'S VOICE
                         Oh. So, have you thought of a colorful 
                         confession yet?

                                     JAM
                         Actually, yes. Last year I walked 
                         out of a candy store with a Reggie 
                         Bar I hadn't paid for, but went back 
                         and apologized the next day.

                                     PRIEST'S VOICE
                         Boooring. Think, boy, think!

               We hear the door SLIDE shut again as Beth and Jam pick up 
               where they left off.

                                         HOLD UP

               INT. SMILEY MART - NIGHT

               Trip leafs through a KISS comic, not really paying attention 
               to it. Directly behind him is the register and the CASHIER.

               He starts hearing voices in his head. We see SUPERS of his 
               friends' faces hovering around him.

                                     LEX'S VOICE
                         I can't believe you're even thinking 
                         of committing a robbery, Trip. You 
                         don't pass go and collect 200 dollars 
                         for pulling stuff like this.

                                     HAWK'S VOICE
                         No shit, dude, is this really worth 
                         it? Sure you get your ass kicked 
                         nine ways to Sunday by that fucking 
                         gorilla, but it's still a hundred 
                         times better than getting it porked 
                         for the next three to five.

               Trip sends brief, agitated glances around the store meeting 
               the cashier's eyes again. She smiles at him coyly as she 
               plays with her mood ring. He gives her the eye, then returns 
               to his comic.

                                     JAM'S VOICE
                         And what about that girl, Trip? She'll 
                         never forget this night. Even if you 
                         get away with it, she'll be scarred 
                         for life. When are you gonna realize 
                         sometimes being tough means being 
                         tender.

                                     TRIP
                              (to the other voices)
                         Alright, everybody, SHUT UP!

               Trip snaps out of it. All the shoppers and cashier are 
               starring at him. He COUGHS loudly, clearing his throat to 
               cover his outburst. The shoppers go back to shopping.

               A MAN WITH A LONG COAT enters the store, looks around, then 
               takes a spot alongside Trip and opens a Mad Magazine.

                                     TRIP
                              (whispering to himself)
                         Okay, bro. You gonna have to do this 
                         sometime. Might as well be now.

               Trip puts a hand in his pocket and takes one last look at 
               Stretch Armstrong before stuffing the action figure back in 
               so it looks like he's got a gun. He takes three deep breaths 
               and discreetly pulls his knit cap down over his eyes, 
               revealing it actually as a semi-ski mask that covers the top 
               half of his face.

               Just then, the man with the coat puts the magazine back and 
               pulls something over his own head.

               Trip whirls around pointing Stretch-in-his-pocket at the 
               cashier...

               Just as the man in the coat, now masked with a stocking, 
               pulls the biggest shotgun ever made from under his coat, 
               pointing it at the cashier as well. The cashier shrieks. So 
               does Trip.

                                     MAN WITH COAT
                         Evening, honey. Y'know what I am, 
                         what this is, and what you have to 
                         do, so do it quick.
                              (to shoppers, Trip 
                              included)
                         The rest of you kindly introduce 
                         yourselves to the floor and kiss it 
                         hello.

               His thunder now stolen, Trip drops to the floor along with 
               everyone else. The air is very tense. The cashier starts 
               SOBBING, keeping her hands in the air.

                                     MAN WITH COAT
                              (to cashier)
                         Do or die, bitch! Next time I let 
                         the barrels do the talking.

                                     CASHIER
                         P-p-please, mister, I'm just a high 
                         school kid...

               Man with the coat COCKS the chamber and the cashier 
               immediately opens the register drawer and starts emptying 
               it.

                                     MAN WITH COAT
                         Fuck school, that's what I say! I 
                         just went through the motions till I 
                         was old enough to drop out and I'm 
                         leaving here with at least two fifty 
                         the easy way. Look where all that 
                         studying's gonna get you tonight. 
                         Robbed at gunpoint and possibly shot 
                         in the fucking head... for minimum 
                         wage!

               The man with the coat's laughter ECHOES in Trip's head till 
               he just can't take it anymore.

               ON THE CASHIER

               She suddenly shoots a surprise glance over the man with the 
               coat's shoulder.

               Seeing this, the man spins around. There's Trip behind him.

                                     TRIP
                         Alright, drop it or I'll kick your 
                         ass!

               Astounded by Trip's audacity, the man with the coat turns 
               his shotgun point-blank at Trip.

                                     MAN WITH COAT
                         Oh, yeah! You and what army?

                                     TRIP
                              (gulps)
                         The KISS Army!

                                    CRASHING BACKSTAGE

               INT. COBO HALL/BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

               Your wildest fantasy of a rock show's backstage area come 
               true. The place is packed with "beautiful" people. Scantily-
               clad BABES everywhere. Slick, RECORD BIZ-TYPES. Lots of food. 
               Lots of booze. Lots of fun. It's backstage at a KISS concert, 
               come on!

               CAMERA TILTS UP above the partying hordes to find Lex shimming 
               along an exposed duct amid the pipes, sprinklers, and vents. 
               Looking straight down on everybody, Lex is in awe and 
               disbelief.

                                     LEX
                         This is real. This is not a dream! 
                         This is real! I've pierced the inner 
                         circle!

               He takes the opportunity to peer down some BIG BUSTED GIRL'S 
               cleavage. Then his eye spots something else. He GASPS. A 
               door. On it a star. Written on the star, the word, KISS.

                                     LEX
                         Oh, God, they're in there!

               A big-haired HIPSTER in mirrored sunglasses KNOCKS on the 
               dressing room door. It opens, but Lex can't see inside. The 
               hipster stands in the doorway talking to whoever is there.

               Lex cranes his neck to see around the door jamb. Desperate 
               for a glimpse of his idols, he leans out too far.

               Suddenly, the entire duct collapses. Breaking loose of the 
               ceiling, Lex hurls to the floor clutching the duct. Backstage 
               goers leap for cover as SMASH... he hits the ground in a 
               shower of plaster and dust.

               The hipster protectively pulls the dressing room door shut 
               as two SECURITY MEN jump in front of it.

               Instantly, huge, burly hands come down on Lex's shoulders.  
               Before he can react, a slew of OFFICERS have him off his 
               feet and carry him away, a stunned expression frozen to his 
               face.

               EXT. ALLEY BEHIND COBO HALL - NIGHT

               Lex is thrown into a heaping garbage dumpster by the scruff 
               of his neck. The security officers laugh and pat themselves 
               on the back as they hurry back in.

               Lex peeks out the lid. The alley is dark and spooky. He jumps 
               out of the trash and comes face to face with the biggest 
               GERMAN SHEPHERD that has ever lived. Its teeth are bared and 
               its black, wolf-like body is coiled, ready to spring.  
               GRRRRRRR!

               Lex jumps backward hitting the dumpster. A GROWLING PITBULL 
               walks out from the shadows and joins the Shepherd.

                                     LEX
                              (petrified)
                         Dogs! Why did it have to be dogs!

               Then, a GROWLING DOBERMAN with a spiked collar emerges from 
               the darkness on the other side of the alley, its solid, 
               muscular form making the brick building nearby look like 
               jello.

               Lex starts SLAPPING himself on the face.

                                     LEX
                         Wake up, Lex! Wake up, man! This 
                         part's gotta be a nightmare!

               No luck. He stops, when several other DOGS emerge from the 
               shadows and gather behind the first three. These new mutts 
               immediately join in the GROWLING chorale. The Shepherd snaps 
               at Lex.

                                     LEX
                              (to the heavens)
                         God, if you ever get me outta this, 
                         I swear I will never masturbate again!

               The pack BARKS even louder.

                                     LEX
                              (to heaven again)
                         I REALLY MEAN IT THIS TIME!

               INT. CONFESSIONAL BOOTH - NIGHT

               Beth lays in Jam's arms on the floor. They might as well be 
               the only two people on the face of the earth. They whisper.

                                     BETH
                         So. Is it true that Gene Simmons had 
                         a cow's tongue grafted onto his real 
                         one? Y'know, to make it so long?

                                     JAM
                         I dunno. I think he had the piece of 
                         skin under his tongue removed so he 
                         could stick it out farther. I'm not 
                         too up on Gene trivia.

                                     BETH
                         Your man is the drummer, Peter Criss, 
                         right?

                                     JAM
                         Peter Criss is my inspiration, man.  
                         If I paid a hundred bucks for a KISS 
                         show and all I saw was his solo, I'd 
                         consider it... money... Hey, how'd 
                         you know that?

                                     BETH
                         I have all your notebook doodles 
                         memorized, Jam... Here.

               She opens her backpack and pulls out a package addressed to 
               Jam. The return address reads: Beth Bumsteen, Somewhere in 
               Ann Arbor.

                                     JAM
                         Ann Arbor?

                                     BETH
                         My dad's company is relocating him. 
                         We're moving. That's why I was acting 
                         so freaky in school today. I thought 
                         it was the last time I'd ever see 
                         you. Anyway, open the box. I would 
                         have given it to you this morning, 
                         except... like I said, I was freaking 
                         out.

               Jam opens the box and his jaw drops. It's a black tee-shirt 
               with the "Mystery" logo printed in white on the chest. Jam 
               holds it up. It's gigantic.

                                     BETH
                         I pass by this really cool tee-shirt 
                         shop on my way to school every day 
                         and I know you wear those black tee-
                         shirts all the time. You look like a 
                         size thirty-five, but all the sizes 
                         were in Roman numerals. So I got you 
                         an XXXL. That's thirty-five, isn't 
                         it?

               Touched, Jam kisses her for a long time. He starts putting 
               on the shirt when suddenly they hear the SHUFFLING of the 
               priest entering his booth. Jam grabs his clothes and sits 
               back on the bench. Beth starts getting dressed at his feet.

                                     PRIEST
                         Okay, you better have something really 
                         sinful for me this time, son. My 
                         patience is worn to threads and your 
                         mom will be here any minute.

                                     JAM
                              (pulling up his pants)
                         Alright, Father, here it is. About 
                         two weeks ago I went to my cousin's 
                         wedding and one of the bridesmaids 
                         asked me if I wanted to take a bath.

                                     PRIEST
                         No...

               Beth is tying her shoes. Jam slips on his socks.

                                     JAM
                         I was insulted, so I asked her if I 
                         was wreaking some wicked b.o., right?  
                         Then she said no, she wanted to take 
                         a bath with me.

                                     PRIEST
                         Oh, this is terrible... Please go 
                         on.

                                     JAM
                         Well, she was a very tempting siren, 
                         Father. Built like you wouldn't 
                         believe. So I gave into temptation 
                         about a block away from the wedding 
                         reception at this little motel that 
                         charges by the hour.

               Jam pauses.

                                     PRIEST
                         Well? Continue! Continue!

                                     JAM
                         Okay... when she peeled off that 
                         gown, you'll never guess what she 
                         was wearing underneath.

                                     PRIEST
                         Was it a teddy?

               Fully dressed, Beth crawls out of the confessional.

                                     JAM
                         No. Much bet... I mean, much more 
                         sinful than that.

                                     PRIEST
                         A bustier?

                                     JAM
                         Tell you what. You keep guessing and 
                         I'll say something when you get it.

                                     PRIEST
                         Splendid! I love a good game of Name 
                         That Nightie.

               Jam quietly sneaks out.

               INT. ST. SEBASTIAN'S CATHEDRAL - NIGHT

               We can hear the priest's voice as Jam hurries to Beth. They 
               dash out the door.

                                     PRIEST'S VOICE
                         Satin underwear? Crotchless panties? 
                         Leopard skin bra? Fishnet leotard? 
                         Leather G-string?

               EXT. ALLEY BEHIND COBO HALL - NIGHT

               Still trapped by the GROWLING, BARKING pack of dogs, Lex 
               searches nervously through the garbage behind him.

                                     LEX
                         Okay, okay, you're pissed off. I can 
                         see this. So... Maybe what we need... 
                         ah-ha.

               Lex holds up a worn-out, old frisbee.

                                     LEX
                         Play some frisbee, poochies?

               The pack just glares and SNARLS. He tosses the frisbee over 
               the packs' heads, but the dogs don't even acknowledge it. 
               They just keep BARKING and GROWLING.

               Meanwhile, an unnoticed dog at the rear of the pack, a mangy 
               Basset Hound, turns its flat head to see the frisbee land on 
               the ground behind him. His tail starts to wag.

                                     LEX
                              (exasperated)
                         Alright! I give up! I hearby and 
                         forthwith defer my destiny to you 
                         mutts. I may be an intelligent, 
                         upright, walking, homo-fucking sapien, 
                         but you fleabags are a force of 
                         nature. So, I'm just gonna sit here 
                         and wait for you to decide. If you 
                         let me live, I thank you. If you 
                         bite my head off, I'll die knowing I 
                         did all I could. It's up to you.

               Lex waits before the GROWLING, SNAPPING canines. Suddenly, 
               the Basset Hound runs up in front of the pack and drops the 
               frisbee at Lex's feet. Lex looks down at the floppy, wrinkly 
               dog, who wags its tail and PANTS furiously.

                                     LEX
                         Well, how do you like that?

               Lex starts to pet the hound, and one-by-one the rest of the 
               dogs shut-up. Shocked, Lex picks the frisbee up again and 
               throws it.

               This time the entire pack bolts after the Whammo product.

               Lex smiles, watching them fight for it in the air... in SLOW 
               MOTION... as the theme from "CHARIOTS OF FIRE" begins.

               The black Shepherd finally grabs the frisbee in its mouth 
               and runs back toward Lex. It's soon joined by the rest of 
               the pack. That's right about when Lex realizes they aren't 
               going to stop.

                                     LEX
                         Whoa! Whoa!

               The dogs plow into Lex full-force knocking him into the 
               garbage. They surround him licking his face. Lex bursts into 
               unstoppable laughter.

               Pulling himself up, he pets the dogs as they jump around him 
               wagging their tails and PANTING.

                                     LEX
                              (baby talk)
                         You sonsofbitches could tickle a guy 
                         to death, y'know that? Sure you do... 
                         Sure you do...

               Lex stops. He hears TALKING coming from inside the windowless, 
               brick building on the other side of the alley. He steps in 
               front of the pack and puts his fingers to his lips. They 
               obey, quieting instantly. He then tiptoes to a thin crack in 
               the brick wall. The dogs quietly follow.

               Lex puts his eye to the crack and peers in.

               INT. CHOP SHOP - NIGHT

               LEX'S POV

               His mom's Volvo and a BMW are on adjacent hydraulic lifts 
               inside a makeshift auto-mechanic shop.

               Two BEEFY JERKS with blow torches stand next to the cars. 
               One has a bandage on his head and seems to be in pain.

                                     BEEFY JERK #1
                         So, I jump into the car, hot-wire it 
                         in thirty seconds and start driving. 
                         Then, suddenly I hear this scream. 
                         The disco queen was asleep in the 
                         back seat.

               Beefy jerk #2 laughs.

                                     BEEFY JERK #1
                         You think it's funny? How would you 
                         like to have a stiletto heel smacking 
                         you in the temple when you're tryin' 
                         to work?

               Beefy jerk #2 laughs more. Beefy jerk #1 checks the time.

                                     BEEFY JERK #1
                         You about done splittin' a gut there?  
                         We gotta get these parts to Toledo 
                         by nine.

               Then a familiar voice is heard coming from the back of the 
               shop.

                                     CHRISTINE
                         Then maybe you guys'll let me go, 
                         huh?

               Lex follows the voice and sees Christine handcuffed to a 
               radiator near the rear of the shop.

                                     CHRISTINE
                         Come on, whadaya say? You scratch my 
                         back, I scratch yours. You let me 
                         go, and in return, I keep my big 
                         mouth shut about your little operation

                         You're lucky you're still alive, 
                         wench. If you was a guy, we woulda 
                         thought nothin' of sawing your head 
                         off with a butter knife.

                         What are we gonna do with her anyway?

                         I dunno, but she sure looks fun.

               Beefy jerk #1 touches the bandage on his head.

                                     BEEFY JERK #1
                         Yeah, and payback's a bitch.

               Christine GAGS at the thought.

               ANGLE ON WALL CRACK

               Lex's eyeball bulges with terror.

               EXT. IT'S RAINING MEN PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               DOLLY FROM the front end of a Jaguar XKE, Michigan vanity 
               plate reading: AMANDA.

               TO its windshield, through which we see Hawk and Amanda 
               kissing in the front seat, clad only in their underwear. 
               Something like "ME AND MRS. JONES" plays on the radio. When 
               they separate, Amanda takes out a flask and offers it to 
               Hawk.

                                     HAWK
                         Thanks.

               He gulps some down and pulls the flask away COUGHING.

                                     HAWK
                         What the hell is that?

                                     AMANDA
                         Gin.

                                     HAWK
                         Whoa. Some of this hard liquor's a 
                         tad too manly for me. I'm a brewski 
                         man myself.

                                     AMANDA
                         Better ease up then, Hawk. Wouldn't 
                         want to give you whiskey dick would 
                         we?

                                     HAWK
                         Who's Whiskey Dick?

               Amanda plants a stocking foot on Hawk's crotch and rubs.

                                     AMANDA
                         Well. Obviously no one you have to 
                         worry about... Woody.

                                     HAWK
                         My name's not Woody, it's Haw-haw...

               Hawk's eyes cross as he lets out a DEEP, OBNOXIOUS GROAN.

                                     HAWK
                         ...holy shit!

               Amanda looks down at his crotch.

                                     AMANDA
                         But you do know Premature Peter, 
                         don't you? Shame, I just bought these 
                         stockings.

               Hawk has never been more embarrassed.

                                     HAWK
                         Well, Amanda, this has been quite a 
                         night. So far you've seen me and my 
                         dick throw up.
                              (to the heavens)
                         What's next? Projectile diarrhea?
                              (beat, to Amanda)
                         Man. What a stud, huh?

                                     AMANDA
                         Believe it or not, you still have a 
                         way to go before you start competing 
                         with my soon-to-be-ex-husband... the 
                         champion of lousy lovemaking. The 
                         man who thinks he's the biggest and 
                         the best... The man who thinks every 
                         secretary, stewardess, and cocktail 
                         waitress he fucks should lick his 
                         feet for the honor. The man for whom 
                         faking it was invented. Christ, if I 
                         hadn't gotten pregnant with our son, 
                         I would have never known I even had 
                         sex with the prick.

               She takes a healthy swig of gin, relishing its bitterness.

                                     HAWK
                         You love him?

                                     AMANDA
                         I just told you, he's a big, hairy...

                                     HAWK
                         No, I mean... you love your son?

                                     AMANDA
                         More than anything in the world.

                                     HAWK
                         And he loves you back, doesn't he?

                                     AMANDA
                         He's a little spoiled, but I know he 
                         does.

                                     HAWK
                         Well, shame on him if he doesn't.

               She pats his shoulder.

                                     AMANDA
                         You're sweet.

               Hawk stares out the windshield.

                                     HAWK
                         My mom died of a heart attack while 
                         she was having me. Man, I wish I had 
                         known her for even one day. If they 
                         ever invent a time machine, that's 
                         what I'm doing. Going back in time 
                         to meet my mom. I'm gonna say, "Mrs.  
                         Pitchford?... or Miss Williams, 
                         depending on when I show up. You 
                         don't know me, but I'm your kid from 
                         the future. Just wanted to thank you 
                         for the blue eyes, pug nose and for 
                         tying the knot with a guy who didn't 
                         mind diaper detail... Oh, and, uh... 
                         cut down on the red meat, will ya?"

               Amanda caresses Hawk's cheek. He turns with her hand and 
               kisses it. He takes her arm and begins kissing his way up to 
               her neck, her cheek, her mouth...

                                  DR. LOVE TO THE RESCUE

               INT. SMILEY MART - NIGHT

               It's a stand-off. Prone customers look up at Trip and the 
               man with the long coat circling each other like sharks. The 
               helpless cashier lets out fearful sobs.

                                     MAN WITH COAT
                         Gimme your gun, boy!

                                     TRIP
                         No, you gimme your gun, boy!

                                     MAN WITH COAT
                         Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!

                                     TRIP
                         Not if I shoot first!

                                     MAN WITH COAT
                         I don't even think you have a gun!

                                     TRIP
                         Neither do I!

               The man with the coat puts his shotgun against Trip's head.

                                     MAN WITH COAT
                         Now, for the last time, take the 
                         piece out and lay back down or your 
                         mom's gonna need the White Tornado 
                         to get the brains outta your ski 
                         cap.

               Trip GULPS. The jig's up. He slowly pulls out Stretch 
               Armstrong, and the man with the coat glances down and starts 
               to laugh very loud. So loud, he throws his head back.

               When he recovers, Trip's got Stretch aimed at his head and 
               pulled back to maximum tension.

                                     TRIP
                         Smile, you sonofa...

               Trip lets go. WZZMACK! The man gets it right in the face and 
               falls backward onto the Hostess display, toppling a whole 
               bunch of Ho-Ho's, Ding-Dong's, Twinkies, and Suzy-O's to the 
               ground.

               Trip runs up and grabs the shotgun away as the man with the 
               coat lifts his head briefly, then passes out.

               Trip turns around and the cashier SLAMS into him, nearly 
               knocking him over. She throws her arms around him letting 
               out relieved SOBS. Behind her all the customers rise from 
               the floor CLAPPING. Trip did it. He saved the fucking store!

               The cashier looks into Trip's masked eyes.

                                     CASHIER
                         Thank you! Thank you!... Who are 
                         you?

                                     TRIP
                              (with confidence)
                         Call me... Dr. Love!

               She plants a thousand mega-watt kiss on his lips and we ZOOM 
               IN on her mood ring changing color from gray to fire engine 
               red.

               Trip's eyes widen just before... KABOOM... The shotgun he's 
               holding goes off, blowing a hole in the ceiling.

               The recoil from the blast jolts Trip and the cashier apart.  
               We now see Trip's face is smeared with bright, red lipstick.  
               A huge chunk of ceiling falls onto his head but he doesn't 
               move. The kiss hit him harder.

                            I'M HERE FOR THE GIRL AND THE CAR

               INT. CHOP SHOP - NIGHT

               BZZZZZ! Christine and the beefy jerks watch the brown, '78 
               Volvo, Ohio plates: OB-GYN, ascend on a hydraulic lift.

               Behind them sits the BMW skeleton. These boys work fast.

                                     CHRISTINE
                         You guys better kill me before you 
                         do what you're thinking of doing. 
                         Cause when I'm mad enough, I can 
                         bite down very hard.

               The beefy jerks laughs.

                                     BEEFY JERK #1
                         Sweet Polly Purebred's got some spunk, 
                         huh?

                                     BEEFY JERK #2
                         I'll give her some spunk alright.

               They put their blow torches down and turn to her.

                                     BEEFY JERK #1
                         We stripped that Beemer in fifteen 
                         minutes. Bet we can strip her in 
                         fifteen seconds.

               They giggle maniacally and lumber toward Christine. Their 
               shadows growing larger and larger across her.

                                     CHRISTINE

                         I know a dance we can do. The 
                         horizontal hustle.

               They both laugh. Just as they're about to grab her...

               Suddenly, the garage door behind them SLIDES UP revealing 
               darkness. Christine and the beefy jerks look out anxiously.

                                     BEEFY JERK #1
                         Who's there?

               Silence except for CRICKETS. Then... from out of the darkness 
               emerges a figure... Lex. Christine's eyes brighten like a 
               bulb.

                                     LEX
                         I'm here for the girl and the car. 
                         You can try to stop me, but I must 
                         warn you, it may be hazardous to 
                         your health.

               The beefy jerks laugh at this little punk. They start toward 
               him, one with a tire iron, the other a big monkey wrench.

                                     BEEFY JERK #1
                         Too bad. He was such a young idiot.

                         Ehhh. He was a stupid boy. He deserved 
                         to die.

               Lex lets out a quick HIGH-PITCHED WHISTLE. The pack of BARKING 
               dogs led by the Shepherd, the Pit Bull, the Doberman, and 
               the Basset Hound, step from the darkness and flank Lex, 
               GROWLING and SNARLING at the beefy jerks.

                         What music they make... Hounds of 
                         hell? Say hello to dinner!

               The beefy jerks drop their tools on their feet and yelp in 
               pain. The pack takes this as a threat and charge the beefy 
               jerks, who bolt for a glass-partitioned office. The dogs 
               SCRATCH and BARK at the window ferociously.

               Lex smiles at Christine. She smiles back. He presses the 
               "down" button on the lift and the Volvo descends. Lex yells 
               to the beefy jerks through the glass.

                                     LEX
                         One foot out of that office and your 
                         asses are Alpo!

               Lex unlocks Christine. She leaps into his arms.

                                     CHRISTINE
                         Wow! Thank you! You're cooler than 
                         the Fonz.

               She gives him a lingering kiss. Lex leans back, gives the 
               double thumbs-up, and says...

                                     LEX
                         Aaaayyyyy!

               Lex takes her hand and they walk over to the Volvo. Lex lets 
               her in then rounds the car to the driver's side.

                                     BEEFY JERK #1
                         Hey, what about the dogs?

                                     LEX
                         You got a phone in there?

               They nod. Lex drips a dry smile onto them.

                                     LEX
                         Call the cops.

               The beefy jerks watch in disbelief as the Volvo SCREECHES 
               out of the chop shop.

               EXT. WHITE CASTLE PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               Beth's parents wait in the running car as Jam and Beth share 
               a heartfelt good-bye outside the back door.

                                     BETH
                         Ann Arbor isn't... that far from 
                         Cleveland, right?

                                     JAM
                         Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I 
                         could come up all the time.

                                     BETH
                         That'd be great. Hey, maybe someday 
                         your band'll play there. It's a 
                         college town, you know?

               Jam takes her hands.

                                     JAM
                         I feel like such an idiot. Why didn't 
                         I just say something a year and a 
                         half ago? Man, think of how much 
                         time we wasted.

                                     BETH
                         Let's not think about the past. Let's 
                         just think about from today on. I'll 
                         never forget you, Jam.

                                     JAM
                         Tell me about it. Church will never 
                         be the same again.

               They stare at each other for a really long time. Then, kiss.

               BEEP. BEEP. Dad looks back out the window and CLEARS HIS 
               THROAT LOUDLY.

                                     BETH

                         Coming dad.
                              (to Jam)
                         I'll call you. Soon as we get a phone. 
                         Bye.

                                     JAM
                         Bye.

               She gets in the car. They both wave as the Impala turns a 
               corner out of sight. Jam is left alone still waving long 
               after she's gone.

               INT. AMANDA'S JAG - NIGHT

               Amanda and Hawk are half-dressed post-coitus. She looks in 
               her purse.

                                     HAWK
                         Amanda, as ironic as this is gonna 
                         sound, I can't take any money for... 
                         I'm no Midnight Cowboy, y'know. It 
                         would only cheapen the whole deal 
                         for me.

                                     AMANDA
                         I'm not paying you for the lovemaking, 
                         Hawk. I just want you to have whatever 
                         you needed the money for when you 
                         took me up on my offer.

               She forces the money into his palm.

                                     HAWK
                         ...Thanks.

               They kiss.

                                     AMANDA
                         You're a good man, Hawk. Thank you.

               EXT. SMILEY MART - NIGHT

               The cashier, shoppers, and a gathering CROWD watch two cops 
               load the dazed man with the coat into a cruiser.

                                     COP #1
                              (to cashier)
                         You wouldn't happen to know where we 
                         could find this... Dr. Love, would 
                         you?

                                     CASHIER
                         It's company policy to hand over a 
                         cash reward of a hundred and fifty 
                         dollars to anyone who stops a robbery. 
                         I gave him the money and he took 
                         off.

               The cops shrug and get into the cruiser.

                                     COP #2
                         Okay, well, thanks anyway. And let 
                         us know if you happen to see him 
                         again. We'd like to ask him some 
                         questions.

               The cruiser takes off and the cashier stares at her mood 
               ring. It throbs red like a beating heart.

                                     CASHIER
                              (sighing to herself)
                         If I see Dr. Love any time soon, 
                         you're gonna have to wait till I'm 
                         done with him first.

               CAMERA TRACKS BACK QUICKLY AND SWINGS JUST AROUND THE CORNER.

               EXT. SMILEY MART PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               We find Trip counting his money out to the little kid, Chongo, 
               and their two buds.

                                     TRIP
                         ...hundred forty, hundred fifty.  
                         That's all I got.

               The little kid puts the money in his pocket.

                                     LITTLE KID
                         Tsk. Tsk. Tsk. I really wanted things 
                         to work out for you, my weasly, dim-
                         witted friend. You got spunk.
                              (to Chongo)
                         Chongo, give him a fifty dollar 
                         wallop.

               Chongo reels back and...

                                     TRIP
                         Oh, no... Please, look.  I...

               THWAM! Right in Trip's face. Trip flies off his feet into 
               the Smiley Mart brick wall with a THUD. A bag of weed drops 
               from his jacket, then some uppers, a few sheets of acid, and 
               finally a can of beer rolls out.

                                     CHONGO
                         Hey, the jerkoff's got drugs.

                                     LITTLE KID
                         Consider it a bonus, Chongo.

               Chongo laughs like an ejaculating gorilla as he and his two 
               buds scoop it all up. The little kid, Chongo, and the buds 
               leave Trip lying in a puddle of his own nose blood.

               He pulls out Stretch Armstrong and looks at him fondly.

                                     TRIP
                              (misty eyed)
                         At least I still got you, Stretch.

               Trip looks up. The six year olds who he stole it from stand 
               close by having watched the whole humiliating exchange. 
               Licked, Trip tosses the doll to them. They both dash away 
               with it, giggling.

               EXT. NEARBY STREET - NIGHT

               Christine sits in an idling taxi taking money from Lex, who 
               stands outside the window.

                                     LEX
                         This oughta be enough to get you to 
                         Disco Inferno, Christine.

                                     CHRISTINE
                         Come with. It's not too late for you 
                         to catch the fever.

                                     LEX
                         No can do. But I made a promise to 
                         get you to that disco, and we KISS 
                         maniacs are men of our word. 
                         Besides... you're pretty cool... for 
                         a stella, I mean.

               Christine takes his hand and writes something on his palm in 
               lipstick.

                                     CHRISTINE
                         Here's my number. Tell me how cool I 
                         am over the phone sometime. Okay?

               She gives Lex a kiss then pushes him away.

                                     CHRISTINE
                              (to CABBIE)
                         Disco Inferno, on the double.

               The taxi SCREECHES away as Lex smiles and gets back into the 
               Volvo.

               INT. COBO HALL - NIGHT

               Jam approaches the stadium, passing the MATMOKS, walking 
               straight up to Mrs. Bruce. Her back is to him. He taps her 
               on the shoulder. She turns. Her jaw drops. It escaped again! 
               And what an ugly tee-shirt.

                                     JAM
                         I'm gonna ask you nicely first. Mom, 
                         can I have my drumsticks back?

               Taken aback by his confidence, Mrs. Bruce grabs his ear and 
               tries to pull him away. He won't budge.

                                     JAM
                         Again, can I have my drumsticks?

               A BUNCH OF IDIOTS walk by with big transistor radios. One of 
               them holds a Mr. Microphone and heckles the MATMOKS.

                                     LEAD IDIOT
                         Hey, I'm on the radio! Hi, good-
                         lookin'. We'll be back to pick you 
                         up later!

               Mrs. Bruce yells at Jam through her bullhorn.

                                     MRS. BRUCE
                         Drumsticks are the least of your 
                         worries, young man. You are in a 
                         world of...

               Jam yanks the Mr. Microphone from the lead idiot and screams 
               at his mother, his voice amplified on the transistors. 
               Everyone stares.

                                     JAM
                         I know, mom, I've been in trouble 
                         for about twelve hours now! 
                         Hellooooo!?

               The other MATMOKS turn to look as Jam climbs onto a trash 
               receptacle and shouts down at his mother, his face slowly 
               turning purple.

                                     JAM
                         I'm gonna be spending the next two 
                         years of my life at St. Bernard's 
                         Boarding School, remember?! I'm gonna 
                         be outta your hair till I'm a legal 
                         adult, remember?! That way, all you 
                         have to do is go to church, light a 
                         candle, pray to a little statue for 
                         me, and voila! All is forgiven and 
                         forgotten, right mom?!! Then, you 
                         can spend your days in guilt-free 
                         pursuit of more constructive 
                         activities like telling everybody 
                         else how screwed up their lives are! 
                         That way you no longer need the 
                         patience and understanding required 
                         to communicate on some normal level 
                         with your own child!!! And that way 
                         you don't even have to think about 
                         how tough it was for you when you 
                         were growing up, and it's a good 
                         thing too. Cause if you did, you'd 
                         realize what a LOUSY, GODDAMN, SHITTY-
                         ASS, PARENT YOU ARE!!!

               The crowd of KISS fans APPLAUD Jam's rant. Mrs. Bruce is 
               utterly winded from the assault.

                                     MRS. BRUCE
                              (timidly)
                         Jeremiah... what's gotten into you?

                              (into Mr. Microphone)
                         I just lost my virginity in a 
                         confessional booth! Lord have mercy!!

               The crowd cheers. Jam jumps down and hands the Mr. Microphone 
               back to the lead idiot. He turns to his mom.

                                     JAM
                         For the last time, mom. Let me have 
                         my fucking drumsticks. Please.

               Mrs. Bruce reaches into the trash, finds the drumsticks and 
               hands them to him. He spins them like pistols, then stuffs 
               them into his socks and walks away.

                                       SIMPLE PLAN

               EXT. IT'S RAINING MEN STRIP CLUB - NIGHT

               Hawk runs to the scalper across the street who's selling a 
               ticket to another KISS fan.

                                     HAWK
                         Whoa! Whoa! WHOA! That better not be 
                         the last ticket! I hope you have 
                         another one for me!

               The scalper sees Hawk and bolts down the street disappearing 
               around a corner. Hawk stops. He's lost him.

               Hawk sulks to the now-familiar intersection where all four 
               landmarks meet. He takes one more look up the block at Cobo 
               Hall. Nearly all the KISS fans are inside. The streets are 
               almost deserted.

                                     HAWK
                         Fuck me!

               He sees someone out of the corner of his eye across the 
               street. It's Jam. Lex approaches the other corner. Trip comes 
               up to the forth corner. They all stop when they see each 
               other. Each standing on his own corner. They're all pissed. 
               They meet in the middle of the street as last minute CONCERT 
               GOERS hurry by.

                                     HAWK
                         Any luck?

                                     TRIP
                         Plenty, but it was all bad.

                                     LEX
                         I found the Volvo.

                                     HAWK
                         Tickets?

               They all shake no.

                                     HAWK
                         Well, dudes, the only way we're gonna 
                         see KISS this tour is by some fuckin' 
                         miracle.

               Suddenly, a commotion up the street. A SURLY MOM yanks four 
               12 YEAR OLD BRATS dressed like KISS by the scruffs of their 
               necks. She's furious, they're CRYING.

                                     SURLY MOM
                         How dare you sneak out of the house 
                         like that! You had me worried to 
                         death! Don't you know this is Detroit! 
                         And for a degenerate band like KISS! 
                         They're sick, sick, sick and oughta 
                         be in jail with their vile antics!

               She throws a wad of paper to the pavement as they pass our 
               four heroes. The dudes watch her pull the brats away.

                                     SURLY MOM
                         Just wait until your father gets 
                         ahold of you!

               Jam, Hawk, Lex, and Trip turn and look at the crumpled wad 
               at their feet. It's an envelope. An ANGELIC SPOTLIGHT FROM 
               ABOVE highlights it.

                                     LEX
                         No... You don't think...?

                                     HAWK
                         Nah. Couldn't be.

               They all shake their heads in unison resolved that it isn't. 
               Then, unable to control themselves, they dive for the 
               envelope. Jam tears it open. His trembling hand reaches in.  
               All their eyes focus like lasers on what's inside.

               Jam pulls out four KISS tickets. Their jaws drop. Their eyes 
               bug.

                                     JAM
                         It's a miracle! A miracle!

               The boys are practically moved to tears. It's Divine 
               Intervention at its finest.

               Suddenly, a greasy hand juts out of nowhere and grabs the 
               tickets. The boys look up shocked. They can't believe it.

                                     ALL FOUR BOYS
                         ELVIS?!!

               Yes, Elvis. Fire in his eyes. Mania on his mind. And tickets 
               in his hand.

                                     ELVIS
                              (laughing hysterically)
                         Whose laughing now?! Whose laughing 
                         now, ya little shits?! I told ya... 
                         Over my dead body! Ha-HA-HAAA!

                                     HAWK
                              (arms outstretched)
                         Take it easy, Elvis. Don't do anything 
                         crazy. Just give me the tickets before 
                         someone gets hurt.

                                     TRIP
                         Hey, wait a minute! This ain't school 
                         property! He's not the boss of us 
                         here!

                                     ELVIS
                              (crazed)
                         That's right. This ain't school. 
                         It's not about school anymore. Now 
                         it's personal.

                                     LEX
                         Come on, Elvis. We was only kiddin'. 
                         It's all in good fun. We run, you 
                         chase. Cat and mouse. You know.

                                     ELVIS
                         Boys, this time... I win!

               Elvis stuffs all four tickets in his mouth and chews crazily. 
               In seconds, GULP. Elvis explodes into unhinged laughter as 
               he runs away zigzagged down the street.

               Our boys are left dumbstruck and speechless. After a really 
               long pause...

                                     JAM
                         Well... I still got my idea if anybody 
                         will let me speak.

                                     HAWK
                              (beaten)
                         Go ahead, Jam.

                                     JAM
                         We all beat each other up, then, 
                         once we're nice and bruised, we run 
                         over to the ticket takers and say we 
                         got mugged and our tickets were 
                         stolen. They gotta let us in then.

               They stand and think for a moment. Hawk's mouth curls into a 
               devilish grin.

               Then, he lets out a gigantic "AIEEE!!! and slugs Jam. The 
               four boys brutally pummel one another in the middle of the 
               intersection. Punching. Kicking. Headbutting.

               EXT. COBO HALL - NIGHT

               Two TICKET TAKERS are letting the last KISS fans in. They're 
               about to close the doors when our four bloodied and bruised 
               heroes come running up.

                                     HAWK
                         Dude, you gotta let us in! Four 
                         muggers just stole our tickets!

                                     TICKET TAKER
                              (sceptical)
                         You expect us to believe that?

                                     JAM
                         Look at us!

               Trip points into the crowd of fans inside the auditorium 
               foyer.

                                     TRIP
                         It was those assholes! They even 
                         stole my wallet!

               The ticket takers turn to see the little kid, Chongo, and 
               their two buds just going in. The ticket takers signal two 
               security guards who proceed to stop the four stunned kids 
               and confiscate their tickets. They find all the stolen dope 
               and Trip's wallet.

                                     TRIP
                         Inside that you'll find my KISS Army 
                         picture I.D. and a hundred fifty 
                         bucks cash.

               The security guards see he's right and break out the cuffs.

                                     TRIP
                              (to little kid)
                         Tsk. Tsk. Tsk. I was really hoping 
                         things would work out for you, my 
                         weasly, midget friend. You got spunk.

               The little kid for once is speechless.

               Then the ticket taker extends his arm in SLOW MOTION into 
               COBO Hall as if to say "Entrez Vous." The four friends pause.

                                     JAM
                         This is it!

               They take a few slow steps almost as if they don't believe 
               it, then run like the wind into the auditorium.

                                    DETROIT ROCK CITY

               INT. COBO HALL AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

               The lights are out. The lighters have been lit. The CROWDS' 
               ROAR is deafening.

               Jam, Hawk, Trip, and Lex plow their way through the throngs 
               and head straight for the front row just as Simple Simon 
               takes the stage.

                                     SIMPLE SIMON
                         You wanted the best! And you got the 
                         best! The hottest band in the world... 
                         KISS!!!

               Simple Simon runs from the stage just as the opening chords 
               to DETROIT ROCK CITY BEGIN.

               On the beat, BOOM, FIREWORKS shoot from the floor alighting 
               the place. KISS takes the stage descending on hydraulic 
               elevators.

               ON JAM, HAWK, TRIP, AND LEX

               They're seeing God!

               The show is spectacular. The costumes. The make-up. The 
               blitzkrieg of pyrotechnics. The flashing KISS sign. Ace's 
               smoking guitar. Gene's spewing fire. Paul's rockin' vocals. 
               Peter's kick-ass beat.

               Then, something really weird happens.

               The crowd behind the boys heaves forward. Jam is pushed like 
               a twig in a flood and over the shoulders of those in front 
               of him. Purely by accident, he is thrown onto the stage 
               landing on his stomach between Paul and Gene. Just before 
               Peter's drum solo is about to start.

               Gene, Paul, and Ace silence their instruments. Peter throws 
               his drumstick into the air intending to catch it when it 
               comes down. But the sight of Jam landing on the stage 
               distracts him.

               All is mute as Peter misses the drumstick. It hits the outside 
               edge of one of the drums.

               Thinking fast, Jam grabs one of his drumsticks out of his 
               sock and tosses it to Peter. It tumbles through the air in 
               SLOW MOTION with a LOW, WHOOPING, HELICOPTER SOUND. We see 
               the word "Mystery" clearly as it twirls.

               Instantly, it's caught in Peter Criss's hand and he brings 
               it down on his drum not missing a beat. The song resumes 
               with all its fury as Peter's drum kit ascends on a hydraulic 
               platform.

               Jam scrambles from the stage and leaps back into the audience 
               barely missing the claws of some security guards.

               The four friends pound on each other with unbridled, teenage 
               exuberance. Will it ever get any better than this?

               FREEZE FRAME.

                                                             FADE TO WHITE:

                                         THE END
DJANGO UNCHAINED

                         I

          EXT - COUNTRYSIDE - BROILING HOT DAY

          As the film's OPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE plays, complete with its own
          SPAGHETTI WESTERN THEME SONG, we see SEVEN shirtless and shoeless
          BLACK MALE SLAVES connected together with LEG IRONS, being run,
          by TWO: WHITE MALE HILLBILLIES on HORSEBACK.

          The location is somewhere in Texas. The Black Men (ROY, BIG SID,
          BENJAMIN, DJANGO, PUDGY RALPH, FRANKLYN, and BLUEBERRY) are slaves just
          recently purchased at The Greenville Slave Auction in Greenville
          Mississippi. The White Hillbillies are two Slave Traders called,
          The SPECK BROTHERS (ACE and DICKY).

          One of the seven slaves is our hero DJANGO... . he's fourth in the leg
          iron line. We may or may not notice a tiny small "r" burned into his
          cheek ("r" for runaway), but we can't help but notice his back which
          has been SLASHED TO RIBBONS by Bull Whip Beatings.

          As the Operatic Opening Theme Song plays, we see a MONTAGE of misery
          and pain, as Django and the Other Men are walked through blistering
          sun, pounding rain, and moved along by the end of a whip. Bare feet
          step on hard rock, and slosh through mud puddles. Leg Irons take the
          skin off ankles.

          AS The CREDITS play, DJANGO has a SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK.
          Now Spaghetti Western Flashbacks are never pretty, it's usually the
          time in the film when the lead character thinks back to the most
          painful memory inflicted on him or his loved ones from evil characters
          from his past. In this instance we see Django in a SLAVE PEN at the
          Greenville Auction.

                         DJANGO
          Amongst many other shoulders and heads, sees through the bars of the
          cell door, his wife BROOMHILDA being led to the auction block.

          He fights his way to the door, and far off and obscure in the distance,
          he can see Broomhilda up on the auction block, and in the distance he
          hears the Auctioneer yell; "Sold." Then she's taken away to whereabouts
          unknown, never to be seen again.

          As the sun continues to beat down on Django's head, he remembers;

          DJANGO in the SLAVE PEN
          with what seems like a one hundred and fifty Slaves in a cell designed
          for forty.

          WHITE MEN yank him out. of the cell, shirtless, shoeless, and lead him
          down a hallway, into a giant round pen, an audience viewing area
          circles the round pen floor on three different stories of the
          structure.

          The ground floor is covered by the BIG MONEY BUYERS who stand in front

          is moved into a line of SLAVES (The Black Men), and their MASTERS
          (their White Owners), and their SELLERS (the White Man actually doing
          the sales pitch on the auction block), as they wait for their turn on
          the block.
          A SLAVE (ROBBIE), stand on the auction block in view of the room full
          of Buyers, The SELLER sells, and the OWNERS stand off to the side.

                         DJANGO
          takes in the environment around him. Django has never cared for white
          folks, but these white folks are in particularly ugly.

          It's DJANGO's turn ON THE AUCTION BLOCK
          as the THEME SONG wails its tragic crescendo, Django is brought up on
          the auction block. He.looks down at all the WHITE PEOPLE who want to
          buy Niggers, who look up to him.
          His heart fills with poison.

          end.


          /--" EXT - WOODS -- NIGHT

          It's night time and The Speck Brothers, astride HORSES, keep pushing
          their black skinned cargo forward.
          It's a very pitch black night, with only a few stars in the.sky to
          create a little top light. It's so dark, the Slavers use the creek.bed
          to keep from getting lost. Both Speck Brothers carry a lantern up on
          their horse, as. does Roy, the Slave in lead position on the chain gang.
          It's also a bitterly cold night, with the breath of the seven slaves,
          two slavers, and two horses creating clouds in the air. In fact the
          seven chained together Slaves, with the lead one holding a lantern, and
          all of them chugging out smoky breath, and. slightly moving in unison,
          resemble a human locomotive.
          The Slaves shiver from the cold on their shirtless backs, both Speck
          Brothers wear rawhide winter coats with white fur linings, and white
          fur collars.

          WHEN...
          .A SOUND and a SMALL LIGHT appears ahead of them on the road. This
          makes the Slave Traders stop their human live stock, and ready their
          rifles for possible trouble.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         3

          A BLACK HORSE
          carrying a dressed in grey Rider, CLIP-CLOPS from the background to the
          foreground, illuminated by a glowing lantern that the Rider carries.

                         THE RIDER
          appears to be a tenderfoot, due to his style of dress. A long grey
          winter'coat, over a grey three piece business suit, and a grey bowler
          hat on his head.

                         DICKY SPECK
          Who's that stumblin around in the dark?
          State your business, or prepare to get
          winged!

                         THE RIDER
          Calm yourselves gentlemen, I mean you no
          harm. I'm simply a fellow weary traveler.
          The Rider dressed in business grey pulls his horse to a stop in front
          of the two Slavers, and their Slaves, lifting the lantern up to his
          face. He speaks with a slight German accent.

                         THE RIDER
          (to the Slavers)
          Good cold evening gentlemen.
          (to the shivering Slaves)
          Good evening-I'm looking for a pair of
          slave traders that go by the'name of
          The Speck Brothers. Might that be you?

                         ACE SPECK
          Who wants to. know?

                         THE RIDER
          I do. I'm Dr. King Schultz, and this
          is my horse, Fritz.
          Fritz, does a little bow with his head, a neat trick the doctor taught
          him.

                         DICKY SPECK
          You a doctor?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Affirmative.

                         DICKY SPECK
          What kinda doctor?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Dentist. Are you The Speck Brothers, and did you
          purchase those men at The Greenville.Slave Auction?

                         ACE SPECK
          So what?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         LE
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          So, I wish to parley with you.

                         ACE SPECK
          Speak English!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Oh, I'm sorry. Please forgive me, it is a
          second language. Amongst your inventory,
          I've been led to believe, is a specimen
          I'm keen to acquire.
          (to the slaves)
          Hello you poor devils. Is there one among
          you, who was formerly a resident of
          The Carrucan Plantation?
          Since Roy in lead position is the one holding the lantern, the second
          half of the slave centipede falls off into darkness. In the darkness a
          VOICE rings out;

          DJANGO'S VOICE (OS)
          I'm from The Carrucan Plantation.
          Dr.Schultz moves Fritz forward towards the darkness, raises his
          lantern, illuminating our hero Django.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Splendid! And what's your name young, man?

                         DJANGO
          Django.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Wunderbar! You're exactly the one I'm looking
          for. So tell me Django - by the way that's a
          amazing name - during your time at the
          Carrucan Plantation, did you come to know
          three overseers by the name of The Brittle
          Brothers?
          Django nods his head, yes.
          Dr.Schultz is delighted.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Big John, Ellis, and little brother Raj?

                         DJANGO
          Dem da Brittle Brothers.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          So Django, do you think you could recognize -
          ï¿½. The Speck Brothers have been watching this tenderfoot engage their
          Slave in polite conversation.. .with a touch of disbelief.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         ACE SPECK
          Hey, stop talkin' to him like that!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Like what?

                         ACE SPEC
          Like that!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          My good man, I'm simply trying to ascertain

                         ACE SPECK
          Speak English, goddamit!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Everybody calm down! I'm simply a customer
          trying to conduct a transaction.

                         ACE SPECK
          I don't care, no sale. Now off wit ya!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Don't be ridiculous, of course they're for
          sale.
          Ace raises his rifle towards the German.

                         ACE SPECK
          Move it!
          Ace cocks back the rifle hammer.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          My good man, did you simply get carried away
          with your dramatic gesture, or are you
          pointing that weapon at me with lethal
          intention...?

                         ACE SPECK
          Last chance, fancy pants
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          - Very well -
           The doctor, throws his lantern to the ground, enveloping him in
          darkness.
          The next FLASH OF LIGHT we see is the good doctors PISTOL out of his
          holster, and FIRING point blank into Ace Specks face...
          .BLOWING the dumber dumb brother off his horse, dead in the dirt.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Before Dicky can maneuver either his rifle or his horse in the Germans
          direction...

          BAM...
          Dr.SCHULTZ SHOOTS his HORSE in the head...
          .The Steed goes down taking Dicky with him...
          When the dead weight horse lands on Dicky's slightly twisted leg, we
          hear TWO DISTINCT CRACKING SOUNDS.:..
          Dicky lets out a bitch like scream.
          The Slaves watch all this. They've never seen a white man kill another
          white man before.
          Dicky is pinned down under his ole paint.
          Django watches in the dark, the German climb down off his horse,
          pick up Ace's discarded lantern, and walk over to the remaining Speck.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Sorry about putting a bullet in your beast.
          But I didn't want you to do anything rash
          before you had a moment to come to your senses.
          Dr.Sch.ultz LIGHTS the lantern, illuminating himself, as he stands over
          Dicky's body.

                         DICKY SPECK
          You goddamn son of a bitch, you killed Ace!
          Dr.SCHULTZ.
          I only shot your brother, once he threatened
          to shoot me. And I do believe I have ...

                         (COUNTING OUT

                         THE SLAVES)
          .one, two, three, four, five, six,
          seven witnesses who can attest to that fact.

                         DICKY SPECK
          My damn legs busted!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          No doubt. Now, if you can keep your
          caterwauling down to a minimum, I'd like
          to finish my line of inquiry with young Django.

                         (TO DJANGO)
          As I was saying, if you were to see
          the Brittle Brothers again, would you
          recognize them?

                         DJANGO
          Yes.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Now I'm sure. to you, all unshaven white men
          look alike. So Django, in a crowd of
          unshaven white men, can you honestly
          and positively point out The Brittle Brothers?

          DJANGO SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK
          We're in his little shack at the Carrucan Plantation. It's PISSING RAIN
          outside. Django is making love to his wife Broomhilda, when she stops
          letting out a shout. The three overseers known as THE BRITTLE BROTHERS
          are outside peeking in through the window. They BURST in through the
          front door. Soaked to the bone, they rodeo bull their way into the
          shack, and make the two slaves continue fucking for their amusement.
          As Django and Broomhilda are forced to copulate, they run their wet
          white hands down her chocolate leg.. .they fondle his ass.. .they squeeze
          her tit. . .they bring a belt across Django's backside to make him fuck
          faster. . .then they yank him off, as BIG JOHN climbs on top of
          Broomhilda..the other Brittle brothers whip Django with their belts,
          and make him sit in the corner, while they finish with his wife.

          BACK TO DJANGO

                         DJANGO
          I can point 'em out.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Sold American! So Mr.Speck, how much for
          Django?

                         DICKY SPECK
          I'm gonna lose this leg!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes, unless you find a talented physician
          very quickly, I'm afraid that will be the.
          end result. But back to business, how much
          do you want for Django?

                         DICKY SPECK
          You go to hell!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Don't be silly. How much for Django?

                         DICKY SPECK
          800 dollars!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Oh come now, I may not have the experience in
          the slave trade that you and your family does,
          but neither was I born yesterday.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         8
          The. good doctor removes a pamphlet from his grey suit coat pocket.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          In this most helpful pamphlet that I picked
          up at The Greenville Slave Auction, it says
          that the going rate for African flesh'
          - in particularly a field nigger -_is sixty
          to eighty dollars. Now handsome no doubt as
          Django is, technically, he is a field. nigger.
          Which according to"this pamphlet here - and
          why would they lie - puts his price at
          eighty dollars. So in light of that, how
          bout a hundred and twenty five dollars for
          young Django here.
          Dr.Schultz removes his long billfold from his pocket, and takes out a
          one hundred dollar bill, two tens and a fiver.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          And since your late brother. won't be using
          it anymore, I'd like to purchase his nag.
          He removes a twenty dollar gold piece from his. pocket, and tosses it on
          Dicky's body. He bends down and, puts the paper money-.in the saddle bags
          on Dicky's dead horse. With.his hands in there, he roots around and
          finds the keys to-the leg irons. He unlocks Django's leg irons.
          Django is free.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          There you go Django,. Give your ankles a good
          rubbing, then get up on that horse.
          Also, if I was you, I'd take that winter
          coat the dear departed Speck left behind.
          Django removes the coat from the dead slaver. Puts on the warm jacket
          over his bare back, and climbs up on Ace Specks horse.
          Dr.Schultz turns to Dicky on the ground.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Mr.Speck, I am afraid I will require a
          bill of sale. Do you have one?
          Dicky just curses him.
          He says, removing a notebook from his pocket;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I thought not. No worries, I come prepared.
          (as he writes)
          This will serve nicely as a bill of sale.
          (he stops, then
          says to Django)
          Django is spelled with a silent "D",
          is it not?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         9

                         DJANGO
          Huh?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Why not..
          He writes it in his book with a silent "D", then stops to admire the
          way it looks.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes, that does add a little character.
          The German dentist lowers himself by the Speck brother pinned down
          under his horse, and hands him the notebook and pen.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          If you'd be so kind Speck, as to make your
          mark here.
          The. Hillbilly spits in the German gentleman's face. The good doctor
          wipes his face with a handkerchief. Then takes out a pocket knife.
          And whispers something that can't be heard in the slavers ear.
          He signs the bill of sale.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Mr.Speck, I would like to say it was a
          pleasure doing business with you, but your
          customer service leaves a lot to be desired.
          The good doctor climbs back up on Fritz, and looks to the six Slaves, in
          leg irons.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Now as to you poor devils.
          He tosses to Pudgy Ralph the keys to the shackles.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          So as I.see it, when it comes to the subject
          of what to do next, you gentlemen have two
          choices. One, once I'm gone, you lift that
          beast off the remaining Speck, then carry him
          to the nearest town. Which would be at least
          thirty-seven miles back the way you came.
          Or ...
          .Two, you unshackle yourselves, take that
          rifle over there. . .put a bullet in his head,
          bury the two of them deep, and make your way
          to a more enlightened area of the country.
          The choice is yours.
          He's just about ready to ride off, when the good doctor adds;

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         0
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Oh, and on the off chance that there's
          any astronomy aficionados amongst you,
          the North Star is THAT ONE. Tata.
          He looks to Django, who doesn't know how to start his horse.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Just give him a little kick.
          Django does, and the horse responds by moving.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          See, it's not so difficult.

          EXT - MORNING TEXAS LANDSCAPE - SUNRISE
          The DAWN BREAKS on a western landscape. The two men ride their horses
          silently, horse hooves CLIP-CLOPPING among the rocks. Django wears
          Specks winter coat, with one of Dr.Schultz's white button down dress
          shirts underneath it. As they ride through the picturesque scene...
          Dr.Schultz breaks the silence.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          So, Django, what do you intend to name him?

                         DJANGO
          Who?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Your horse?

                         DJANGO
          What horse?
          Dr.SCHULTZ'
          The horse you're riding.

                         DJANGO
          This ain't my horse.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes it is.

                         DJANGO
          No it ain't, it's your horse. I'm just riding
          it.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well, technically, yes - Wait a minute -
          technically not. If it's my horse, I can
          give it to you, and as of now, I'm doing such.
          Django, you're now the proud owner of a horse,
          congratulations.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         /1

                         DJANGO
          I can't feed no horse. I can't put no horse
          up in no stable.
          Dr.SCHULTZ

                         (FRUSTRATED)
          Don't worry about all that!
          They ride a bit longer in silence.. .the good doctor composes himself...
          then says with a smile;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          So... . now that that's settled... . what do you
          intend to name it? Half the fun of having
          a horse is choosing his name. For instance
          my steed is named Fritz. He's stubborn,
          ornery, and prone to a bad disposition, but I
          couldn't do without him.
          (he pats Fritz's neck)
          Anyway, the name of one's steed, isn't
          something one does lightly. So once you've
          thought about it for awhile -

                         DJANGO
          - Tony.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          - Tony what?

                         DJANGO
          - I dunno, Tony the horse.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Oh, you mean you want to name your horse
          Tony?

                         DJANGO
          Yeah. That's what you jus' asked me, right?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          When you're right you're right, indeed I did.
          Why Tony?

                         DJANGO
          I gotta tell ya? You didn't tell me I gotta
          tell ya.
          As they continue to converse, they start heading downhill toward a
          western town. They pass by a sign that says; "WELCOME TO DAUGHTREY,

                         TEXAS"

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         /Z
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well I'm naturally curious, of course, but
          there's no reason you MUST tell me. In fact
          an air of mystery adds a dash of panache to
          any steed. And I do believe Tony wears it
          well. Good job Django, well done.

          EXT - THE WESTERN TOWN OF DAUGHTREY - MORNING
          As the citizens of Daughtrey wake up, Django and Dr.Schultz ride Fritz
          and Tony through the main street of town..Daughtrey looks like a
          million western towns we've seen before in movies. But to the
          TOWNSPEOPLE of Daughtrey, Django and the German don't look like a
          million other visitors.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          What's everybody staring at?

                         DJANGO
          They never seen a nigger on a horse before.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          What's this bizarre obsession they have
          with. you not riding horses?

                         DJANGO
          You askin' me?
          Dr.Schultz stops Fritz in front of a saloon, and dismounts. Django has
          a little trouble both stopping Tony and getting off him, but it gets
          done. Dr.Schultz keeps bombarding The Slave with questions.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          So what other archaic rituals are you people
          verboten to take part in?
          As per usual with this white man, Django thinks; "What"?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I'm just trying to get a clear idea on what
          you can do, and what you can't do, and if
          you can't do it, why can't you do it?
          Like for instance, what if we were to walk
          in this saloon here, sit down at a table,
          order a drink, and drink it?
          Would the authorities frown on that?

                         DJANGO
          Hell yeah, they gonna frown.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          What part would they find the most offensive?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         13

                         DJANGO
          All of it. I can't be walkin' in no saloon.
          I can't be sittin' my ass on no chair,
          at no table. I can't be drinkin' no drink.
          And I definitely can't be sharin' no drink,
          with no white man, in public.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          So if you and I did those things, that would
          be considered enough of a infraction to make
          the saloon keeper go get the sheriff?

                         DJANGO
          You bet your sweet ass they get the sheriff.
          The good doctor extends his hand towards the saloon entrance.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well in that case Django, after you.

                         DJANGO
          Whoa - I ain't funnin, I can't go in there.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Django you're going to have to learn to trust
          me, and as the man said; "There's no time
          like the,present."
          He takes Django by the arm and leads him into the entryway of the
          establishment.

          INT - SALOON - MORNING
          The nervous black slave and the confident German'dentist walk into the
          saloon.
          The SALOON KEEPER (PETE) is high up on a chair placed high up on a
          table, to change a candle in the saloons chandelier. His back is turned
          away from the two patrons.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Good morning inn keeper, two beers for two
          weary travelers.

                         SALOON KEEPER
          It',s still pretty early, we won't be open
          for about a hour. But by then we'll be
          servin' breakfast -
          He turns around and sees them.

                         SALOON KEEPER
          Whoa! What the hell you think you doin' boy,
          get that nigger outta here.

                         TIME CUT

          EXT - SALOON - MORNING
          It's about five minutes later, and the Saloon Keeper comes running out
          of the bar to get the Sheriff.
          When Dr.Schultz, sitting at a table with the young Django, calls;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Inn keeper! Remember, get the sheriff, not
          the marshall. This wouldn't be the marshalls
          jurisdiction.'This is just a infraction,
          on what I assume is a simple county ordinance,
          and that would fall under the domain of the
          Sheriff.
          The Saloon Keeper runs away.
          The two men sit by themselves in the empty saloon.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          It looks like we must act as our own bartender.
          The German stands up, and walks-behind the bar, and pours two beer's
          from the tap into mugs. Django remains seated, and after a beat, asks;

                         DJANGO
          What kinda dentist are you?
          This makes the doctor laugh, as he pours the beer's.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I haven't practiced dentistry in five years -
          Not to say once I know you better, I wouldn't
          like to get a look at that mouth - I'm sure
          it's a disaster - But these days I practice
          a new profession ... . Bounty Hunter.
          This gets no reaction from Django.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Do you know what a Bounty Hunter is?
          The Black Man shakes his head, no.
          As the good doctor, walks back to the table carrying the mugs of beer,

                         HE EXPLAINS;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well the way the slave trade deals in
          human lives for cash, a bounty hunter,
          deals in corpses.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         15
          Dr.SCHULTZ (CONT'D)
          The state places a bounty on a man's head.
          I track that man, I find that man, I kill
          that man. After I've killed him, I transport
          that man's corpse back to the authorities -
          and sometimes that's easier said then done.
          I show that corpse to the authorities -
          proving, yes indeed, I have truly killed him
          - At which point, the authorities pay me
          the bounty.
          (lifting his beer)
          Cheers.
          The two men touch glasses, and take a drink.

                         DJANGO
          What's a bounty?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          It's like a reward.

                         DJANGO
          You kill people and they give you a reward?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Certain people, yes.

                         DJANGO
          White people?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Mostly. A few Mexicans. Couple Chinamen.

                         DJANGO
          Bad people?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Badder they are, bigger the reward.
          Which brings me to you, and I must admit
          I'm at a bit of a quandary when it comes
          to you. On one hand, I despise slavery.
          On the other hand, I need your help,
          and if you're not in a position to refuse,
          all the better. So for the time being,
          I'm going to make this slave malarkey
          work to my benefit.

                         (BEAT)
          Still... . having said that, .I feel guilty.
          So... I'd like the two of us to enter into
          an agreement. I'm looking for The Brittle Brothers,
          however in this endeavor I'm at a slight
          disadvantage, in so far as, I don't know
          what they look like. But you do... .dont'cha?

          I know what they look like, all right.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Good. So, here's my agreement. You travel

          - Where we goin'?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I hear at least two of them are overseeing
          up in Gatlinburg, but I don't know where.
          That means we visit every plantation in
          Gatlinburg till we find them. And when we
          find them, you point them out, and I kill
          them. You do that, I agree to give you
          your freedom... . twenty-five dollars per
          Brittle brother - that's seventy-five

          dust, I'll buy you a new saddle, and a
          new suit of clothes, handsome cowboy hat
          included.
          Dr.Schultz's eyes go to the saloon window.

          And as if on cue... . here comes the sheriff.

          EXT - SALOON - MORNING
          We see the sheriff, BILL SHARP, walk towards the saloon cradling a
          Winchester. Some TOWNSPEOPLE (like the Saloon Keeper) stand around to
          watch. A. YOUNG BOY leads a herd of BABY GOATS through town.
          Sheriff Sharp stands in the middle of the street.

                         SHERIFF SHARP
          Okay boys, fun's over, come on out.
          Both the doctor and Django stand up and walk to the front porch.
          As they do, The Sheriff says;

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         1 2

                         SHERIFF SHARP
          Now why y'all wanna come into my town,
          start trouble, and scare all these nice
          people? You ain't got nothin' better to
          do, then to come into Bill Sharps town
          and show your ass -
          From his top step on the porch, Dr. King Schultz extends his hand
          toward the sheriff, as if to shake it... :.

          .THEN...
          A SMALL DERRINGER - POPS into Schultz's hand from a metal sliding
          apparatus concealed under his jacket sleeve. Once in hand, the dentist
          FIRES one tiny bullet into the belly of Bill Sharp.
          The tiny gun makes a tiny POP sound.
          The shocked Bill Sharp lets out a ugly groan, and doubles over in the
          dirt.
          The TOWNSPEOPLE are startled.
          As is Django.
          As Schultz walks down the porch steps, to the fallen sheriff, reloading
          his tiny pop shooter, a PEDESTRIAN yells out;

                         PEDESTRIAN
          What did you jus' do to our sheriff?
          Dr.Schultz answers him by putting another tiny bullet in the law man's
          skull, killing him dead.
          In the background, ONE WOMAN faints. The Boy and his Goats scatter.
          Dr.Schultz looks over at the Saloon Keeper, across the street.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Now you can go get the marshall.

          INT - SALOON - DAY
          Dr.Schultz sits behind the piano playing a catchy little saloon number.
          He seems skilled enough to be a professional western saloon piano
          player. A terrified Django, who's sure his new master is a lunatic
          who's going to get them both killed, peeks out the closed curtains
          on the window.
          Dr.Schultz's suit coat sits draped over a chair. All of his weapons,
          including his metal sliding rail Derringer contraption, lie on a table.
          He plays piano in his button down dress shirt and gray suit vest.

          I think they wonderin' why you playin'
          the piana'.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Good.

                         (PAUSE)
          But what are they doing?

                         DJANGO
          A buncha white folks brought a buckboard
          around out front, now they hidin' behind it
          with guns. And a buncha other white folks
          are up on the roof, with rifles pointed
          down here.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Damn, they got that organized fast. Is the
          marshall out there?

                         DJANGO
          If the one I think is the.marshall is the
          marshall, he's out there.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         )9
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          What makes you think he's the marshall?

                         DJANGO
          Cause he's the one ready to say somethin'.

                         MARSHALL'S VOICE
          You in the saloon!
          Dr.Schultz stops playing the piano.

                         MARSHALL'S VOICE
          We got eleven Winchesters on every way
          outta that buildin'! You got once chance
          git outta this alive! You and your nigger
          come out right now with your hands over
          your head, and I mean, right now!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          First things first! Is this the marshall
          I have the pleasure of addressing?

                         MARSHALL TATUM
          Yes it is, this is U.S. Marshall Gill Tatum.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Wunderbar! So marshall, I have relieved
          myself of all weapons, and just as you
          have instructed, I'm ready to step outside
          with my hands raised above my head.
          I trust as a representative of the
          criminal justice system of The United
          States of America, I shant be shot down
          in the street, by either you or your deputies,
          before I've had my day in court.

                         MARSHALL TATUM
          You mean like you did our sheriff? Shot
          'em down like a dog in the street!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes, that's exactly what I mean! Do I
          have your word as a lawman not to shoot
          me down like a dog in the street?

                         MARSHALL TATUM
          Well, as much as we'd all enjoy seein'
          somethin' like that, ain't nobody gonna
          cheat the hangman in my town!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Fair enough marshall, here we.come.!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Dr.SCHULTZ

                         (TO DJANGO)
          They're a little tense out there. So don't
          make any quick movements, and let me do
          the talking.
          Django looks at him like, "as if..."

          EXT - SALOON/MAIN STREET - DAY
          A lot of guns are trained on the front door of the saloon.
          Outside of range, the WHOLE TOWN watches the stand off.
          The saloon doors open, and Dr.Schultz and Django, hands raised, step
          outside.

                         MARSHALL TATUM
          You unarmed?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes indeed we are. Marshall Tatum, may I
          address you, your deputies, and apparently
          the entire town of Daughtrey, as to the
          incident that just occurred?

                         MARSHALL TATUM
          Go on!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          My name is Dr.King Schultz. And like
          yourself, marshall, I am a servant of the
          court. The man lying dead in the dirt,
          who the good people of Daughtrey saw fit
          to elect as their sheriff, who went by
          the name of Bill Sharp, is actually a
          wanted outlaw by the name of Willard Peck,
          with a price on his head of two hundred
          dollars. That's two hundred dollars, dead
          or alive.

                         MARSHALL TATUM
          The hell you say!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I'.m aware this is probably disconcerting
          news. But I'm willing to wager this man
          was elected sheriff sometime in the last
          two years. I know this because. three years
          ago he was rustling cattle from,
          The B.C. Corrigan Cattle Company of
          Lubbock Texas.

          In my possession. is a warrant made out by
          circuit court Judge Henry Allen Laudermilk
          of Austin Texas. You are encouraged to wire him.
          He will back up who I am, and who your
          dear departed sheriff was.
          The Menfolk of the town with rifles, begin trading looks. Then
          Dr.Schultz delivers the coup de grace.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          In other words marshall, you owe me
          two hundred dollars.

                         CUT TO

          EXT - TENNESSEE COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
          Django and Dr.Schultz, who by now have ridden quite a few miles
          together, ride their horses in the Tennessee countryside, on the way to
          Gatlinburg. Dr.Schultz is dressed in one of his nearly identical grey
          business suits, and Django is still dressed in his slave pants,
          Schultz's button down dress shirt, and Ace Speck's winter coat.
          Somewhere along the way a pair of shoes have appeared on'his feet.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          One needs a plan, son. These are brutal
          times. A man who survives, is a man with
          a plan. A man who thrives, is a man with
          a good plan. So, having said that, what's
          your plan, young Django?

                         DJANGO
          What'cha mean?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well, after this Brittle business is behind
          us, you'll be a free man, with a horse, and
          seventy five dollars in your back pocket.
          What's your plan after that?

                         DJANGO
          Find my wife, and buy her freedom.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Django, I had no idea you were a married man.
          Do most slaves take the institution of
          matrimony seriously?

                         DJANGO
          Huh?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         ZZ
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Do slaves believe in marriage'?

                         DJANGO
          Me and my wife do.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Where is she now?

                         DJANGO
          I dunno. They put us in different boxcars,
          and sent U.S to The Greenville Slave Auction.
          She got sold two days 'fore me.
          But I don't know who to.
          Dr.Schultz takes out a long stick of beef jerky.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Care for some jerky?

                         DJANGO
          Sure.
          Dr.Schultz rips him off a piece. Django chews on it. As he chews,

                         SCHULTZ SAYS;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          So your plan is to trackdowri your wife, and
          purchase her.freedom? Only you don't know
          where she is?
          A chewing Django nods his head, yes.
          Dr.Schultz, takes a big bite of jerky, chews for a "moment contemplating
          the dilemma, then pronounces;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well that shouldn't be all that difficult.
          So how long ago did all this happen?

                         DJANGO
          A few months ago.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Three or four?

                         DJANGO
          Three.

          and shewassold at The Greenville Slave
          Auctiontosome :unknown customer three
          monthsago?
          Django nods his head, yes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         Z3
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          The bad part about slavery being a business,
          is it's immoral. The good part about it being
          a business is, they keep records. Somewhere
          in Greenville there's a book with your wife's
          name in it, and the name of the customer who
          bought her, and more then likely their address.
          But then Schultz seems to get second thoughts.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Still, seventy-five dollars in your back
          pocket is a pretty nice grub steak, but it's
          not going to get you very far in Greenville.
          Not to mention a slave auction town in
          Mississippi isn't the safest place you could
          visit. Free or not.

                         DJANGO
          I'll have my freedom papers.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes you will. But say you show them to some
          rascals, and they take them from you and
          tear them up?

                         DJANGO
          They could do that?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I'm not saying they would, but they could.

                         DJANGO
          They do that I'll kill 'em.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Great! Now you get hung for killin' a white
          man. The point being is the place,is just
          too dangerous for you.

                         DJANGO
          Well I gotta go, when do I go?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          When you get more dangerous.

          EXT - CHATTANOOGA - DAY
          Muddy and wet big city Chattanooga. We're in the back of a STORE that.
          sells SERVANT/HOUSE NIGGER UNIFORMS. Django comes bursting out of the
          stores back door. He's very distressed. One glance at the outfit he's
          wearing explains the distress.

          Versailles.
          Dr.Schultz comes trailing after him.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Django, you have to, it's part of "The Act".
          You're playing a character. Your character
          is The Valet. This is what The Valet wears.
          Remember what I told you. During the act,
          you can never break character.

                         CUT TO

          EXT - BENNETT MANOR- DAY
          We see Dr. Schultz, riding slightly in front of Django, dressed in his
          blue satin Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit, as they enter the property of
          BENNETT MANOR, a plantation in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. Django leads a
          riderless horse, behind him and Tony.
          As the two men ride their horses up the road that leads to the front
          steps of Bennett Manor, alongside the cotton fields, all the SLAVES
          stop picking cotton, and straighten their bent backs up to stare in
          wonder at this sight.
          The patriarch of Bennett Manor, SPENCER "BIG DADDY" BENNETT, dressed in
          a fancy leisure suit of the day, emerges from the double doors of the
          mansion, and stands on the top steps, hands on hips, watching the white
          man and black man move from the background to the foreground.
          While there are plenty BLACK MALES out in the cotton fields, the
          majority of the slave population of Bennett Manor is pretty.BLACK
          FEMALES, fourteen to twenty-four, referred to as, "PONY'S".
          The biggest money making crop of this farm, after cotton.
          As Dr.Schultz and fancy pants Django, bring Fritz and Tony to a stop
          in front of Bennett Manor, they've drawn quite a crowd of SLAVES,
          BENNETT FAMILY MEMBERS, and WHITE WORKERS (OVERSEER'S).
          Spencer Bennett keeps on the top step so he won't be forced to look up
          at the darkee on the horse.

                         SPENCER BENNETT
          It's against the law for niggers to ride
          horses in this territory.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          This is my valet, and my valet doesn't walk.

          Not on my.property, around my niggers
          he can't.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          My good sir, perhaps we got off on the
          wrong boot. Allow me to unring this bell.
          My name is Dr.King Schultz, this is my
          valet, Django, and these are our horses,
          Fritz, and Tony.
          Fritz, does his head bow.
          This makes the pretty PONY'S surrounding Bennett, giggle.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Mr. Bennett, I've been lead to believe you
          are a gentleman, and a business man.
          And it is in these capacities that we've
          ridden from Texas to Tennessee to talk
          with you now.

                         SPENCER BENNETT
          State your business.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I wish to purchase one of your
          nigger gals.

                         SPENCER BENNETT
          You and your Jimmie rode from Texas to
          Tennessee, to buy one of my nigger gals,
          no appointment, no nuttin'?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I'm afraid so.

                         SPENCER BENNETT
          Well what if I say, I don't like you, or
          your fancy pants. nigger, and I wouldn't
          sell you a tinkers damn - what'cha gotta
          say about that?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Mr. Bennett, if you are the business man,
          I've been led to believe you to be,
          I have five thousand things I might say,
          that could change your mind.
          i This gets everybody's attention, not least of all Spencer Bennett.
          Spencer laughs.

          to drink.
          The incognito bounty hunter, dismounts his steed, as does Django.
          Then the good doctor walks up the steps to Bennett Manor.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Maybe while we discuss business, you
          could provide one of your loveliest black
          creatures to escort Django here around
          your magnificent grounds.

                         SPENCER
          Absolutely. Betina!
          A pretty, fleshy, sweet jelled, twenty-two year old slave gal named
          BETINA, snaps to attention.

                         BETINA
          Yes sir, Big Daddy?

                         SPENCER

                         BETINA
          As you please, Big Daddy.
          Dr.Schultz lowers his voice, and says to the plantation owner;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Mr. Bennett, I must remind, you, Django is a
          free man. He cannot be treated like a slave.
          Within the bounds of good taste, he must be
          treated as an extension of myself.

                         SPENCER
          Understood., Schultz. Betina?

                         BETINA
          Yes, sir?

                         SPENCER
          Django isn't a slave. Django is a free
          man. Do you understand? You're not to treat
          him like any of these other niggers around
          here, cause he ain't like any of these
          other niggers around here. Ya got it?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         BETINA
          Ya want I should treat 'em like white
          folks?

                         SPENCER
          No that's not what I said.

                         BETINA
          Then I don't know what'cha want Big Daddy.

                         SPENCER
          Yes, I can see that.

                         (HE THINKS)
          What's the name of that peckawood boy from
          town works with the glass? His mama works
          at the lumber yard? He comes by and fixes
          the winda's when we have a problem?
          The MAMMY OF BENNETT MANOR chimes in;

          MAMMY OF BENNETT MANOR
          Oh, you mean Jerry.

                         SPENCER
          Yeah, that's the boy's name, Jerry.

                         (TO BETINA)
          You know Jerry, dont'cha sugar?

                         BETINA
          Yes 'em, Big Daddy.

                         SPENCER
          Well that's it then... just treat 'em
          like you would Jerry.

          EXT - ANOTHER PART OF BENNETT MANOR - DAY
          Away from the big house, Betina gives Django a tour of the grounds.
          Her in her slave get up, complete with handkerchief on her head, and
          him in his satin baby blue Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit, are quite
          the pair. She eyeballs him disapprovingly up and down.

                         BETINA
          What'cha do for your massa'?

                         DJANGO
          Didn't you hear him tell ya, I ain't no slave.

                         BETINA
          So you really free?

                         DJANGO
          Yes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         ZY

                         BETINA
          You mean you wanna dress like that?
          Django fumes.

          EXT - BENNETT MANOR (BACK PORCH) - DAY
          Both Spencer Bennett and Dr.Schultz sit on the back porch drinking
          lemonade.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I've been'told by those who should know,
          the most exquisite African flesh in the
          state of Tennessee is bred right here on
          your land. And from the look of these
          black angels, my sources weren't wrong.

                         SPENCER
          Oh I got my share of, coal blacks, horse
          faces, and gummy mouth bitches out in the
          field. But the lion share of my lady
          niggers are real show pony's.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well that's what I'm looking for, a show
          pony for young Django. So the only
          question that remains is, do you have a
          nigger here worth five thousand dollars?

                         SPENCER
          Dr.Schultz, five thousand dollar nigger,
          is practically my middle name.

          BACK TO DJANGO AND BETINA
          Betina and Django walk by a big tree on the plantation grounds.
          The cotton fields and the SLAVES picking it, in the background.

                         DJANGO
          Betina, come over here, I need to ask
          you something.
          He moves her by the tree for more privacy. Betina thinks this fancy
          pants wants to get all lovey-dovey, and she couldn't be less interested.

                         BETINA
          What'cho want?

                         DJANGO
          I'm lookin' for three white men. Three
          brothers. Overseers. Their name is
          Brittle. Do you know 'em?

                         BETINA
          Brittle?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         DJANGO
          Yes, Brittle. John Brittle. Ellis Brittle.
          And Roger Brittle, sometimes called, Little Raj.

                         BETINA
          I don't know dem.

                         DJANGO
          They could be usin' a different name.
          They woulda' come to the plantation in
          the last year.

                         BETINA
          You mean The Shaffer's?

                         DJANGO
          Maybe? Three brother?

                         BETINA
          Ah-huh.

                         DJANGO
          Are they here?

                         BETINA
          Ah-huh.

                         DJANGO
          Can you point one of 'em out to me?

                         BETINA
          Well ones over in that field.
          She points to the cotton field, at a OVERSEER on top of a horse, whip
          in hand, eyeing the blacks at his mercy.
          Django takes hold of a little bag slung over his shoulder opens it, and
          takes out a shiny brass SPYGLASS, the type a sea captain might use.
          Obviously a prop from Dr.Schultz. He slides it open, places it against
          his eye, and points it in the direction of a figure out in the cotton
          field landscape.

                         SPYGLASS POV:
          Astride his nag, the filthy hillbilly, who calls himself SHAFFER, but
          who Django knows to be ELLIS BRITTLE, looks on, oblivious to Django's
          observation.

          DJANGO SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK
          He remembers Ellis Brittle BURNING a "r" into Broomhilda's cheek with a

          BRANDING IRON.

          BACK TO DJANGO AND THE SPYGLASS
          he lowers the glass.

                         (INNOCENTLY)
          Is that who you lookin' for?

                         DJANGO
          Yep.
          He folds the spyglass back up, and puts it back in his purse.

                         DJANGO
          Where's the other two?

          BETINA.
          They by the stable, punishin' Little Jody
          for breakin' eggs.

                         DJANGO
          They whippin' Little Jody?
          She nods her head, yes.

                         DJANGO
          Point me in that direction.
          She points to a shed, and keeps pointing right.

                         BETINA
          You go to that shed, and keep goin' that way.
          Which means; "Go to the shed and turn right."

                         DJANGO
          Go git that white man, I came here with.
          He slaps her ass, to hurry her up.
          Then looks to the shed, and begins crossing the distance between him
          and The Brittle Brothers.

                         FLASH ON
          A memory from The Carrucan Plantation; The Brittle Brothers giving his
          wife Broomhilda, a peelin'.
          PEELIN' : A punishment by bullwhip, across the back.
          LITTLE RAJ makes a line in the dirt with the heel of his boot.
          Making Django stand behind it, as he watches his wife being whipped.
          BIG JOHN BRITTLE SLASHES the beauty of Broomhilda's back with his

          BULLWHIP.
          DJANGO, keeping behind the line, begs Big John for mercy.

          Please Big John, she won't do it no more!
          She's real sorry!
          The WHIP RIPS her back.

                         DJANGO

                         (SCREAMING)
          Goddamit, Big John!

                         LITTLE RAJ
          Whoa nigger, calm down, keep it funny.
          Django gets on his knees, and on behalf of Broomhild.a, begs Big John
          Brittle with everything he has.

          BACK TO DJANGO
          crossing the lawn towards The Brittle Brothers, like an express train.

                         FLASH ON
          Big John Brittle standing over him, bullwhip in hand, saying to the

                         KNEELING DJANGO;

          BIG JOHN BRITTLE
          I like the way you beg, boy.

          EXT - STABLE - DAY
          Little Raj Brittle, ties LITTLE JODY, a petite slave girl (eighteen)
          to a dead tree stump.
          BIG JOHN BRITTLE paces, taking a few practice CRACKS with his WHIP.
          LITTLE JODY begs The Shaffer Brothers/The Brittle Brothers for mercy.
          ROGER goes and sits on a old wagon wheel to watch the whippin'.

          BIG JOHN BRITTLE
          Now Jody quit your caterwaulin'. You know
          yourself it's for your own good. Niggers
          are clumsy. You'd break everything in
          goddamn sight, you weren't cured. And the
          only known cure for nigger clumsiness
          is a peelin'.
          Little Jody begs to differ.

          BACK TO DJANGO
          As Django in his powder blue satin suit hurries across the grass to
          Little Jody and The Brittle Brothers, he collects eight little friends
          who happily run along with the fast walking man. EIGHT LITTLE FRENCH
          BULLDOGS who bark, yelp, snort and breath at his heels.. Django pays the
          little dogs no nevermind.

          BACK TO BIG JOHN BRITTLE
          In position to take the skin off of Little Jody's back.

                         BIG JOHN
          After this we'll see if you break eggs again.

                         DJANGO
          turns the corner to the stable, and stands behind them. They don't see
          him. Big John rears back to make the first WHIP LASH...

          WHEN ...
          .DJANGO'S VOICE, stops him;

                         DJANGO
          John Brittle!
          Big John breaks his whip stride, looks. up, and in a discarded full
          length broken mirror from the big house, laying abandoned against the
          stable wall, he see's DJANGO, dressed in his powder blue satin Little
          Lord Flauntleroy outfit, surrounded by his pack of little French
          Bulldogs.
          LITTLE JODY on her knees, tied to the dead tree stump, looks up see's
          the same thing in the mirror.
          LITTLE RAJ looks to his left at the sounds of the voice.
          BIG JOHN turns toward Django, who he still doesn't recognize.
          DJANGO just stares back.
          BIG JOHN smile disappears. He recognizes Django.
          So does Roger.

                         LITTLE RAJ
          Django?
          Django crosses toward Big John, raising up his arm like he's going to
          shake his hand ...

                         DJANGO
          Remember me?
          .Django extends his arm, and Dr.Schultz's Derringer arm
          contraption,. POPS the TINY GUN into his hand, and he FIRES a tiny
          bullet smack dab into BIG JOHN'S MERCILESS HEART.

          BIG JOHN FACE
          goes into shock... .he falls to his knees...he looks up, clutching his
          heart, at Django.

                         DJANGO
          I like the way you die, boy.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         3 3
          Big John hears it...then tips over dead.
          LITTLE JODY can't believe what she's just seen.
          FOUR OTHER SLAVES who just happen to be walking in the background, see
          it.
          LITTLE RAJ is stunned ... . then comes to his senses, fumbling for the
          gun he wears on his hip, but since he's no gunman, in his haste, he
          gets it out of his holster, but drops it on the ground.
          It goes off... BANG.
          SHOOTING himself in the foot, he HOPS UP AND DOWN in pain.
          The Bulldogs scatter at the sound. of the BANG.
          DJANGO picks Big John's WHIP off the ground., and begins WHIPPING
          LITTLE RAJ across the face and chest.
          MORE SLAVES gather.

          DJANGO WHIPS HIM TO THE GROUND
          whips him on the ground, then throws the whip to the ground, picks
          Roger's pistol off the ground, and empties it (FIVE SHOTS) into Roger.
          To say the slaves are flabbergasted, is a understatement.
          Dr.Schultz rides his horse up quickly, rifle in his hand. He sees
          Django, and the two dead bodies.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Who are they?

                         DJANGO
          That's John Brittle, and that's his
          little brother Raj.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Where's Ellis?

                         DJANGO
          He's the one hightailin' it across that
          field right now.
          Ellis Brittle riding his horse full out through the cotton field trying
          to make an escape.

                         SCHULTZ'S WINCHESTER
          goes to his eye, he follows the rider with his rifle barrel.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Are you sure that's him?
          Ellis gets further away...

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         DJANGO
          Yes!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Are you positive?
          Ellis gets further away...

                         DJANGO
          I dunno.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          You don't know if you're positive?
          Ellis gets further away...

                         DJANGO
          I don't know what, positive,'means.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          It means you're sure.

                         DJANGO
          Yes.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes, what?

                         DJANGO
          Yes I'm sure that's Ellis Brittle.

          BAM!
          The German picks the middle Brittle brother off his horse.
           The dead man WIPES OUT horribly in the thick cotton brush.
          RED BLOOD splashes on WHITE COTTON.
          The German and Django have the entire plantation's attention.
          Spencer Bennett (with his Winchester), his SONS and his OVERSEERS,
          and some HOUSE NIGGERS come around like a angry mob.
          The German tosses his rifle in the dirt, and raises his hands.
          Django does the same with his pistol.
          Dr.Schultz addresses the ANGRY MOB.

          Dr.SCHULTZ
          You know them by the name, Shaffer.
          But the butchers real names'were Brittle.
          These are wanted men. The law wants them
          for murder. I reiterate, this warrant
          states dead or alive. When Django and myself
          executed these men on sight, we were operating
          within our legal. boundaries. Now I realize
          passions are high. But I must warn you,
          the penalty for taking deadly force
          against a officer of the court in the
          performance of his duty is, you will be
          hung by the neck until you are dead.
          This does put a momentary pause in the lynch mob's blood lust.
          After his dramatic pause for effect...
          .Dr.Schultz says;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          May I please remove the warrant from my
          pocket so you may examine it?
          Resting his Winchester over his shoulder, Bennett reaches for the
          paper.

                         SPENCER
          Gimmie.
          Dr.Schultz removes the warrant from his jacket pocket, and hands it to
          the plantation owner. Bennett reads it silently to himself, resigned to
          what it says.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Satisfied.
          Bennett eyes go from the warrant to the German.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          May I have that back?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         36
          ,- Bennett hands Schultz back the piece of paper.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          We good?

                         BENNETT
          Get off my land.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Post haste.

                         (TO DJANGO)
          Load up the bodies as quickly as
          you can, and let's get out of
          here.

                         TIME CUT
          All three dead Brittle Brothers lie over the back of the extra horse
          the bounty hunters brought with them.
          Both Bounty Hunters are back in their saddles ready to leave.
          With all the eyes of the plantation on them, the white and black man
          start to ride out, when Spencer "Big Daddy" Bennett, steps in their way
          for one final threat.

                         BENNETT
          Ain't nobody gonna touch you and your Jimmie
          while you on my property. But for lettin' a
          nigger kill a white man, and especially for
          letting a nigger kill a white man in a
          audience of niggers, y'all ain't gonna make
          it out of the county alive. Mark my words
          Schultz, by tomorrow morning your niggers
          gonna be stripped and clipped and hangin'
          from my motherfuckin' gate.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I'm fully aware Bennett, that you and your
          regulator playmates aren't shy about
          killing for what you believe in. But mark
          my words Big Daddy, if you make a move
          towards Django or myself, you better be
          prepared to die for it.
          The two men ride off.
          The Black and White Audience watch them go.

          lying on his belly in the grass.

                         SPENCER BENNETT
          That's them sonsabitches.

                         SPENCER'S POV:
          We see the camp by the lake that Dr.Schultz and Django have set up.
          Both wrapped up in bedrolls. The dead bodies of the Brittle Brothers
          lie by them in a pile. A campfire slowly dims.
          We Cut Back to Spencer Bennett lying on his belly with SIX OTHER RIFLE
          CARING MEN observing the camp, from over a grade.
          The Men sneak back down the hill the way they came...
          Where about TWENTY-FOUR REGULATORS are waiting for them ON HORSEBACK,
          all of the riders heads are covered by FLOUR SACKS with eyes and mouth
          holes cut out. Some carry TORCHES, all carry RIFLES or SHOTGUNS.
          Spencer mounts his horse. "Big Daddy" issues orders astride his
          steed..

                         SPENCER BENNETT
          Now unless they start shootin' first,
          nobody shoot 'em. That's way too simple
          for these jokers. We're gonna whip that
          nigger lover to death. And I'm gonna
          personally, strip and clip that garboon
          myself.
          Having said his blood thirsty words, he puts the flour sack over his
          head. He tussles with the sack for a bit, then from inside the sack;

                         SPENCER BENNETT
          Damn, I can't see fuckin' shit outta
          this thing.
          He sticks his fingers in the.eye holes, and rips, trying to make the
          holes bigger, he only succeeds in making-visibility more obscured.

                         BRADSHAW
          We ready, or what?

          Well if all I hadda do was cut a bag, I
          could cut it better then this.

          How 'bout-you Robert, can you see?

                         ROBERT
          Not too good. I mean if I.don't move my head,
          I can see you pretty good ... . more or less.
          But when I start ridin' the bag starts moving
          all over, and I'm riding blind.
          Randy tears at his bag.

                         RANDY
          Oh shit, I just made mine worse.
          He puts it on-then says;

                         RANDY
          Yep, it's worse.
          He yanks it off his head.

                         RANDY
          Did anybody bring any extra bags?

                         TERRY
          No, no one brought a extra bag!

          Do we hafta wear 'em when we ride?

                         SPENCER
          Shitfire, if you don't wear 'em as you ride
          up, that just defeats the purpose.
          Redfish, fatter then some (but not all), takes off his bag.

                         REDFISH
          I can't see in this fucking thing!
          I can't breathe in this fucking thing!
          And I can't ride in this fucking thing!

                         WILLARD
          Fuck all y'all! I'm going home. I watched
          my wife work all day gettin' thirty bags
          ready for you ungrateful sonsabitches!
          And all I hear is criticize, criticize, criticize.
          From now on don't ask me or mine for nothin'!
          Willard rides off.
          O.B. removes his bag, and yells after Willard.

                         SPENCER
          O.B., I tole yo to keep quiet! They're asleep,
          not dead.

          O.B.
          But Willards riding off.

                         SPENCER
          Fuck Willard! Look, let's not forget why we're
          here. We gotta killer nigger over that hill.
          And we gotta make a lesson outta 'em.

                         RANDY
          Okay, I'm confused, are the bags on or off?
          Robert takes off his bag, and says;

                         ROBERT
          I think we all think the bags was a nice
          idea. But, not pointing any fingers, they
          could of been done better. So how 'bout,
          no bags this time, but next time, we do the
          bags right, and then we go full regalia.
          Everyone takes off their bag.

                         SPENCER
          Wait a minute, I didn't say no bags!

                         TERRY
          But nobody can see.

                         SPENCER
          So?

                         TERRY
          So, it would be nice to see.

                         SPENCER
          Goddamit, this is a raid! I can't see, you
          can't see, so what? All that matters is can
          the fuckin horse see! That's a raid.
          Spencer puts on his sack, everyone else, reluctantly, does as well.

          EXT - LAKE - NIGHT
          The THIRTY RIDERS, all with SACKS OVER THEIR HEADS, come riding over
          the hill, hooting and hollerin. Since nobody can see they ride
          haphazard into each other.'Redfish falls off his horse hard on his fat
          ass. They surround the camp, and when the sleeping Schultz and Django
          don't react, they know something's up. But since nobody can see,
          everybody and everybody's horse is. confused.

          WE HEAR A GROUP OF LINES FROM CIRCLING COWBOYS ON HORSEBACK WITH BAGS
           OVER THEIR HEADS: "Where are they, I can't see" - "They tricked us" -
          "Did somebody fall" "Where the hell are they" "Y'all, Redfish fell
          off his horse-He's kinda hurt bad."

          The two treetop killers let loose with rifle fire.

          INSIDE OF THE SMOKE
          pandemonium reigns. Horses and Men trip over bodies and pieces of
          bodies, of horses and men. Men with legs and arms blown off, yell
          bloody murder, hurt and scared Horses cry. Some struggle to get the
          sacks off their heads, while scared horses dance and buck in panic.
          Some are shot by the rifle fire. The rest of the men not blown up, and
          still on horseback, between the sacks and the smoke, still can't see
          worth a damn. And Men and Horses collide with one another, which causes
          more bucking and riders falling. About fifteen of the men who can still
          ride, high tail it the fuck out of there. Whipped and whimpering like
          dogs.

          with suggestions offered by Schultz. When he's done, Django looks damn
          handsome in his new duds. Brown cowboy boots, Green Corduroy Jacket,
          Smokey Grey Shirt, Tan Skin Tight Pants, and Light Brown Cowboy Hat.

          You're a freed, slave, you should be in New York.
          You shouldn't be in Greenville, you shouldn't
          even be forty miles on any side of Greenville.,
          You shouldn't be anywhere in Mississippi.

          were sayin' where I gotta go first?

          You know when she was sold, you know where
          she came from, the Carrucan Plantation, and

          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Broomhilda?
          Django.nods his head yes.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Were her owners German?
          Now Django reacts, "How did he know that?

                         DJANGO
          Yeah, how did you know? She wasn't born on
          The Carrucan Plantation. She was raised by
          a German mistress, The Von Shafts. She can
          speak a little German too.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Your wife?

                         DJANGO
          Yeah, when she was little her mistress taught
          her so she'd have somebody to talk German with.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          So let me get this straight, your slave
          wife speaks German, and her name is
          Broomhilda Von Shaft...?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         DJANGO
          Yep. Mouthful, huh?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          To say the least.
          (stopping the horse)
          This looks like a very pretty place to have
          our picnic. What'd ya say, here?

                         TIME CUT

          EXT - PICNIC IN COUNTRY MEADOW - PRETTY DAY
          The two men sit on a blanket with a nice picnic spread spread out.
          Django eats a cucumber sandwich with the crust cut off, and drinks a
          cup of tea.

                         DJANGO
          How did you know Broomhilda's first masters
          were German?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Broomhilda is a German name. If they named
          her, it stands to reason they'd be German.

                         DJANGO
          Lotsa gals where you from named Broomhilda?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          No, not so much. Broomhilda is the name of
          a character in one of the most popular of
          all the German legends.

                         DJANGO
          Really? There's a story 'bout Broomhilda?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes there is.

                         DJANGO
          Do you know it?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Every German knows that story. Would you
          like me to tell you?
          Django nods his head, yes.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well Broomhilda was a princess. She was the
          daughter of Wotan, the god of all gods.
          Anyway, her father is really mad at her.

                         DJANGO
          What she do.?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I don't exactly remember. I think she disobeys
          him in some way. So at first he's just going to
          obliterate her -

                         DJANGO
          Obliterate... . what does that mean?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Like blow up.
          He pantomimes a explosion.

                         DJANGO
          Phew, that's pretty mad.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes it is, and like most fathers, given a
          little time, he calms down a bit. He's
          still mad at her. He still wants to punish her.
          Just not ... . blow her up. So instead what he
          does, is he puts her high on top of a mountain.

                         DJANGO
          Broomhilda's on a mountain?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          It's a German legend, there's always going
          to be a mountain in there somewhere. So, he
          puts her on top of the mountain and he puts a
          fire breathing dragon there to guard the mountain.
          And. then he surrounds her in circle of hellfire.
          And there Broomhilda shall remain, unless a hero
          arises brave enough to save her.

                         DJANGO
          Does a fella arise?
          From now on as Dr.Schultz talks, he's beginning to realize something he
          wasn't aware of when the conversation started.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes Django, as a matter he does. A fella
          named, Sigfried.

                         DJANGO
          Does Sigfried save her?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes he does, and quite spectacularly, so.
          Now true, he is assisted in his triumph by
          a truly, truly, remarkable sword, still, having
          said that, Sigfried triumphs over all of his
          obstacles not just due to his sword, but due to
          his courage. He scales the mountain, because he's
          not afraid of it. He defeats the dragon, because
          he's not afraid.of him.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Dr.SCHULTZ (CON'T)
          He walks through hellfire because
          Broomhilda's worth. it.
          After that last line of dialogue... .the two men just let a moment pass
          as they nibble on their sandwiches.

                         DJANGO
          I know how he feels.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I think I'm just starting to realize that.
          He pours Django and himself some more tea out of a fancy tea pot, as he
          thinks about what he's going to say next.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Look Django, I don't doubt one day you will
          save your lady love. But I'm afraid I can't
          let you go to Greenville in a good conscious.
          Let me ask you a question, how do you like
          the bounty hunting business?

                         DJANGO
          Kill white folks, and they pay ya?
          What's not to like?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I hafta admit, we make a good team.

                         DJANGO
          But I'thought you were mad at me for killin'
          Big John and Rodger?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes, on that occasion, you were a tad
          overzealous. But normally, that's a good
          thing. How'd you like to partner up for
          the winter?

                         DJANGO
          What'd ya mean partner up?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          You be my deputy, for real this time. A lot
          of the big money is in outlaw gangs. Some
          of these fellas are worth fifteen hundred or
          three thousand a piece. With one man, anything
          over three men is a risk. But with a partner?
          Creating cross fire? It's fish in a. barrel.
          A lot of these gangs hold up in the'hills
          for the winter.

                         DJANGO
          You makin' another agreement?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         W7
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes. You work with me through the winter,
          till the snow melts. I give you a third
          of my bounties. And while we're together,
          I'll teach you a few things you're going
          to need to know.

                         DJANGO
          Can you teach me how to make Tony do that
          head bow thing that Fritz can do?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          That among other things. We make some
          money this winter, when the snow melts,
          I'll take you to Greenville myself, and
          we'll find where they sent your wife.
          I'm pretty good at finding people. Is it a deal?
          No white man has ever done anything for Django, just to him. So
          understandably, he's a little suspicious.

                         DJANGO
          Why you care what happens to me? Why you
          care if I find my wife?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well frankly, I've never given anybody
          their freedom before. And now that I have,
          I feel vaguely responsible for you. You're
          just not ready to go off on your own, it's
          that simple. You're too green, you'll get hurt.
          Plus when a German meets a real life Sigfried,.
          it's kind of a big deal. As a German, I'm
          obliged to help you on your quest to
          rescue your beloved Broomhilda.
          Django accepts that response.
          What follows is a MONTAGE covering the five months that Django and
          Schultz partner up as bounty hunters. Schultz wears his normal
          ensemble. Django wears his cool looking Green Jacket, unless it's
          really cold, which a lot of this Montage is. Then he still wears Ace
          Specks raw hide winter coat over his cool clothes.

                         WE SEE
          A SCENE to be improvised (more or less), where Dr.Schultz teaches
          Django how to draw and shoot the pistol in the holster at his hip.
          By the end of the scene, after trial and error, we see Django's going
          to be good at this.

          EXT - HILLSIDE - SUNNY DAY
          We see Django and Dr.Schultz walking up a hill. Tony and Fritz have
          been left tied up downhill. Django leads a extra body HORSE (named
          PONCHO) behind him. Dr.Schultz carries his scope sight rifle in 'a long
          case. They get to the top of the hill. It overlooks a small farmhouse.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          Y, 8

          DOWN BELOW WE SEE
          A LITTLE MAN struggling behind a plow, and his FIFTEEN YEAR OLD SON
          helping him by leading the horse forward.
          On top of their perch on the hill top, Dr.Schultz says;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Keep down or he'll see you.

                         DJANGO
          Who that farmer? Who cares?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well since we came here to kill 'em, he
          just might.

                         DJANGO
          What? The little man pushin' that plow?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          That little man pushing that plow, is Smitty Bacall.

                         DJANGO
          Smitty Bacall is a farmer?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          No. Smitty Bacall is a stagecoach robber
          who's hiding out as a farmer, because
          there's a seven thousand dollar bounty on
          his head.
          He hands Django the scope rifle case.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          And he's all yours my boy.
          DJANGO lays on his belly, with the Scope Sight up to his eye.

          SCOPE SIGHT POV:
          on the Farmer struggling behind his plow, working hard with his horse
          and his son.
          Django's finger on the trigger... .but he hesitates.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Oh what happened.to mister I wanna kill white
          folks for money?

                         DJANGO
          His son's with him.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Good. He'll have a loved one with him.
          Maybe even share a last word. That's
          better then most get, and a damn. sight
          better then he deserves.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         1Ï¿½9
          Django still hesitates.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Put down the rifle. Don't worry, I'm not
          mad at you. Take out Smitty Bacall's handbill.
          Django removes the folded up handbill from the pocket of his tan pants.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Read it aloud. Consider it today's lesson.

                         DJANGO

                         (READING)
          "Wanted, dead or alive. Smitty Bacall and
          The Smitty Bacall Gang. For murder and
          stagecoach robbery. Seven thousand dollars
          for Smitty Bacall. One thousand and five
          hundred dollars for each of his gang members.
          Known members of The Smitty Bacall Gang are as
          follows, DANDY MICHAELS, GERALD NASH, and

          CRAZY CRAIG KOONS."
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well done. Bravo. THAT is who Smitty Bacall
          is. If Smitty Bacall wanted to start a farm at
          twenty-two, they would never of printed that.

                         (REFERRING TO

                         THE HANDBILL)
          But Smitty Bacall wanted to rob stagecoaches,
          and he didn't mind killing people to do it.
          You want to save your wife by doing what
          I do? This is what I do. I kill people,
          and sell their corpses for cash. His corpse
          is worth seven thousand dollars.
          Now quit your pussyfootin and shoot him.
          Django SHOOTS.
          The Little Man down below behind the plow falls down.
          The Young Boy doesn't know what happened at first. Then he figures'out
          his father was just shot. He goes to him in the dirt.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          You need to keep that Smitty Bacall handbill.

                         DJANGO
          Why?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          It's good luck. You always keep the
          handbill of your first bounty.
          They begin walking down the hill, to collect Smitty Bacall's body,
          leading the extra body horse behind them.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         50
          As they walk down hill, they watch the little scene of Smitty Bacall's
          Son cradling his dying father.in his arms, the older man speaking his
          last words to his son before he dies.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          See, they're having a tender little father son
          moment now. No doubt the most heartfelt one
          they've ever had.

          EXT - SNOWY FOREST - NIGHT
          It's now full on snowy winter in the hills.
          Django practices his quick draw against a SNOWMAN he's built. He sticks
          a BOTTLE in it, so the bottom of the bottle is where the snowman's
          heart would be.
          He DRAWS...
          Shoots the bottle heart!
          He DRAWS ...
          Shoots the left coal eye.
          He DRAWS ...
          Shoots the right coal eye.
          He DRAWS...
          Shoots the carrot nose.
          Dr.Schultz comes up behind him.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I think it's safe to say you're faster then
          the snowman.

          EXT - SNOWY FOREST - DIFFERENT NIGHT
          A outlaw gang known as The WILSON - LOWE GANG (five guys) ride through
          a snowy forest at night. When all five men and their Horses, are SHOT

          FROM ABOVE.

          DJANGO AND SCHULTZ
          up in a tree, FIRING DOWN ON them.

          EXT - WINTER MOUNTAIN TOWN MAIN STREET - NIGHT
          The FLAKES continue to FALL HARD as Dr.Schultz and Django ride down
          the main street of town, pulling poor Poncho who's FULLY LOADED DOWN
          with five corpses.

          The local SHERIFF, DON GUS, watches the two men ride up, he knows them.

          Doctor and Django, how the hell are ya,
          and who the hell ya got there?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          The Wilson - Lowe Gang.

                         SHERIFF GUS
          Who the hell's The Wilson - Lowe Gang?
          Dr.Schultz removes a handbill from his inside jacket pocket, and hands
          it down to the friendly peace officer.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Bad Chuck Wilson, and meaner Bobby Lowe.
          And three of their acolytes.

                         SHERIFF GUS
          Just leave 'em out here, they ain't going
          nowhere. And if'in they do, god must love
          'em, so who are we to say. Come outta the
          snowy snow and git yourself some coffee.

          TNT - SHERIFF GUS'S OFFICE - NIGHT
          The snow encrusted bounty hunters come inside the lawmans office.
          They exchange pleasantries about the weather as the Sheriff pours them
          coffee. After the two frosty gentlemen have drunk some of the hot
          liquid, they get down to business. As Schultz and Gus discuss the
          bounties, Django reads the handbills aloud from off the wall. On the
          third one he reads, WARREN VANDERS, and a two thousand dollar bounty,
          "That one", Schultz says.
          Django RIPS IT off the wall.
          As the winter has progressed, we see they've become a genuine bounty
          hunting team. And Django, a genuine bounty hunter.

          EXT - PRETTY MEADOW - DAY
          The snow has melted, and it's SPRING. And inside of this meadow Django
          practices his fast draw against five men...
          .by Schultz throwing FIVE COINS in the air ...
          DJANGO DRAWS FAST shoots three coins, FIRES again hitting another, then
          falls to the ground to get the fifth.
          He looks up from the ground at Schultz.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         5L
          As Schultz collects the coins off the ground, he says;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          You're pretty confident aren't you?
          Django nods his head, yes.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          You have reason to be.
          He holds out his fist, opens his hand, the coins lay in his palm.
          All the coins have bullet holes dead in their center. He drops them on
          top of Django.

                         DJANGO
          Still think I'm too green for Greenville?
          Dr.Schultz removes a pipe, sticks it in his mouth and says;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Oh you're ready for Greenville.
          He lights a match, then lights the pipe, puffing as he says;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Greenville ready for you, that I'm not so
          sure.
          He blows out the match...

          WE GO TO BLACK
          What we also saw in the above montage is Django shake off a lifetime of
          slavery. Django, in his green jacket, in his cowboy hat, on top of his
          steed Tony, with his gun hanging from his hip, has become his own man.
          He's not a slave anymore. He's a bounty hunter.

                         CUT TO

          EXT - THE TOWN OF GREENVILLE MISSISSIPPI - DAY
          The whole Main Street of Greenville is thick with five inches of shit
          brown mud that all the horse hooves, and wagon wheels, and slave feet
          have to wade through to get from one end of the town to the other.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         53
          We see Django and Dr.Schultz enter the town, and slosh their horses in
          the mud,, down the main street of Greenville Mississippi. The buying and
          selling of slaves is what the whole town is built around.
          BLACK MEN, WOMEN, and CHILDREN in BONDAGE are everywhere you look.
          LINES OF CHAINED SLAVES being marched one way or the other, move
          through the muddy streets of Greenville. WHITE MEN on horses move them
          along.
          BUCKBOARDS filled with DOMESTIC SLAVES (HOUSE NIGGERS), and pretty
          PONYS, driven by WHITE MEN roll through the street.
          A YOUNG WHITE BOY (14 years old), a shepherd, leads a bunch of
          SLAVE CHILDREN through town. A SHEPHERD'S DOG, HELPS HIM OUT BY MOVING

          THE KIDS ALONG.
          Impromptu slave auctions take place on almost every block.
          A SUBTITLE APPEARS on the bottom of the screen:

                         GREENVILLE

          CHICKASAW COUNTY, MISSISSIPPI
          Dr.Schultz takes in this African flesh market, where human beings sell
          other human beings, with disgust and a little bit of shock.
          Django is neither disgusted or. shocked, he knows first hand how
          Greenville operates.
          As he rides Tony through town in his snappy duds, he looks'at the BLACK
          MEN half dressed: in chains. He REMEMBERS HIMSELF with his six Other
          Companions from earlier, being walked through the mud of Main Street by
          The Speck Brothers. On that day he might as well of been a steer.
          Today, with a gun on his hip, money in his pocket, in his snappy
          outfit, astride his steed Tony, he feels so different from these
          wretched half naked bastards it gives him a bit of a chill.
          Django sees the towns railroad depot, and across from it a huge SLAVE
          PEN, like a STEER CORRAL. At the moment there's no train in the depot.

          WE FLASH ON
          The TRAIN, at a earlier time, pulling into the depot.

          INSIDE ONE OF THE BOXCARS
          amidst a boxcar full of shirtless BLACK MALES, Django watches the train
          pull into the station, from inside the wooden slates of the boxcar.:
          A hatch in the roof of the boxcar is NOISILY YANKED OPEN, and TWO WHITE
          SLAVE TRADERS (RUSS AND JUDD), peer down at their human cargo.

                         JUDD
          Good god almighty these niggers stink!

          Niggers stink, where's the shock?
          (to the Slaves

                         BELOW)
          Okay you bucks, listen up, and listen
          well, I'm only gonna say this once.
          There's a slave corral right across from
          this boxcar. We gittin ready to open these
          doors. When we do, y'all run as fast as you
          can, right into that pen. 'Anyone gittin off
          trail, gonna get hurt and hurt bad. Now you
          niggers better comprehend. And that goes for
          any African garboons amongst y'all can't
          understand english ... . your American buddies
          better shove your ass in the right direction,
          or your trip to this country is going to be
          short, and pointless. Train to pen as fast as
          you can!
          The boxcar door is slid open, and a HUNDRED AND FIFTY BLACK MALES
          run full out from the train to the steer corral.
          We spot Django during the running.
          Once inside the corral, the gate is closed.
          COWBOYS with rifles act as prison guards.

          INSIDE THE CORRAL
          through the wooden posts, in the distance, Django watches them open up
          the boxcar holding the females. They do their run to their pen out of
          view.
          Django catches a quick glimpse of Broomhild.a running with the other
          LADIES, then she's gone from view.

                         DJANGO
          You should see it from the other side.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Frankly, I don't know if I could endure this.

                         DJANGO
          You'd be surprised what you can endure.

          enter, and Dr.Schultz present his business card to a Dickensian looking
          RECORDS OFFICE WORKER. As Schultz starts his spellbinding with words

                         BROOMHILDA

          INT - SLAVE PEN - DAY
          The same shot we saw before of Django fighting his way to the bars of
          the slave pen, to get a better last look of Broomhilda.
          Broomhilda, as before is walked by in the distance.
          Then, as before Django loses sight of her.

          EXT - MAIN STREET - GREENVILLE - DAY
          We follow in front of Broomhilda being lead out of the slave pen by TWO
          WHITE MALE SLAVERS. Her bare feet slosh in the Main Street mud, and
          the leg irons scrap her ankles.
          Up until now everything you've ever seen of Broomhilda, has only been
          in Django's Spaghetti Western Flashbacks. In other words, from his
          perspective, and memory. This is the,only time the story will shift to
          Broomhilda's perspective. The strong but frightened girl is led out on
          to the hustle and bustle, and wagon wheels and horse hoofs of Main
          Street.
          Broomhilda is not taken into that three story auction arena that Django
          was sold in at the beginning. Instead She's just lifted up on a parked
          buckboard wagon. Her SELLER (CLYDE) starts his pitch on the TWELVE or
          so BUYERS that watch this puny make shift auction.

                         BROOMHILDA
          looks down into the crowd of twelve ugly white men, and holds her
          breath which one will buy her.
          Among the ugly white men we see Mr.HARMONY (MIKE), not quite as ugly as
          the rest. An older well dressed, classy gentleman. Next to him is his
          twenty four year old overweight awkward son SCOTTY HARMONY.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Scotty in the audience, and Broomhilda on the wagon, THEIR EYES MEET,
          he nudges his dad.
          The Seller makes her expose her breasts to the small crowd. Then her
          back, revealing her whip marks. Then pointing out the runaway "r"
          branded in her cheek.
          Some of the crowd, including Scotty, react with repulsion at the sight
          of the whip marks. The Seller assures the crowd, that niggers don't
          feel pain like white folks, and it only makes the women more gentle.

          SELLER - CLYDE
          Fellahs, you ain't felt gentle, till you felt
          nigger gal gentle.

          Broomhilda notices that. And makes more eye contact with Scotty.
          They look at each other as Mr.Harmony continues to bid.
          A LITERARY NARRATOR comes on the soundtrack.

          On that day, eight months ago, the auction
          was won by Mike Harmony, as a birthday present
          for his fat boy son Scotty.
          Mr.Harmony congratulates his son.
          From on top of the buckboard Broomhilda looks down at her new owners.
          Later they leave for the Harmony house. Scotty lifts Broomhilda up into
          the back of the buckboard. He hands her a little white bag.

                         SCOTTY
          This is for you.
          She opens the bag,candies of many colors sit in it.

                         SCOTTY
          They're jelly beans. Try one.
          She selects a yellow one and puts it in her mouth.

                         SCOTTY
          Good huh?
          She nods her head, yes.
          We see him drive the buckboard out of Greenville with Broomhilda in the
          back eating her bag of jelly beans.

          $XT - COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
          The buckboard makes its way down a country road. Broomhilda in the
          back, and Scotty driving the wagon.
          Scotty bought her, but he's too scared to talk to her.
          Broomhilda's muddy bare feet dangle off the wagon. She's beginning to
          realize the young master is the shy type.

                         BROOMHILDA
          Master Scotty... ?

                         SCOTTY
          Yes Broomhilda?

                         BROOMHILDA
          I'm lonely back here. Can I come on up with
          you on that seat so we can talk?

                         SCOTTY
          Please, I'd love that.
          She climbs into the driver's seat. In more ways then one.

          EXT - THE HARMONY HOUSE - DAY
          A nice two story southern house. Very nice, but hardly a plantation.
          The household's FOUR DOMESTIC SLAVES. Broomhilda will be the fifth. The
          buckboard pulls up to the front of the house.
          Scotty's mother, Mrs.HARMONY (MARY LOUISE), waits to meet her son, and
          his new bought nigger gal.
          The older lady looks the black girl up and down and says to her;
          Mrs.HARMONY
          What's your name, gal?

                         BROOMHILDA
          Broomhilda.
          Mrs.HARMONY
          Follow me. into the kitchen,
          ('to her son)
          You stay out here.

          INT - KITCHEN - DAY
          Mrs.Harmony brings Broomhilda in her kitchen. The TWO DOMESTIC SLAVES
          that were in, there are chased out by the boss lady. Mrs.Harmony grabs
          Broomhilda by the wrist, and tells her;
          Mrs.HARMONY
          I want to have a word with you, wench. You met
          my boy Scotty. You can tell ain't no white
          girl gonna fool with him. And if they do fool
          with him, they fool with him for the wrong
          reason. Boy's twenty four, he still ain't a
          man yet. That's why you're here. Be nice to him.
          He's a very sweet boy. Play him right, he'll
          eat bird seed out of your palm. Play 'em
          wrong, you'll deal with me.

                         BROOMHILDA
          I like Scotty. He's just shy is all. All he
          needs is a little confidence.
          Mrs.HARMONY
          And you'll give that to him?

                         BROOMHILDA
          I'll do my best, mam. Scotty's a real sweet boy.
          Mrs.HARMONY
          He is, isn't he?

                         BROOMHILDA
          Ah-huh.
          The mother lets go of the young lady's wrist.

          bride for young master Scotty that day.
          And the two kids had a nice time playing
          house for awhile.
          We see Scotty and Broomhilda catching butterflies in butterfly nets in
          the daytime..
          At night they catch LIGHTNING BUGS together.
          At night in Scotty's bed, while the young man lay fast asleep,
          Broomhilda looks at her jelly jar of GLOWING LIGHTNING BUGS.

                         NARRATOR (VO)
          As Scotty's sort of defacto sweetheart, if
          no visitors were about, Broomhilda would
          even join the family at their dinner table.
          We see them at dinner eating fried chicken and mashed potatoes and
          gravy.

          After three months of this bliss,
          Scotty decided to take Broomhilda for
          a romantic weekend in Greenville.

          SCOTTY AND BROOMHILDA
          drive through the Main Street of Greenville, dressed to the nines, in a
          fancy carriage. Broomhilda dressed in a beautiful white lace dress,
          complete with white lace gloves, fancy ladies hat, and white parasol.
          Scotty, very proud of his pretty Pony, is dressed in a fashion best
          described as plantation pimp daddy.

          the papered Ponys appreciate their privilege
          position, (just in case they'd forgot).

          holding her parasol, looking like a black Daisy Miller, watches the
          OTHER SLAVES march by in the mud. They watch her too.

          INT - HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
          Broomhilda and Scotty, and their luggage, move into the fancy hotel
          lobby, and rent a room at the front desk.

          INT -. GREENVILLE - NIGHT
           Greenville at night is a little different. At night, RICH WHITE MASTERS
          showing off their Ponys (like Scotty), rule the streets.

                          NARRATOR (VO)
          And two, there was a sliver of society that
          ran through Greenville at night that catered
          to white masters who were infected with a
          condition that was normally referred to as,
          "Nigger love." At night the streets, the bars,
          bistros, and buggy rides were ruled by rich
          white masters showing off their pretty Pony's.

          INT - THE CLEOPATRA CLUB - RESTAURANT - NIGHT
          The interracial joint is jumping (as long as by interracial you mean
          white men and black women).
          Scotty and Broomhilda are enjoying a fancy dinner in the clubs dining
          room.
          We see across the dining room, the powerful white man, CALVIN CANDIE,
          sitting with some White Men and some Black Ponys, eyeing Broomhilda.

                         SCOTTY
          I gotta tell you Broomhilda -
          I don't care if I go to. hell for this -
          I love you. And if loving you means I go to
          hell ... . Well then hello Mr.Devil.
          That was actually kind of funny. Broomhilda was right, all he needed
          was a little confidence. She puts her hand on his.

                         NARRATOR (VO)
          Then... speak of the devil and the devil
          appears.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          appears at their table.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Hello, my name is Calvin Candie, I own
          The Cleopatra Club. And I would just like
          to welcome an attractive couple'like
          yourselves to my favorite place on earth.
          Scotty stands up and shakes hands with Calvin.

                         SCOTTY
          Thank you so much, it's a great honor.
          We love it here.
          Pointing at a empty chair.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          May I join you?-

                         SCOTTY
          Please, by all means.
          Calvin sits down.
          Broomhilda gets a sinister chill from this smiling jack.
          Scotty, as per usual, is clueless.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          How long have you been a member?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         SCOTTY
          We just joined this weekend.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Well our little private oasis appreciates
          your patronage. Some may consider the dues
          excessive, but they're necessary for us to
          create this haven for the alternative
          lifestyle we've all become accustomed to.

                         SCOTTY
          Well said, and money well spent.
          He squeezes Broomhilda's hand.
          Candie sees this.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          It would be.my pleasure, your first
          weekend at the club, to join me and my
          friends at my table.
          Broomhilda knows this is a man to be avoided.
          But Scotty is swept away being courted by somebody like Calvin Candie.
          She tries to imply they should stay where they are. He brushes her off
          with a, "Don't be silly."
          We see Calvin introduce his table of friends to the couple, and they
          join the party.
          Calvin Candie has his arm around a foxy Pony named SHEBA, whose dress
          is a little more revealing then the others.
          They drink and talk, and the White Men have a forced good time. But
          Calvin Candie can't hide his sinister side from Broomhilda, and it
          keeps her uncomfortable, until she excuses herself from the table to go
          to bed. Scotty's having such a good time with his fancy friends he opts
          to stay behind.'Broomhilda leaves in a bit of a huff, due to Scotty's
          disobedience. If these fancy.fucking white men weren't around making
          Scotty feel so puffy chested, he'd never dismiss her that way.
          We FOLLOW Broomhilda out of the club, across the street, to the hotel.

                         NARRATOR (VO)
          After excusing herself, she walked across
          the street to her hotel room. She got
          her white dress dirty in the mud, but she
          didn't care, the night was ruined anyway.
          Some romantic weekend. Wait till she gets
          home and tells his mother how he ignored her.
          She'll fix his fat ass. Wait till he asks her
          to scratch his back next time. She's gonna
          scrape every pimple.

          ï¿½-. BACK AT THE CLEO CLUB
          The now drunk Scotty is playing poker with Calvin and his friends.

                         NARRATOR (VO)
          Back at The Cleopatra Club, as the night
          wore on, Calvin Candie suggested'a friendly
          card game. As the game wore on, it came down
          to a two thousand dollar pot between
          Calvin Candie and Scotty Harmony. Luckily
          for him, Scotty was holding.a inside straight.
          Calvin holds his cards with Sheba draped around him. She whispers
          something in his ear.

                         CANDIE

                          (TO SHEBA)
          Really?

                         (TO SCOTTY)
          You know what Sheba just tole me?
          Scotty, thinking about his great hand, says;

                         SCOTTY
          What?

                         CANDIE
          She says she thinks you're cute.

                         SCOTTY
          Really? Thank you Sheba, I think you're
          beautiful.
          Sheba whispers something else in Candie's ear.

                         CANDIE
          Sheba says she'd like to give you a little
          lip. Want some lip?
          Scotty, is a little surprised.

                         SCOTTY
          Well, she's your Pony...I mean...

                         CANDIE
          Oh hush, what's a little nigger lip 'tween
          friends. Go on honey, give 'em some sugar.
          Sheba walks over to Scotty's side of the table, and gives him a very lip
          intensive'soul kiss. The table enjoys the show. Then Sheba goes back to
          Calvin's side of the table.
          The game continues.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         G

                         CANDIE
          Okay loverboy, I think you're trying to out
          brazen me in my own club, and I won't have
          it. If you're really holding cards, time to
          pony up. I raise you five hundred.
          Candie throws in his chips.

          SCOTTY.
          I see your five hundred...
          (throws in chips)
          .and raise you four hundred more.
          (tosses his last chips)
          Call.
          This is where Calvin Candie has waited to be all night.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Not so fast, boy.

                         (BEAT)
          Pot ain't fat enough yet.

                         SCOTTY
          I'm all in.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Ain't that too bad.
          Scotty doesn't intend to let this smiling Jack cheat him out of his
          pot, especially with him holding an inside straight.

                         SCOTTY
          I would think a southern gentleman of
          such renown as yourself, wouldn't have
          to resort to buying a pot in his own club.
          Calvin writes on a piece of paper, then throwsit'in the pot.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          One final raise.
          Scotty takes the piece of paper, "What's this?"

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          It's Sheba's bill of sale.

                         SCOTTY
          What? I don't want her.
          Calvin.and the whole table laugh at that.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You sure didn't look like you didn't want her.
          More laughter.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          In Greenville slaves are currency. And
          Sheba's worth about eight hundred dollars.
          I'm throwing Sheba in the pot. Match or
          fold?

                         SCOTTY
          I'm all out of money.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          But we ain't playin' for money no more..
          We matchin' nigger gals. And a nigger gal
          you got.

                         SCOTTY
          I can't bet Broomhilda.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          In Chickasaw County, she's money. Pony her up
          or fold. Somebody get him a piece of paper
          and a pencil.
          Somebody does.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Write out a bill of sale, or fold them cards.
          Scotty makes a pressured decision.
          He hurriedly takes the pencil and writes out a Bill of Sale for
          Broomhilda.

                         SCOTTY
          Let me see your cards!
          Candie lays down his cards, he has a FLUSH.
          What Scotty's just done hits him like a ton of bricks.

                         SCOTTY
          You cheated me.
          After Scotty uses the "C" word, everybody quiets down.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What did you just call me?

                         SCOTTY
          I called you a card cheatin' son of a bitch,
          cause that's what you are!
          Calvin calmly stands up from the table. He removes a small Derringer
          Gun.from his pocket, and tosses it on the table in front of Scotty.
          Then takes out another one, and tosses it on the table in front
          himself .

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         66
          Everybody in The Cleo Club quiets down.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Scott Harmony. For calling me a card cheat
          in my own club, as a southern gentleman,
          I challenge you to a duel.
          (to the Piano

                         PLAYER)
          Piano player, will you hit three separate
          notes?

                         (TO SCOTTY)
          On the third note, pick up the gun and
          try to kill me.
          (to Piano player)
          Piano player please ...
          This is all going too fast for slow Scotty.

                         SCOTTY
          Wait a minute ...no!

          FIRST NOTE ...

                         SCOTTY
          I ain't dueling with you! I don't want
          to duel!

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Then get out of here, get in your buggy
          and get out of town.

                         SCOTTY
          Sure. Let me just get my girl.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You lost that girl, fat boy.

          SECOND NOTE...

                         SCOTTY
          Wait!... . Look ... . Mr.Candie, I'm sorry I
          called you a cheat. But... please...I can't
          give you Broomhilda.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Last chance fat boy, go home and get'useta
          to fuckin' another one.

                         (BEAT)
          Or pick up that gun.
          Scotty can't leave. He can't go home without her. He can't face his
          parents. He can't walk out on her. No matters what happens he can't
          leave.

          Dr.SCHULTZ
          His name is Calvin Candle, and he is the
          owner of Candyland.

                         DJANGO
          Candyland? The mandingo fightin' place?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Oh, so you heard of it?

                         DJANGO
          Ain't no slave ain't heard of Candyland.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well apparently, that's where your wife is,
          and apparently the repellent gentleman down
          there is the one who owns her.

          The White Man and Black Man find a cubby hole to talk in the auction
          hall.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          How much do you know about mandingo fighting?

                         DJANGO
          Not so much... A little... Master Carrucan had
          a couple niggers he'd fight.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Can you play a mandingo expert?

                         DJANGO
          What?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Can you convincingly masquerade as someone
          who is an expert on mandingo fighters?

                         DJANGOÂ¢
          Why?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Because when a man has one of the four
          biggest cotton plantations in Dixie, but
          the only thing that seems to ring his chimes
          is big sweaty black males, if WE want to get
          his attention, we better be talking about
          big sweaty black males. So my character is
          that of a big money buyer from Dusseldorf, here
          in Greenville to buy my way into the mandingo
          fight game. And your character is the mandingo
          expert I hired to help me do it.

                         DJANGO
          They call that "One-Eyed Charly."
          Dr.SCHULTZ.
          One-Eyed Charly?

                         DJANGO
          That's what you call it when you buy a slave
          expert. If you wanna raise horses, but don't
          know nothin' 'about horses, you buy yourself
          a One-Eyed Charly who knows about horses.
          He teaches ya. You wanna plant tobacco but
          don't know nothin' about it, you buy yourself
          a One-Eyed Charly knows about tobacco.
          Dr'. SCHULTZ
          Why do they call it One-Eyed Charly?

                         DJANGO
          You know, back on the plantation, my. job
          wasn't historian.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Testy. It's an unusual name. That's a perfectly
          legitimate question. So, can you convincingly
          play my mandingo One-Eyed Charly? Don't say,
          yes, if you can't.

                         DJANGO
          You want me to play a black slaver? There
          ain't nothin lower then a black slaver. Black
          slavers are lower then head house niggers, and
          buddy, that's pretty fuckin low.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Then play him that way! Give me your black slaver.
          Django gets that.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Can you do that?

                         DJANGO
          That, I can do. What's next?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          To get ourselves personally invited to
          Candyland by Calvin Candie himself.

          Which looks like aregular nice three story house, among other.nice
          houses on an affluent residential block in Greenville Mississippi.
          They open the tiny garden gate in front of the house, walk up the stoop
          steps to the front door. They ring the doorbell.
          A pretty young black girl, dressed in a FRENCH MAID outfit opens the
          door.

          The two men walk into the entrance way of the house.
          A beautiful mulatto HOSTESS greets the two men.

          Hello gentlemen, I'm Cleo, can I help you?
          Dr.Schultz hands Cleo the guest card.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes I am Dr.King Schultz, and this is my
          associate, Django Freeman.
          Upon hearing Django is a free man her eyes go to, him.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          We're here for a appointment with
          Calvin Candie and Leo Moguy.

                         CLEO
          Yes you gentlemen are expected. Please
          make yourself comfortable. I'll inform
          Monsieur Candie you've arrived.

          Can Coco get either of you two gentlemen
          a tasty refreshment?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Not at the moment.

                         CLEO
          Then Coco will entertain you while I
          inform Monsieur Candie.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          How charming.
          Cleo leaves.
          Django wanders over the dining room, and peers inside.

          INT - DINING ROOM (CLEOPATRA CLUB) - NIGHT
           A lush fancy restaurant dining area inside of this house. The DINERS
           are made up exclusively of well dressed WHITE MEN, and pretty BLACK
          GIRLS (PONYS) dressed in the most elaborate ladies fashions of the day.

          Some appear to be on dates.
          Some appear to be enjoying a special evening (birthday, anniversary,
          special treat).
          - Some are.two men with two women.
          Some are one man with two or three or more women.
          The white men's ages range from early twenties to old men.
          The girls ages ranges from their twenties, to thirteen.
          The bill of fare is a combination of French cuisine, and hearty beef
          driven American dining.
          The dolled up, decked out'Ponys eat rich French cuisine complete with
          elaborate sauces, and take their knives to thick cuts of steak.
          The younger little girls, usually eat ice cream with hot fudge, banana
          splits, and cookies.
          While-all the men drink whiskey or wine, the girls all drink
          sarsaparilla.
          Dr.Schultz quietly moves next to Django and asks;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Have you ever seen anything like this
          before?
          Django shakes his head, no.

          Dr.Schultz, good to see you again.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Mr.Moguy, thank you for your assistance
          in creating the opportunity for this
          appointment.

          .So this'is the One-Eyed Charly I've heard
          so much about.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes, this is Django.. Django, this is Mr.Candie's
          lawyer, Leonide'Moguy.

                         MOGUY
          Just call me Leo. Calvin's in the billiard
          room, follow me. Y'all want Coco should come
          along too?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          We would be quite lucky indeed if the
          charming Coco cared.to follow.
          Coco blushes.

                         MOGUY
          You better watch out doctor, you gonna
          steal this little pony's heart.
          They walk through the club to get to the billiard room, as they do they

                         SAY;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          How long have you been associated with
          Mr.Candie?

                         MOGUY
          Calvin and I were about eleven when we
          went to boarding school together. One
          could almost say, I was raised to be
          Calvin's lawyer.

                         DJANGO
          One could almost say, you a nigger.
          Coco can't believe what this snappy looking cowboy nigger just said to
          Mr.Moguy.

                         MOGUY
          What did you say?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Oh nothing, he's just being cheeky.
          Anything else about Mr.Candie I should
          know before I meet him?

                         MOGUY
          Yes, he's a bit of a Francophile.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         7EF
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          What civilized people aren't?

                         MOGUY
          That's why all the French ambiance. And
          he prefers Monsieur Candie to Mister Candie.
          Dr.Schultz says in FRENCH SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;
          Dr.SCHULTZ

                         (FRENCH)
          What ever he prefers.
          This stops Moguy, and he turns to warn Schultz.

                         MOGUY
          Oh he doesn't speak French. Don't speak
          French to him, it'll embarrass him.
          They get to the two sliding doors that lead to the billiard room.
          Moguy slides the doors open...
          The party enters the billiard room.

          INT - BILLIARD ROOM (CLEOPATRA CLUB) - NIGHT
           Inside is Calvin Candie, his bodyguard Bartholomew (still dressed in
          the ill fitting suit), and the lanky sexy Sheba.
          Also, at this moment, TWO MANDINGOS are having a bloody and savage
          fight to death in this closed room.
          An older European looking man, who's rooting for the mandingo that
          Calvin's not rooting for, is also in the room. His name is.AMERIGO

          VASSEPI.
          Before any introductions can be made, with his back to the new arrivals
          and his eyes on the black men fighting for their life, Calvin says;

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Why do you want to get in the mandingo
          business?
          That's quite abrupt and aggressive.
          Dr.Schultz says, as if he's just been massively insulted;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          You don't intend to allow your 2nd...
          (referring to Moguy)
          .to make the proper introductions?
          Without turning towards them, Candie tells Schultz;

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         7S

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Quit stalling and answer the question.
          The room is quiet.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          The awful truth?

                         (PAUSE)
          I'm bored, and it seems like a good
          bit of fun.
          Candie takes that to heart. He'll accept it for now.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Well come on over, cause we gotta us a fight
          goin on that's a good bit of fun_
          Dr.Schultz steps up to get a better look at the savage fight.
          The bigger mandingo is really hurting the smaller one.
          Schultz has schooled Django on the importance of never BREAKING
          CHARACTER.' Well now the good doctor must practice what he preaches.
          Which means not only must he watch. the two men beat each other to
          death, he must appear to convincingly enjoy it.

          CALVIN CANDIE.
          The bigger nigger is mine. I just bought
          him today. What's his name, Moguy?

                         MOGUY
          Big Fred.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          The other nigger belongs to this disreputable
          Italian gentlemen to my right. Amerigo Vassepi.

                         (TO AMERIGO)
          What's your nigger's name?

                         AMERIGO
          Luigi... .?
          Candie looks over at Django; who doesn't walk over to watch the fight.
          Instead he walks over to a bar set up in the room. A slave bartender
          named, ROSCOE tends it.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          How 'bout you, boy? You find nigger fightin'
          a good bit of fun?

                         DJANGO
          You seen one nigger fight, ya seen 'em all.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          How'd you two like to try the signature drink
          of the club?

          don't spare the rum.
          Roscoe makes the drinks in coconut shell glasses.
          Big Fred kills Luigi.
          Candie and his friends cheer.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Arrivederci Luigi! Well, Mr.Vassepi, looks
          like you owe me ten dollars.
          Amerigo pays up the puny bet.
           Django and Schultz get the fancy coconut shell drinks. They both take a
          sip. Schultz hates it, Django loves it.
          Candle turns his attention to Django.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What's your name, boy?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          His name is Django.

                         CALVIN CANDIE

                         (TO SCHULTZ)
          Where'd ya dig him up?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          A fortuitous turn of events brought
          Django and myself together.

                         CALVIN CANDIE

                         (TO DJANGO)
          I've heard tell about you. I heard you're a

          What you say, boy?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         77
          /ï¿½. Candie puts a calming hand on Bartholomew's shoulder.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Calm down Bartholomew, gentle... gentle.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Monsieur Candie, I would appreciate it if
          you directed your line of inquiry to me.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Doc, I'm a seasoned slaver, you are a
          neophyte. I'm simply trying to ascertain
          if this cowboy is taking advantage of you.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          With all due respect, Monsieur Candie, I
          didn't seek you out for your advice. I
          sought you out to purchase a fighting
          nigger at above top dollar market price.
          I was'under the impression when you
          granted me an audience, it would be to
          discuss business.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          No we weren't talking business yet. We
          were discussing my curiosity.
          Now according to Moguy here, if I do
          business with you...

                         (POINTING TO

                         SCHULTZ)
          , .I'm doin' business with both of y'all.

                          (POINTING TO

                         DJANGO)
          He does the eyeballin', you the billfold?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well you don't make it sound too flattering,
          but more or less, yes.
          None of the white men in the room have any respect for a white man who
          needs a nigger to tell him what time of day it is.
          Candie turns his attention back to Django.

                         CALVIN CANDIE

                         (TO DJANGO)
          So Bright Boy,.Moguy here tells me you
          looked over my African flesh, and were
          none too impressed.

                         FLASH ON
          we see. Django looking over THREE MANDINGOS..

                         

                         

                         

                         

          BACK TO CLEO CLUB

                         DJANGO
          Not for top dollar.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Well then we got nothing more to talk
          about. You wanna buy a beat ass nigger
          from me, those are the beat ass niggers
          I wanna sell.

                         DJANGO
          He don't wanna buy the niggers you wanna
          sell. He wants the nigger you don't
          wanna sell.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          I don't sell the niggers I don't wanna
          sell.
          Dr.Schultz chimes in thoughtfully;-
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          You won't sell your best. You won't even
          sell your second best. But your third
          best... .you don't want to.sell him... .But if
          I made you an offer so ridiculous you'd be
          forced to consider it... . who knows what
          could happen?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What do you consider ridiculous?
          Dr.SCHULTZ.
          For a truly talented specimen,
          ."The Right Nigger"..:?
          How much would you say, Django?

                         DJANGO
          Twelve thousand dollars.
          Calvin Candle takes in the figure.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Gentlemen, you had my curiosity. Now
          you got my attention.

                         TIME CUT

          TNT -- CLEOPATRA CLUB -- RESTAURANT - NIGHT
          Candle, Moguy, Django, Schultz, Bartholomew, Sheba, and Coco eat dinner
          in the restaurant. All the men eat thick T-Bones. Coco eats Catfish.
          And Sheba uses her fingers to rip apart Crawdads.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          How ya like that meat, Bright Boy?
          Django's eyes go to Calvin, he nods his approval.

                         CALVIN CANDIE

                         (TO COCO)
          How's your Catfish, dew drop?

                         COCO
          Real good Monsieur Candie.

                         CALVIN CANDIE

                         (TO SCHULTZ)
          You spend a lot of time around niggers
          aside from Freeman here?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Not so much.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Well if'in you did,.you'd know what a
          treat this was for 'em. You feel special
          Coco?

                         COCO
          Yes. sir, Monsieur Candie.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You feel special Bartholomew?

                         BARTHOLOMEW
          Yes sir, Monsieur Candie.
          He looks to Sheba, who's licking her fingers from the Crawdads.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Now Sheba always feels special. Dont'cha?

                         SHEBA
          Yep.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          How 'bout you Bright Boy, you feel
          special?

                         DJANGO

                         (MEANING SHEBA)
          Not as special as her.
          The table breaks out in laughter.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Well we're leaving bright and early
          tomorrow morning, and moving the. whole
          kit and caboodle to "Candyland."
          You oughta come with us.
          Dr.Schultz and Django's eyes meet for a moment.. .so far...so good.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well, that wasn't on the agenda. But I
          suppose I could be amenable to that.
          How far must we trek?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Oh hardly a ride at all, We'll still be
          in Chickasaw County. Five hours.. .tops.
          There you can get a look at my best
          specimens. Have dinner with my sister
          and I. Spend the night at Candyland as
          my guest.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Splendid.
          Django and Schultz trade looks and small smiles.

                         WE CUT

          EXT - COUNTRY SIDE MISSISSIPPI - DAY
          It's the next day and a whole procession is making their way to
          "Candyland."
          Calvin Candie, Leonide Moguy, Dr.Schultz, Django, and THREE OVERSEERS
          (BILLY CRASH, TOMMY GILES, and HOOT PETERS) ride horses.
          Bartholomew (now dressed in work clothes) drives a buckboard filled
          with'supplies.
          FIVE MANDINGOS (Big Fred and Banjo who we already met, plus JOSHUA,
          SIDNEY JAMES, and TATUM) recently purchased at the Greenville Auction
          walk to their new home, with small bundles of their personal
          possessions under their arm. They look like powerful warriors.

          THREE OTHER SHIRTLESS MANDINGOS (RODNEY, CHICKEN CHARLY, CHESTER) WHO
          WERE THE MANDINGOS FROM Candyland that didn't sell at Greenville are
          walking back to Candyland, with their small bundle of personal
          possessions under their arms. These poor devil's know their fate is
          pretty dismal. Either they'll be sold to the LeQuint Dickey Mining
          Company, or they'll be put in some mandingo fight they can't win, like
          with Samson, or Stonesipher's dogs.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         J

                         RODNEY
          walks along the road, looks up at Django riding his horse. All the
          slaves hate Django because they think he's a black slaver. But
          the three heading back to Candyland are even more resentful.

                         FLASH ON
          Django with Schultz, earlier, inspecting and rejecting these three.

                         RODNEY
          gives Django a bad eyeball look up on his horse.

          DJANGO ON TONY
          sees it. He's playing the role of a fucker black slaver, he can't let
          that shit stand.
          He yells down to the powerless man;

                         DJANGO
          Gotta problem with your eyeball, boy?
          Rodney looks away.

                         RODNEY
          No sir.

                         DJANGO
          You want a boot heel in it?

                         RODNEY
          No sir.

                         DJANGO
          Then keep ya damn eyeballs off me!
          Flash that bad look at me again,
          I'll give ya reason not to like me!
           As this parade makes progress, Django keeps his emotions in check, but
          not without difficulty.
          Dr.Schultz comes riding Fritz beside him.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          How do you like this side of the slave
          trade?

                         DJANGO
          Not so much.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Prefer the other side?

                         DJANGO
          I didn't say that.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I've confirmed Broomhilda's at Candyland.

                         DJANGO
          Are you sure it's her?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          He didn't call her by name, but she's a
          young lady, whip marks on 'her back, and
          speaks German. Now while it's not wise to
          assume, in this instance, I think it's
          pretty safe.

                         DJANGO
          Did you offer to buy her?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I opened the door to my possible interest.
          But naturally, sight unseen, I can only be
          so interested.

          SUDDENLY ...
          Calvin Candie comes riding up behind them...

                         CALVIN CANDLE
          Am I intruding?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Of course not.

                         CALVIN CANDIE

                         (APPRAISING THE

                         TWO MEN)
          I swear you two are cozier then a couple
          of cuttle fish.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          You'd be surprised what a good
          conversationalist Django is.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Oh by now, I don't think that would
          surprise meat all.
          Candie gives Django a creepy smile.
          Around now the audience may start noticing DOG BARKING in the distance.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          When do we reach your property?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          1?3

                         CALVIN CANDLE
          You been on it. I own the whole sixty
          miles 'fore we get to Candyland.
          Candie gets annoyed at the barking dogs.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Excuse me a moment, gentlemen.

                         (YELLING BEHIND
          him at Billy)
          Billy Crash, git up here!
          Billy Crash, a hillbilly overseer who's missing his two front teeth,
          rides up.

                         BILLY CRASH
          Yeah, Boss?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Find out what that goddamn commotion
          is up at the tracker shack!

                         BILLY CRASH
          Right away, Boss.
          Billy Crash TEARS UP AHEAD on his horse.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You know, confidentially, just 'tween
          us girls, worse things about this
          business, ain't the slaves. It's all
          the white trash ya gotta deal with.
          Like these peckawoods we got riding with
          us. These dumb, ignorant, sleazy sonsabitches
          ain't good fer nuttin, except kickin' a
          niggers ass can't kick back. Yeah, they
          holdin' the pretty part of the whip, but
          it's just a thin membrane separate 'em.
          And don't think they don't know it either.
          It's about the only thing these dumbass
          motherfuckers do know. But ya need 'em.
          Who the hell else ya gonna get to beat a
          niggers ass, other than somebody might as
          well be a nigger hisself. But these mountain
          boys I use as trackers for the runaways,
          they the worst. Nothin but a buncha goddamn
          inbreed hillbillies. Now like that nigger
          gal we was talkin' 'bout. I'm sure it.was
          a pain in the ass, but with a lot of
          patience, that German lady taught Hildi
          how to speak German.
          Django hears her name himself. His head does involuntary jerk, but his
          ï¿½, emotions betray nothing.

                         (CON'T)
          Now these inbred hillbillies, on the other
          hand, they can barely speak English. I can't
          understand a damn word most of 'em say. You
          could teach a plow horse how to make a pot
          of coffee, 'fore you teach those fools how
          to use a knife and fork. I tell ya, if it
          wasn't for catchin' a nigger on the run,
          they'd be as useless as tits on a boar hog.
          Billy Crash comes riding back.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What the hell's goin on?

                         BILLY CRASH
          They got 'em a runaway.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Who?

                         CUT TO

          EXT - TRACKER SHACK - DAY
          A BUNKHOUSE for the FOUR HILLBILLY TRACKERS (they track down runaway
          slaves) that live here about forty miles from the Candyland Plantation.
          A little dog kennel, looks like a chicken coup, sits next to the
          bunkhouse.
          The TRACKERS are a hairy, bearded, burly, buck skinned wearing, dirty
          long haired lot.
          Their Leader is Mr.,STONESIPHER, the other three are STEW, LEX, and
          JAKE. The four men could be brothers, or cousins, or father and sons,
          or just from the same hollow.
          Lex holds two SNARLING GERMAN SHEPHERDS on a leash. Stew one SNARLING
          GERMAN SHEPHERD on a leash. And Mr.Stonesipher holds one SNARLING
          GERMAN SHEPHERD on a leash, the lead dog, that goes by the name of

          MARSHA.
          A runaway slave named, D'ARTAGNAN, lies belly down in the dirt,
          surrounded by the four vicious dogs, who BARK, GROWL, and SNAP at him.
          One look at D'Artagnan tells you he's a mandingo who's been in one
          fight too many. One of his eyes have been 'poked out. Big BITES have
          been bit out of both his face and neck (by past fights, human bites,
          not-the dogs), as well as three fingers have been bit off. Not to
          mention he's covered in cuts, like he's been drug through a briar
          patch.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         O V5
          The fourth Tracker, JAKE, doesn't engage in the melodrama. He hangs in
          the background, CUTTING FIREWOOD with a big axe.
          Calvin Candie, Dr.Schultz, Django, and the whole Candie caravan look
          down on the runaway slave. Including the five new mandingos, and the three
          old mandingos who know D'Artagnan.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Well I'll be, D'Artagnan. Now boy, why do
          a fool thing like run off?

                         D'ARTAGNAN
          I can't fight no more, Monsieur Candie.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Oh yes you can. You might not be able to
          win, but your ass can fight. - Mr.Stonesipher,
          shut these goddamn dogs up, I can't hear
          myself think!
          Mr.Stonesipher, yells to Marsha;
          Mr.STONESIPHER
          Hush now! Marsha! Marsha, hush up!
          Marsha, Marsha, hush up!
          (to the other

                         TRACKERS)
          Take these goddamn dogs away from this nigger,
          he's just makin' em hungry.
          The other two YANK the dogs away from the fallen Black Man.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          How long was he loose?
          Mr. Stonesipher spits tobacco juice.
          Mr.STONESIPHER
          A.night. Day. Half the other night.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          How far he git off property?
          Mr.STONESIPHER
          Bout twenty miles off prop. Pretty fer,
          considering that limp he got.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Moguy, who was D'Artagnan suppose to fight
          Friday?.

                         MOGUY
          (pointing behind him)
          One of this new lot.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Well the way he looks now a blind Indian
          wouldn't bet 'a bead on 'em.

                         (TO D'ARTAGNAN)
          Boy, you done made yourself as useless as
          a tail on a teddy bear.
          D'Artagnan starts begging.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Now now, no beggin', no playin' on my
          soft heart. You in trouble now, son.
          Now you need to understand I'm runnin' a
          business. Now I done paid five hundred
          dollars for you. And when I pay five
          hundred dollars, I expect to get five
          fights outta a nigga 'fore he roll over
          and play dead. You've fought three fights.

                         D'ARTAGNAN
          I won every one.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Well, yes you did. But that last one, you
          muddied the line between winning and losing.
          Calvin climbs down off of his horse, and walks to the captured runaway
          on the ground.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          But the fact remains, I pay five hundred
          dollars, I want five fights. So what
          about my five hundred dollars? You gonna
          reimburse me?
          The Whites (except for Schultz) laugh.
          This whole spectacle is making Dr.Schultz sick to his stomach.
          Not Django ... . he's seen this little drama play out many times before.
          The three returning mandingos, Rodney, Chicken Charly, and Chester,
          watch their fellow doomed servant pay the price for running away.
          The five new mandingos watch Calvin Candie's treatment of D'Artagnan to
          know what to expect from their new home.
          Bartholomew on the buckboard looks at the captured runaway like, poor
          bastard.
          Calvin prods further.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You even know what reimburse means?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         E 17
          The Whites laugh.
          Then SUDDENLY ...
          .The German Speaks;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I'll reimburse you.
          All eyes turn to Dr.Schultz.
          Including Django's, whose eyes narrow at the doctor.
          Calvin Candie uses the occasion to perform a slow dramatic turn in the
          direction of the good German.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You will?
          Removing his long brown leather billfold from his suit jacket pocket.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You'll pay five hundred dollars for a
          one eyed Ole'Joe, ain't fit to push a
          broom?
          Django's voice cuts through the Mississippi heat.

                         DJANGO
          No he won't.
          All eyes turn to Django.

                         DJANGO
          He's just tired'of you toyin' with him is
          all. And for that matter, so am I. But we
          ain't payin' a penny for that pickaninny,
          we ain't got no use for 'em. Ain't that
          right, Doc?
          Dr.Schultz realizes he's just done the one thing he's always preached
          to Django you can never do..BREAK CHARACTER. The doctor puts his
          billfold back in his suit coat pocket.
          Dr.SCHULTZ

                         (TO CANDIE)
          You heard 'em.
          The Hillbilly Trackers stare up at the black man on the horse in the
          green jacket, slack jawed.
          !` Even the one chopping wood in the BG stops his chopping.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You'll hafta excuse Mr.Stonesipher's slack
          jawed gaze. He ain't never seen a nigger
          like you ever in his life..Ain't that right,
          Mr. Stonesipher?
          Mr.. Stonesipher., SPITS.
          Mr.STONESIPHER
          That's right.
          Calvin steps up to Django on his horse. Looking up at the black man,
          Calvin challenges Django to a staring contest.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Well now since you won't pay a penny for
          this pickaninny, you won't mind me handlin'
          this nigger however I see fit?

                         DJANGO
          He's your nigger.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Mr.Ston.esipher... .let Marsha and her
          bitches send D'Artagnan to nigger heaven.
          Mr.STONESIPHER
          Marsha...git 'em!
          The other Trackers let loose of the leashes holding the German
          Shepherds back.
          The DOGS CHARGE towards D'Artagnan on his knees...

                         THE MANDINGOS
          all react to the sight of the dogs being let loose.
          The DOGS ATTACK D'ARTAGNAN ...
          As we HEAR the ATTACK ...
          Candie.staring contest with Django...
          Django, who expected nothing less and has seen worse, doesn't blink as
          the runaway slave is torn to bits by canine teeth ...
          The other Mandingos are scared sick at what they see.
          The Hillbilly Trackers root the dogs on.
          Dr.Schultz has never seen a man torn apart by dogs before, and he
          appears not to enjoy it.
          Calvin, without blinking, shifts his eyes toward Dr.Schultz, then back
          ï¿½-. to Django.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         P9

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Your boss looks a little green around
          the gills for a blood sport like
          nigger fightin'?
          As D'Artagnan's SCREAMS and Marsha's GROWLS continue OFF SCREEN.

                         DJANGO
          Naw, he just ain't use to seein' a man
          ripped apart by dogs, is all.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          But you are use to it?

                         DJANGO
          Well, him bein' German an' all, I'm
          a little more use to American's then
          he is. Now Monsieur Candie, whenever you're
          ready, we rode five hours so you could
          show off your stock. Let's git to it.
          Cause as of now, if he's a example, I'
          ain't impressed.
          Calvin...BLINK...
          Saying nothing, Monsieur Candie turns his back to Django, climbs up on
          his horse, then looks at the black man.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Follow me.
          The whole caravan rides off as the dogs continue to tear D'Artagnan
          apart.

          EXT - THE GROUNDS OF CANDYLAND - DAY
          The caravan starts to approach Candyland. Calvin Candie and his sister
          own the fourth biggest cotton plantation in the state of Mississippi.
          As the parade gets closer we see fields of cotton, and fields of SLAVES
          picking it.
          The audience might of been expecting Candyland to be a hell on earth,
          Auschwitz, Andersonville, Yuma Prison, a Mexican prison in a Sergio
          Corbucci Spaghetti western ...
          INSTEAD ... . CANDYLAND is very beautiful. The fields of cotton, the way
          the trees hang green vines over everything. It's full of nature and
          natures vibrant colors, and a broiling hot sun to see it all in.
          One of the cottonpickers in the field, DOBIE, looks up, and sees Django
          in his cool green corduroy jacket, badass cowboy hat, on top of Tony.
          He taps the shoulder of another cotton picker (ORWELL), and points out
          Django.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         90
          All of a sudden all the bent over backs in the field, straighten up to
          get a better look at the black riding a horse.
          Django looks back matching their stare.

          EXT - SLAVE VILLAGE - DAY
          The caravan rolls through the shack/cabin village the slaves live in.
          As the parade rolls through all the SLAVES snap to attention, and bow
          (very formally) as Monsieur Candie rides past. A KING among his SUBJECTS,
          a PATRON with his PEONS, a FATHER amongst his CHILDREN, a SHEPHERD
          among his SHEEP.
          KIDS playing in the dirt get up and run to Calvin on his horse.
          Candie calls the kids by name, takes out a bag of jelly beans, and
          begins tossing them about.
          The Kids scramble in the dirt for the bright colored candy.
          This is Calvin Candie in his element, at his happiest.

          THEN ...
          .DJANGO rides by.
          The CARAVAN moves from the slave village to the White Village the
          overseers and their family live in on the plantation grounds.
          Other then the switch of white faces for black, it's pretty much the
          same village.
          And they too see Django ... . WOW!
          The Caravan enters the road that leads to the front of the Plantation,
          or The Big House as everyone calls it.
          To the left of the Big House is big wooden ARENA built for his Friday
          night nigger fights.
          All the HOUSE SLAVES (the domestic slaves that work for the Candie
          family in the Big House), and WHITE WORKERS (overseers and stray farm
          hands) come out to greet the caravan.
          They all greet Monsieur Calvin Candie, who naturally leads the
          procession, as if he's Alexander The Great returning from the wars.
          As the caravan comes to a stop in front of the Big House, it creates a
          huge dust cloud behind it.
          Calvin's widowed sister LARA LEE CANDIE-FITZWILLY, an attractive
          ï¿½. fortyish, strawberry blonde southern belle, steps out on the porch of
          the Big House to greet her brother.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Directly above Lara Lee, on the third floor balcony over hang, out.
          steps...

                         STEPHEN
          eyeing Calvin and the approaching caravan.
          Who's STEPHEN? Stephen is a very old black man, who with his bald pate,
          and tufts of white curly hair on the sides, looks like a character out
          of Dickens - if Dickens wrote about House Niggers in the Antebellum
          South. -
          Stephen has been Calvin's slave since he was a little boy. And in
          (almost) every way is the 2nd most powerful person at Candyland.
          Like the characters Basil Rathbone would play in swashbucklers, evil,
          scheming, intriguing men, always trying to influence and manipulate power
          for their own self interest. Well that describes Stephen to a tee.
          The Basil Rathbone of House Niggers.
          The old Man watches the caravan and the trailing dust cloud approach.

          THEN...
          Out of the dust cloud ...EMERGE DJANGO and SCHULTZ... . on TONY and FRITZ.
          All the Candylanders see Django, dressed like he is, up on the horse,
          and for a moment don't know what to think.
          Lara Lee, like her brother, is both surprised and intrigued.
          As Stephen peers down from his perch at the nigger in the green jacket,
          it's hate at first sight. Stephen heads downstairs, he walks with a,
          limp.
          All the caravan riders are still up on their horses. Calvin sees
          Stephen limping towards them, and greets him with a big how do you do;

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Hello Stephen my boy!

                         STEPHEN
          Yeah yeah yeah, hello my ass - who's
          this nigger up on that nag?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Oh Stephen, why so ornery, you miss me?

                         STEPHEN
          Yeah, I miss you like I miss.a rock in my
          shoe. Like I said, who's this nigger, up
          on that nag?

          DJANGO'S VOICE (OS)
          Hey Snowball.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          : Stephen looks up at Django on Tony.

                         DJANGO
          If you wanna know who I am, or the name of
          my horse, you ask me.

                         STEPHEN
          Just'who the hell you callin' Snowball,
          horse boy? I'll yank your ass of that
          goddamn'nag, so goddamn fast - in the mud.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Whoa, whoa, whoa, Stephen, let's keep it
          funny. Django's a Freeman.
          Stephen jerks a thumb up towards Django.

                         STEPHEN
          This nigger, here?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          That nigger there. Let me at least introduce
          the two of. you. Django, this is another
          cheeky black bugger like yourself, Stephen.
          Stephen, this is Django. You two should
          hate each other.
          Stephen uses'the special privilege he and he alone enjoys amongst the
          blacks at Candyland.

                         STEPHEN
          Calvin, who the hell is this nigger you
          feel the need to entertain?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Django and his friend in grey, Dr.Schultz
          are customers, and they are our guests
          Stephen. And you - you old decrepit bastard...
          .are to show them every hospitality.
          Do you understand that?

                         STEPHEN
          I don't know why I gotta -

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You don't hafta know why, do you
          understand?

                         STEPHEN
          Yeah yeah yeah, I understand just fine.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Good. They're spending the night. Go up
          in the guest bedrooms and get two ready.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         93

                         STEPHEN

                         (POINTING AT

                         DJANGO)
          He's gonna stay in the Big House?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Stephen, he's a slaver. It's different.

                         STEPHEN

                         (INCREDULOUS)
          In the Big House?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You gotta problem with that?

                         STEPHEN
          I don't gotta problem, unless you gotta
          problem with burin' the bed, the sheets,
          and the pillow cases once this black ass
          motherfuckers gone!

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          That's my problem, they're mine to burn.
          Your problem, right now, is making a
          good impression. And I want you to start
          solving that problem right now, and git
          them rooms ready.
          The Old Man looks up at his Master, and says;

                         STEPHEN
          Yes sir, Monsieur Candie.
          Stephen limps away to the guest rooms, muttering to'himself.
          Lara Lee and her ever present shadow, a FAT MAMMY named CORA, comes up
          to her brother on his horse.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Dr.Schultz, this attractive southern belle
          is my widowed sister, may I present to you,
          Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly.
          Lara Lee does a southern lady bow.
          Dr.Schultz lifts his bowler hat, and nods in a grand manner.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I am Dr.King Schultz, this is my 2nd
          Django,
          (Django tips his hat)
          and these are our horses, Fritz and Tony.
          Both Fritz and Tony do the head bow.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          And it is our great delight to encounter
          this flaming rose.

                         LARA LEE
          Well aren't you the charming gentlemen.
          You're not from around here, are you?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Actually I'm from a far off land,
          Dusseldorf, to be exact.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          These two are in the market for a fightin'
          nigger. So I thought I'd invite 'em down,
          show 'em my stock.

                         LARA LEE
          We'll all have dinner tonight, right?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Half the reason I invited them. I thought
          you'd find.them as intriguing as I do
          little sister.
          Lara Lee looks up at Django, and smiles.
          All of a sudden THREE WHITE RIDERS ride up on horses, a older one, and
          two tough looking younger ones. The'older one is the Cap't of the
          Overseers, ACE WOODY, and his two assistants BROWN and JINGLE BELLS
          CODY. While Ace is dressed for work on a farm, both Brown and Jingle
          Bells Cody are peacocks who wear cool cowboy outfits.
          As Calvin Candie watches the three riders approach, he turns to
          Dr.Schultz and Django, and says;

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You know since I started fightin' niggers
          about eleven years ago, it's been a new
          lease on'life. And the man ridin' up here
          now is the man responsible for all my
          success.
          Ace and his boys pull their horses up, kicking up dust.
          Through the dust Ace, Brown, and Jingle Bells Cody eyeball Django and
          Schultz.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Howdy Ace.

                         (TO SCHULTZ

                         AND DJANGO)
          This here is my Overseer .Cap't, and
          nigger fight trainer extraordinaire,
          Ace Woody.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         915
          Pointing at the two shadows that flank Ace Woody.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          And that's Brown and that's Jingle Bells
          Cody.

                         (TO ACE)
          Ace, this here is Dr.Ring Schultz, and
          Django Freeman, they're big customers with
          big pockets wanna buy a big nigger. So I
          brought 'em out here so you could give
          'em a little display of our African flesh.
          Ace takes off his hat, bows from his horse, welcoming them.

                         ACE WOODY
          Welcome to Candyland, gentlemen.
          Astride their horses Brown and Jingle Bells Cody just make faces at
          Django.
          Ace's attention goes to the five new mandingos.just walked from
          Greenville to here.

                         ACE WOODY
          These the new chickens?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Yes siree bob.

                         ACE WOODY
          How many you get?

                         (HE COUNTS)
          One, two, three, four, five.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Five real strong bucks.

                         ACE WOODY
          How many you get rid of?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          We still got three left.
          Ace looks to see who came back from the auction.
          Leo Moguy chimes in;

                         MOGUY
          I already wired the LeQuint Dickey people,
          they'll be here tomorrow.
          Ace turns to Brown.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         ACE WOODY
          Get 'em away from the others. Put 'em in
          the pen till tomorrow.
          Brown with his horse, yells, chases, and herds the three men away into
          the slave pen.
          Ace yells from his horse down to the five new mandingo arrivals, Big
          Fred, Banjo, Sidney James, Tatum,.and Joshua.

                         ACE WOODY
          Y'all stand over there and make a line!
          They do.
          Ace climbs down from off his horse.
          Cody stays in his saddle, circling the black men with his horse.
          Everybody, including Django and Dr.Schultz, watch the show.
          Ace'Woody walks up and down the line looking at the new men.
          Candie, sitting comfortably up on his horse, says;

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What do you think?

                         ACE WOODY
          I think you lookin' for niggers to push
          a plow, 'dem your boys.
          Candie rolls his eyes.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What's wrong with them?

                         ACE WOODY
          Hold it...hold it, you done bought
          r em, let me look at 'em.
          Unimpressed Ace Woody continues to examine them.

                         ACE WOODY
          Okay, how 'bout that one, did you
          buy that one?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Which one?

                         ACE WOODY
          What you mean, which one? The one I'm
          pointing at, that one.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         77

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Actually, that one was purchased by
          our mister Moguy.

                         ACE WOODY

                         (TO MOGUY)
          You bought him?

                         MOGUY
          Yes I did.

                         ACE WOODY
          Why?

                         MOGUY
          I like his prospects.

                         ACE WOODY
          His prospects? Now you know Mr..Moguy,
          I ain't a educated fella like yourself.
          Remind me again what prospects means?

                         MOGUY
          Hope for the future.
          Jerking a thumb towards the slave in question.

                         ACE WOODY
          You got hope for his future?

                         MOGUY
          I did.

                         ACE WOODY
          Well I don't.
          Ace walks over to the slave in question.

                         ACE WOODY
          What's your name, boy?
          The mandingo says;

                         SIDNEY JAMES
          Sidney James, sir.

                         ACE WOODY
          So long Sidney James.
          Ace takes the peacemaker out of the holster on his hip, and SHOOTS
          Sidney James point blank in the belly.
          Everybody reacts.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Especially the four other mandingos standing next to him.
          Sidney James rolls in the dirt, screaming and holding his bleeding gut.
          Till Cody puts a bullet in his head, putting him out of his misery.
          Moguy, shakes his head, "Typical," he thinks.
          Django and Schultz, on their horses next. to Candid, watch.
          Ace looks up at his boss.

                         ACE WOODY
          Boss Candie, which one did you buy?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Well to me the pick of the litter is
          Big Fred over there.

                         ACE WOODY

                         (POINTING AT

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Yes.

                         ACE WOODY

                         (TO FRED)
          You Fred?
          A very scared Fred answers.

                         BIG FRED
          Yes, sir.

                         ACE WOODY

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          I had 'em fight one of Amerigo's niggers

          Really? You won?

                         BIG FRED
          Yes, sir.

                         ACE WOODY

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Beat 'em to death.
          Smiling impressively at Big Fred.

                         ACE WOODY

                         (TO FRED)
          Really?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          He did have fifteen pounds on 'em,
          but still, he still beat his ass
          to death.

                         ACE WOODY

                         (TO FRED)
          You did?

                         BIG FRED)

                         BIG FRED
          Yes, sir.
          Ace gives Cody a slight head nod, and Cody SHOOTS Big Fred in the back.
          Candie acts out mock frustration.
          The remaining three mandingos jump a mile.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Now why did you do that?

                         ACE WOODY
          He won his last fight last night.
          Ace puts his eyes on the three remaining mandingos

                         ACE WOODY

                         (TO MANDINGOS)
          Those of you with exceptional ability
          will find it ain't so bad here. Those of
          you who don't possess exceptional ability,
          will wish you did.
          Ace looks up to Cody on his horse.

                         ACE WOODY
          Run 'em over to the Arena. Git 'em doin
          push ups. First one gives out, shoot 'em
          in the head.

                         (TO MANDINGOS)
          Welcome to Candyland, boys!
          Cody runs the terrified mandingos to the arena.
          Candie leans over to Schultz and says;

                         CALVIN CANDLE
          We only get about two out of every batch
          of five fighters we buy. But those two
          tend to be lucky.
          Ace Woody hops back up on his horse.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You know Mr.Woody, I'm beginning to think
          that you don't trust my judgement?
          Ace Woody just smiles at his boss, and says;

                         ACE WOODY
          Oh you know I always trust your judgement,
          Boss Candie...eventually.
          He rides off.
          Stephen limps back to the action.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Ahhh, Stephen my boy, rooms ready?

                         STEPHEN
          All ready for your guest and his nigger.
          Candie'shakes his head in mock frustration.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Stephen, you're incorrigible.

                         (TO SCHULTZ

                         AND DJANGO)
          Gentlemen, let Stephen show you to your
          rooms.

                         CALVIN CANDLE

                         (CON'T)
          There you can lie down and rest up
          for a couple of hours. Then we'll have
          some lemonade, and I'll show off some of
          my finer specimens.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Splendid.
          Both Dr.Schultz and Django climb down from their horses.
          Candie looks to a black little stable boy of about eight named TIMMY.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Timmy boy, go take their horses for 'em.
          Fix 'em up at the stable, give 'em a load
          of oats.
          Django hands the boy the reigns.

                         DJANGO
          That's Fritz, this is Tony. You take good
          care of 'em now.

                         TIMMY
          Yes, sir.
          Django takes an apple out of his saddle bag, and hands it to the boy.

                         DJANGO
          Once he's in the stable, give 'em that.
          He reaches back in the saddle and pulls out another one.

                         DJANGO
          Give that one to Fritz.
          Timmy leads the horses away.
          The two visitors start to follow Stephen to their rooms, when
          Dr.Schultz pretends to remember something;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Oh, Monsieur Candie, about that matter about
          the nigger girl we were talking about?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Nigger girl?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I believe you said she spoke German?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Oh Yes, Hildi, what about her?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          ,oz.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Do you think before the demonstration you
          could send her around to my room?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          I don't see why not.

                         (TO STEPHEN)
          Stephen, when you get through showing
          them to their rooms, go fetch Hildi.
          I want her cleaned up and smellin' nice,
          and sent over to Dr.Schultz's room.
          Stephen has to be the bearer of bad news.

                         STEPHEN
          Actually... . Monsieur Candie... . there's
           somethin' we ain't tole you yet.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What?

                         STEPHEN
          Hildi's in The Hot Box.
          This gets Django's, Schultz's, and Candie's attention.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What's she doin' there?

                         STEPHEN
          What 'cha think she doin' in The Hot Box,
          she bein punished.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What she do?

                         STEPHEN
          She ran away again.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Jesus Christ, how many people ran away
          when I was gone?

                         STEPHEN
          Two.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          When did she go?

                         STEPHEN
          Last night. They brought her back this
          morning.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         CALVIN CANDLE
          How bad did Stonesipher's dogs tear her up?
          Django's hand falls to the butt of his smoke wagon. If they sicked
          those dogs on his angel, he's going to just kill all these
          motherfuckers right now.

                         STEPHEN
          Lucky for her they were busy lookin' for
          D'Artagnan's ass. Brown and Cody went out
          lookin' for her and found her. She a little
          beat up, but she did that to herself.
          Runnin' through them damn bushes.
          Django's hand moves away from his gun.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          How long she been in the box?

                         STEPHEN
          What'cha think, all goddamn day! Little
          fool got ten more days to go.

                         CALVIN CANDLE
          Take her out.

                         STEPHEN

                         (INCREDULOUS)
          Take her out? Why!

                         CALVIN CANDLE
          Because I said so, that's why. Hildi is
          my nigger. Dr.Schultz is my guest. Southern
          hospitality dictates I make her available
          to him.

                         STEPHEN
          But Monsieur Candie, she just ran away?

                         CALVIN CANDLE
          Jesus Christ Stephen, what's the point of
          havin' a nigger speaks German if-you can't
          wheel 'em out when you have a German guest?
          I realize it's inconvenient. Still, take
          her out.

          Lara Lee would you and Cora be responsible
          for getting her cleaned up and presentable
          for Dr.Schultz?
          The overseers,'Tommy Giles and Hoot Peters go to The Hot.Box. While
          Billy Crash goes to the well to draw a bucket of water.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Django watches them walk to The Hot Box.
          Dr.Schultz's eyes shift to Django, to watch him watch this.
          Stephen notices Django's interest in both The Hot Box and whoever's
          sizzling in it.
          The HOT BOX
          itself is a large IRON SOLITARY CONFINEMENT CELL DOOR (from Yuma
          Prison) built into the ground. They put a key in the lock, and the two
          men lift the heavy iron door open.

          WHEN ...
          Billy Crash TOSSES the bucket of water on her.
          Django watches this.
          DJANGO'S POV:.From his wide shot perspective we see them yank the NAKED
          BROOMHILDA (incoherent) out of the hole.

          as we move into a Sergio Leone CU of DJANGO'S FACE.
          Stephen breaks the mood.

                         STEPHEN

                         (TO DJANGO)
          You comin', or you wanna sleep in that
          little box?
          Django turns his back on the naked Broomhilda and follows Stephen and
          Dr.Schultz up the front steps of The Big House.

          INT - THE BIG HOUSE - DAY
          Stephen leads the two guests up the big prominent sweeping staircase in
          the entry way of The Big House. Then down the hallway with the guest
          rooms. Dr.Schultz is shown his guest room by Stephen. Schultz enters
          the room and shuts the door behind him. Stephen takes Django to the
          room next door, opens the door, and leads him in.

          INT - DJANGO'S GUEST ROOM - DAY
          A guest room with a big feather bed, dresser drawer with a flowery
          pitcher of water and basin on top of it. A little bedside table with a
          lamp and a tiny bell on it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         105

                         STEPHEN
          This one's yours, boy. That bed's damn
          nice too.
          Django walks over to the window, parts the curtains and peers out.
          Broomhilda's gone. As he looks through the glass, snotty Stephen
          rattles on in the background.

                         STEPHEN
          Feel free to touch anything you want,
          cause we burnin' all this shit once you
          gone. I'll have somebody knock on the
          door when the demonstration ready.
          Django sits down on the bed.
          Stephen turns to leave.

                         DJANGO
          Not so fast.

                         STEPHEN
          I got more important things to do then
          jaw with you.

                         DJANGO
          Nigger, when I say stop you plant roots.
          Both the words and the tone stop Stephen dead. He turns around.

                         DJANGO
          This tiny bell on this little table...
          .is this for you? I ring this, you
          do fer me?

                         STEPHEN
          Me or somebody.
          Django reaches over and picks up the bell.
          (a soft) DING-A-LING

                         STEPHEN

                         (UNAMUSED)
          What 'cha want?

                         DJANGO
          I want you to pour some water in that
          bowl for my wash up.
          Stephen does what he's told, but with attitude.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         )O'
          Django shuts the guest room door so the two men are alone.
          Once Stephen's done, Django stands up from the bed.

                         DJANGO
          Gimmie.
          Stephen hands him the basin full of water.
          Django takes it from him.
          Then throws the water in Stephen's face.
          The dripping wet old slave can do nothing against this free man.

                         DJANGO
          Whatsamatter Stephen, you don't like
          that?
          Django takes his hand and SLAPS the old man hard across the face
          knocking him to the floor;

                         DJANGO
          That's my kinda bell ringin'. Git up.
           The old man timidly, slowly, and shaky rises off the floor - as soon as
          he does - Django SLAPS HIM TO THE FLOOR again.
          Then Django sits back down on the bed, looking at the old man on the
          floor below his knees.

                         DJANGO
          I've known me House Niggers like you my
          whole life. Play your dog tricks with your
          Massa'. Ya' lip off to him every now an'
          then, as long as ya' keep it funny. He
          rolls his eyes and puts up with it, and
          all the white folks think it's so cute.
          Meanwhile you got all these niggas round
          here hoppin' and jumpin' to stay on your
          good side. Well this time Snowball, you
          gonna listen to me. You got anymore sass
          you wanna sling my way, before they give
          us a mandingo demonstration, I'm gonna
          give this whole motherfuckin plantation
          a demonstration, of ME beatin' the BLACK
          off your ass. I will make you drop your
          drawers, I'll take off my belt, and I will
          Wup' your bare ass with it, in front of
          every nigga on this plantation. And after
          I do that, let's see you play the rooster
          round here.

                         STEPHEN
          Calvin wouldn't. let you do it.

                         DJANGO
          Oh that's right, he gives you first name
          privileges... . ain't that cute. Sass me
          me again nigger, see what happen'.
          Stephen lying on the floor, bites his tongue.

                         DJANGO
          That's what I thought. Now git outta"here.
          With as much dignity as he can muster, Stephen stands up.
          Before he leaves, Django tells him;,

                         DJANGO
          When I ring this bell, you better come
          a runnin'. You - not nobody else. While
          I'm on this property, you my nigger
          Snowball.
          Stephen leaves.
          Django lies down on the bed. He covers his eyes with his arm.
          A door joins Django and Schultz's room. The adjoining door opens, and
          Schultz stands there.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Was that wise?
          Django doesn't remove his arm from.his eyes.

                         DJANGO
          He ain't tellin' nobody 'bout that.
          That's all that needs to be said.

          INT - HALLWAY (BIG HOUSE) - DAY
           Lara Lee, Cora, and a traumatized, but cleaned up (she's dressed in a
          domestic maid uniform) Broomhilda stand outside Dr.Schultz's door,
          after Calvin's sister raps on it.
          Dr.Schultz opens the door.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Hello ladies.

                         LARA LEE
          Dr.Schultz, may I introduce to you,
          Hildi. Hildi, this is Dr.Schultz, he
          speaks German.
          Dr.SCHULTZ

                         (TO BROOMHILDA)
          I've been informed you do as well.

                         BROOMHILDA

                         (GERMAN)
          It would be my, pleasure to speak with you
          in German.
          Schultz acts for the benefit of Miss Lara's astonishment.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Astonishing.

                         (IN GERMAN)
          Please come inside Fraulein.
          She does, and just'as Lara Lee is to say something, Schultz says,
          "Thank You very much," and closes the door in her face. Miss Lara looks
          to her Mammy, and the two women head off nonplussed.

          INT - SCHULTZ'S GUEST ROOM (BIG HOUSE) - LATE AFTERNOON
          With the door closed, Schultz turns to the weak, frightened,
          disoriented girl.
          He gives her a pleasant smile.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          They call you Hildi, but your real name
          is Broomhilda, isn't it?

                         BROOMHILDA
          Yes. How do you know that?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Stands to reason who ever taught you
          German would also give you a German name.
          Can I pour you a glass of water,
          Broomhilda?
          Hearing her name being spoke properly for the first time in awhile, not
          to mention with a German accent, does have a bit of a calming influence
          on the frightened girl.

          WE CUT TO DJANGO
          on the other side of the adjoining door, listening, waiting for his cue
          to present himself.
          BACK TO BROOMHILDA AND Dr.SCHULTZ
          As Dr.Schultz calmly pours the young lady a glass of water, he begins
          talking to her in GERMAN SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;
          Dr.SCHULTZ

                         (GERMAN)
          I'm aware you haven't spoken German in
          a long while. So I'll talk slowly.
          I'm only speaking German to you now,
          Broomhilda, in case Candie's people are
          listening to us. Myself and a mutual
          friend of ours, have gone through a lot
          of trouble, and rode a lot of miles, to
          find you fraulein - to rescue you.
          He hands her a tall clear glass of water.
          She looks at him weird, rescue me?
          Dr.SCHULTZ

                         (GERMAN)
          Please drink.
          She absentmindedly obeys.
          Dr.SCHULTZ

          (.GERMAN).
          Now it's myself and our mutual friend's
          intention to take you away from here
          forever.

                         (GERMAN)

          Dr.SCHULTZ

                         (GERMAN)
          Yes you do.

          Dr.SCHULTZ

                         (GERMAN)
          I can't tell you. Our mutual friend has a
          flair for the dramatic, and he wants to
          surprise you.

          Standing right behind that door.
          Her head moves in the direction of the door.
          He looks to the young woman;
          Dr.SCHULTZ

                         (GERMAN)
          Promise me you won't scream?
          She nods her head, yes.
          Dr.SCHULTZ

                         (GERMAN)
          Say, I promise.

                         BROOMHILDA

                         (GERMAN)
          I promise.
          Dr.Schultz moves to the door, and lightly raps on it.
          The door knob turns.
          The door slowly opens revealing...
           Her husband Django, but different, all cowboyed out and cleaned up.
          He smiles at her, and says;

                          DJANGO
           Hey Little Trouble Maker.
          Obviously a pet name between them.
          Broomhilda goes into a bit of shock...
           .first she loses strength in her wrist, so the glass tips over, and
          the water spills on the floor ...
           .followed quickly by herself spilling on the floor in a dead. faint.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         1/1
          The two men look at the woman on the floor, then at each other;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          You silver tongued devil you.

                         MONTAGE
          WE DISSOLVE to later, as we see Dr.Schultz and Django explain what-
          they're doing there, who they're pretending to be, and what their plan
          is to Broomhilda. We hear a woman whistle a soft pretty tune on the
          soundtrack. It's not a happy tune.. .per se. But it's pretty, and
          vaguely optimistic ...
          WE DISSOLVE TO The SLAVE PEN
          The doomed men who didn't sell at Greenville, brooding Rodney and
          Chester and Chicken Charly, spend their last night at Candyland
          sleeping under the stars in The Slave Pen. The same whistling tune
          continues over this scene.
          Rodney sees, The whole slave selling and buying group, Django,
          Dr.Schultz, Candie, Bartholomew, Moguy, Ace Woody, Brown and Cody, and
          the Overseers, walk across the plantation grounds on their way to
          The Arena. Laughin' and joshin' all the way. The hatred Rodney feels
          for that group of men burns inside him like a red hot poker.
          A study in powerless fury.

          DISSOLVE TO BROOMHILDA SETTING THE DINNER TABLE
          in the dining room of The Big House with its knives, spoons and forks.
          She's all by herself as she goes through this duty.
          The whistling tune we've been listening to has been coming from
          Broomhilda whistling as she sets the table.
          Suddenly out of the darkness of the background appears Stephen.

                         STEPHEN
          What you. whistlin', girl?
          Broomhilda stops whistling and spins surprised in Stephen's direction.

                         STEPHEN
          What was you whistlin'?

                         BROOMHILDA
          Oh nuttin'.

                         STEPHEN
          You weren't whistlin' nothin', you were
          whistlin' somethin'. What'cha whistlin'?

                         BROOMHILDA
          I dunno. Somethin' I heard. I don't know
          no.name.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         )/Z

                         STEPHEN
          It's kinder pretty.
          She doesn't say anything in return.

                         STEPHEN
          That was a compliment.

                         BROOMHILDA
          Thank you.
          Stephen steps out of the shadows into the light closer to Broomhilda.

                         STEPHEN
          I'm just sayin', two days ago you wus' in
          such misery here, you hadda run off. So you
          run off, we catch your ass an' drag you back.
          Then we stick your bare ass to sizzle in
          The Hot Box for' 'bout ten hours. Now here
          you are two days later, whistlin' while you
          work. I'm just sayin', I.wouldn' think you'd
          have a hellva lot to whistle 'bout.
          .I'm jus' sayin'.
          He watches the effect his words have on Broomhilda's face.

                         BROOMHILDA
          I'm done here, may I be excused?

                         STEPHEN
          Yes you may.
          She moves off to another part of the house.
          He watches her shuffle off.

          INT - DINING ROOM (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
          Later that evening, Django and a lot of other white people (Calvin
          Candie, Lara Lee, Moguy, and Dr.Schultz) sat around the dinner table.
          They are being served by the black people we've come to know at
          Candyland (Stephen, Cora, and because Dr.Schultz likes her Broomhilda).
          Along with an army of DOMESTIC SLAVES acting as wait service.
          Knowing Django's a slaver, and for his dinner table privileges, the
          Domestic Slaves despise Django.
          Even Broomhilda will be shocked to hear him speak like a slaver, even
          though they obviously gave her a heads up on their masquerade.
          We pick up the conversation in mid-negotiation.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          "5.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Look Monsieur Candle, they were all fine
          specimens, no doubt about it. But the
          best three, by far, were Sampson, Goldie,
          and Eskimo Joe. - By the way, why's he
          called Eskimo Joe?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Oh you never know how these nigger nicknames
          get started. His name was Joe-...maybe one
          day he said he was cold.. .who knows?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Irregardless, we all know Samson's your
          best, and you'll never sell him and I can
          see why, he's a champion.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          All three are champions.
          Django contradicts, as he chews his steak;

                         DJANGO
          Samson's the champion. The other two
          are pretty good.
          All the Domestic Slaves around the table STIFFEN at witnessing Django
          contradict Calvin Candie.
          Including Broomhilda, who's wielding the Gravy Boat. After Django says
          that, while in shock, she over pours beef gravy on Lara Lee's mashed
          potatoes.

                         LARA LEE
          Hildi!
          Broomhilda snaps back.
          Instead of getting angry, Candle seems to reflect on that analysis,
          then issues his own appraisal;

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Can Eskimo Joe whip Sampson, no. Can he
          take Goldie, probably not - Goldie's the
          best dirty fightin' nigger I ever saw. But as
          long as you don't put 'em up against those
          two., Eskimo Joe will whip any niggers ass.

                         DJANGO
          Maybe.
          The Domestics FREEZE for a jerky second when Django says that.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         //

                         F
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          You must understand, Monsieur Candie, while
          admittedly a .neophyte in the nigger fight
          game, I do have a bit of a background in
          the European traveling circus. Hence, I
          have big ideas when it comes to presentation.
          I need something more then just a big nigger.
          He needs to have panache. A sense of showmanship.
          I want to be able to . bill. him as. The Black Hercules.
          I said., and I quote; "I would pay top dollar
          for the, right nigger." Now I'm not saying
          Eskimo Joe is the wrong nigger - per se ...
          but is he right as rain ... ?
          Everyone waits for Calvin's response. He milks the moment by taking a
          sip of his mint julep, then says;

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Dr.Schultz, i will have you know, there
          is no one in the nigger fight game that
          appreciates the value of showmanship
          more then, Monsieur Calvin J. Candie. But
          one must not forget the most important
          thing in the nigger fight game.

                         (BEAT)
          A nigger that can win fights. That should
          be your first, second, third, four, and
          fifth concern. After you have that, and
          you know you have that, then, you can
          start to implement a grande design. But
          since I enjoy oldest man 'at the table
          status - beating Moguy by one year for
          that honor allow the old sage to advise,
          first things first.
          Broomhilda comes around with a bowl of string green beans.
          Dr.Schultz says something pleasant to her in German..
          She smiles, and says something pleasant back.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          I see you two gettin' on?
          Dr.Schultz breaks into a wide grin;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          .Famously.

                         (DRAMATIC PAUSE)
          Monsieur Candie, you can't imagine what
          it's like not to hear you native tongue
          for four years.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Hell, I can't imagine two weeks in Boston.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         Â»5
          Everybody at the table chuckles.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I can't express the joy I felt conversing
          in my mother tongue. And Broomhilda is a
          charming conversation companion.
          As Broomhilda holds the bowl of green beans for Moguy, Lara Lee notices
          how Django and Broomhilda look and try not to look at each other.
          Stephen enters the room with a fresh mint julep for Monsieur Candie.

                         LARA LEE
          I don't know doctor, you can lay on all
          the German sweet talk you want, but it
          looks like this ponys got big eyes for
          Django.
          Lara Lee has no idea how right she is, but when she said it, all three,
          Django, Broomhilda, and Schultz, involuntarily jerk.

          AND ...
          .STEPHEN sees it.
          Schultz covers the jerk with more of his verbal gobbilty gook.
          Except for Stephen, no one else was the wiser.
          Broomhilda takes her greenbeans and leaves the dining room for the
          kitchen.
          Stephen watches her go, then looks at Django, then hands Candie his
          mint julep, and goes into a broad routine for the table's benefit.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Stephen, you're amazing. I haven't finished
          a drink in this house in twenty years.

                         STEPHEN
          When a man likes a cold drink, a man likes
          a COLD drink.
          Chuckle... . chuckle...

                         CALVIN CANDIE

          me spending two weeks in Boston

                         (MOCK INDIGNANT)
          You don't have any idea the work I do
          to see food gets on the table.

          nothin' better to do then listen in here

                         (MOCK INDIGNATION)
          What? They laughed!

                         STEPHEN
          Of course they laughed, their parents
          raised them right. When they're a guest
          in somebody's house, and the master of
          of the house thinks he's- funny, you
          suppose to laugh. They'd be rude not to.
          Chuckle... .chuckle...
          They play their little comedy routine for all it's worth.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          No it was really funny,

                         (TO TABLE)
          wasn't it?

                         STEPHEN
          Now what do you expect these people to
          say? What you need to do is stop
          embarrassing your guest.

                         (TO TABLE)
          Everybody don't laugh at him, you're being
          polite, I understand, you mean well, but
          it just encourages him.
          Chuckle-chuckle...
          As the white folks chuckle, Stephen moves back into the kitchen.

          TNT - KITCHEN (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
          Once Stephen enters the kitchen, his smile melts away, and he locks
          eyes on Broomhilda. He moves over to her.

                         STEPHEN
          You know that nigger?
          /ï¿½ She spins around.

          She shakes her head, no.
          Stephen looks at her skeptical.

          Okay, if you say so.

                         DJANGO
          Eskimo Joe's a quality nigger, no doubt
          about it. But if it was my money, I
          wouldn't pay twelve thousand dollars
          for him.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          What would your price be?

                         DJANGO
          Well, if I ,was inclined to be generous,.
          and I don't know why I would be inclined
          to be generous... . nine thousand ... . maybe.
          Candie's lawyer chimes in.

                         MOGUY

          one thousand dollars.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Precisely Bright Boy, good on ya. Any way
          you cut that cake, that spells profit.
          Not to, mention a years worth of action at
          the big table in a blood sport with a
          winner nigger. However let me reclarify
          how this whole negotiation came about.
          It wasn't me who came to you to sell a
          nigger, it was you who approached me to
          buy one. Now that nine thousand dollar
          figure Bright Boy was banding about,
          ain't too far off from right. And if I
          wanted to sell Eskimo Joe for that, I
          could sell 'em any day of the week.
          But like you said in Greenville doctor,
          I don't wanna sell 'em. It was only your
          ridiculous offer of twelve thousand
          dollars that would make me consider it.
          Dr.Schultz considers'Calvin Candie's words, then suddenly says;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          You know Monsieur Candie... . you do possess
          the power of persuasion.
          Candie smiles at that remark.
          Then SUDDENLY Schultz SLAPS the table hard with his hand, and says;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Why not! Monsieur Candie, you have a deal,
          Eskimo Joe, twelve thousand dollars!
          The White people at the table get very happy.
          Dr.Schultz continues;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          However, that is a tremendous amount of
          money. And the way you have your Mr.Moguy,
          I have a lawyer, a persnickety man named
          Tuttle. And I would need my man to draw
          up a legal contract before I would feel
          comfortable exchanging that amount of
          money for flesh. Not to mention having
          Eskimo Joe examined by a physician of my
          choosing. So say I return in about five
          days time with my Mr.Tuttle. And then my
          Mr.Tuttle and your Mr.Moguy can hash out
          the finer points between themselves.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Splendid.

                         (CALLING TO

                         THE KITCHEN)
          Stephen, time for dessert!
          Stephen, Cora, Broomhilda, and the other Domestics come out of the
          kitchen to clear away the dirty dishes.
          Broomhilda goes to Calvin.

                         BROOMHILDA
          Can I take away your dishes, Monsieur Candle?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Yes you may, Hildi.
          She begins gathering the dirty dishes.
          Candie looks up at her as she works.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          So Hildi, how you like servin at the big
          table in the big house?

                         BROOMHILDA
          I like it a lot Monsieur Candle.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          It's a lot better then sizzling in that
          hot box, or draggin' your ass through a
          bramble bush, ain't it?

                         BROOMHILDA
          Yes 'em.
          With Candie interrogating Broomhilda, Django tenses up.
          Stephen clocks this.
          Stephen decides to test Django's reaction.

                         STEPHEN
          You know Monsieur Candle, the doctor might
          be interested in seein' Hildi's "peeled"
          back. Seein' as he don't see many niggers
          where he from.

                         CALVIN CANDIE

                         (TO SCHULTZ)
          When you was alone with Hildi here, didja
          just speak German, or did ya git her
          clothes off?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          !20
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          We just spoke.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          So you haven't seen her back?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          No I haven't.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Then Stephen's right, you would probably
          find this interesting. Hildi, take off
          your dress, and show us your back.
          Django hears this.
          Broomhilda instinctively shoots a look to Django.
          Stephen clocks it.

                         LARA LEE
          Calvin, I just got her all dressed up
          and looking nice.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          But Lara Lee, Dr.Schultz is from Dusseldorf,
          they don't got niggers there. And he's a
          man of medicine. I'm sure it would
          fascinate him, the niggers endurance for
          pain. I mean Hildi got something like
          fifteen lashes on her back. Lara Lee get
          one, she'd lose her mind. These niggers
          are tough, no doubt about it.

                         LARA LEE
          Calvin, we are eating - dessert, no less.
          Ain't no one wanna see her whipped up back.
          Django continues to watching this play out.
          Stephen watches him.
          Candie folds.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Okay okay Lara. Maybe after dinner.
          During the brandies.
          Broomhilda - dismissed - takes Calvin's dishes and heads back into the
          kitchen.
          Stephen takes one more look at Django, and follows Broomhilda behind
          the kitchen door.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         121

          INT - KITCHEN (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
          In the kitchen with the OTHER DOMESTICS, Stephen says to Broomhilda;

                         STEPHEN
          I thought you said you didn't know him?
          Broomhilda turns around.

                         BROOMHILDA
          Huh?
          Stephen approaches her, the other Domestics get quiet and watch.

                         STEPHEN
          I said, you said, you didn't know him?

                         BROOMHILDA
          I don't.

                         STEPHEN
          Yes you do.

                         BROOMHILDA
          Mister Stephen, I don't.

                         STEPHEN
          Why you lyin to me?
          As tears begin to well in her eyes.

                         BROOMBILDA
          I ain't.

                         STEPHEN
          Why you cryin'?

                         BROOMHILDA
          Because you're scarin' me.

                         STEPHEN
          Why am I scarin' you?

                         BROOMHILDA
          Because you're scary.
          Things have become so tense and quiet in the kitchen, that the dinner
          table conversation begins to bleed inside.
          We hear Dr.Schultz in the next room say;
          Dr.SCHULTZ (OS)
          .to speak German,with Hildi this
          afternoon was positively soul enriching.
          Stephen hears this, he's starting to get the idea.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         1ZL
          His eyes to to Broomhilda.

                         STEPHEN
          You, stay in the kitchen.
          Stephen moves to the kitchen door, swings it open, and watches
          Dr.Schultz prepare to proposition Candie for Broomhilda. Stephen knows
          these two jokers (Django and Schultz) are up to something, and now he's
          just figured it out.

          INT - DINNER TABLE (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          You indicated earlier you would be
          willing to part with Hildi?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Yes siree bob I did.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well in that case allow me to propose
          another proposition?
          In full "Ole Jimmie" performance, Stephen BARGES in the room,
          INTERRUPTING Dr.Schultz.

                         STEPHEN
          - Monsieur Candie?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Stephen, you just interrupted Dr.Schultz.

                         STEPHEN
          (to Dr.Schultz)
          Oh, I do apologize, doctor. My hearin'
          ain't worth a damn these days.

                         (TO CANDIE)
          Monsieur Candie, I need a word with you in
          the kitchen.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What, you mean get outta my chair?

                         STEPHEN
          If you could manage it. It's about dessert.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What about dessert?

                         STEPHEN
          I would rather tell you in private.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          We're having rhubarb pie, what sort of
          melodrama could be brewing back there?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         123
          Stephen bends down and whispers in his ear;

                         STEPHEN
          Meet me in the library.
          Well that's a horse of a different color. That means whatever Stephen
          has to say, hasn't anything to do with rhubarb pie. "Meet me in the
          library" is their secret signal.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Fine friend Stephen, I'll be along momentarily.
          Stephen exits.
          Candie stands up from his chair and addresses the table.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Well as you can see, talented no doubt as
          they are in the kitchen, from time to
          time, adult supervision is required.
          If you'll excuse me a moment.
          Candie exits.

          TNT - LIBRARY (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
          A masculine sanctuary for Calvin Candie. Walls of perfectly bound
          books. Stuffed animal heads (deer, boar) that he's shot, sit mounted on
          the walls. There's comfy red leather chairs and a bar in the globe.
          When WE CUT TO this room, we cut to Stephen sitting in one of the red
          leather chairs, drinking a brandy out of a brandy sifter.
          Calvin enters the room, sees Stephen sitting in the chair, drinking his
          brandy, and doesn't bat an eye. It appears, in this room, Calvin's and
          Stephen's life long friendship exits on a different plane. Outside of
          outside eyes, in this room, all pretense of master and slave is
          dropped, and the number one and number two.. men of Candyland can talk
          turkey.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What's the matter?

                         STEPHEN
          Those motherfuckers ain't here to buy no
          mandingos. They want that girl. -

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What the hell you talkin' about?

                         STEPHEN
          They playin your ass for a fool, that's
          what I'm talkin' bout. They ain't here
          for no muscle bound Jimmie, they here for
          that girl.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What girl, Hildi?

                         STEPHEN
          Yeah, Hildi. The niggers know each other.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          He just bought Eskimo Joe.

                         STEPHEN
          Did he give you any money?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Well not yet, but -

                         STEPHEN
          - Then he didn't R ..Y diddly, not yet no
          how. But he was just about to buy, who he
          came here to buy, when I interrupted him.
          Thank you Stephen - you're welcome Calvin.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Where you gettin' all this? Why would they
          go through all that trouble, to. buy a
          nigger with a chewed up back, ain't worth
          five hundred dollars?

                         STEPHEN
          Well they're doin' it cause Django's in
          love with Hildi. She's probably his wife.
          Now why that German gives a fuck about
          who that uppity son-of-a--bitch is in love
          with, I'm sure I don't know.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          If she's who they want, why the whole
          snake oil pitch about mandingos?

                         STEPHEN
          Because you wouldn't pay no never mind
          to four hundred dollar. But twelve
          thousand got you real friendly.
          Calvin thinks ...
          .as per usual, Stephen's right.

                         CALVIN CANDIE

          fix their wagon but good! Stephen, we
          .gonna have us a Candyland tar and
          feathering!

                         STEPHEN
          Now Calvin.. .not that I wouldn't enjoy
          seein' something like that ... . but why
          don't you sit down and let's talk about this.

                         CALVIN CANDLE
          I let a goddamn nigger and nigger lovin'
          huckster insinuate themselves at my
          dinner table, and play this whole goddamn
          plantation for a fool!

                         STEPHEN
          Calm-the-fuck-down, sit down, and let's
          discuss this.
          A frustrated Calvin finally collapses in the chair.

                         STEPHEN
          Now look, you knew, and I knew, there
          was something up with these two. We just
          didn't know what. But now we do. They
          don't want you to know how bad they want
          that girl. But these ole boys have rode
          a lotta miles, went t6 a whole lotta
          trouble, and done spread a whole lotta
          bull to get this girl. They must want her
          mighty bad. Way I see it, ain't nothin'
          changed. They wanna buy a nigger, you
          wanna sell a nigger.The only thing done
          changed is the advantage.

                         (BEAT)
          Now we got it. .So let's go back in there
          and busts these motherfucker's chops.

          INT - DINING ROOM (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
           The Dinner Table Guests listen to Lara Lee'Candie-Fitzwilly hold court
          melodramatically ... . Till ... . Calvin Candie enters the room from the
          kitchen door.
          Lara Lee, oblivious to her brothers change in demeanor, blurts out upon

                         SEEING HIM;

                         LARA LEE
          There you are! I was beginning to think
          you and that of crow ran off together.
          Schultz and Django feel the change in their host's demeanor, as he
          stares down the table at them.

                         CALVIN CANDLE
          That'd be a hellva note, wouldn't it
          Lara Lee?

          Would you be a dear and go out there and
          give them gals an eyeball. That of boy
          knows everything to know 'bout mandingos,
          But he don't know diddly 'bout black puddin'.
          Lara Lee excuses herself and leaves the room, as she goes out,
          Bartholomew, with his Sawed Off Shotgun, comes.in behind Schultz and
          Django.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Can I ask you two gentlemen to look over
          your shoulder?
          Schultz and Django do, and see Bartholomew with his sawed off shotgun
          pointing at them.
          Calvin Candie removes his arm from behind his back, and in his hand
          he's holding a big ugly hammer.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Now lay your palms flat on the table top.
          They put their palms on the table.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Now you lift those palms off that turtle
          shell table top, Bartholomew gonna let
          loose with both barrels of that sawed off.
          There's been a lotta lies said around this
          table tonight-but that.. .you can believe.

                         (BEAT)
          Mr.Moguy, would you be so kind as to collect
          the pistols hangin' on those boys'hips?
          Mr.Moguy does.
          Holding the hammer in his hand, Candie continues to hold court.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Now where were we? Oh yes, I do believe you
          were just getting ready to make me a
          proposition to buy Broomhilda. Right?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Right.

                         CALVIN CANDIE

                         (YELLING TO

                         STEPHEN)
          Stephen! Bring out Hildi!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Ix?
          Stephen enters the dining room through the kitchen door, holding
          roughly in his grip, Broomhilda. He holds a small Derringer pistol
          against the side of her head.
          Django and Schultz react.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Now it should be quite clear by now I know
          you're not here to buy no mandingos.
          Reason y'all came to Candyland, is y'all
          want Broomhilda. But y'all don't want me
          to know how much you want 'er. So instead,
          you waste my time with all this Eskimo Joe
          horseshit.

                         (TO STEPHEN)
          Stephen, put her in that chair.
          Stephen sits the young lady down in Moguy's old chair.
          With their palms against the table, unarmed, Django and Schultz
          silently watch Candie's next move.
          Candie, still holding the hammer, continues.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Now the way I see it, ain't nothin' changed..
          You still wanna buy a nigger, I still wanna
          sell one. So, with that in mind, in Greenville,
          Dr.Schultz, you yourself said, "For the Right
          Nigger you'd be willing to pay what some would
          consider a ridiculous amount." To which, me
          myself said, "What is your definition of
          ridiculous?" To which you said, "Twelve
          thousand dollars."
          Now considering you two have ridden a whole
          lotta miles, went to a whole lotta trouble,
          and done spread a whole lotta bull, to
          purchase the lovely lady to my left, it would
          appear that Broomhilda is, "The Right Nigger."
          And if y'all wanna leave Candyland with
          Broomhilda, the price is twelve thousand dollars.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I take it you prefer the take it or leave
          it style of negotiating.
          Candie continuing to hold the hammer continues.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Under the laws of Chickasaw County,
          Broomhilda is my property. And I can do
          anything with my property I so desire.
          He brings the big hammer down hard on the dinner table, making
          everybody jump.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         IN

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          And if you think my price for this nigger
          is too steep, what I'm gonna desire to do
          is, take this hammer and beat her ass to
          death with it. Right in front of both y'all.
          He SMASHES the arm rest of the chair Broomhilda's sitting in.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Put up or shut up, Schultz. You wanna save
          this nigger bitch, you gonna pay my price.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          May I lift my hands from the table top in
          order to remove my billfold?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Yes you may.
          Dr.Schultz removes his long brown leather billfold from his gray suit
          jacket, and says;,
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Easy come, easy go.
          He slides the billfold down the table to Candie. The plantation owner
          takes out the money, does a quick count, then looks down the table at
          the seated Schultz, and says;

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Pleasure doin' business with you.

                         TIME CUT

          INT - DINING ROOM (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
          INSERT: Calvin signing over Broomhilda's BILL OF SALE.
          .Moguy signs as a witness.
          Broomhilda stands next to Django, and watches her Master sign her
          freedom papers.
          Dr.Schultz sits off by himself. He's very disturbed.
          All the white people with Calvin Candie are happy and celebrate
          Candie's successes with glasses of Brandy. Lara Lee, Ace Woody, and
          Brown and Cody have joined the' celebration.
          For an experienced horsetrader, the just concluded transaction is a
          thing of legend. He just sold a Pony, with a tore up back, and a
          runaway "r" burned in her cheek - ain't worth five hundred
          dollars- for twelve thousand.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Stephen smiles and laughs it up with everybody else.
          The Other domestics bring out little plates of rhubarb pie, and buzz
          around pouring coffee for the white people.
          Candie walks over to the seated Schultz, he carries a small plate of
          rhubarb pie with him.

                         CALVIN CANDIE

                         (TO SCHULTZ)
          Rhubarb pie?
          Schultz looks at the pie and the man.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          No.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Are you brooding 'bout me getting the best
          of ya?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Actually, I was thinking of that poor
          devil you fed to the dogs today, D'Artagnan.
          And I was wondering what Dumas would make of
          all this.
          Calvin hands the doctor the two pieces of paper he needs. Broomhilda's
          bill of sale, and her freedom papers. As he says the following he
          examines he papers.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Dumas...?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Alexander Dumas. He wrote "The Three Musketeers."
          I figured you must be an admirer. You named
          your slave after that novel's lead character.
          If Alexander Dumas had been there today, I
          wonder what he would of made of it?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You doubt he'd approve?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes his approval would be a dubious proposition
          at best.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Soft hearted Frenchy?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Alexander Dumas is black.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         1 30
          Schultz rises, puts the papers in his back pocket, .looks to his two
          companions, Django and Broomhilda, and says;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          We got it, let's go.

                         (TO CANDIE)
          Normally Monsieur Candie, I would say,
          auf wiedersehen. But since what auf wiedersehen
          actually means is, till I see you again,
          and since I never wish to see you again,
          to you sir, I say, goodbye.
          Schultz begins to cross the room towards the exit.
          When Calvin says to the German's back;

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          One more moment, Doc!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          What?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          It's a custom here in the South, once a
          business deal is concluded, for the two
          parties to shake hands. It implies good
          faith.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I'm not from the South.
          He turns to leave.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You're in my house, doctor, I'm afraid
          I must insist.
          This turns Schultz around.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Insist what...? That I shake your hand
          before I leave? Then I'm afraid I must
          insist in the opposite direction.
          Calvin walks closer to the German doctor.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You know what I think you are?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          What you think I am? No I don't.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          1310,

                         CALVIN CANDLE
          I think you are a bad loser.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          And I think you're an abysmal winner.

                         CALVIN CANDLE
          Never the less, here in Chickasaw County
          a deal ain't done till the two parties have
          shook hands. Even after all this paper
          signin', don't mean shit you don't shake my hand.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          If I don't shake your hand, you're gonna throw
          away twelve thousand dollars...?
          I don't think so.
          Schultz looks to Django and Broomhilda.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Let's go.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Bartholomew, if she tries to leave here
          before this German shakes my hand.
          Cut 'er down.
          Schultz looks to Django... . then to Candle..
          .and then with a smile on his face, and a twinkle in his eye, asks

                         CANDLE;
          Dr.SCHULTZ.
          You really want me to shake your hand?
          Django gets it.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          I insist.

                         DR
          -Schultz smiles.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well, if you insist.
          Django goes to stop him...

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         1 714
          The German crosses toward Candie, offering him his hand...
          Candie offers his hand to Schultz...
          The small DERRINGER POPS into Schultz's outstretched hand...

          POP!
          He SHOOTS CALVIN CANDIE in the heart.
          Candie has a look of shock as blood explodes from his heart, and he
          falls to the floor.
          Everybody is stunned.
          Schultz looks to Django.
          Django looks back.
          Dr.SCHULTZ

                         (TO DJANGO)
          I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.
          Dr.SCHULTZ is BLOWN APART by Bartholomew's SAWED OFF SHOTGUN.
          The room comes to its senses and attacks Django and Broomhilda.

          FADE TO BLACK

                         

                         

                         

                         
          We FADE UP FROM BLACK to see:
          The soles of Django's bare feet. A rope is tied around the ankles, and
          it's obvious he's been strung up, upside down.
          The CAMERA moves down his naked body, down his legs (we see his wrists
          are'bound with ropes to his thigh), down his bare buttocks, down his
          whip scarred back, to the back of his head which hovers just about
          three inches from the barn yard wooden floor.

          INT - BARN - AFTERNOON
          Eight year old stable boy, Timmy, wipes the unconscious Django's face
          with a wet rag. They are all alone in the barn.
          Django begins to come to ...

                         TIMMY

                         (SHHH'S HIM)
          Act like you still sleepin'.

                         DJANGO
          Where's Broomhilda?

                         TIMMY
          Who?

                         DJANGO
          Hildi, the slave girl that ran away a
          couple of days ago. They had her in The
          Hot Box.

                         TIMMY
          I don't know 'bout no girl.

                         DJANGO
          How 'bout that German white man I came
          here with?

                         TIMMY
          Oh he's dead. His body's over there.
          Django twists upside down on the rope, and sees the corpse of his
          friend King Schultz dead on the filthy barn yard floor. The sight of
          the lifeless carcass of the doctor fills Django with pain and anger.
          Just then head overseer Ace Woody walks in the barn.
          Upon seeing Ace, Timmy hightails it out of there, Ace throws an empty
          bucket at the fleeing boy.

                         ACE WOODY
          Git on outta here, boy!

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         133
          Django, slightly..swaying to and fro from the rope, looks upside down
          at Ace Woody, all dressed up in a black suit with a string tie, which
          makes him look a bit like Wyatt Earp.

                         ACE WOODY
          So y'all bounty hunters,.huh?
          Django thinks, "How does he know?"

                         ACE WOODY
          I knew there was something fishy 'bout, y'all.
          We found your wanted posters and book of figures
          in your saddle bags. I gotta say, ain't never
          heard of no black bounty hunter before. A black
          boy paid to kill white men? How did ya like that
          line of work?
          Django retorts, upside down.

                         DJANGO
          Well, it turns out I was a natural.
          Ace woody laughs.

                         ACE WOODY
          Boy, people 'round here are cross wit you.
          Ace Woody pulls up a tiny milking stool, and sits down on it, a body
          length from the hanging man.

                         ACE WOODY
          See Boss Man was a rather beloved figure
          'round here. Now he's dead as fried chicken,
          everyone 'round here blames you.
          Ace Woody opens his black suit jacket, we see not only does he wear a
          gun and holster around his waist, he carries a HUGE BOWIE KNIFE ina
          shoulder holster. He removes the big blade from its sheath.

                         ACE WOODY
          Yep, Boss Man's gone. Poor Calvin. Poor
          goddamn Calvin. We're burnin' him in a few
          hours. At sunset. Should be real pretty.
          However ... . I don't think you're gonna be
          able to attend.
          Ace takes the Bowie Knife and THROWS IT...
          . IT LANDS stuck in the wooden barn yard floor, four inches from
          Django's face.
          Ace Woody slowly rises up from the tiny milking stool, and slowly walks
          the length of the floor between him and Django, pulls the blade out of
          the floor, and walks back to his stool, and sits back down.
          As he does this, he says;

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         ACE WOODY
          Now I understand you didn't really have
          nuttin' to do wit it. It's that German
          sunbitch the trouble maker. You just wanted
          to git your girl, and hightail your nigger
          asses outta here. Now I appreciate that.
          But grieving folks 'round here need someone
          to blame. And I guess they figure if you
          hadn't brought your black ass 'round here
          in the first place, Boss Man still be alive.
          And you know what, they got a point.
          He THROWS the knife again...
          .this time IT LANDS in the floor two inches from Django's face.
          He walks the same path from the knife and back to the tiny stool.
          As he does he says;

                         ACE WOODY
          Now when it comes to making a nigger regret
          the error of his ways, believe me when I.
          tell you, I know every goddamn trick in the
          book. Now there's a lotta ass busters out
          there try an' git creative with the way they
          bust ass. But me... .I always found the best
          methods are, tried and true.
          He THROWS the knife again...
          Django JERKS his head back ...
          .and the knife LANDS in the floor, right where Django's head was.
          Ace Woody stands up, walks the floor to the Bowie, yanks it out of the
          wood., and straightens up, standing right beside the hanging upside down
          naked black man. Ace talks confidentially to the bound man at his
          mercy.

                         ACE WOODY
          You know Blackie, here at Candyland, I had
          me a real sweet deal. These last eleven years
          training Calvin's mandingos I made me more
          money I made my whole goddamn life.
          And no end in sight, neither.

                         (BEAT)
          Then you came along. Knocked me right off
          that perch I was sittin' pretty on. You think
          Miss Lara gonna be as.interested in
          mandingos as her brother?
          Uuummmm...I don't think so. What I think,
          is you done fucked up my good thang.
          So when it comes to you, Django boy, you
          could say I gotta axe to grind.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         IJS
          He grabs a handfull of Django's genitals in his fist. He takes his big
          Bowie, and places the razor sharp BLADE against Django's nut sack.
          Django dances at the end of the rope like live bait on a fishing pole.

                         ACE WOODY
          How's the blade of that Bowie feel against
          your ball sack, Blackie? A Bowie right off
          the wet stone. Now that's what I call sharp.
          Django dances some more ...

                         ACE WOODY
          Yep nigger, I'm gonna snip them nuts.

                         (BREATH)
          On the count of three.

                         DJANGO SCREAMS:

                         DJANGO

          NO!!!!

                         ACE WOODY

          ONE ...

                         DJANGO

          NO DON'T DO IT!!!!!

                         ACE WOODY
          Got to do it, boy. TWO...

                         DJANGO

          NO!!!! !
          Just then Stephen appears in the entrance of the barn/blacksmith
          facility. He's holding Django's clothes in a bundle under his arm.

                         STEPHEN
          Cap't, Miss Lara lookin' for you. She wanna
          talk about the Old Man's funeral.
          Oh, and she changed her mind 'bout snippin'
          Django. She gonna give 'em to the LeQuint
          Dickey people.
          While still keeping a firm grip on Django's'junk, Ace Woody says;

                         ACE WOODY
          Well she didn't waste a minute tellin' me.
          Ace Woody looks down at Django, both men get over the aborted emotion
          of what almost happened.

                         ACE WOODY

                         (TO DJANGO)
          How disappointing.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         171

                         ACE WOODY

                         (TO STEPHEN)
          Where she at?

                         STEPHEN
          She in the big house. The kitchen.
          Ace turns to leave, Stephen goes over to a big fiery furnace in the
          blacksmith barn, and begins poking a LONG POKER which lies buried in
          the fire.
          Django's clothes are dumped by the furnace.

                         ACE WOODY
          You gonna look after our friend?
          As, he plays with the poker in the fire, he says;

                         STEPHEN
          Oh yes sirree Bob, you know I am!
          01' Snowball and a certain naked ass
          upside down nigger we both know, gonna
          have us a big of chat.
          He removes the big black poker from the furnaces fire, it's RED HOT END

          GLOWS ORANGE.

                         STEPHEN
          Snowballs just makin' sure his talking
          stick is all nice and FROSTY.
          Ace Woody chuckles to himself as he exits the barn.
          Just Stephen with a red hot poker, and naked, bound upside down Django,
          alone.
          With the red hot poker in his hand Snowball approaches the naked
          hanging Django.

                         STEPHEN
          I bet you an' that German thought y'all was
          on easy street for awhile - didn't ya?
          Y'all track Hildi to the Old Man.
          You get the idea to go to Greenville -
          look up the Ole Man there.

                         (BREATH)
          That was a good idea. I bet y'all couldn't
          believe how easy it was. You meet Moguy, he
          buys your horseshit. Ya' git your ass invited
          to Candyland, no fuss no muss. Ya' ride the
          whole way to the plantation, no one the wiser.
          Then ya' ride in to Candyland - ride your
          goddamn horses right up to the motherfucking
          Big House.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         137

                         STEPHEN

                         (BEAT)
          And that's where you met me. And that's when
          you knew your goose was cooked.
          He TOUCHES Django's NIPPLE with the ORANGE HOT TIP of the poker.
          Unlike a lot of movie hero's, Django doesn't take torture silently and
          stoically. This shit fucking hurts, so you best believe he screams his
          fucking ass off, and twists in agony when he gets touched by the orange
          tip of that red hot poker.

                         STEPHEN
          Now that fancy talkin' white man of yours
          didn't know what's what. He still thought his
          ass hadda chance. But like the One-Eyed Charly
          you are, you always know the end is near
          'fore the white folks.
          With the ORANGE HOT poker, he BURNS OFF Django's other NIPPLE.
          The smell of burned flesh smokes in the air. Stephen makes a show of
          breathing it in his nostrils.

                         STEPHEN
          Damn Nigger, you smell good.
          He walks behind Django with the poker.

                         STEPHEN
          You know, when you was sittin' on that feather
          bed in the quest room in the Big House -
          After you slapped my ass to the floor
          You were sayin' something 'bout my BARE BLACK
          ass, and how you were gonna BUST IT.
          Remember that, Bright Boy?
          He places the HOT ORANGE END OF THE POKER hard against Django's BARE
          buttocks.
          Django SCREAMS!
          Stephen LAUGHS.
          Stephen walks away and sticks the poker back in the fire. He goes
          through Django's clothes and pulls out his tan pants. He tosses them on
          the floor by the hanging man.

                         STEPHEN
          You leavin', that's what you can take
          with you.
          Stephen walks over to the hanging upside down man, and as he talks to
          him, he begins fondling Django's genitals.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         I31

                         STEPHEN
          Now you were quite the topic of conversation
          for the last few hours. Seemed like folks
          never had a bright idea in their life, was
          comin' up with different ways to kill your
          ASS. Now most of 'dem ideas involved fuckin
          wit your fun parts. But while that might SEEM
          like a good idea. Truth is, once ya snip a
          niggers nuts, most bleed out. Then I say;
          "Hells bells, the niggers we send to LeQuint
          Dickey, got it worse then that." Then they're,
          "Let's whip 'em to death," "Throw 'em to the
          mandingos," "Feed 'em to Stonesipher's dogs."
          And then I say, "What's so special 'bout that?
          We do that shit all the time. Hells bells,
          the niggers we send to LeQuint Dickey got it
          worse then that."
          He stops massaging Django's balls.

                         STEPHEN
          So Miss Lara got the bright idea of givin'
          your ass to The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company.
          And as a slave of The LeQuint Dickey Mining
          Company, hence forth, till the day you die,
          you will be swinging a sledgehammer, all day,
          every day, turning big rocks into little rocks.
          And trust me when I tell you it's gonna be
          'bout as much fun as it sounds. We sell 'em
          the mandingos ain't good for nuttin' no more.
          Like them three y'all came back with. For them
          big garboons we get twenty a piece. They last
          'bout six months. Skinny nigger like you,
          I give two or three.
          Stephen turns to leave.

                         DJANGO
          Where's Broomhilda?

                         STEPHEN
          She's all right for now. Miss Lara
          soft hearted on 'er. She gave her
          to Billy Crash. He was sweet on 'er.
          Now Billy Crash might not look or
          smell too good, but ain't nobody
          gonna bother her.
          Stephen limps away.

                         CUT TO

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         137

          EXT - CANDYLAND - AFTERNOON
          The Caravan coming from The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company comes riding
          up to the plantation. It comes equipped with one CAGE WAGON (from a
          prison), ONE white trash PECKAWOOD named FLOYD to drive the wagon, a
          2nd white trash PECKAWOOD named ROY to ride lead horse, and a white
          trash PECKAWOOD named JANO to bring up the rear riding horses ass, plus
          a pack horse that carries dynamite for the mine.
          The three peckawoods, who all talk with thick Australian accents, have
          stopped the caravan and are having a powwow.

                         ROY
          It's chaos 'round here. Some bastard shot
          the big boss. Let's git the niggers and
          git out.
          The Three mandingos who weren't sold in Greenville, Rodney, Chicken
          Charly, and Chester are walked to the wagon by overseers Tommy Giles.
          and Broomhilda's new owner Billy Crash. All three slaves carry the
          bundles of personal belongings they've had since Greenville. Chester
          wears a hat, and Chicken Charly has a corncob pipe in his mouth.
          The wagon driver, Floyd, approaches them.

                         FLOYD
          You blacks line up.
          They do.

                         FLOYD
          What's your names?

                         CHESTER
          Chester.

                         CHICKEN CHARLY
          Chicken Charly.

                         RODNEY
          Rodney.

                         FLOYD
          I'm.Floyd, this is Roy, and that's Jano.

                         (POINTING AT

                         CHESTER'S BUNDLE)
          What's that?

                         CHESTER
          It's my stuff.

                         FLOYD
          Throw it in the dirt.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         1 40
          All three throw their only belongings in the dirt. Floyd takes the'hat
          off of Chester's head and sails it away. As well as ripping the
          corncob pipe out of Chicken Charly's mouth and tossing it in the dirt.

                         FLOYD
          (to Chicken Charly)
          You won't be doin' much smokin' mate.
          (to all three)
          You are now the property of The LeQuint
          Dickey Mining Company. Git in the cage.
          This is going to be worse then the three even thought. They climb into
          the cage wagon. Floyd locks it behind them.
          Roy, the head Aussie, pays Billy Crash for the slaves, when we hear Ace
          Woody call out;

          ACE WOODY (OS)
          Hold on, we got another hammer swinger
          for ya.
          Ace Woody comes walking out of the barn with Django, shirtless and
          barefoot (just like we met him at beginning of the story), wearing his
          old tan pants, and his wrists bound by a rope.

                         ROY
          We can't use that skinny bastard.

                         ACE WOODY
          We got an arraignment with Mr.Dickey to take
          punishment niggers from time to time.

                         ROY
          No one tole' me 'bout no arraignment.

                         ACE WOODY
          Well if Mr.Dickey ain't takin' you into his
          confidence, I'm sure I don't know why.

                         ROY
          Look, no one tole' me 'bout -

                         ACE WOODY
          - No, you look peckawood, this nigger got Boss
          Candie killed. And we want his ass punished.
          Now I know you need our bucks. So.unless you
          wanna ride back to the mine, and tell Mr.Dickey
          how and why you fucked up our nice little
          business relationship, take this nigger and
          hush up about it!

                         ROY
          Fine, stick 'em in the goddamn cage.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         "H
          Django sees the three mandingos in the cage. They see him too.
          Django stops Ace Woody.

                         DJANGO
          Whoa whoa whoa, you can't put me in there
          with them. They'll kill me. What about all
          that -turning big rocks into little rocks-
          shit y'all was. talkin' about? I mean that was
          the idea ain't it? You put me in there with
          them big ass garboons they kill me on the way.
          I mean if that's the idea, that's the idea,
          but I didn't think that was the idea.
          Ace knows he's right, so he turns to Roy and Floyd.

                         ACE WOODY
          He can't go in there with them.

                         FLOYD
          Why not?

                         ACE WOODY
          They'll kill him.

                         FLOYD
          I don't give a damn.

                         ACE WOODY
          Well we do! He killed the fuckin Boss Man,
          we want the mine to grind him to gravel!

                         ROY
          Jano, you're riclin' horses ass, you take this
          black and make sure he keeps up.

                         JANO
          Oh, I'll keep 'em up.
          Jano takes the rope tired around Django's wrists.and ties the other end
          around his saddle horn.
          The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company caravan leaves Candyland.

          EXT - MISSISSIPPI COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
          The Caravan makes its way down a dirt road in pretty Chickasaw County.

          Jano ignores him.

          I said, hey white boy!

                         JANO

                         DJANGO
          I ain't worried about it. I'm just curious.
          I mean, I'm the property of The LeQuint Dickey
          Mining Company, ain't I?

                         JANO

          for today?

                         JANO
          Look black, it don't work like that. Dickey
          paid for our passage from Australia to here.
          We get a little money to send back home, and
          pay him back for the boat trip.

          'bout two years.

                         DJANGO
          And you ain't paid him back yet?

          You a slave too, peckawood. They just bought
          your ass for the price of a boat ride.
          At least they didn't charge us for our boat
          ride ... . ha ha ha ha...

                         (YELLING)
          You shut up!
          Jano's hand grabs his riding crop, and he brings it up to strike
          Django, when the black man says to him;

                         DJANGO
          How'd you like to make eleven thousand
          dollars?

                         JANO
          What?
          Django steps closer to him.

                         DJANGO
          How would you like to make eleven thousand
          dollars -- eleven thousand five hundred,
          actually?
          Roy, in the lead, yells back to Jano;

                         ROY
          Goddamit Jano, stop fuckin with that black,
          and keep up!

                         DJANGO
          Keep riding, just ride slower.
          They move forward, with Django walking beside Jano on his horse.

          Back at that plantation Candyland, there
          was an eleven thousand five hundred dollar
          fortune just sittin there, and y'all rode
          right past it.

                         JANO
          You be damned, blackie. We're not bandits.

                         DJANGO
          That's what's nice about this fortune, it's
          not illegal. You can't steal it, ya gotta
          earn it.

                         JANO
          If you got something to say, say it.

                         DJANGO
          The eleven thousand five hundred dollar fortune
          waiting for you back at Candyland, is in the
          form of a wanted dead or alive bounty on
          Smitty Bacall and the Smitty Bacall Gang.

                         JANO
          Who the fuck is Smitty Bacall?

                         DJANGO
          Smitty Bacall is the leader of a murdering
          gang of stagecoach robbers, The Bacall Gang.
          There's a seven thousand dollar dead or alive
          bounty on him. And one thousand five hundred
          dollars for each of his three accomplices,
          Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash, and Crazy Craig Koons.
          And all four of them gentlemen are sittin back
          there at Candyland...laughin their ass off...
          cause they just got away with murder.

                         (BEAT)
          But it don't hafta be that way. You and your
          mates could get that money.

                         JANO
          Who pays the money?

                         DJANGO
          The Court.

                         JANO
          The Court?

                         DJANGO
          The Austin Texas Courthouse. Oh, and by
          the way, the court don't give a damn about
          how you kill 'em. You can shoot 'em in the
          back, from up on a hill, in the back of
          the head, in their sleep - don't matter.

                         (CON'T)
          Court doesn't care how you do it, just as
          long as you do it.

                         JANO
          They.pay us to kill 'em?

                         DJANGO
          No. You kill 'em, and they payyou for the
          corpse. Get it?

                         JANO
          I think so... . what did these jokers do again?

                         DJANGO
          Killed innocent people in a stagecoach
          robbery. I've got the handbill in my pocket.
          Django digs into his tan pants and pulls out the folded up Smitty
          Bacall handbill that Dr.Schultz told him to hang on to for good luck.
          He hands it to Jano.

                         JANO
          What's this?

                         DJANGO
          I told you, it's the handbill for Smitty
          Bacall and The Bacall Gang.
          Jano looks at the handbill.

                         DJANGO
          Whatsamatter, can't you read?

                         JANO
          I can read, I just don't have my glasses.
          I didn't take 'em with me, because I didn't
          think I'd be doin much readin' on a nigger run.

                         DJANGO
          What about that cowboy fella in the lead?

                         JANO

                         DJANGO
          Can Roy read?

          Look, get it straight black, I can fuckin

          The LeQuint Dickey Mining Co. Caravan has stopped, and pulled over to
          the side of the road.

          IN THE CAGE
          Rodney, Chicken Charly, and Chester sit in the cage, and watch through
          the bars this new turn of events without any.clear comprehension of
          what they're watching.
          What the three caged men are watching is the three Australian mining
          company employees and Django, off in the distance (where they can't
          hear what they're saying), having some sort of a discussion. That
          includes the still bound by the wrists Django showing the three men a
          piece of paper.

          INSERT: SMITTY BACALL'S WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE HANDBILL
          Roy holds it in his hand as he reads and Django talks.

                         DJANGO
          I ain't no goddamn slave. Do I sound-like
          a fuckin slave? I'm a bounty hunter.
          Yesterday as a free man, I rode into
          Candyland on a horse with my white German
          partner, Dr.King Schultz. We'd tracked The
          Bacall Gang from Texas all the way to
          Chickasaw County. Found them laying low at
          Candyland. We went in to get 'em, things
          went sour. My partner was killed, and Calvin
          Candie was shot. Everybody there decided to
          blame me, so here I am.

                         (TO ROY)
          You know I'm not on the manifest? All of you
          know I'm not suppose to be on this trip.
          But those four men, are still back there.
          They're still wanted. And that eleven thousand
          five hundred is still up for grabs. And the
          last thing they'd expect is y'all rid.in back
          and gittin it.
          Django is damn convincing.

                         ROY
          What's your deal? You tell us who they are
          and we let ya go?

                         DJANGO
          I ain't tellin' who they are. But, you give
          me a pistol, and a horse, and five hundred
          dollars of that eleven thousand five hundred,
          and I'll point 'em out to you.
          He's got these greedy sonsabitches right on the hook...he just needs
          one little push.

          Y'all wanna ask somebody if I'm tellin the
          truth, ask them mandingos. You can't put
          me in the same cage with them without them
          killin me. Why ya think that is? Ask them
          .am I a Candyland slave, or did I ride in
          there on a horse, with a white man, yesterday?

                         CUT TO

          ROY AND FLOYD
          go to the Cage Wagon to talk with the three mandingos. As they walk,
          Roy continues to study the handbill.

                         ROY

                         (READING ALOUD)
          "Wanted, dead or alive. Smitty Bacall and
          The Bacall Gang. For murder and stagecoach
          robbery. Seven thousand dollars for Bacall.
          One thousand five hundred dollars for each
          of his gang members... ." This is a real handbill.

                         FLOYD
          Just because the handbill's real doesn't
          mean that other bunch of malarky.is.

                         ROY
          Why would a nigger slave have a wanted dead
          or alive handbill in his pocket?
          Floyd doesn't have an answer for that one.

                         ROY
          That black's damn convincing.
          They get to The Cage O'Men. Roy startles them with a direct question;

                         ROY
          (pointing, behind
          him, at Django)
          That black ride into Candyland yesterday?
          The Caged Men don't know what they're suppose to say.
          Roy removes the pistol from his belt, cocks back the hammer and points
          the barrel at the cage.

                         ROY
          I'm gonna ask again, and remember I don't
          like liars. Is he a Candyland slave, or did
          he ride in with a white man yesterday?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         CHESTER
          Yeah. They walked us from the Greenville
          Auction and he rode on a horse with a
          white man.

                         ROY
          This white man, was the black his slave?

                         RODNEY
          He weren't no slave.

                         FLOYD
          You sure about that?

                         RODNEY
          Damn sure.
          Roy starts taking the possibility of an eleven thousand dollar windfall
          seriously.

                         ROY
          What happened at Candyland?

                         CHICKEN CHARLY
          Bunch of shootin, master got shot.

                         ROY
          Who shot 'em?

                         CHICKEN CHARLY
          The German.

                         ROY
          And why did he do that?

                         CHICKEN CHARLY
          The nigger and the German were actin as if they
          were slavers, but they weren't.

                         ROY
          What were they?

                         RODNEY
          Bounty hunters.
          Floyd is starting to get convinced.

                         FLOYD
          Goddamn Roy, this could be big.
          (to the Slaves)

          Okay black, you gotta deal.
          Jano reacts.

          I got one more condition.

                         ROY

          When we get there, when the time comes,
          you let me help you kill 'em.
          Roy whips out a big knife, and cuts the rope around Django's wrists.

          You gotta deal, mate.
          Roy really laughs this time. As does Django and the other two Aussies.

                         ROY
          You're all right for a black fella!

                         THE CAGE
          Rodney, Chicken Charly, and Chester watch the sight of the white men
          cutting the ropes that bound the black man's wrists, as well as them
          all sharing a laugh, with wonderment. "Who is this Nigger?"

          BACK WITH THE LAUGHING QUARTET

          What's them saddle bags filled with?

                         FLOYD
          Dynamite.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          !so

                         DJANGO
          I.ain't ridin no horse with no goddamn
          dynamite on his back!

                         ROY

                         (CHUCKLE CHUCKLE)
          Yeah, I can see why. Jano take those sticks
          off that horse, and stick 'em in the nigger
          cage.
           Jano does this, lifting two out of four bags filled with dynamite off
           the pack horse, and walking to the cage wagon, unlocking ' the cage door,
           and placing the bags inside. The Black Men in the cage don't like this
          at all.
          Jano removes the last of the dynamite filled saddle bags from Django's
          horse, throws them over his shoulders, and begins walking back to The
          Cage Wagon.
          Django moves to his new pack horse, and says;

                         DJANGO
          Where's my pistol?

                         ROY
          Floyd, you got that rifle on the wagon, give
          'em your gun and your belt.
          Floyd unbuckles his gun belt, gun and all, folds it up, and walks over
          to Django handing it to him. Django accepts it.
          About the pistol, Floyd tells Django;

                         FLOYD
          Now don't drop it now. I just had the sights
          fixed last month, it's perfect.
          Django holding the gunbelt in his hand.

                         DJANGO
          That's good to know.
          Without taking the pistol out of the gunbelt, DJANGO SHOOTS FLOYD TWICE
          in the chest...
          Roy turns around...
          Django takes the gun out of the holster...
          . BAM...ROY is HIT in the UPPER BRAIN AREA and falls to the grass
          dead.
          Jano goes for the gun on his hip.
          Django SHOOTS ONE OF THE SADDLE BAGS over.Jano's shoulder...KAHBOOM!!!!!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Jano is BLOWN TO SMITHEREENS...
          The KAHBOOM knocks Django on his ass...
          The CAGE WAGON
          Rodney, Chester, and Chicken Charlie come down from the shock of the
          blast. The image outside the bars of their cage is of DUST and SMOKE in
          the air, obscuring all visibility...

          THEN ...
          A sudden GUST OF WIND comes and BLOWS all the smoke and dust away,
          REVEALING in bright color focus...
          .DJANGO standing among the two dead Aussies, and whatever is left of
          Jano.
          He's shoeless and shirtless, but Floyd's pistol and gunbelt sit
          wrapped around his waist.
          He locks eyes with the three men in the cage..
          He then moves towards the wagon, and unhooks the mine company beast,
          and climbs aboard him bareback.
          He leans over and snatches the RIFLE that Floyd kept on the wagon seat
          next to him.
          Grabbing a fistful of the horses mane, he digs his heels into the
          beast's side. The pack animals SPRINGS TO LIFE under the new rider. By
          now it should be apparent that Django brings the best out of horses, and
          horses bring the best out of Django.
          From his high horse Django looks down at The Three Caged Men...

          .THEN...
          Using the rifle in a QUICK ONE HANDED MOVE he SHOOTS the lock on the
          cage door.
          He looks at the three men, especially Rodney, then says;

                         DJANGO
          Throw up that dynamite.
          Rodney grabs a saddle bag full of dynamite and tosses it to Django on
          his Horse.
          Django wraps it around the Horse's neck, turns the beast around, and
          without saying another word, rides back in the direction of Candyland.
          The Three NOW FREE Mandingos, watch him ride away.
          "Who was that nigger?"

          A GORGEOUS BIG SKY SOUTHERN PURPLE AND ORANGE SUNSET WE PAN DOWN from
          the sky and see in small black silhouette the Funeral Procession of
          Calvin Candie carrying the Coffin of the former Master up the hill on
          'Candyland that leads to the Graveyard.
          A WHITE PREACHER walks out in front of the Procession.
          Then comes Calvin Candie's Coffin carried by eight pallbearers,
          Stephen, Moguy, Bartholomew, Ace Woody, Brown, Cody, and his best
          mandingos SAMSON and GOLDIE.
          The first mourner in line is Lara Lee dressed in a fancy black dress,
          wide brim black hat, black veil, and ever present black Mammy (Cora)
          crying at her side.

                         CORA
          The sky's real pretty Miss Lara. Monsieur
          Candie think it real nice.

                         LARA LEE
          Ah, bless you sweet innocent Cora.

          WE CROSS CUT WITH SHOTS
          of Django RIDING THE HORSE on the way back to Candyland. The bare
          backed black man riding the horse bareback, holding the RIFLE in one
          hand, a fistful of the horses mane in the other, hauling ass against a
          gorgeous SUNSET SKY, looks like an Indian.

          EXT - TRACKER SHACK/BUNKHOUSE - SUNSET
          The same GORGEOUS SUNSET SKY over the same shitty Tracker shack
          -Bunkhouse that Mr.Stonesipher and his three obscure companions share.
          The GERMAN SHEPHERDS (including Marsha) rest in the chicken wire kennel
          next to the bunkhouse.

          INT - TRACKER SHACK - SUNSET
          The FOUR TRACKERS are.missing the funeral, hanging out in the bunkhouse
          wearing their beards. Mr.Stonesipher, Lex, and Stew are playing a
          mountain card game which looks like poker, except the way you get rid of
          your cards is different. Instead of chips they play with, "NIGGER EARS"
          (yes, the ears of slaves). On a second viewing the audience may notice
          that some of the slaves at Candyland are missing one ear.
          Jake, the biggest, is off by himself, pounding nails into a small
          delicate BIRDHOUSE he's making.

          head...

                         SHIRTLESS DJANGO
          moves quietly through the woods.

                         MARSHA
          rises to all fours, to listen and smell. out in the darkness, her three
          PALS continue to lay out.

          DJANGO BY A TREE
          he can see the bunkhouse entrance, the LONG HANDLE AXE buried in the
          chopping block, the kennel, and the one dog looking his way.

                         MARSHA

          BARK!
          The Other Three Dogs wake up, and go on alert.
          Django disappears.

          INT - TRACKER SHACK - SUNSET
          They hear the barking inside.
          Mr.STONESIPHER
          Jake!
          Jake building his birdhouse.

                         JAKE
          Yeah?
          Mr.STONESIPHER
          Check on Marsha.
          Jake, the one not playing the game, puts aside his hammer, and rises to
          check on them (these guys are very sensitive about their dogs).

          EXT - TRACKER SHACK
          As the BARKING gets louder, WE SEE A CLOSE UP of The Axe in the
          chopping block, and Django's hand REMOVING IT.

                         JAKE
          opens the bunkhouse door-he sees directly a hundred feet in front of
          him, Django standing there with the axe. Just as he reacts...

          DJANGO ... . THROWS THE AXE...

          JAKE ... . IT HITS HIM IN THE FACE.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          After letting go of the axe handle, Django RUNS FULL SPEED toward Jake.
          Before the other three have really registered what's happening, Django
          has crossed the distance, and is YANKING The Axe out of JAKE'S FACE.
          And with AXE in hand, Django chases and fights with all three trackers,
          till after a point where he's CHOPPED DOWN TWO OF THEM, Lex, and Stew,
          and now there's only Mr.Stonesipher left.
          But Mr.Stonesipher has managed to draw his gigantic BUCK KNIFE, and is
          able to fight back against Django. You know Stonesipher's great with a
          knife, plus his fighting style is like one of his dogs, attack attack
          attack.
          Django uses the axe handle in a defensive position.
          The expert Mountain Boy begins SCORING BLADE CUTS on shirtless Django.
          The two men fight until they end up losing their weapons. Then it's
          just a fight of brute strength, and survival. Mr.Stonesipher is
          physically bigger then Django. But if Django's going to save Broomhilda,
          not to mention get revenge on all these Candyland motherfuckers, he has
          to take Stonesipher's ass out.
          This Black Man who has been under the yoke of white man's domination
          all his life, and this White Man who feeds black people to dogs, fight
          each other for their life.
          Django gets his arm around Stonesipher's neck in a headlock, but the
          mountain boy is big enough to lift Django. So like a rodeo rider
          holding onto bull for dear life, Django tightens his lock around his
          opponents neck. Django gets his hand on the HAMMER Jake was building
          the birdhouse with, and BRINGS IT CRASHING DOWN ON THE TOP OF

          STONESIPHER'S HEAD.
          That weakens Stonesipher.
          He HITS HIM AGAIN IN THE HEAD.
          That drops Stonesipher to his knees.
          He HITS HIM AGAIN WITH THE HAMMER ON THE HEAD.
          That puts the mountain man down on his back.
          He HITS HIM ONE MORE TIME WITH THE HAMMER TO keep him down for good.
          The Trackers are all dead.
          Only the dogs mad barking remains.
          EXT - The FUNERAL - NIGHT

          words over him.

          Django, half naked, splattered with blood from the axe murders, steps
          out of the shack. He takes a wash basin off the window sill, and walks
          over to the WATER PUMP.
          Marsha and her three friends-continue to BARK like mad.
          He PUMPS a couple of times, and water explodes into the bowl. He
          begins washing the blood-off'of himself. As he washes, he says outloud;

                         DJANGO
          What ya doin around here, boy?
          Timmy steps from his watching place in the bushes.

                         TIMMY
          I was just walkin' by.

                         DJANGO

          Not by the time I get through killin'
          everybody.
          Timmy has never heard a black man talk like that. He believes him.

                         TIMMY
          I'll show ya.

          THEN ...
          Django turns towards the barking dogs. He turns back to Timmy and asks;

                         DJANGO
          You know what toadstools look like?

          Timmy comes'in carrying a bunch of toadstools inside his shirt.
          Django takes the toadstools and Mr.Stonesipher's BUCK KNIFE and CHOPS
          the mushrooms into tiny pieces.
          He tosses the tiny bits of poisoned shrooms into the beefy sauce, and
          mixes it up with the spoon.

          EXT - MARSHA'S KENNEL - NIGHT
          Django throws the pot of poisoned beef stew over the top of the kennel.
          It lands on the ground with a PLOP.
          The Angry Dogs, are nevertheless', still dogs, and greedily scarf up
          the stew.
          Django watches them wolf down their ultimate agony with a smile.

                         DJANGO
          You bit your last nigger, bitch? Bite on that.
          Django lifts Timmy up on to the bare backed wagon horse.

          Timmy brings Django to the stable on the Candyland grounds. Django goes
          straight up to the stall housing Tony and says hello. Tony's happy to
          see him. Django feeds him an apple he picked along the way for him.
          He turns and sees the body of Dr.Schultz lying in a heap.
          And Schultz's horse Fritz in the stable.

                         DJANGO
          Saddle up Fritz and Tony.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Timmy just stares.

                         DJANGO
          Now, boy!
          Timmy hops to work.
          Django bends down over the body of Dr.Schultz, he takes Broomhilda's
          bill of sale and freedom papers out of his back pocket. He also
          searches for and finds Schultz's hidden DERRINGER, he keeps it in a
          holster around his ankle.
          As Timmy saddles the horses, he asks;

                         TIMMY
          Do you feel bad for your friend?
          Django rises from the body of his friend.

                         DJANGO
          Yeah, "I do.
          As Timmy saddles the horses he says;

                         TIMMY
          I know just how ya feel. I lost a white
          friend once. He drowned in the lake.
          Django doesn't correct the difference between Dr.Schultz and a white
          friend, because there's nothing he could say to Timmy to make him
          understand.
          He goes over to his pile of clothes, which still lie next to the
          furnace. He Puts on his boots. His Green Jacket over his bare chest.
          And finally his hat.

          He exits the shack to go the outhouse, leaving Broomhilda alone.
          WE MOVE INTO A CLOSE UP OF BROOMHILDA lying on the bed. She cries for
          Django, she cries for herself...

          .THEN...
          She HEARS an IMPACT SOUND, and a MUFFLED "Ooomph" SOUND.
          And through the spaces in the wooden planks that act as walls in Billy
          Crash's shack, she sees a figure fall to the ground.
          Then she sees another figure through the wooden planks move towards the
          front door.

                         CU BROOMHILDA
          Her face, stained with tears, watches the door.
          A soft "Knock Knock" on the door.

                         BROOMHILDA

                         (SOFTLY)
          Yes?
          The VOICE on the other side of the door, says;

          DJANGO'S VOICE (OS)
          Hey Little Trouble Maker.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         157
          She hops out of bed, and throws open the door...

          THERE HE IS,
          she runs into his arms.
          EXT - The FUNERAL - NIGHT
          The TWO OLD SLAVE.GRAVE DIGGERS are throwing the first shovelfuls of
          dirt on Monsieur Calvin J. Candie's coffin.
          The participants of this ritual, begin to move away from the grave. The
          funeral is a private affair, just the Candie Family Unit, some of the
          overseers, and the slaves. No one from town, except the Preacher.
          The SLAVE MOURNERS begin. to move towards their living area, all saying
          goodbye to Miss Lara. Miss Lara makes a big show of saying goodbye to
          them.
          A little cognizant of the Candie Family unit begin the walk off the
          hill back to the big house.

          EXT - BILLY CRASH'S SHACK - NIGHT
          Django with Broomhilda. Billy Crash lies dead in the B.G., Stonesipher's
          Buck Knife buried deep in his chest. He hands Broomhilda her papers.

                         DJANGO
          Here's your bill of sale, and freedom papers.
          No matter what happens to me, hold on to these
          and get out of the south.

                         BROOMHILDA
          What's gonna happen to you?

                         DJANGO
          Ain't nuttin' gonna happen to me honey,
          I'm just sayin'. Now go to the stable, little
          Timmy's got our horses .saddled. Your horse is
          named Fritz. He's a damn fine horse. Meet me

                         BROOMHILDA
          But what about you -

                         DJANGO
          - Don't worry about me. I'll see you, with
          Timmy and the horses, by the big house.
          He sends her on her way.
          Django looks up and sees the silhouettes of the funeral party walking
          down hill heading back for the big house.

          EXT - The TRAIL BACK TO The BIG HOUSE - NIGHT
          The Family unit of The Late Calvin Candie and his sister Lara Lee walk
          back to The Big House for a drink. This Candie Family Unit consists of:
          LARA LEE (unarmed) in her black flowing funeral dress.
          CORA (unarmed) her mammy, walks with Miss Lara, holding her hand.
          STEPHEN. (unarmed) dressed in his fancy black velvet version of his
          normal House Nigger outfit, walks on the other side of his mistress
          Miss Lara, holding her other hand.
          ACE WOODY (armed with a gun belt.around his hip) dressed in his Wyatt
          Earp like funeral black suit, with the string tie, walks by himself.
          LEONIDE MOGUY (armed with a gun belt around his hip) walks by himself.
          BARTHOLOMEW (unarmed) dressed in his tight fitting business suit, with
          his hat, walks alone.
          BROWN and JINGLE BELLS CODY (both armed with guns on their hips) both
          dressed slightly like cowboy peacocks, walk together.
          and finally,
          SAMSON and GOLDIE (unarmed) Calvin Candie's two prized mandingos,
          wearing suits they borrowed from Bartholomew..
          This CANDIE FAMILY UNIT walk to The Big House for a few post funeral
          drinks.
          They enter the lawn in front of The Big House, and head for the front
          door.
          Broomhilda on Fritz and Timmy riding on Tony come along the side of the
          property by some shed. They see The Candie Family Unit, all dressed in
          their darkest finery, walking towards the front steps of The Big House.
          The woman and little boy stop. But the group of enemies aren't looking
          their way.
          The CANDIE FAMILY UNIT
          moves closer towards the front of The Big House...

          WHEN ...
          The front of The Big House

          EXPLODES!
          knocking the.Candie Family Unit flat on their collective asses.
          BROOMHILDA and TIMMY
          can't believe their eyes.

          WOOD - STONE - PLASTER - DIRT - DUST - GLASS - SMOKE - GUNPOWDER
          hang in the air.
          The CANDIE FAMILY UNIT
          starts coming to their senses. Nobody was killed, or even seriously
          hurt (unless you count eardrums), just stunned.
          As their minds try and grasp with what just happened, their eyes look
          up from the ground, and try and see through the smoke and dust.
          The'SMOKE and DUST thins a little, and we see inside the smoke the
          mansion has been obliterated, but The Big House front steps remain.
          CUE cool MUSIC.
          STEPHEN sees something in the smoke, squints.
          ACE WOODY sees something in the smoke, squints.
          BROWN and CODY see something in the smoke, squint.
          In the SMOKE and DUST we begin to see a FIGURE, walking towards them.
          ACE WOODY squints at the FIGURE.
          MOGUY sees the.FIGURE.
          CORA attending to Miss Lara sees the FIGURE, then MISS LARA sees it.
          The FIGURE moves further out of the SMOKE and DUST.
          ACE WOODY, on the ground, his hand starts to move towards the gun
          around his waist.
          Then he sees The FIGURE.is carrying something in his left hand...
          .it's Floyd's Winchester, he raises it, and points it at Ace.
          ACE WOODY's hand moves away from his gun.
          The FIGURE steps out of the SMOKE. It's DJANGO dressed in his DJANGO

          OUTFIT.
          STEPHEN, ACE WOODY, MOGUY, LARA LEE, BARTHOLOMEW, CORA, BROWN and
          JINGLE BELLS CODY, SAMPSON or GOLDIE...Nobody can believe Django's
          standing there.
          He stands at the top of the front steps of The Big House, looking down
          at The Candie Family Unit, all lying on the front lawn, Winchester
          rifle held casually in his left hand. His right hand held casually by
          the gun on his hip.
          The CANDIE FAMILY UNIT
          all on their ass in the grass, look up at Django with a mixture of
          Wonder, Fear, and Hate.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         ICZ

          WE MOVE INTO A ROMANTIC CLOSE UP OF BROOMHILDA
          as she watches this.
          As DJANGO looks out at the ten stunned enemies spread out on The Big
          House front lawn,. and as they look back from the grass at him.
          The black man in the cool green jacket says;

                         DJANGO
          I bet I.know what you're thinkin', Ace Woody?
          You'.re thinkin', why didn't I'cut off that
          niggers nuts when .1 had the'chance? Right?

                         ACE WOODY
          I guess I shoulda'.

                         DJANGO
          Yes you should of.
          He points the Winchester at the people spread out on the grass.

                         DJANGO
          Everybody stand up!
          It's now Django who gives the orders. They stand up quickly.
          Django, with the rifle pointing at them, just looks at The Candie
          Family Unit. Enjoying their collective hatred.

          THEN...
          He tosses the rifle away.
          Then moves his right hand by his gun belt in his holster, as he takes a

          SHOWDOWN STANCE.
          EVERYBODY realizes DJANGO's intentions.
          Even BROOMHILDA and TIMMY.
          DJANGO looks down from his position at the top of The Big House steps
          at the ten people, and says;

                         DJANGO
          All black folks, take ten steps away from
          the white folks.
          DJANGO's eyes go to STEPHEN, who looks back at him.

                         DJANGO
          Not you Stephen. You're right where you
          belong.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         163
          The Black Folks, Cora, Bartholomew, Samson, and Goldie begin taking ten
          steps away from the White Folks and the gunfight.
          LARA LEE can't believe Cora's leaving her.
          CORA is "I'm sorry Miss Lara, but I never did nuttin' to that nigger."
          DJANGO looks to STEPHEN, and takes Schultz's hidden Derringer out of
          his pocket.

                         DJANGO

                         (TO STEPHEN)
          Let's see if you can handle this as well
          as you can my nuts?
          He tosses the Ole Man the tiny gun.

                         DJANGO

                         (TO EVERYBODY)
          Somebody give Miss Lara a gun.
          BROWN gives LARA LEE one. of his two guns.

                         BROWN

                         (TO DJANGO)
          Can I at least cock it for her?

                         DJANGO
          Yep.
          BROWN cocks back the hammer of the peacemaker, and puts it in her hand,
          and points it towards the ground.

                         BROWN
          (to Lara Lee)
          Okay Miss Lara, keep it pointed down till
          the shootin' starts. Then bring it up as
          fast as you can.
          LARA LEE CANDIE-FITZWILLI can't come to grips with what she's.in the
          middle of, who she's facing, what's in her hand, or what's about to
          happen.

                         DJANGO
          (to the six)
          Make your play hillbillies.
          The MUSIC SWELLS.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         16'F
          EVERYBODY, except for LARA LEE is READY:

          DJANGO ACE WOODY

                         STEPHEN MOGUY

                         BROWN CODY

                          LARA LEE
          The PEOPLE watching on the side:

          BARTHOLOMEW SAMSON BROOMHILDA

          CORA GOLDIE TIMMY
          EVERYONE'S ready, but no one wants to start this party...

          TILL...
          ACE WOODY starts to go for the gun in his holster, and STEPHEN starts
          to raise his Derringer.
          But it's no contest.
          As soon as Django saw any movement from the six in front of him,
          Floyd's Pistol was QUICKSILVER FAST in. his right hand, as his left hand
          FANNED the Pistols Hammer, SHOOTING INSTANTLY all five White People (and
          Stephen) standing in front of him.
          They all fall to grass in different ways..
          It was never any contest, they and WE (the audience) just didn't know
          HOW GOOD DJANGO was.

                         FLASH ON
          DJANGO showing off his incredible FAST DRAW and ACCURATE MARKSMANSHIP
          to Dr.Schultz.
          Dr.SCHULTZ

                         (SMILING)
          You know what they're going to call you,
          my boy? "The fastest gun in the South."

          BACK TO SHOWDOWN
          DJANGO stands on the top steps of what's left of'The Big House, looking
          down at The Candie Family Unit, who all lay dead or dying on the
          Candyland front lawn.
          The WITNESSES can't fathom what they'just witnessed.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         /65
          All the CANDIE FAMILY UNIT lies on the grass SHOT. But some are still
          alive. We HEAR MOANING coming from LARA LEE, CODY, and MOGUY.
          DJANGO sees this.
          The Black Man reaches behind him and comes out with a DYNAMITE STICK.
          He tosses it on the grass among the bodies.
          He takes aim with his pistol; and FIRES.
          It EXPLODES.
          Finishing off what was left of the Candie Family Unit, not to mention,
          blowing the limbs off of many of them.
          The LAWN is SILENT.
          DJANGO'S PISTOL goes back in its holster.
          Django walks down the front steps of The Big House, feeling tremendous
          satisfaction in the wrath he just wroth on Candie and Co.
          He removes Dr.Schultz's tiny Derringer from Stephen's dead hand,
          putting it in his pocket. Then heads over to where Broomhilda and Timmy
          wait for him with Fritz and Tony.
          As he,walks up to Broomhilda on Fritz, he says;

                         DJANGO
          Hey Little Trouble Maker.

                         BROOMHILDA
          Hey Big Trouble Maker.

                         DJANGO
          Down, boy.
          Timmy hops off of Tony.
          Django climbs aboard Tony. He says to Broomhilda;

                         DJANGO
          I tole' you ain't nuttin' gonna happen
          to me.

                         BROOMHILDA
          Yes you did.

                         DJANGO
          Girl, you're gonna hafta start trustin' me.

                         BROOMHILDA
          I'll keep that in mind.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         Âº66
          Django looks down to Timmy.

                         DJANGO
          Thanks for the help, boy.
          He reaches into his saddle bag, and pulls out an apple, and tosses it
          down to Timmy.

                         DJANGO
          That's for you. Good luck Tim.
          (he points to
          the Northern Sky)
          The North star, is that one.
          He looks to Broomhilda on Fritz.

                         DJANGO
          You gonna hafta keep up, ya know?

                         BROOMHILDA
          You won't wait for me.

                         DJANGO
          Better not.

                         BROOMHILDA
          You won't.

                         DJANGO

                         (SMILING)
          Better not.

                         BROOMHILDA

                         (SMILING)
          You won't.
          They kiss.
          Then, astride Tony, Django leaves Candyland having rescued his
          Broomhilda from her Mountain, her Ring of Hellfire, and all her
          Dragons.
DOGMA

EXT ASBURY PARK BOARDWALK - DAY

Jersey spring day. Beyond the wooden planks that make up the aged fun pier,
the ocean waves crash into the sandy shoreline.

An OLD MAN stares at the empty beach. Sun-worshipers hours away from
besmirching the dunes. His features are simple. He wears an old overcoat.
His face belies good years gone by - a face that has seen more sunrises
than one would suspect. He inhales the crisp, salty air and lets a small,
satisfied smile cross his face.

Behind him. a large arcade with steel shuttered doors sits on the
boardwalk. Three young boys skate around by on roller blades, passing a
street hockey ball between them proficiently. The Old Man views them
briefly. checks his watch, and looks back toward the ocean.

The skates of the three hockey playing youths skid to a halt. We pan up to
their faces - now cold and dispassionate. They look at one another and nod.

Their skates glide out of frame.

P.O.V. SKATERS - The Old Man leans on the railing that overlooks the beach.
We get closer and closer to him until...

One of the skaters checks him hard into the railing. The Old Man exhales
violently and falls to his knees. The two other skaters begin savagely
beating on him with their hockey sticks, as he crumbles beneath them.
Repeatedly their blades crash down hard on his head.

OC VOICE

I don't understand - how can you base your lack of belief in God on the
writings Lewis Caroll?

The three skaters cease their beating and check the Old Man's pulse.
Satisfied, they skate away, leaving his crumpled form on the boardwalk.

INT AIRPORT - DAY

LOKI walks beside a NUN in a semi-busy terminal. They pass through the
metal detectors. The Nun carries a donation can.

LOKI

Leaving 'Alice in Wonderland' aside, look closely at 'Through the Looking
Glass' - particularly 'The Walrus and the Carpenter' poem: what's the
metaphorical meaning?

NUN

I wasn't aware there was one.

                                   LOKI

Oh, but there is - it colorfully details the sham that is organized
religion. The Walrus - with his girth and good-nature - obviously refers to
either the Buddha, or - with his tusks - the lovable Hindu elephant god,
Lord Ganesha. This takes care of the Eastern religions. The Carpenter is an
obvious reference to Jesus Christ, who was purportedly raised the son of a
carpenter. He represents the Western religions. And in the poem. what do
they do? They dupe all the oysters into followmg them. Then. when the
oysters collective guard is down. the Walrus and the Carpenter shuck and
devour the helpless creatures, en masse. I don't know what that says to
you, but to me it says that following faiths based on these mythological
figures insures the destruction of one's inner-being.

BARTLEBY sits amongst a row of seats by one of the arrival gates. He eats
popcorn and stares at...

A steady stream of TRAVELERS, exiting the gate, meeting lovedones, family.

                                  OC LOKI

Organized religion destroys who we are or who we can be by inhibiting our
actions and decisions out of fear of an intangible parent-figure who shakes
a finger at us from thousands of years ago and says "No, no!"

Bartleby smiles at the meet-and-greets, warmed. Loki saddles up beside him,
kneeling on one of the seats, facing the Nun.

                                   LOKI

'Through the Looking Glass' - a children's tale? I think not.

                                    NUN

(really dazed)

I've... I've never really thought about it like that...

(beat; shocked; off her cassock)

What have I been doing with my life...?'.

                                   LOKI

Don't look back. Just get out there and taste life.

(off donation can)

Leave this for the unenlightened. Poverty is for the gullible - it's
another way the church is trying to control you. You take that money you've
been collecting for your parish reconstruction and go get yourself a nice
piece of ass. You deserve it.

The Nun nods at him, and saunters off, obviously grappling with something.
A passerby tries to stick money in her can, but she yanks it away. Loki
faces the proper direction in his seat and plops down beside the
still-transfixed Bartleby.

                                 BARTLEBY

                               (looking OC)

Here's what I don't get about you: you know for a fact that there is a God.
You've been in his presence, he's talked to you personally. And yet I just
heard you claim to be an atheist.

                                   LOKI

C'mon man - you know I don't believe any of that shit I was telling her. I
just like to fuck with the clergy; keep 'em on their toes. When her head
stops spinning, she'll be facing the way of the Just again. But oh. will
she have a bunch to confess.

(looks around)

Now here's what I don't get about you: why do you feel the need to come
here all the time?

                                 BARTLEBY

(off travelers)

I like to watch. This is humanity at it's best. Look at them.

A reunited FAMILY share a group hug and move on, making way for two young
LOVERS to embrace and kiss passionately.

                                OC BARTLEBY

All that tension, all that anger and mistrust, forgotten for one perfect
moment when they come off that plane. See those two? The guy doesn't even
know that the girl cheated on him while he was away.

OC LOKI

She did?

Bartleby and Loki continue to watch the arrivals.

                                 BARTLEBY

Uh-huh. Twice. But it doesn't matter at this moment because they're both so
relieved to be with one another. I like that. I just wish they could all
feel that way more offen.

                                   LOKI

Maybe if someone gave them free bags of peanuts more often they would. Now
what was so friggin' important that I had to miss cartoons this morning? If
it was to share in your half-assed obsessions with Hallmark moments, I'm
going to slug you.

                                 BARTLEBY

(still looking OC)

You're never going to believe this: we're going home.

(off Bartleby's popcorn)

Let me have some?

                                 BARTLEBY

(pulls out envelope)

Look what somebody sent us in the mail.

(hands him a newspaper article and corn)

                                   LOKI

Did you say we're going home?

(reads)

"Cardinal Glick Cuts Ribbon on 'Catholicism - Wow!"

Campaign."

(to Bartleby)

And?

BARTLEBY

Keep reading.

                                   LOKI

(reads)

"Updating the church... television spots... Papal consent...
rededication...

(to Bartleby)

Again - and?

                                 BARTLEBY

(snatches article) Give me this

(getting up; reading)

"The Re-dedication of Saint Michael's Church on it's hundredth anniversary
is the kickoff of a new campaign that seeks to bring the Catholic Church
back into the mainstream. With a papal sanction, the archway entrance to
the centuryold, Jersey shore house of worship will serve as a passageway of
pleanry indulgence, which - according to Catholic beliefs - offers all who
pass through it's arches a morally clean slate."

(looks at Loki)

You still don't get it, do you?

                                   LOKI

No, I don't get it. Are we leaving now?

They start walking.

                                 BARTLEBY

If you walk through the church's front door on the day of the Re-dedication
ceremony, your soul is wiped clean of any and all existing sin, moreso than
the sacrament of penance could ever offer. It's a plenary indulgence, man!
I don't know why I never thought of this before.

                                   LOKI

(spits out chewed popcorn into trash can)

Sounds thin. Sounds like someone made it up.

                                 BARTLEBY

It's rarely employed, but it's legitimate. It has a papal sanction for
God's sake.

                                   LOKI

So you're saying you and I can walk through this doorway and go back home?

                                 BARTLEBY

No - by passing through the doors, our sins are

forgiven. Then all we have to do is die...

                                   LOKI

Wait. wait, wait - Die? I don't want to die.

(chews popcorn)

                                 BARTLEBY

(steps on conveyor belt)

You'd rather stay down here for a few more eons?

                                   LOKI

No, but we don't even know if we can die. And what if we can, but this
archway thing doesn't pan out? What then? Hell? Fuck that.

(spits out chewed popcorn into napkin)

                                 BARTLEBY

Impossible. If we cut off our wings and transubstantiate to complete human
form then we become mortal. And if we die with clean souls, there's no way
to keep us out. They have to let us in.

LOKI

(beat)

Who sent this thing?

                                 BARTLEBY

I don't know. Somebody who's looking out for us,

I guess. Does it matter? All that matters is that

after all these years, we've found a loophole. He

can't keep us out anymore. And once we're back

in, I'm sure He'll just forgive and forget.

They pass the Nun. who leans against a wall, still dazed.

                                   LOKI

Yeah, but this plenary' indulgence thing is a church law, not Divine
Mandate. Church laws are fallible because they're created by man.

                                 BARTLEBY

One of the last sacred promises imparted to Peter the first Pope by the Son
of God before He left was "Whatever you hold true on earth..."

                                   LOKI

" ...I'll hold true in Heaven."

                                 BARTLEBY

So if the Pope says it's so, God must adhere. It's dogmatic law.

                                   LOKI

(beat; extends hand)

Let it never be said that your anal retentive attention to detail never
yielded positive results.

                                 BARTLEBY

(accepts hand)

You can't be anal retentive if you don't have an anus.

                                   LOKI

There's just one thing I think I should do before we leave - something
that'Il get us back on His good side.

BARTLEBY

What's that?

Loki smiles and starts rifling through his pockets. He extracts a magazine
article.

                                   LOKI

This is something I've been dreaming about for five years now. Read.

The crumpled article displays a Barney-like gold-hued cow, alongside
various profit charts and text.

                                OC BARTLEBY

                                 (reading)

"Mooby the Golden Calf- Creating an Empire Out of Simplicity."

Loki wipes his mouth and nods to the article.

LOKI

I want to hit them.

                                 BARTLEBY

Are you nuts?!

(crumples article)

We're mere days away from getting back, and you want to jeopardize it
because you have a soft spot for the good ol' days?!

                                   LOKI

What better way to show I've repented than by resuming the position I
denied... thanks to you.

                                 BARTLEBY

A killing spree is not going to make things better for us.

                                   LOKI

We're not talking about killing here. We're talking about Divine Justice.
We're talking about punishing the wicked, raining down fire and brimstone.
He's all about that. I just know he'd want this done.

                                 BARTLEBY

There hasn't been an Angel of Death since you quit. Doesn't that mean
anything to you? Besides, what if you're wrong?

                                   LOKI

If I'm wrong, it won't matter. Like you said - we pass through the arch and
we're forgiven anyway

They step up to an elevator and press the button.

                                 BARTLEBY

(considering it)

Well... he does hate competition.

(reading article)

And this Mooby deninitely falls under that heading.

                                   LOKI

The church we have to go to is where?

                                 BARTLEBY

New ]ersey. The Rededication is in four days.

The doors open. They get on. Other people are inside as well.

                                   LOKI

Our last four days on earth. If I had a dick, I'd go get laid. But we can
do the next best thing.

BARTLEBY

What's that?

LOKI

Let's kill people.

A guy beside Loki reacts. Loki smiles at him as the elevator doors close.

OPENING CREDITS

Between black cards with white credits there are shots of the OLD MAN from
the boardwalk being wheeled into a hospital on a gurney, being treated in
the emergeny room, being hooked up to life support system, and finally
resting in an intensive care wing.

EXT ST. STEPHEN'S PARISH - DAY

The church sits on a grassy knoll in Mc Henry - a suburb of Chicago. Some

                                 OC PRIEST

The greater Illinois chapter of the Right to Life foundation will be
holding it's bi-annual softball game against the Cook County Pro-Choice
league next Sunday at two.

INT ST. STEPHEN'S PARISH - DAY

The PRIEST speaks from the lectern, addressing semi-filled rows of the
faithful.

                                  PRIEST

Those who find the weekly demonstration outside of

the Twelfth Street Planned Parenthood Clinic hard to make due to work
schedules are urged to show their support in the fight against the
thoughtless and wanton destruction of life by cheering on our boys on the
field. Refreshments. as always, will be served.

Dollying down the rows while the Priest rattles on. we pass the
parishoners. Some listen intently, others are nodding off. One
surreptitiously listens to a Walk-man; a man and a woman quietly argue
while their kid colors in a coloring book, going off the page and marking
the pew; two kids play cards; one guy leafs through a copy of Hustler
hidden by his hymnal book.

                                 OC PRIEST

Today's second collection will be donated to the John Doe Jersey Life Fund.
For those of you who haven't been following the news, an unidentified
homeless man who was accosted and severely beaten at the New Jersey shore
last Tuesday lies in critical but stable condition in one of that area's
hospitals. He lacks identification and police have had no luck in tracking
down any possible family. While he shows no signs of recovery, the
Arch-Bishop of the Trenton Diocese has disputed the state's decision to
remove the indigent man from life support systems, asking that Catholics
all over the country join in this protest against Euthanasia. And finally -
will whoever keeps parking in my spot, stop doing that. Thank you. Now,
please rise for the recession of faith. We believe in one God, the
father...

As the congregation flatly joins in the prayer, we stop on BETHANY - a
beautiful twenty-something woman who struggles to stay awake. She checks
her watch and exhales softly.

                                 OC VOICE

I don't really want to be here.

ENT PLANNED PARENTHOOD CLINIC - DAY

A small gaggle of signcarrying RIght-to-Lifer's march in front of the
sterile looking building.

                                 OC VOICE

But then again, I guess nobody ever does... except maybe you.

INT BETHANY'S OFFICE - DAY

The source of the voice - a GIRL - sits beside Bethany's desk, stretching
out her gum. Bethany offers her an understanding smile.

                                   GIRL

You know, I've done this three times now; and each time the counselor tells
me I should be more careful in the future, I should show' some
responsibility. Gotta tell you, though - this is the first time the
counselor wasn't some ugly as hell old bitch. It's kind of hard to take
abortion advice from a woman who's too gross to get laid in the first
place.

                                  BETHANY

I'm not here to lecture you - I'm here to make sure you really want to go
through with this.

                                   GIRL

I'd rather go back to that night when my idiot bovfriend swore up and down
he was sterile. Short of that, there aren't many choices left, now are
there?

                                  BETHANY

Ever think about having it?

                                   GIRL

                                  (beat)

What woman doesn't on some level.

BETHANY

I never did.

GIRL

                               (incredulous)

You had an abortion?

                                  BETHANY

(lights a smoke)

My first year in college. All through high school, I'd dated the same guy -
Walter Flanagan. We were really in love, right? So much so. that we decided
to go Carnegie Mellon together... that's this college in Pittsburgh. So
there we are -away at school, and there's suddenly no parents to worry
about anymore, so we're screwing like rabbits - just constanly doing it.
And I wound up getting pregnant. So he begs me to have it. He says we
should quit school and get married, and I'm telling him that that'lI screw
up our educations. We fought about it for a week - my arguement being there
was no rush to have kids, you know? We could always have a baby in a couple
of years - after school. So I got the abortion against his wishes... I
mean, what the hell - it was my body, right? After graduation, we got
married and immediately set about trying to have kids. We tried like hell
for the first six months, and... nothing. So I went to a gynocologist to
see if everything was okay on my end.

                                  (beat)

                                It wasn't.

(takes a drink)

My uteran wall had this fissure. It seems that the doctor who performed the
procedure on me years before had somehow botched it. I'd never be able to
have a child.

The Girl's face says it all. Bethany takes a drag and continues.

                                  BETHANY

So there I am - devastated. And now I have to go home to break the news to
my husband who years before had begged me to have the baby - his baby. And
after I explain it to him through my tears, he sits on the couch and rubs
his eyes. And in the calmest, most rational voice I've ever heard anybody
use in my life, he asks me for a divorce. And I fought him, you know? I
tried to talk him out of it; told him there were alternatives - like we
could adopt. And all he said was he wanted a wife who could have his
children.

GIRL

                                  (beat)

What happened?

                                  BETHANY

He remarried. He had two kids in two years with his new wife. We never
spoke again. And now I do this.

                                   GIRL

That's like... such a sad story.

                                  BETHANY

I dated this guy a year or two ago - he was really into comic books. He
told me I had the stock superhero story -I wanted to prevent a wrong that
had happened to me from ever happening to anyone else. Kind of like Batman,
he said. The only difference is I don't put on tights to do it... unless
all my other clothes are in the wash.

(smiles and puts out her smoke)

So... let's go over your paperwork.

EXT CLINIC - DAY

A well-dressed LIZ maneuvers through the small thrall of Right-to-lifer's.
They shake their placards at her accusingly.

                                PROTESTOR 1

You should be ashamed of yourself!

PROTESTOR 2

Child killer!

                                    LIZ

(looking over their shoulders)

HOLY SHIT!! IT'S THE POPE!!

As the thrall turns excitedly in an effort try to spy the imaginary
pontiff, Liz ducks inside the clinic.

INT CLINIC COFFEE ROOM - DAY

A NEWSPAPER HEADLINE fills the frame - "CHURCH SAYS NO TO DEATH OF JOHN
DOE". It's lowered to reveal Bethany, reading. Liz enters and hangs up her
coat.

                                    LIZ

Jesus! You're a Catholic, aren't you? Can't you talk

to them or something?

                                  BETHANY

They hate me more than you, no doubt. At least you have an excuse - you're
]ewish,

you don't know any better.

                                    LIZ

I don't think they'd accept that one - we already used it as our excuse for
killing Christ. So where were you yesterday morning - a bunch of us went
out for brunch?

BETHANY

I went to church.

                                    LIZ

That kills me. You and church. We work in a field that specializes in
pissing off the cloth and you add insult to injury by breaking bread with
them every week.

                                  BETHANY

I sit there every Sunday and I feel nothing. I can remember sitting in
church when I was a kid and being moved - like everything meant something,
like I was important. And the stories of all these holy people were so
inspiring. Now I sit there and think about my checking, and what I'm going
to wear to work the next day.

                                    LIZ

So then why do you still go?

                                  BETHANY

(beat)

You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

                                    LIZ

You think I'm going to mock your religious beliefs? We're friends, Bethany
- I may mock you for being a divorce' at twenty five who's never had an
orgasm, but I'd never mock you for having faith.

                                  BETHANY

That's just it - I don't. I don't think I have any faith left.

                                    LIZ

(making coffee)

I had a girl in here once - 'bout fifteen. She told me that faith is like a
glass of water. When you're young, the glass is full, and it's easy to fill
up. But the older you get, the bigger the glass gets, and the same amount
of water doesn't fill the glass anymore. Periodically, the glass has to be
refilled.

                                  BETHANY

A fifteen year old who came in here said that?

                                    LIZ

She had gotten knocked up by her pastor.

                                  BETHANY

Jesus! See? A minister knocks up a teenager -isn't anyone afraid of the
Lord's wrath anymore?

                                    LIZ

That would require faith, and that commodity lately seems reserved only for
the psychotic zealots that hang around outside.

(collects her things to leave)

So what are you doing tonight?

                                  BETHANY

Watching T.V.

                                    LIZ

Girl, you need a man. If only for ten minutes.

                                  BETHANY

It's been my experience that the average male is never a man - not even for
ten minutes in his entire life span.

                                    LIZ

Uh-oh - that sounds militant. You thinking of joining the other side?

                                  BETHANY

Couldn't do it. Women are insane.

                                    LIZ

Then girl, you better get back to church and ask God for a third option.

BETHANY

I think God is dead.

                                    LIZ

The sign of a true Catholic.

Liz exits with her coffee. Bethany stares after her.

INT A QUAINT SUBURBAN HOME - DAY

The Stygian Triplets kneel on one knee before a high-backed leather chair,
upon which Sits a shadowy figure who we see from behind. They appear to be
in a den or library.

                              SHADOWY FIGURE

All proceeds according to plan. No doubt, the powers will attempt to
contact the Last Scion. You know where she is. She must be elliminated
befoie she enters the frav. When she is negated, there will be nothing to
interfere with our plan. Shuffle her loose her mortal coil, that we may
obtain our final glory.

                                  (beat)

Go.

The Stygian Triplets rise and skate off.

INT BETHANY'S KITCHIEN - NIGHT

The fridge door opens and Bethany glances around inside. She pulls out a
chocolate cake and closes the door.

INT BETHANY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Bethany sits on the couch, eating cake with a fork and watching the OC t.v.
The theme song to Filmation's 'Batman and Robin' cartoon can be heard. She
sips some milk from a glass and has some more cake.

INT BETHANY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Bethany's in bed, staring up at the ceiling. From the darkness, a creaking
floor board is heard. Bethany reacts, grabbing a bat from under her pillow.
She peers into the darkness, defensively wielding her bat.

Suddenly, the room explodes in flames. A huge fire that appears to be
shooting out from the floor ignites mere feet from Bethany's bed. Bethany
leaps back, taking a beat to stare, mesmerized. Looking closely, one can
see an anthropomorphic form standing in the blaze.

                                   VOICE

(powerful; booming)

BEHOLD THE METATRON - HERALD OF THE ALMIGHTY AND

VOICEOF THE ONE TRUE GOD!

The Voice repeats itself. Bethany darts out of bed and dashes out of the
room, quickly returning with a fire extinguisher. While the voice is in
mid-sentence, she blasts the thing with the contents of the canister,
swirling the nozzle around to hit all the flames. The booming Voice
sputters and starts coughing, losing it's impressive edge. Bethany stops
squirting and turns on her bedside lamp.

A choking, drenched, and coughing androgynous figure in a suit waves her
away. The figure coughs up some of the extinguisher's contents and drops to
the floor, hacking. It is METATRON. Bethany stares, shocked.

                                 METATRON

(between coughs)

Sweet. ..Jesus! Did you... have to empty...the whole can?!

Bethany grabs her bat again and holds it up, this time offensively.

                                  BETHANY

WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU AND WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING IN MY ROOM?!

                                 METATRON

(slowly rising to it's feet)

I'm the one... who's soaked and... she's the one who's pissed. That's rich!

                                  BETHANY

(reaching for phone, still holding bat)

I'm calling the cops! Breaking and entering, attempted arson... they're
going to lock you up for life...!

                                 M ETATRON

(wiping off clothes)

No dial tone.

                                  BETHANY

(ear to phone)

You cut the phone lines...

(even more offensive with bat)

Get the fuck out of here, now!

                                 METATRON

Or you'll what - hit me with that fish?

The bat Bethany held is now a salmon. She drops it to the floor and freaks.

                                 METATRON

Now just sit down on the bed and shut up!

                                  BETHANY

Oh God - you're going to rape me...

                                 METATRON

I'm not going to rape you.

(to itself; off clothes)

Look at my suit...!

                                  BETHANY

Take whatever you want, just don't kill or rape me...

                                 METATRON

Enough with the raping already! I couldn't rape you if I wanted to.

(unzips pants and pulls them off)

Angels are ill-equipped.

Bethany stares. There, before her, stands the exposed Metatron. There is
nothing where some sexual genitalia should be - it's as smooth and
anatomically impaired as a Ken doll.

                                 METATRON

See? I'm as anatomically impaired as a Ken doll.

(rings out pants)

You meat-puppets and your arrogance - you think everyone's just waiting to
rape you.

                                  BETHANY

Wh..what are you?

                                 METATRON

I'm pissed is what I am. You go around drenching everyone that comes into
your room with flameretardent chemicals? No wonder you don't get laid.

(pulls pants back on)

Go get me a towel, will you?

Bethany blinks. She exits the room and comes back with a towel. She holds
it out to Metatron who grabs it and starts toweling off.

                                 METATRON

(taking off jacket)

Stand back.

Bethany steps back. Metatron flexes and huge fucking wings extend from it's
back, dripping water. Bethany goes wide-eyed and cowers against the wall.

                                 METATRON

(tosses towel away)

Like I was saying - I am the Metatron.

Bethany stares, saying nothing, pinned against the wall. Metatron looks
insulted.

                                 METATRON

Metatron. Don't tell me the name doesn't ring a bell?

Bethany remains silent and wideyed. Metatron gets testy.

                                 METATRON

You people. If there isn't a movie about it, it's not worth knowing, right?

                                  (beat)

I am a seraphim.

(beat)

The highest choir of angels?

(beat)

You do know what an angel is, don't you?

Bethany slowly nods.

                                 METATRON

Metatron acts as the voice of God. Any documented occasion when some yahoo
claims to have spoken with God, they're speaking to me. Or they're speaking
to themselves.

                                 BET HANY

                                  (beat)

Why doesn't God speak for himself?

                                 METATRON

Ah. So glad you decided to join the conversation. To answer that - human
beings have neither the aural nor the psychological capacity to withstand
the awesome

power of God's true voice. Were you to hear it, you're mind would cave in
and your heart would explode within your chest. We went through five Adam's
before we figured that out.

                                  BETHANY

Are you going to kill me?

                                Ni ETATRON

I could for what you did to this suit. Unfortunately I can't. You're
called.

                                 BETH ANY

                                  (beat)

Called how? How called?

                                 METATRON

All that from two words. Color this angel impressed.

                                  BETHANY

(beat)

How do I know you're an angel?

                                 METATRON

Oh, you mean besides the fiery entrance and the expansive wingspan? You
people kill me. Fine. You want more proof? How about a tequila?

(snaps fingers)

INT MEXICAN BAR - NIGHT

Bethany and Metatron sit at a table. Bethany immediately clutches at her
pajamas. Metatron waves a WAITER over.

                                  BETHANY

Where the hell are we?!

                                 METATRON

The only place one can go for good tequila.

(to Waiter)

Dos tequilas, por favor. And an empty glass.

                                  WAITER

Si.

The Waiter turns to leave. Metatron yanks a smoke from his pocket as he
goes.

                                 METATRON

Gracias, senor.

                                  BETHANY

We're in Mexico?!

                                 METATRON

Actually, we're in the Chilli's down the street from your house, but it was
                         still an impressive trick

(lights smoke)

You don't mind that I lost the wings, do you? I'm trying to keep our
profile low.

                                  BETHANY

I suppose it would be too cliche to observe aloud that this is the weirdest
dream I've ever had.

                                 METATRON

Can you imagine how insulting it is to converse with a person and have them
insist you're a dream? If I had an ego, it'd be bruised.

                                  BETHANY

What do you want with me?

                                 METATRON

I'm to charge you with a holy crusade.

(pause)

You do know what a crusade is, don't you?

                                  BETHANY

(sarcastically)

Uh, yeah.

                                 METATRON

Don't give me that. Last time I charged someone with a crusade they had to
look the word up.

                                  BETHANY

Why am I supposed to go on a crusade?

                                 METATRON

Your's is a heritage divine. Also, you didn't seem to be doing much lately.

The Waiter arrives with their drinks.

                                 METATRON

Oh - Gracias!

(he leaves; off the tequila)

One of the only things your people have mastered since you crawled from the
primordial ooze.

(sips)

                                  BETHANY

I work in an abortion clinic.

                                 METATRON

(spits tequila into empty glass)

Moses was a drunk. Look what he accomplished. And no one's even asking you
to part an ocean. All you have to do is go to New Jersey.

                                 BETH ANY

New ]ersey.

                                 METATRON

Sure. Go to New Jersey and visit and small church on a very important day.
Agreed?

                                  BETHANY

That doesn't sound like a crusade.

                                 METATRON

Aside from the fine print, that's it.

                                  BETHANY

What's the fine print?

                                 METATRON

(mumbles into glass)

stopacoupleofangelsfromenteringandthusnegatingallexistence.

Damn, this is good tequila.

(sips)

                                  BETHANY

Wait, wait, wait. Repeat that.

                                 METATRON

Damn, this is good tequila?

                                  BETHANY

The first part.

                                 METATRON

(spits into empty glass)

Details. Stop a couple of angels from entering and thus negating all
existence. God, I hate when people need it spelled out for them.

                                  BETHANY

Clarify that.

                                 METATRON

That's the problem with you people - you need every-thing clarified. No
leaps of faith whatsoever. Alright -vou want the whole secret origin? Here
goes: Back in the old days, God was vengeful and hot-tempered, and his
wrath was bore by the Angel of Death - name of Loki. When Sodom and
Gommorah were destroyed? That was Loki. When the waters wiped out
everything with the exception of Noah and his menagerie? That was Loki. And
he was good at what he did. But one day, he refused to bear God's wrath any
longer.

                                  BETHANY

Why?

                                 METATRON

Because he listened to his friend - a Grigori by the name of Bartleby.

                                  BETHANY

Grigori?

                                 METATRON

One of the choirs of angels. They're called Watchers. Guess what they do?

                                  BETHANY

So they're like Guardian angels?

                                 METATRON

Exactly like that, but different. So one day, Loki's wiping out all the
first born of Egypt...

                                  BETHANY

The Tenth Plague.

                                 METATRON

See? Tell a person you're the Metatron and they stare at you blankiy;
mention something out of a Charlton Heston movie and they're suddenly
theology scholars. May I continue uninterrupted?

(Bethany nods)

So once he's done with the first born, Loki takes his friend Bartleby out
for a post-slaughter drink. And over many rounds, they get into this
discussion about whether or not murder in the name of God is okay. Now,
Bartleby can run circles around Loki intellectually, not to mention the
fact that Loki's more than half in the bag, and in the end, Bartleby
convinces Loki to quit his position and take a lesser one - one that
doesn't involve slaughter. So - very inebriated - Loki tells God he quits:
throws down his fiery sword, gives him the finger - which ruins it for the
rest of us. because from that day forward, God decreed that angels could no
longer imbibe alcohol. Hence all the spitting.

                                  BETHANY

Sounds reasonable.

                                 METATRON

Maybe to you, but I'm a lush by nature.

                                  BETHANY

I mean about the angel of Death's resignation.

                                 METATRON

For a liberal, yes, but this is the Angel of Death we're talking about. The
Angel of Death can't be a conscientious objector. The Angel of Death is
charged with meting out whatever justice God demands. So for their
insolence, God decreed that neither Loki nor Bartleby would ever be allowed
back into Paradise.

                                  BETHANY

Were they sent to Hell?

                                 METATRON

Worse. Wisconsin. For the entire span of human history. And when the world
ends, they'll sit outside the gates for eternity.

                                  BETHANY

And what's this have to do with me?

                                 METATRON

Somebody's clued them in to a loophole in Catholic dogma that would allow
them to reenter Heaven.

                                  BETHANY

So what? They beat the system. Good for them.

                                 METATRON

It's not that simple. If they get in, they will have reversed God's decree.
Now listen up because this part is very important: existence in all it's
form and splendor functions solely on one principle: God is infallible. To
prove God wrong would undo reality and everything that is. Up would become
down, black would become white, existence would become nothingness. In
essence - if they are allowed to enter that church, they'll unmake the
world.

                                  BETHANY

Are these guys that bitter?

                                 METATRON

No, that's the stupid part: they have no idea what their actions will
result in. As far as they know, they're just going home. Isn't that sweet?

                                  BETHANY

If this is so major, why are you talking to me? Why doesn't God do
something?

                                 METATRON

He could. He could blink them out of existence, destroy that church, turn
them into plants. But He'd rather see you take care of this one personally.

                                  BETHANY

Why me?

                                 METATRON

Because of who you are.

                                  BETHANY

And who am I?

                                 METATRON

The girl in the p.j.'s. Don't ask so many questions just serve your
purpose.

                                  BETHANY

I'll pass.

                                 METATRON

I beg your pardon?

                                  BETHANY

When some asshole abortion doctor destroyed my uterus -where was God? When
my

husband decided he couldn't be with a wife that couldn't bear his children
- where was

God? Now all the sudden, after all these years of quiet noninvolvement in
my life, He

sends one of His lackey's my way who tells me I should save the world, and
as what -

some sort of test? To Hell with Him.

                                 METATRON

Do yourself a favor Bethany - do the world a favor: let go of your petty
crap. It's served you precious little in the past, and it serves you even
less now when the fate of existence

hangs in the balance. Don't allow eons of history and life to get blinked
out of being just because you have a grudge against your creator.

                                  BETHANY

A grudge? Do you know why I work in that clinic? It's my own private way of
saying

"fuck you" to God.

                                 METATRON

And any other day I'd say that's your business and your life, and enjoy
yourself and goodnight. But this isn't about you - this is about eve~body.
So you lost the abiliry to make life. You're being offered the chance to
play mother to the world by acting like one and protecting it - saving it.

(swigs her drink and spits it out)

But I can't make you. You'll do what you will. However, if you should
decide to stop being selfish and accept your responsibility, you won't be
alone. You'll have support.

                                  BETHANY

What, more angels?

                                 NIETATRON

Prophets - although they don't quite get it yet. You'll know them right
away - one speaks, the other listens. The one who speaks - and he will at
great lengths, whether you want him to or not - will make mention of
himself as a prophet. The other one won't say anything, but he'll be
helpful

just the same.

(looks at watch)

I have to go. You'll do what you will, but try to remember that we're
working in a time frame here.

Metatron moves to exit.

                                  BETHANY

(beat)

Hey.

(Metatron turns)

You work for God.

                                 METATRON

They tell me it's God. If it's not, I'm going to be severely pissed - what
with all these years of bossing people around on his behalf and
expectorating perfectly good tequila.

                                  BETHANY

What's he like? God?

                                 METATRON

(thinks)

Lonely. But funny. He's got a great sense of humor.

                                  BETHANY

I'll bet.

                                 METATRON

Look at sex. Sex is funny. One time I asked him why you people had to look
so stupid while procreating. He said if you didn't, you'd do it all the
time, just for fun.

                                  BETHANY

But we do.

                                 METATRON

I know. And you all look so damn stupid doing it. It kills us upstairs.

                                  BETHANY

Sex is a joke in Heaven?

                                 METATRON

The way I understand it, it's mostly a joke down here too.

And with that, Nietatron is gone. Bethany looks at her drink. A three-man
mariachi band surround her and begin playing Prince's 'Little Red
Corvette'.

INT BETHANY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Bethany startles awake. The radio on her night-table plays 'Little Red
Corvette'. She lays back down.

INT BETHANY'S OFFICE - DAY

Bethany sits at her desk, staring into space. A twenty-something girl
speaks, butBethany's not really listening. She's extremely preoccupied.

INT CLINIC - NIGHT

Bethany shuts off the lights in the various rooms. She packs up her bag and
turns on the alarm.

EXT CLINIC - NIGHT

Bethany exits and locks the door behind her. She starts walking.

As her feet tread lightly toward her car, three small shadows move toward
her.

Bethany throws her bag on her car roof and rumages through her purse for
her keys. She hears something and stops. Roller blades can be heard moving
slowly across the asphalt of the parking lot. Bethany turns quickly.

Nobody's there. She looks around, a bit peturbed.

                                  BETHANY

(calling into the darkness)

God, what time do you people quit and go home?! Let's just save it for
tomorrow, alright?

There's no response. Then there's the noise of wood being tapped against
the ground. Bethany peers into the darkness, looking for the source.

Suddenly, a skater whips past her, slamming his stick into the back of her
knee. Bethany goes down. Another skater whips in and slashes at her, but
she ducks. The stick hits the car door above her. She rifles through her
purse madly until another skater whips by, dragging her purse away with his
stick. Bethany looks up.

The Stygian Triplets are lined up menacingly, a few feet from her. They tap
their hockey sticks in unison on the ground. Bethany jumps up and faces
them defensively. The Triplets emit an unholy shriek and charge at her.

And from out of nowhere, a large figure swoops down from above, landing on
the ground between Bethany and her menacers. The Triplets stop short and
regard the figure curiously. The large figure whips into a defensive
stance, Batman-style.

The Stygian Triplets look to one another. They shrug and charge anew.

From behind the rock-still large figure, a smaller figure leaps into the
streetlight, shrieking, flying through the air, busting into a flying kick.
He lands before the middle Triplet and open-palm punches him twice in the
face, grabbing his stick from the falling child's hand and tossing it into
the air behind him.

The stick sails through the night air and is snatched by the grip of the
large figure, who twirls it under his arm, and then back Out like a sai. He
swings it out before him, knocking the other two Triplets off balance. The
smaller figure back flips into the larger figure's arms and kicks his feet
into the faces of the two wobbling Triplets. They go down, and the smaller
figure leaps forward with a shriek, landing between the fallen pair, elbows
into their backs.

The flrst struck Triplet leaps out of the darkness at the large figure,
screaming something unholy. The large figure catches the kid by the throat
and quickly

head butts him, tossing him to the side. The large figure sways for a beat
and then shakes it off.

The small figure collects the hockey sticks and throws them into the
distance. He kicks at the falien Triplets as they scurry away.

                               SMALL FIGURE

(calling after them)

GO BACK TO YOUR PAPER ROUTES, YOU PUNK FUCKS!

(more to himself)

Snoogans.

The large figure saddles up beside the small figure. They look at one
another and shake hands.

                               SMALL FIGURE

Dude, I know they were just kids, but we kicked their fucking asses!

Bethany stares, mystified. She grabs her purse from the ground.

                                  BETHANY

Where... where did you learn to do... that stuff?!

                               SMALL FIGURE

From this comic book some guys made about us. Long story.

                                  BETHANY

(beat)

I don't know what to say... or think.

The figures turn into the light, revealing the faces of the heroes for the
first time - two very familiar faces.

                               SMALL FIGURE

Say you'll offer us sex as a reward.

                                  BETHANY

Who are you?

The large figure lights up a smoke. The small one extends his hand.

                               SMALL FIGURE

Jay. And this is my business associate, Silent Bob.

                                 BIETHANY

Well thank you for being out here so late... Come to think of it, what are
you doing out here so late?

(freezes)

Wait a second are you protestors?

                                    JAY

What's a protestor?

                                  BETHANY

You're not with the Fight-to-Lifer's?

                                    JAY

You mean those fucks with the signs and pictures of dead babies? Shit no.
Me and Silent Bob are pro-choice:a woman 5 body is her own fucking
business.

                                  BETHANY

Then - I don't mean to sound ungrateful - but what are you doing hanging
around?

                                    JAY

We're here to pick up chicks.

                                  BETHANY

(a bit stunned)

Excuse me?

                                    JAY

We figure an abortion clinic is a good place to meet loose women. Why else
would they be there unless they like to fuck.

                                  BETHANY

(taken aback)

Oh. Right. Well, I should be going. Thanks for the rescue... I think.

                                    JAY

(shocked)

Wait, wait, wait - we just saved your ass, and you're just going to take
off? What the shit is that?

                                  BETHANY

I had a weird night last night, and now tonight's not shaping up to be any
better. I think I should go home, take some percosets, and lay down.

(opens her car door)

                                    JAY

(to Silent Bob)

How about that shit? Fuck this town, man - I'm going back to Jersey and
selling weed~

(they start walking)

At least there I can get turned down while trying to make myself a profit.

Bethany freezes. Metatron's words echo in her ear. She shakes her head.

                                  BETHANY

(to herself)

You've gotta be kidding me.

(thinks for a beat; then) Hey! Wait!

She runs up to them. They whip around and raise their fists defensively.

                                  BETHANY

Sorry.

(beat)

Would you... I can't believe I'm doing this...

(inhales deeply)

Would you... like to have a drink with me?

Jay's face lights up. He punches Silent Bob in the arm.

                                    JAY

See?! I told you if we hung around outside that place we'd get laid! Thank
you!

(looking skyward)

Thank you, God!

INT SEEDY GUN SHOP - NIGHT

Various guns are laid out atop a glass case.

                                OC SALESMAN

Now this piece is nice. It's not lightweight, but one look at it and nobody
- I mean nobody - is going to fuck with you. Try it on.

Loki picks up the gun. Bartleby and the SALESMAN look at him.

                                   LOKI

It's a lot more compact than the flaming sword, I'll say that much.

                                 BARTLEBY

It's the weapon of choice these days.

                                   LOKI

It seems unimpressive. At least the sword looked intimidating. How can I
strike fear into the hearts of the wicked with this?

                                 SALESMAN

Oh, I get it. You want to become a vigilante, right? Like Batman or
something.

                                   LOKI

Batman never uses guns.

(off gun)

I don't know. It feels impersonal.

                                 BARTLEBY

Then don't use a gun. Just lay the place to waste like Sodom and Gommorah.
Now that was something.

                                   LOKI

Oh yeah, for you maybe. You got to stand there and read. I had to do all
the work.

                                 BARTLEBY

What work? You lit a few fires.

                                   LOKI

I rained down sulfur, man. There's a subtle difference.

                                 BARTLEBY

Sure.

                                   LOKI

Are you kidding me? Any moron with a pack of matches can start a fire.
Raining down sulfur takes a huge level of endurance. Mass genocide is the
most exhausting activity one can engage in, next to soccer.

(to Salesman)

I'll take this one.

                                 SALESMAN

Five seventy five to walk with it right now.

Loki starts sifting through his wallet.

                                 BARTLEBY

Soccer?

INT DINER - NIGHT

An English muffin is covered with a knife-full of jam. Bethany raises the
bread to her mouth and takes a bite. She glances at the OC pair and stops
chewing.

Jay and Silent Bob study her intently. Jay smiles widely, anticipatory, and
nods.

All three sit at a small table near a window. Bethany puts the English
muffin down and brushes off her hands. Jay's feet are moving a mile a
minute.

                                  BETHANY

Are you both from around here?

                                    JAY

I'm hard as hell.

                                  BETHANY

Do you live in the city?

                                    JAY

Do you have a friend for Silent Bob, or are you going to do us both? If so,
I'm first. I hate sloppy seconds.

                                  BETHANY

You're a man of principle. Where do you come from?

                                    JAY

We used to live in a small town in Jersey. Real small town. We practically
knew everybody.

                                  BETHANY

What brought you to McHenry?

                                    JAY

Hollywood.

                                  BETHANY

(beat)

Hollywood?

                                    JAY

Oh yeah. See, we used to sell smoke in front of this video store. And one
day this fuck wants to rent a video. So we did, only we didn't have
anyplace to watch it. So we went to the mall and popped it into a VCR at
Macy's and sat on the floor and watched it. It was called 'Sixteen
Candles'. Did you ever see it?

                                  BETHANY

Yes.

                                    JAY

So the next day we rented 'The Breakfast Club', and then 'Weird Science'
where these two fucks have a chick that'll do anything for them and they
don't do nothing because it's a PG movie. But then we got thrown out of
Macy's when we watched 'Pretty in Pink', because of this bitch.

(points to Silent Bob)

                                  BETHANY

(to Silent Bob)

What'd you do?

                                    JAY

You know how at the end the red-headed bitch gets together with her dream
guy at the prom?

(Bethany nods)

Well pussy here starts fuckin' sobbing all sorts of loud and shit. And the
manager's like "Get the hell out of here!" And I'm like "Fuck you, you bald
cocksucker! I'll kick your lard..

                                  BETHANY

(speeding him along)

So what exactly brought you to Illinois?

                                    JAY

Oh yeah. See, all these movies take place in a town called Shermer, in
Illinois. And there's all this fine bush running around, and we could kick
all the dude's asses because they're all whiney pussies. Except Judd Nelson
- he was harsh. But best of all, there was no one selling weed. So I says
to Silent Bob "Man, we could live phat if we were the blunt-connection in
Shermer, Illinois!" So we collected some cash we were owed, and caught a
bus. But when we got here,

you know what we found Out? There is no Shermer in Illinois. What kind of
shit is that?! Fucking movies are bullshit!

                                  BETHANY

And now you live here?

                                    JAY

Fuck that. This berg sucks. Everyone talks with a stupid accent so you
don't know what they're saying, and it's too fuckin' cold. We were talking
about taking off. Until we met you, that is.

(kisses her hand)

                                  BETHANY

(retracts her hand)

Right. So how much longer are you staying here?

                                    JAY

Until you're ready to skip out and make with the sex.

                                  BETHANY

No. How long are you staying in McHenry?

                                    JAY

We're leaving tomorrow.

                                  BETHANY

Where are you going next?

                                    JAY

(to Silent Bob)

Jesus - this broad asks alot of questions.

(to Bethany)

Back to Jersey. We've been going straight for like five

years now. It's about time for us to retire or something. Enjoy our salad
years. No more adventures.

                                  BETHANY

I see.

(sips her coffee)

                                    JAY

Yeah. So do you do anal? Is it true that chicks fart if you blast them in
the ass?

                                  BETHANY

I didn't ask you out for sex.

                                    JAY

I'll take head.

                                  BETHANY

I don't know why, but...

(composes herself)

...I want to go with you.

                                    JAY

What, like steady? You wanna be my girlfriend?

(shrugs to Silent Bob)

Alright, but Silent Bob has to live with us and you pay the rent.

                                  BETHANY

No, I want to go with you to New Jersey.

                                    JAY

Really? You're the only chick I ever met that wanted to go to Jersey. Most
chicks try to get out.

                                  BETHANY

When can we leave?

                                    JAY

Wait a second! What is this shit? Are we going fuck or not?

                                  BETHANY

You're going to lead me somewhere.

                                    JAY

Me lead you? Lady, I don't even know where I am half the time. If we're not
going to fuck then what the hell did you ask me out for?

                                  BETHANY

Someone told me I'd meet you, and you'd take me somewhere I was supposed to
go. I didn't believe it until you said that thing in the parking lot.

                                    JAY

What the hell are you babbling about? All I know is we saved your ass from
some angry fucking dwarfs and you promised us se~..

(to Silent Bob)

Didn't this crazy bitch promise us sex?

(to Bethany)

...and now you're telling me that I'm supposed to take you somewhere, and
you don't even know where it is?

                                  BETHANY

(beat)

Do you believe in God?

                                    JAY

(horrified)

Holy shit - you're a Jehovah's Witness! All the fine chicks that come out
of that place, and we gotta get the one Jesus freak!

(to Silent Bob, getting up)

Let's go...

                                  BETHANY

(grabbing his sleeve)

No. wait...

                                    JAY

(pulling back)

I'll scream rape.

                                  BETHANY

I can pay you.

                                    JAY

(quickly sitting back down)

Pay?

                                  BETHANY

For being my guide. You were going to leave anyway; all I'm asking is to
tag along and see where it leads. I'll pay a hundred bucks and all
expenses.

                                    JAY

(thinks; to Silent Bob)

I feel like I'm Han Solo, and you're Chewie, and she's Ben Kenobi, and
we're in that fucked up bar.

(to Bethany)

What about sex?

                                  BETHANY

No sex.

                                    JAY

Alright, but let's say we're caught in a situation where we've got like
five minutes to live, like a bomb or something is gonna go off - would you
fuck us then?

                                  BETHANY

In that highly unlikely situation?

(beat)

Yeah, sure.

                                    JAY

Yeah? You slut. Noonch.

(to Silent Bob)

What do you think?

Silent Bob shrugs. Jay stands up.

                                    JAY

Alright. But I'll drive.

EXT MAIN HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Bethany's car roars overhead, speeding down the road, reving awfully
loudly.

INT BETHANY'S CAR - NIGHT

The speedometer reads ninety five.

Jay drives, eyes glued to the road. happy as hell. Silent Bob smokes to his
right. Bethany sits pinned against the back seat, wearing an uncomfortable
and dubious look. She struggles to lean forward. The engine still races.

                                  BETHANY

(yelling over engine noise)

What gear are you in?

                                    JAY

(not looking back)

Gear?

EXT HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Jay, Silent Bob, and Bethany sit on and against the car. The hood is open
and smoke billows out.

                                    JAY

(defensively)

Well what do I know from shifting?! Like I ever drove before!

Silent Bob shrugs and smokes. Bethany walks away, shaking her head.

                                    JAY

Chicks.

Silent Bob nods and extracts a tool from his jacket. He begins working on
the engine as a cross~ountry bus races by.

INT BUS - NIGHT

Bartleby and Loki sit in the back. Bartleby reads a map and Loki stares at
the gun in his lap. A COUPLE makes out in the seat in front of them.

                                 BARTLEBY

We have to pass through three more states to get to New Jersey: Indianna,
Ohio, and Pennsylvania.

                                   LOKI

With a very important stop in Cleveland.

                                 BARTLEBY

Oh right. The Angel of Death Returns. Sounds like a bad movie.

                                   LOKI

Movies are bullshit. And don't start with me, airight. The last time you
bugged me about my job, you got us sentenced to life in Wisconsin.

(looks out window)

All this time we've been down here, why didn't we ever leave the Cheese?

                                 BARTLEBY

He said to stay where he put us. We feared worse punishment if we disobeyed
Him again.

                                   LOKI

Where were we afraid He'd send us?

                                 BARTLEBY

New Jersey.

                                   LOKI

Now that, my friend. is irony.

                                 BARTLEBY

(beat)

You know, maybe you're wrong about this slaughter. How can you even be sure
of what incurs the Lord's wrath these days? Times change. Remember when
eating meat on Friday was supposed to be a Hellworthy tresspass? Or when
people weren't even supposed to shop on Sundays?

                                   LOKI

That stuff was small potatoes. The major sins never change. And believe me
- I can spot a commandment breaker a mile away.

                                 BARTLEBY

Sure.

                                   LOKI

You don't believe me?

(looks around; eyes fall on kissing couple)

There. There's one.

                                 BARTLEBY

(off couple)

So what? They're kissing.

                                   LOKI

Adultery.

                                 BARTLEBY

That's a stretch. How do you know they're not dating?

                                   LOKI

You'd know better than me - let's hear it.

                                 BARTLEBY

Oh, I know the truth. But let's see how boned up on the job you really are.

                                   LOKI

A test?

                                 BARTLEBY

Of sorts. So what's your proof?

                                   LOKI

He's wearing a wedding band.

                                 BARTLEBY

So? Maybe that's his wife.

                                   LOKI

No married man kisses his wife like that. You get married and the passion
dies, man. Don't you ever watch talk shows?

                                 BARTLEBY

What are you talking about?

                                   LOKI

A guy makes his best plays when wooing. When the object of his desire is
won, there's no need to expend the effort anymore. He relaxes, satisfied
with the spoils of victory, which he then decides isn't so victorious
because he's saddled with a life-mate.

                                 BARTLEBY

Very romantic sentiment.

                                   LOKI

That's the problem - romance. You think about it :back in the old days,
nobody got married out of quote, unquote, love. People married for
property', dowries, or to procreate - to immortalize oneself through
offspring. When did all this love stuff start? What the hell happened to
the status quo?

                                 BARTLEBY

The Troubadors.

                                   LOKI

Lionel Richie's old group?

                                 BARTLEBY

No, that's the Commodores. The Troubadors were wandering minstrels and
dramatists that sang melodramatic and sappy songs of undying love.

                                   LOKI

Sounds like the Commodores.

                                 BARTLEBY

The Troubadors made 'love' fashionable. And their influence altered the
balance in a significant fashion. Until them, people got married because
they had to. After them, people started 'falling in love'. Romantic
courtships became the norm. What started out as simple entertainment made
such a dramatic impact as to forever alter the way society operates.

                                   LOKI

That's human beings for you - easily misled. From the Garden of Eden to the
'Thigh Master' - thev believe what they're told. I'm telling you - one day
they're all going to watch one too many John Hughes flicks and start
looking for Shermer, Illinois.

                                 BARTLEBY

Be fair. Humans are dumb, but not that dumb.

(off couple)

So is it adultery or not?

                                   LOKI

(thinks; to couple)

Excuse me.

The Couple stops kissing. The MAN looks at Loki.

                                   LOKI

Are you married?

                                    MAN

(puzzled)

Why?

                                   LOKI

Just curious.

                                    MAN

(holds up ring finger)

What do you think?

The Man shakes his head and goes back to kissing. Bartleby offers Loki a
"Satisfled?' expression. Loki taps the Man on the shoulder.

                                    MAN

(breaks kiss; pissed)

What?!

                                   LOKI

To her?

                                    MAN

What?

                                   LOKI

Are you married to her?

                                    MAN

Not that it's any of your fucking business, but no! Why?!

Loki looks at Bartleby. Bartleby rolls his eyes. Loki calmly shoots the man
in the head. Screaming ensues.

EXT HIGHWAY - NIGHT

The bus skids to a halt. People flock off in a panic. scattering. After a
beat, Bartleby and Loki deboard and stand there alone.

                                 BARTLEBY

You're such an asshole.

                                   LOKI

Don't blame me, man. Blame the Commodores.

                                 BARTLEBY

Troubadors.

EXT ROADSIDE OF HIGHWAY - DAWN

Silent Bob still tools around under the hood, Jay hands him various
wrenches. Bethany steams off to the side.

                                    JAY

(to Silent Bob)

She's pissed, dude. She'll never fuck us now. Well,

maybe you, but definitely not me.

(beat)

Let me know how she is.

                                  BETHANY

(turns on him)

Nobody is fucking me! You got that?!

                                    JAY

At least not in this car.

                                  BETHANY

(sighs)

I'm sorry I dragged you to that diner. I don't know what I was thinking.
But being that I've decided to go home and not to New Jersey, this is where
you two get off.

                                    JAY

You're breaking up with us?

                                  BETHANY

Good luck with finding Molly Ringwald, or whoever it is vou're looking for.
Sorry for the inconvenience. Good bye.

Bethany starts walking away. Jay stares at her, shocked.

                                    JAY

(to Bethany)

Who the hell do you think you are, lady? You can't go around breaking
people's hearts like that! We fell in love with you! Guys like us don't
just fall out of the sky, you know!

On cue, a naked black MAN falls from the sky. landing between the two
parties. Bethany and Jay stare at him. The Man is face down, sooty, and
ashen - as if he's just been in a fire. Bethany drops to her knees and
rolls him over, feeling for a pulse. Jay looks down, then looks skyward as
Silent Bob joins him.

                                    JAY

(yelling up)

A beautiful, naked woman doesn't just fall from the sky, you know?!

(beat; to Silent Bob)

Was worth a try.

Silent Bob nods. Bethany presses her ear to the man's chest.

                                  BETHANY

No heartbeat.

                                    JAY

Do you think he fell from a plane? Like 'Alive'? Did you ever see that
flick?

                                  BETHANY

(starts CPR'ing him)

I think there would have been more of a mess if he fell from that high.

                                    MAN

Not necessarily.

Bethany, Jay, and Silent Bob leap back. The man sits up and rubs his face.

                                    JAY

KILL IT!! KILL IT!!

                                    MAN

That sounds familiar.

                                  BETHANY

Jesus, are you okay?

                                    MAN

Rufus. And yes, I'm fine.

                                    JAY

He's the fuckin' undead!! Cut his head off!!

                                   RUFUS

(getting up with Bethany's help)

What happened to your car? You clock ninety in first gear or something?

                                    JAY

Mind your own fucking business!

                                   RUFUS

(to Jay)

Listen, goldie-locks, what I just did was not easy and it ga\e me a fucking
migraine. Now if you don't pipe down, I'm going to rip your balls off.

                                    JAY

(hiding behind Silent Bob)

I knew it! Mother fucker wants to eat my brain!

                                  BETHANY

I think he was aiming a bit further south.

(to Rufus)

Speaking of which, you're awfully nude - Rufus, is it?

                                   RUFUS

Rufus it is, Miss.

(to Silent Bob)

Hey, tubby... how's about lending a brother your coat 'till I can find my
own threads?

Jay looks at Silent Bob.

                                    JAY

Dude, he fell out of thin air!

Silent Bob shrugs and passes his coat to Rufus. Jay bugs.

                                    JAY

Dude, his dick is gonna be rubbing all over the inside of your armor!

                                   RUFUS

(to Silent Bob)

I'll do my best to tuck it back, brother.

Silent Bob nods. Something OC catches his eye. He stares OC and exits.

                                  BETHANY

Where exactly did you fall from?

                                   RUFUS

Some might say grace.

                                    JAY

(to Silent Bob)

Dude, he's talking about your mom.

Jay turns to see that Silent Bob isn't there.

Silent Bob peers at a large bush at the road side. The bush rustles
slightly.

                                OC BETHANY

You know, normally I'd have a hard time with this, but somehow you falling
out of the sky seems to go hand in glove with some of the other stuff I've
been deaiing with.

                                 OC RUFUS

Believe me - you ain't seen nothing yet.

Silent Bob peers closer at the bush. Suddenly - a Stygian Triplet leaps out
at him, pinning him to the ground with his hockey stick.

The other two Triplets leap on top of Jay and BETHANY

Rufus grabs the one off Bethany and hurls him to the side.

Jay manages to reach into his jacket and pull out a copy of Penthouse. He
rolls it up and starts beating the kid in the head with it.

Silent Bob gets his hands under the stick that pins him and pushes it up
hard, into the Triplet's forhead, knocking him off. He rushes to Jay's side
and plies the other Triplet from his throat, hurling him OC.

The Triplet Silent Bob fought 'punctures' the air with his stick and rips
downward, creating a 'hole'. He grabs his friend and leaps into it,
disappearing.

Jay and Silent Bob look at eachother, blink, and embrace passionately.

The Triplet that Rufus threw rushes Rufus from behind - hockey stick in
lancing position. Without looking back, Rufus reaches behind himself,
grabbing the stick and swinging it (and the Triplet) over his head in an
arch, letting go. The last Triplet goes sailing through the 'hole', and it
seals shut.

Bethany, Jay and Silent Bob are in various wide-eyed states of shock.

                                    JAY

Alright - what's with you, lady?! That's the second time you got attacked
by the fucking Mighty Ducks!

                                   RUFUS

(wiping off hands)

Man, they're onto you bad, already. I got here just in time.

                                  BETHANY

How can you be so composed? We were almost killed.

                                   RUFUS

Death is a worry of the living. The dead only worry about decay and
necrophiliacs.

                                    JAY

See! I told you he was the undead!

                                  RU FUS

Not the undead, the dead. I died. Christ told me the secret to resurrection
once when we were at a wedding in Canna, but I got drunk and forgot it.

                                  BETHANY

                               (incredulous)

Wait. wait, wait - Christ? You knew Christ?

                                   RUFUS

Knew him? I saw him naked.

                                  BETHANY

Let me guess - you're another angel?

                                   RUFUS

No, I'm a man - just like you and him.

(looks at Jay)

Well, maybe not like him. At least I was a man. Been dead for nearly two
thousand years. Here.

(pulls rolled up paper from behind his ear)

                                    JAY

No wonder he saw Jesus - homey's rockin' the ganj.

                                  BETHANY

(unrollingit)

It's not a joint.

(looks at it)

I can't read this.

                                   RUFUS

It's Sanskiit. It says "Rufus - see you in two years. Jesus." Freaked me
out because he basically told me when my number was up. Took the flavor out
of the remaining years. Look, we gotta keep moving. If we stay in one place
long enough, those things are liable to come back. What say we continue
this discussion over something to eat?

                                  BETHANY

(snaps)

WAIT A SECOND!

(inhales deeply)

I'm a rational woman, okay. All I want to know is where you, and those...
kids came from?!

                                   RUFUS

They came from Hell. I came from Heaven.

(walking away)

Let's start walking.

                                    JAY

Walk? Do you know how far we are from anywhere?

                                   RUFUS

Back in the old days with J.C., we walked everywhere. Did you ever hear of
a fat apostle?

(exits)

Bethany looks to Jay and Silent Bob for some guidance or stability.

                                    JAY

What's an apostle?

Bethany shakes her head and exits. Jay and Silent Bob shrug at each other.

EXT MOOBY CORP. BUILDING - DAWN

A large office building in downtown Cleveland. The city. hasn't started up
yet. A pickup truck pulls curbside in front of the structure. Bartleby and
Loki jump out of the back and pat the side of the truck. offering waved
thank-you's to the driver. As the truck pulls away, Loki pulls out the
article and looks at it. He looks up at the building and nods to Bartleby,
smiling. They head toward the front doors.

INT QUAlNT SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAWN

A ringing phone is answered by the unseen figure in the chair. We move from
the seated Figure, passing by the dead bodies of the home's original
owners, and come to a stop on the bruised and worn Stygian Triplets seated
on a couch. They look scared.

                                  FIGURE

Hello?... No, they're not in right now... I'm the phone guy... I'll leave
them a message... Bye.

The Figure hangs up the phone and rises.

                                  FIGURE

You say the girl has already met the prophets?

The Stygian Triplets nod.

                                  FIGURE

She grows closer to learning her true identity. If that happens, our plan
is jeopardized. I can't afford to go into the field - that might compromise
us further. The best course of action is to insure that our parcel is not
found. And being that I can't even trust you enough to kill a girl, I'm
left with no choice but to seek outside assistance in guarding our package.

(sighs)

I'm going to have to summon the Golgothan.

The Figure exits. The Stygian Triplets register shock.

EXT FAST FOOD JOINT - DAWN

Rufus - now wearing some funky new clothes - carries a tray of fast food to
an outdoor table. Sitting already are Bethany, Jay, and Silent Bob.

                                   RUFUS

(off new clothes)

It's amazing the shit people throw out. Didn't I tell you I'd find some
threads?

A car full of teens whip past them.

                                   TEEN

(yelling from passing car)

GARBAGE PICKER!

                                   RUFUS

(waves to them)

Thank you.

(to group)

What's that mean?

                                    JAY

It means they saw you pull that shit out of that dumpster.

                                   RUFUS

So it's a good thing, then.

(handing coat back to Silent Bob)

I appreciate the loan, brother. You can have this back.

                                    JAY

(to Silent Bob)

Lucky you.

                                   RUFUS

(off food)

Damn, I remember when all we used to have for breakfast was fish and goat's
milk. What do you call this shit?

                                  BETHANY

(to Rufus)

Egg McMuffin. Now how about you start explaining some things to me.

                                   RUFUS

Like what?

                                  BETHANY

Like - for starters - who the hell are those kids that keep attacking me?

                                   RUFUS

Nasty little bastards called the Stygian Triplets. They're not really
related. When they were alive they were a trio of kids that snatched a
neighbor's toddler and smashed it's skull in - "just to see what it looked
like" I believe was their defense. They were killed in a car wreck on the
way to a detention center.

                                  BETHANY

So they're dead too?

                                   RUFUS

You'd be surprised how many dead people are just walking around - we're
stubborn bastards. Thing is, those kids are supposed to be in Hell. Which
means that someone wants you out of the picture so badly they're willing to
summon demons.

                                  BETHANY

Is it those two angels I'm supposed to stop?

                                   RUFUS

Couldn't be. They're not evil - they're just stupid.

                                    JAY

(to Bethany)

Wait a minute - are you going to listen to this shit? We don't even know
who this guy is. For all you know, he's in with those fucks. They both
showed up at the same time.

                                  BETHANY

I hate to say it - but he does have a point. How did you know where to find
us?

                                   RUFUS

You know what the dead do with most of their time? They watch the living.
Especially in the shower.

                                    JAY

(to Silent Bob)

I can't wait to die.

                                  BETHANY

And why are you watching me?

                                   RUFUS

Because you're the one who's going to help me get some changes made in that
book you all hold so much stock in.

                                    JAY

Hustler?

                                   RUFUS

The Bible.

                                  BETHANY

What's your beef with the Bible?

                                   RUFUS

I'm not in it.

                                    JAY

Neither are any of us, but you don't hear us bitching.

                                   RUFUS

But I'm supposed to be in it. I was the Thirteenth Apostle.

                                  BETHANY

I've been going to church my entire life and I've never heard of a
thirteenth apostle named Rufus.

                                   RUFUS

See? You know all about the other twelve Apostles -white boys, I might add.
But no mention of Rufus. And why? Cause I'm a black man. But that's just my
pet peeve. I mainly want to correct a major error that you people are
basing a faith on.

                                  BETHANY

What's that?

                                   RUFUS

Jesus wasn't white; He was black.

Rufus bites into his sandwhich. Bethany, Jay and Silent Bob look at him and
then each other.

                                    JAY

Bullshit. I've seen pictures of Jesus, and He has blonde hair and blue
eyes.

                                   RUFUS

(wiping hands)

That's what's particularly insulting. Between the time when He established
the faith and the church started to officially organize, the powers-that-be
decided that while the message of Christ was integral, the fact that He was
black was a detriment. So all renderings were ordered to be Eurocentric,
even though the brother was blacker than Jesse.

                                  BETHANY

If that's true, then why'd He get written about while you were left out?

                                   RUFUS

Well He is the Son of God, right? It's kind of hard to have the New
Testament without him. So you fudge a few facts and put a spin on His
ethnicity. Leaving me out's okay because there's still Twelve apostles to
choose from.

                                    JAY

I don't buy it.

                                   RUFUS

That's what the good people of Antioch were saying when they stoned my ass.

                                  BETHANY

You were martyred?

                                   RUFUS

That's one way of putting it. Another way is to say I was bludgeoned to
shit by big rocks. See - Christ told us Apostles to go out into the world
and spread His word. Antioch was already garnering a big Christian
following, so I got sent there. And was a big hit. They loved hearing about
Jesus' message, and how He was the Redeemer. But when I mentioned He was
black, the whole town turned on me - called me a liar and shit. I pressed
the point, and before I know it, I'm wearing stones - although not to
accessonze.

                                 BETH ANY

Why didn't you just let the point go when you saw how they were reacting?

                                   RUFUS

Because it's part of the facts. White folks only want to hear the good
shit: life eternal, a place in God's kingdom. As soon as they hear they're
getting all this from a black Jesus, they freak. And that - my friends - is
called Hypocrisy. Folks just can't accept a black Savior.

(to Silent Bob)

You going to eat that hash brown?

                                  BETHANY

So you went to Heaven?

                                   RUFUS

Shit yeah; it was the least the brother could do. I gave up my sheep and
followed His ass around Jerusalem for three years. And in all that time,
did I ever get laid? Hell no! But I didn't bitch, because I was into His
message. And while the message is what counts, folks should know that He
was black. That's why I'm going to help you find stop those angels from
getting to that church in exchange for you helping me with my campaign.

                                  BETHANY

How do you know about that?

                                   RUFUS

Heaven's a pretty boring place, and anything that breaks the tedium is
news. The unmaking of existence is what you might consider a great
tediumbreaker. Besides, there isn't much I don't know about you.

                                  BETHANY

I find that hard to believe.

                                   RUFUS

When you were five you let a kid from next door piss on your hand.

                                    JAY

(shocked)

You did that?

                                  BETHANY

Yeah... but I never told anyone about it.

                                   RUFUS

Neither did he. He died of Leukemia two years later. His name was...

                                  BETHANY

...BryanJohnson.

                                   RUFUS

Your exploits - no matter how inane - are well-known in Heaven. Probably in
Hell, too.

Bethany rubs her temples and exits OC. Rufus watches her go.

                                    JAY

(intrigued)

Tell me something about me.

                                   RUFUS

(preoccupied with the OC Bethany)

You masturbate more than anybody else on the planet.

                                    JAY

Shit, everyone knows that. Tell me something nobody knows.

                                   RUFUS

You think about guys when you do it.

Rufus gets up and exits. Silent Bob looks at Jay, shocked.

                                    JAY

Not all the time!

Bethany sits on a swing in the kiddie-jungle gym, shaking her head. Rufus
joins her.

                                   RUFUS

I'm sorty if I spooked you.

                                  BETHANY

I just feel... violated. Like my life isn't mine exclusively.

                                   RUFUS

That's the way it goes with celebrities.

                                  BETHANY

What are you talking about? I'm a nobody. I'm just a quiet girl from the
suburbs who counsels pregnant teens.

                                   RUFUS

You sound like Christ. He had the same reaction when He found out who He
was, minus the quiet girl from the 'burbs angle. And like Him, I'm sure
you'll come to terms and do what you're supposed to.

                                  BETHANY

Why not get the pope or someone holy like that?

                                   RUFUS

Just because a guy wears a funny hat, doesn't make him the right man for
the job. Only certain hands can deliver the world from the brink of
destruction. last time it was Jesus - this time it's you.

                                  BETHANY

Why me?

                                   RUFUS

Can't say yet. But the question is - are your hands capable enough to carry
the burden. It all rides on you.

                                  BFTRANY

(rubbing her temples)

Two thirds of me wants to forget about this and go home. You know,
yesterday I wasn't sure God even existed. And now I'm upto my ass in
Christian Mythology.

                                   RUFUS

God hates it when it's referred to as Mythology.

                                  BFTHANY

Well then let's ask the quote, unquote 'prophets' what we should call it
instead.

(looking OC; concerned)

Now where did those two assholes go?

INT STRIP JOINT

It's your typical strip club. One woman on a stage and a crowd of men
paying way-too-much attention. The place is dimly lit with red lights and
chock full of smoke. Off to one side, a dee-jay spins records, blasting the
music. The crowd is rather thin.

Jay and Silent Bob sit at the stage. their eyes glued on...

The DANCER - a gorgeous, shapely vixen with very little clothing on, and
growing littler by the second.

Jay pokes Silent Bob, who produces a wad of bills. They skim off a nice
pile and stow the rest. They spread their piles neatly on the bar. The
Dancer smiles and starts dancing toward them. Jay holds up a five-spot and
performs his own little seductive dance ~th it. He stands at the edge of
the stage, ~'rating. The Dancer slinks over and Jay stuffs the five in her
G-string. She rubs his head and slinks away. Jay humps Silent Bob's chair,
excitedly. Bethany and Rufus come up from behind them. Bethany hits Jay.

                                  BETHANY

(shouting above the music)

What are you doing?

                                    JAY

Proving to this bastard that I ain't gay.

                                  BETHANY

What?

                                   RUFUS

Long story - forget it. But we should get moving. How can we get to New
Jersey?

                                  BETHANY

I had a car.

She slaps Jay upside the head, but - riveted by the Dancer - he doesn't
feel it.

                                  BETHANY

(to Rufus)

We could go by train.

                                   RUFUS

(looking OC)

Sounds cool.

                                  BETHANY

There's a phone out there. I'll call for reservations.

Rufus is now also riveted by a table dancer off to the side.

                                  BETHANY

No, it's okay. I can handle it.

Rufus half-nods. Bethany shakes her head and exits.

The Dancer gyrates on the stage, revealing more and more of herself.

Jay pounds on the stage, hoots, and dances, flashing more bills.

ACROSS THE STAGE a small GANG of bandanna-wearing, angry-looking blacks
watch the OC Jay with little amusement. The Dancer dances toward them.

                                    JAY

(banging on stage)

Sweet thing!

(Hashes another five)

Look what I found! Snoog!

The Dancer smiles as she approaches Jay, but is interrupted by more
banging.

The GANG LEADER has his foot on the stage. He produces a ten dollar bill
from his jacket and casually holds it up. The other three members of his
posse smile and slap hands.

The Dancer shrugs at the shocked Jay and changes direction, heading toward
the Gang. Jay casts a horrified look at Silent Bob.

The Gang Leader leans forward, preparing to tip when we hear an obnoxiously
loud throat~learing.

Jay holds aloft a twenty, smiling and nodding.

The Dancer shrugs at the Gang Leader and again switches direction. The Gang
Leader looks at his posse, who shake their heads at him, disappointedly.

The Stage becomes a bidding table, as - on one side - the Gang Leader
produces two twenties. On the other side, jay - staring at the Gang Leader
- produces three twenties. The Gang Leader hits his posse up for more cash.
Jay hits Silent Bob up for more cash. The Dancer stays in the middle,
gyrating and sizing up the best offer.

Jay then produces the creme'de Ia creme': three hundred dollar bills. He
sneers at the OC Gang Leader. The Dancer heads over to jay and wraps her
legs around him from the stage, gyrating against his groin. Jay stares at
the Gang Leader, a victorious smirk on his face.

The Gang Leader shakes his head angrily and jumps out of his seat,
producing a gun from his jacket. He fires into the ceiling. The music
scratches to a halt and the other viewers scatter toward the door. The Gang
Leader points his piece at Jay, his posse backing him up.

                                GANG LEADER

You a smart ass, ain'tcha, white boy? Come in here and ruin my good time.

                                    JAY

It's a free country. The bitch just came to the man with the most.

                                  DANCER

Bitch?

                                    JAY

No offense, baby.

                                GANG LEADER

The bitch is gonna be leaving with the man with the most - the man with the
most led in his piece. While you and tubby are leaving with the most led in
your dead fucking carcasses, know what I'm sayin?

                                    JAY

(to Dancer)

Step to the side, baby. I've gotta slap this pussyass, Nino Brown wanna-be
down.

                                  DANCER

(to Gang Leader)

Come on, Kane. This isn't necessary.

                                GANG LEADER

Shut the fuck up and back away from the midget!

The Dancer moves to the side.

                                GANG LEADER

(to Jay)

Now I believe you were about to apologize. I believe you were about to
intone some pleas for mercy. You were about to say "Please, Mister Kane, I
didn't mean to disrespect you in your club. Please accept my most humble
apology.

Bethany comes back and sees the mess. She moves to rush to Jay's side, but
Rufus holds her back An OC Jay laughs.

Jay leans on Silent Bob, laughing. The Gang stares back, angrily.

                                    JAY

You want an apology?

                                GANG LEADER

(cocks gun)

Give me at least one "I'm sorry," and ltll put a kill shot through that
thick fucking skull of your's. Otherwise we go slow and long in the pain
dispensation.

                                    JAY

(beat; zips jacket closed)

Know what I'm doing?

                                GANG LEADER

No. What you doing?

                                    JAY

I'm closing my jacket, so that when we start this up, I don't get your
filthy fucking brain guts all over my shirt. You know why?

                                GANG LEADER

Why?

                                    JAY

Because you can't get shit stains out of flannel. What I'm saying is that
you got shit for brains.

The Gang Leader and his posse stare silently for a moment.

                                GANG LEADER

Well I appreciate you breaking that down for me, but I got it without the
explanation.

                                    JAY

No. No, I don't think you did get it. See, there's gonna he some nine's
firing in here, and when the bullets stop flyin', your cunt-lip ass is
gonna be all holes and smoke. You think you can draw on me and walk away?
Fuck that. And fuck you - you punk-ass monkey bitch! Yeah, I called you a
monkey! Maybe if you kiss my dick all nice before I cap you, I'll bring a
coconut to your funeral and lay it on your grave; stick a straw through it
and stick the other end in the ground. Your lips'll reach.

The Gang stares, mystified. Rufus and Bethany can't move they're so
frightened.

                                    JAY

You think every white boy cowers at your ass? Shit, if I don't fucking
plant you - watermelon - my muscle here will.

(thumbs at Silent Bob)

What do you think he is? My boy friend? I love chicks. So he's gotta be
with me for one reason: to watch my back. Silent Bob doesn't talk in words
- he speaks in bullets. Re's all quiet cause he's thinking about how he's
gonna take you and your bitches out quick enough to piss on the bullets in
your bodies before they cool down. You know why? Because he likes to see
the hot steam coming off them when he sprays them down. Come to think of
it, I~m tired of talking to your dumb ass; you probably don't even
understand big words like 'piss'. Tell you what - I'll let him explain it
to you.

(to Silent Bob)

Silent Bob - shoot these punk-monkey bitches.

Silent Bob slowly raises his hands in a surrender fashion. Jay looks at
him.

                                    JAY

What are you waiting for?!

Silent Bob shrugs.

                                    JAY

(flabbergasted)

YOU DON'T RAVE A GUN?!?

Silent Bob kind of nods

                                    JAY

(shocked)

WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU MEAN? ALL THIS TIME WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER, AND YOU DON'T
HAVE A GUN?!?

Silent Bob indicates the negative, sheepishly.

                                    JAY

THAT'S JUST FUCKING GREAT! DO YOU THINK I

WOULD'VE SAID ALL THAT IF I'D KNOWN YOU

DIDN'T HAVE A GUN?!?

(beat)

HUNHH?!?

Silent Bob raises his eyebrows remorsefully. The Gang snickers and smiles.

GANG LEADER

What was that about a coconut?

Jay shakes his head and glowers at Silent Bob.

                                    JAY

No gun! What the fuck kind of muscle are you?! All this time and you got no
gun!

GANG LEADER

Oh boys! We have some unfinished business here.

                                    JAY

(sheepishly)

Can we talk this over?

                                GANG LEADER

Tell you what - you got thirty seconds. Then I cap you. Talk all you like.

Bethany goes to make a move, but Rufus holds her back, shaking his head. He
puts a finger to his lips to quiet her and points back toward the action,
smiling.

Jay fumes.

                                    JAY

(to Silent Bob)

I can't believe you.

(to Gang Leader)

Do me a favor.

(points to Silent Bob)

Shoot this piece of shit first.

(to Silent Bob; disgusted)

No gun!

Suddenly, they both snap into a momentary trance. Zombie-like, Jay and
Silent Bob step to the turntables behind them. Jay puts on headphones and
begins scratching a record. A familiar tune begins.

The Gang watches, perplexed.

Silent Bob whips around, microphone in his hand, and begins to sing.

                                SILENT BOB

HEY, HEY, HEY!!! IT'S FAT ALBERT!

AND I'M GONNA SING A SONG FOR YOU!!

AND BILL'S GONNA TELL YOU A THING OR TWO!!

WE'LL HAVE SOME FUN, NOW!

WITH BILL AND ALL THE GANG!

LEARNING FROM EACH OTHER -

WHILE WE DO OUR THANG!

The Gang slowly goes from perplexity to enjoyment. The Gang Leader softens
and smiles, adding a slight nod of approval. Jay provides back-up.

                                    JAY

NA , NA, NA! GON NA HAVE A GOOD TIME!

                                SILENT BOB

(as Fat Albert)

HEY! HEY! HEY!

                                    JAY

NA. NA. NA! GONNA HAVE A GOOD TIME!

Bethany and Rufus look on. amazed.

                                   RUFUS

I thought she looked familiar.

                                  BETHANY

Who?

                                   RUFUS

(he nods toward the stage)

Serendipity.

Bethany looks to the stage.

The Dancer is the SERENDIPITY in question. She wipes sweat from her brow.

INT. MOOBY CORP. BOARDROOM - DAY

Oh, this isn't your standard boardroom; this is Mooby Corp., home of Mooby,
the Golden Calf - which can only be described as a bovine variation on
Barney: sickeningly simple and very non-threatening. A large table sits in
the middle, a media center behind the huge chair at the head. The walls are
adorned with framed posters of Mooby, playing with kids, mouth agape in a
stupid smile. At the center of the table is a large, gold plated statue of
the insipid creature.

Doors open and the boardroom fills with suits - six men, one woman. They
chatter and take their seats. After a beat, WHITLAND, the CEO, enters,
taking his place at the head of the conference table.

                                 WHITLAND

Good morning, shoppers.

(slaps a file on table)

Has anyone seen the over-night's?

An anticipatory hush fills the room.

                                 WHITLAND

We creamed 'em.

A cheer and applause goes up from the group. Whitland smiles.

                                 WHITLAND

(reading from file)

And last night was a rerun, which says to me that with the six months we
have to ready and promote the 'Very Nlooby Christmas' pay-per-view special,
we can produce history-making numbers. The record is held by that
shock-jock's New Year's thing, but I see no reason why our little cash cow
can't supercede those numbers and...

(stops and sniffs the air)

Do I smell onions?

Bartleby and Loki sit behind the thrall on a black leather couch. Loki is
carving something out of an onion, while Bartleby looks on.

Whitland and the rest of the board stare at them.

                                 WHITLAND

I didn't realize we had guests. Who are these gentlemen with?

The other suits shrug and look to one another for an answer nobody has.

                                 WHITLAND

(to Bartleby and Loki)

Excuse me.

Loki continues carving. Bartleby looks at his friend and shakes his head.
Loki lifts his head without looking up.

                                   LOKI

(very distracted)

Hmm?

                                 WHITLAND

May I ask what you're doing in my boardroom?

                                   LOKI

(still preoccupied)

My friend just has a few words for you, and then we'll be on our way.
Heading to Jersey, you see. Now -by the decor, I assume I'm guessing
correctly that this is the corporate headquarters for Mooby Productions
International?

                                 WHITLAND

You guess correctly. Now, may I ask who the fuck you are and - again - what
the fuck you're doing in our conference room?

                                   LOKI

(to Bartleby, still not looking up)

You may proceed, mon ami'.

                                 BARTLEBY

I can't believe you.

(to Whitland)

I just want to start off by apologizing. My friend here has a penchant
toward the dramatic, so he's making me do this. Usually, I don't even
involve myself in his affairs, but he hasn't done this in awhile, so he
wants...

                                   LOKI

(frustrated)

Just read 'em their rights already.

                                 BARTLEBY

(sighs; circling the table)

Mooby, the Golden Calf. Created by Nancy Goidruff -a former kindergarten
teacher - in nineteen eighty nine to fill a gap in the Saturday morning
schedule on local network K-REL Bought by the Complex Corporation in
nineteen ninety one and broadcast nationally as the 'The Mooby Fun-Time
Hour', it picked up a large following of children, ages three to eight, and
spawns sixteen records, two theatrical films, eight prime-time specials, a
library of priced-to-own video cassettes, and bicoastal theme parks dubbed
'MoobyWorld'.

(beat)

Did I miss anything?

Whitland and company stare for a beat.

                                 WHITLAND

You forgot 'Mooby Magazine'. Is there a point to this?

                                 BARTLEBY

(grimly)

You and your board are idolators.

Whitland and company stare dumbfounded. Loki finishes carving and stands
beside Bartleby.

                                   LOKI

(to Bartleby)

How could your forget the magazine?

Bartleby rolls his eyes. Loki turns to the Whitland and holds up the
sculpture.

                                   LOKI

It's you.

(sets sculpture on table)

Do you know much about voo-doo? Fascinating practice, very close to
Satanism, but not really much of a religion - no doctrine of faith. Just an
arrangements of superstitions, the most well- known of which is the voo-doo
doll.

(sneezes; waits; continues)

A mock-up of an individual is subjected to various pokes and prods, and the
desired result is that the individual will feel the effects.

                                 WHITLAND

(to nearest board member)

Call security - now.

Loki throws the knife at the table, severing the phone cord.

                                   LOKI

All lines are currently down.

                                 BARTLEBY

(to Whitland)

Again -. I apologize for my friend's...

                                   LOKI

(frustrated)

Would you just get on with it?!

                                 BARTLEBY

(miffed; to Whitland)

You are responsible for raising an icon that draws worship from the Lord.
You've broken the first commandment, but more than that, I'm afraid none of
you passes for a decent human being. Your continued existence is a mockery
of morality.

(looks to Loki; Loki nods)

Like you - Mister Bernard.

(stands behind board member)

Last year you cheated on your wife of seventeen years, eight times - twice
with prostitutes. You even had sex with her best friend while she was at
her garden club meeting and you were supposed to be watching your kids.

                                   LOKI

In the bed you and your wife share, no less.

The board member stares in disbelief. Loki nods to Bartleby and he moves
on.

                                  BARTLBY

And you, Mister Newman.

Loki sifts through compact discs. He pulls out one entitled 'Mooby Mania'
and pops it into a player. A simple children's song echoes through the
room.

                                 BARTLEBY

You got your girlfriend drunk at last year's Christmas party, and then paid
a kid from the mailroom to have sex with her while she was passed out, just
so you could break up with her - guilt free - when she sobbingly confessed
the next morning that she cheated on you. She killed herself three months
later. You sent flowers to her wake.

The board member's face is frozen. Bartleby shakes his head and moves
quickly around the table.

                                 BARTLEBY

(not liking his job)

Mister Pereira disowned his gay son; Mister Turran put his mother in a
third-rate nursing home and used the profits from the sale of her house to
purchase an oriental rug for himself; Mister Barker flew to the Phillipines
on the company account to have sex with an eleven year old boy; Mister
Bloom okayed the production of Mooby dolls from what he knew were unsafe
and toxic materials because it was less costly.

Bartleby stops at the female Board member and looks at her, relieved.

                                 BARTLEBY

You, on the other hand, are an innocent. You lead a good life and have
never misused your power here.

She stares at Bartleby. Loki pats her on the back and urges Bartleby on.

                                 BARTLEBY

But you, Mister Whitland. You have more skeletons in your closet than this
assembled party. I can't even mention them aloud.

Bartleby leans over and whispers something unheard into Whitland's ear.
Whitland goes green. Bartleby steps back. Loki stands beside Whitland.

                                   LOKI

You're her father, you sick fuck.

Whitland begins sobbing.

                                 BARTLEBY

(to Loki)

Can I go now?

                                   LOKI

(cheerily rubbing his head)

Go on, you crazy kid.

Bartlebv exits. Loki turns menacingly on the others.

                                   LOKI

With the exception of Miss Pryce, there is not a decent human being amongst
you. Do you know what makes a human being decent?

(beat)

Fear. And therein lies the problem. None of you has anything to fear
anymore. You rest comfortably in seats of inscrutable power, hiding behind
your false idol, far from judgement - lives shrouded in secrecy even from
one another. But not from God.

Loki goes to exit but pauses. He turns around.

                                   LOKI

I forgot my little voo-doo doll.

(looks at Whitland)

Wow. It really does look just like you. Maybe, if I believed enough...

Loki begins moaning menacingly, slowly waving an open palm over the figure.
Whitland looks at it horrified, then at Loki, then back at the figure. He
sweats and shifts in his seat - eyes pinned on the figure. Loki lets out a
shriek and smashes the figure with his fist. Whitland freezes, eyes closed.
Slowly, he opens his eyes - unharmed.

                                   LOKI

I don't believe in voo-doo.

Loki swiftly exits. The Board Members sit in awed silence. Then the doors
burst open and Loki storms back in.

                                   LOKI

But I do believe in this.

Gun blazing, he takes out the male board members, including Whitland, in a
flurry of bullets. The remaining female Board Member covers her head with
her arms. Loki hangs his arm at his side and touches her hair.

                                   LOKI

(smiling)

It's okay. You've done nothing wrong. They were bad men. You are a pure
soul.

She looks at him, terrified. He smiles back. Then his expression hardens.

                                   LOKI

But you didn't say 'God Bless You' when I sneezed.

He quickly puts the gun to her head. She slams her eyes shut.

                                OC BARTLEBY

(cautionary)

Loki!

Loki freezes and looks OC. He grimaces and holsters his piece.

                                   LOKI

(to woman)

Sorry. Force of habit.

He surveys his handiwork and exits. The female Board Member slowly opens
her eyes and looks around.

INT STRIP JOINT - LATER

Jay and the Gang Leader sit together at a table, surrounded by the other
gangsters and Silent Bob. They laugh and chug their '40's.

                                GANG LEADER

(to Gang)

Watch this shit.

(to Jay)

Do it again, G. Do the Mush-mouth.

                                    JAY

(swigs his beer; as 'Mush-mouth')

Hey-buh, Fat-buh, Al-buh-bert.

The Gang laughs hysterically.

                                GANGSTER 1

Fat Albert like a mother fucker and shit!

Bethany, Rufus, and Serendipity huddle around a table further away.

                                   RUFUS

(elated)

I forgot you were down here! How long now?

                                SERENDIPITY

Three years this August. What about you - is this another temporary
expulsion? You and your 'Christ was down' campaign?

                                  BETHANY

What does that mean - another expulsion? I thought you came down here
specifically to help me?

SERENDIPITY

Is that what he told you? Rufus gets thrown out constantly; at least once a
month, ethereal time. They always bring him back, but only after a few days
of peace and quiet - free from that black nationalist rhetoric.

                                   RUFUS

(joking)

Artsy-fartsy bitch.

                                SERENDIPITY

Who you calling artsy-fartsy?

                                   RUFUS

(to Bethany)

Serendipity here used to hang with us sometimes back in Jerusalem.

                                  BETHANY

Let me guess - the fourteenth apostle; left out of the bible because she's
a woman.

                                   RUFUS

The girl's not a woman.

(to Serendipity)

No offense.

                                  BETHANY

Oh, those weren't tits I saw Jay cozying up to?

                                SERENDIPITY

(tugs on boobs)

What, these? You should know better than anyone at this table that tits
don't make a woman.

                                   RUFUS

Hell, the tubby, coat-wearing mother fucker's got tits - don't make him a
woman.

                                SERENDIPITY

Aside from an intuitive knack for accessorizing, what traditionally defines
a woman falls between two things : her legs. But as you can see...

Serendipity stands and unbuttons her jeans, dropping them slightly,
revealing yet another smooth, sexless crotch, quite like Metatron's.

                                SERENDIPITY

I lack definition.

                                  OC JAY

Hey! They're getting a free show!

Serendipity pulls her pants back up and sits down, smiling at the OC party.

                                  BETHANY

(weary)

Oh God. Another angel. Like Metatron.

                                SERENDIPITY

How do you know Metatron?

(to Rufus)

How does she know Metatron?

                                   RUFUS

This is the last Scion.

                                SERENDIPITY

(beat)

You're kidding.

                                   RUFUS

Don't you see the resemblance?

                                SERENDIPITY

(stares at Bethany)

A bit.

(suddenly nervous)

Oh shit. If she's been tapped, then something's up.

                                  BETHANY

I'm confused.

                                   RUFUS

Bethany, Serendipity here isn't technically an angel, nor is she by any
means a human being like I was and you are.

SERENDIPITY

Amen to that.

(swigs her beer and spits it out)

                                  BETHANY

Then who is she?

                                SERENDIPITY

Not who - what. I haven't always been part of the anthropomorphic club. I
used to be an abstract.

                                  BETHANY

Now I'm really lost.

                                   RUFUS

Serendipity's an idea.

                                SERENDIPITY

Try all ideas.

                                  BETHANY

Meaning?

                                SERENDIPITY

I'm a muse, stupid.

Bethany stares at her for a beat, then at Rufus. Rufus nods affirmatively.

                                  BETHANY

I can't take much more of this.

(downs her beer)

                                   RUFUS

(to Serendipity)

She's now met a seraphim, a dead man, and a muse.

You can appreciate her frame of mind.

                                  BETHANY

(to Serendipity)

So you - what - inspire people?

                                SERENDIPITY

What just went down with your friends over there-you don't think they
thought of that themselves? I knew Kane's weak spot for Fat Albert and
passed it along to the boys.

                                   RUFUS

If she hadn't interceded, they'd be chalk lines right now.

                                  BETHANY

You made them sing that song?

                                SERENDIPITY

I offered them a solution out of the hole they dug for themselves.
Thankfully, they took it.

                                  BETHANY

Are you kidding? Those two are so dense, they wouldn't get a good idea if
it was given to them in a specially marked box.

                                SERENDIPITY

Dense people are the most open to suggestion - it's vou so-called
intelligent folks that have a hard time accepting a good idea.

                                   RUFUS

Ain't that the truth.

                                  BETHANY

Prove it. Give me a good idea.

                                SERENDIPITY

If I do, and you accept it, then you'll have confirmation that you are - as
you say - dense.

                                  BETHANY

(beat)

Alright. So you're a muse. So what kind of people do you inspire - besides
stupid ones?

                                SERENDIPITY

I used to specialize in entertainment - literature, theatre, so forth.

                                  BETHANY

Movies?

                                SERENDIPITY

In some cases, I'd do everything but bang starlets on the casting couch.

                                  BETHANY

What have I seen that you've been involved with?

                                SERENDIPITY

Off the top of my head - everything. Well almost everything. For example:
I'm responsible for nine of the ten top grossing films of all time.

                                  BETHANY

Nine?

                                SERENDIPITY

The one about the kid, by himself in his house; burglars trying to get in
and he fights them off?

(Bethany nods)

I had nothing to do with that one. Somebody sold their soul to Satan to get
the grosses up on that piece of shit.

                                   RUFUS

Which brings us to the next logical question - what are you doing
stripping?

                                SERENDIPITY

Well you remember why I left, right?

                                   RUFUS

You were tired of doing all the work and getting none of the credit for
your ideas.

                                SERENDIPITY

And sick of watching incapable people take brilliant inspiration and turn
out real trash.

(to Bethany)

So I opted to quit being a muse and write for myself. I gave my two weeks
notice. got a body, fifty bucks, and got sent out into the world to make my
fortune.

                                  BETHANY

So what happened?

                                SERENDIPITY

Writer's block.

                                   RUFUS

Writer's block?

                                SERENDIPITY

Can you believe it? Me - a muse, for God's sake! I sit down in front of the
typewriter, and what do I get? Nothing. Blank page. 1 can't even write a
grocery list.

                                  BETHANY

What about what you did with Jay and Silent Bob? You inspired them.

                                SERENDIPITY

That's the cosmic joke. I can give out a zillion and nine ideas a second,
but I can't keep any for myself. Her quirky sense of humor.

                                  BETHANY

Whose?

                                SERENDIPITY

God's.

                                  BETHANY

You're saying God's a woman.

                                SERENDIPITY

Was there ever a doubt in your mind?

                                  BETHANY

The possibility never presented itself. He's always referred to as a Him.

                                SERENDIPITY

I didn't write it that way My job stops at the idea stage. The person that
holds the pen adds their own perspective, and all the pen-holders were men.
One of the drawbacks to being intangible is that you have no say in the
editorial process.

                                   RUFUS

Another one's that you can't jerk off.

                                SERENDIPITY

(to Bethany)

See. these being male-dominated times, the Pharisees and High Priests felt
threatened by the idea of a woman lording over them and controlling their
fates. so they made sure that She became a He Doesn't stop with God - the
whole book is slanted and gender-biased: a woman's responsible for the
first sin, the fall of man, and the expulsion from Eden. a woman cuts
Sampson's coif of power, a woman asks for the head of John the Baptist.
Read that book again some time - women are painted as bigger antagonists
than the fucking Egyptians and Romans combined.

                                  BETHANY

(stunned)

God is a woman...

                                SERENDIPITY

I don't know what the big surprise is - women are the only gender that can
create life, just like God created the universe. Who else but a mother
could have the infinite patience with impudent children that God has with
humanity. A woman can give birth to and nurture both sexes, so
psychologists theorize that women are the only gender both sexes can feel
completely comfortable with; and the faithful - both male and female - feel
at ease with God. In time of trial, our first instinct is to implore the
aid of the Almighty, just as when you're a child, the only person who can
make it all better is...

                                  BETHANY

...mom. God, it makes sense.

                                   RUFUS

(to Serendipity)

Shit, you still have a knack for words.

                                SERENDIPITY

Not really useful in my new line of work.

                                   RUFUS

What about that? Why'd you choose stripping?

                                SERENDIPITY

In an effort to create something artistic that I could claim as my own.
See, I've been able to fool myself into thinking this isn't stripping, it's
dancing; and at least dancing is artistic. But She won't even give me that
much - the way God designed dance, it's the only creative act which results
in no tangible product. Unlike paintings, poems, movies or most other arts
forms. when the dance is over, there's nothing to show for it - nothing to
save and enjoy... or sell.

(takes a drink)

Believe me, the irony wasn't lost on this muse.

                                   RUFUS

How long are you going to keep this up?

                                SERENDIPITY

Believe me, I think about eating crow and going back to the grind from time
to time. But I'd hate to give Her the satisfaction of my playing the
prodigal. And it sucks because I can't stand being flesh anymore -
especially this halfway crap. Not only do I have to take care of the
aesthetic - the showers, the haircutting, the pit-shaving - but I can't
take advantage of the benefits - like getting laid or using my period as an
excuse not to get laid...

(conspiratorily to Bethany)

...the only true boon to having a period, from what I understand.

                                   RLFLS

Well we could sure use your help. We need someone with good ideas. You
remember a couple of angels named Loki and Bartleby?

SERENDIPITY

Sure - the angel of death and his squeamish pal with a conscience.

                                   RUFUS

They found a way back.

                                SERENDIPITY

(shocked)

God no. Not the plenary indulgence loop hole?

                                  BETHANY

You know about that?

                                SERENDIPITY

I always knew that thing was a bad idea. Leave it to the Catholics to
destroy existence.

                                   RUFUS

Bethany's Catholic.

                                SERENDIPITY

My condolences.

                                  BETHANY

What do you have against Catholics?

                                SERENDIPITY

Ever been to a Catholic mass?

                                  BETHANY

Once or twice.

                                SERENDIPITY

It's like bad sex - up, down, up, down, kneel, leave.

And the whole time you'd rather be watching t.v.

You people don't celebrate your faith - you mourn it.

                                  BETHANY

So if we're so wrong, then what's the right religion?

                                SERENDIPITY

When are you people going to learn? It's not about right or wrong - it's a
question of faith. It doesn't matter what you believe in - just that you
believe.

Jay and Silent Bob join them, wearing bandannas.

                                    JAY

Look! They made me and Silent Bob part of the gang!

Suddenly, the doors behind them blast open, pouring light into the onc~im
room. A huge figure stands in the doorway, backlit and acting as a sepia
filter - the light and vapors surrounding him are brown.

                                  FIGURE

(deep, gutteral hiss)

Not born... shit into existence.

Our group stares at the OC brute. Jay sniffs the air.

                                    JAY

Who farted?

                                SERENDIPITY

Sweet Christ, someone wants you bad.

                                  BETHANY

What do you mean? What's that smell?

                                   RUFUS

Don't tell me that's who I think it is.

                                SERENDIPITh

The stench should say it all.

                                  BETHANY

Who the hell is it?!

                                SERENDIPITY

An excremental - the Golgothan.

                                  BETHANY

A what?

                                   RUFUS

A shit-demon.

The Golgothan moves slowly from the door, toward the group.

                                  NO-MAN

No... man. ..of...woman.. born...

The Gang join the others. They hold and cover their noses.

                                GANG LEADER

(to Jay; loading his piece)

Friend of your's?

                                    JAY

(to group)

Is this smelly fuck with us?

                                   RUFUS

He's coming for Bethany.

                                    JAY

(to Gang Leader)

Smoke that mother fucker like it ain't no thang!

                                GANG LEADER

I knew I'd get to wax someone today. Represent!

The Gang charges OC, guns blazing, while we hold on the group. Suddenly,
the room is filled with screams and wet, slurpy noises. The group goes from
staring wide-eyed, to shielding themselves. The noise stops and Jay and
Silent Bob look up.

The Gang lay about NoMan in trashed, dead positions. They are covered in
murky, creamy crap - their wide, white eyes frozen in horror. NoMan scoops
a finger-full of muck off the leader and eats it, smiling.

Our heroes start backing up slowly, as to not be noticed.

                                    JAY

(to Silent Bob)

I guess we're in charge of the gang now.

                                  BETHANY

What the fuck happened?!?

                                SERENDIPITY

Go for the bar. We might have a few seconds - his short-term memory's for
shit.

                                    JAY

So's the rest of him.

                                   RUFUS

No chance of taking him down?

                                SERENDIPITY

Gee. I don't know. Let's ask the gangstas.

                                   RUFUS

You're right; let's book.

They dash. NoMan snaps to attention and throws it's arm at them, launching
a huge glob of shit through the air.

                                    JAY

(running; seeing it coming)

SHIT!!!

Everyone leaps behind the bar. The shit flies over them and slams against
the mirror above. Immediately, it stretches - Blob-like - over the entire
frame, and burns in an acidic fashion.

Jay stares, horrified.

                                    JAY

Now that... is some powerful shit.

Serendipity pulls at the floor, yanking open a door.

                                SERENDIPITY

Quick! Get in!

Bethany, Rufus, jay and Silent Bob leap into the darkness. Serendipity
follows, pulling the door shut on top of them.

INT BASEMENT

Our heroes cower beneath the floor door.

                                    JAY

What is that thing?

                                SERENDIPITY

You ever hear of Golgotha?

                                  BETHANY

Skull place. The hill where Christ was crucified.

                                SERENDIPITY

(peering above)

Yeah, well it wasn't just Christ up there - the Romans crucified everybody
on that hill. Ahd Christ excluded, they were all criminals - killers,
brigands, thieves, rapists. And whenever the crucified expired, their
bodies would naturally lose muscle control, spilling bowel and bladder in
the process. And the result is that walking pile of crap up there: the
Golgothan Shit-Demon - Hell's chief assassin. And he's here for you,
girlie.

Silent Bob stares at a crack in the doors. A milky drop of shit drips
through it.

                                  BETHANY

What are we doing down here, then?. Any second now he'll be blasting
through that door!

                                SERENDIPITY

Shit's brainless. If we can sit tight for a couple of minutes, he'll forget
what he came for.

Suddenly another drop falls. Then another. Then a steady stream. Silent Bob
taps Rufus and points. Rufus reacts.

                                   RUFUS

(indicating trickling shit)

Looks like it's been taking memory training courses...

                                SERENDIPITY

(off trickle)

JUMP!!!

The five leap from their perch on the steps, just as the doors explode,
dumping a torrent of crap on the steps. The body of muck morphs into NoMan
anew. NoMan lumbers toward them. The group, attempting to gain their
bearings on the floor, crawls backwards. NoMan pulls a piece of himself
off, rolling it around in It's hands.

                                SERENDIPITY

If anybody still remembers any prayers, I suggest you start whipping them
out.

Silent Bob stares wide-eyed up at the approaching demon. And then,
something occurs to him. He stops backing up and stands. The others
continue moving back.

                                  BETHANY

Bob, get down! Jay!

                                    JAY

(to Silent Bob)

You tubby retard! Get your ass back on the floor!

Silent Bob stands like a statue in the Golgothan's path. The demon snarls a
smile, moving ever closer. Silent Bob reaches into his coat and pulls a
small canister out. He points it at the beast. A mist shoots out into the
face of the Golgothan. It pauses, looking confused. The shitball in It's
hand drops to the floor, and then so does It.

Bethany, Rufus, Serendipity, and Jay climb to their feet and crowd around
Silent Bob. They look to the fallen, unconscious behemoeth, then to Silent
Bob.

                                  BETHANY

(off Bob's canister)

What was that?

Silent Bob holds the can out to them: it's a small, trial size can of Glade
Air Freshener. Jay looks at it, then at Silent Bob.

                                  BETHANY

(reading can)

'Knocks strong odors out.'

                                   RUFUS

Way to go. tubby.

                                  BETHANY

Why would you ever carrs this?

Jay farts. Silent Bob sprays the freshener at his ass. The others look at
jay.

                                    JAY

What?!

                                   RUFUS

(to Serendipity)

Who has dominion over this thing?

                                SERENDIPITY

Only Lucifer can order a killing. But something doesn't make sense: this
thing never travels alone - with it's intelligence level, Lucifer'd never
allow it. It usually has some kind of backup.

                                   RUFUS

Can you get some answers?

                                SERENDIPITY

I can give it a shot.

                                  BETHANY

What's going on?

                                   RUFUS

Serendipity's going to talk to that demon.

                                    JAY

Cool! Can we watch?

                                SERENDIPITY

Not a good idea. Demon's can wreak havoc on the weak-minded.

                                    JAY

Fuck you - weak-minded! Me and Silent Bob can talk to him in his own
language! See...?

(makes the universal metal sign)

he'd understand this.

                                SERENDIPITY

(shakes her head; to Rufus)

Whoever sent this might send mor~. I suggest you take the princess and get
as far away as possible.

(to Bethany)

I'll do what I can to extract some info from shit-boy here. If there's
anything helpful. I'll get it to you somehow.

                                  BETHANY

(hugs her)

Thank you. And... you're a great dancer.

                                SERENDIPITY

I'm a better juggler.

(to jay and Silent Bob)

You know you're supposed to be prophets. right? Start acting like prophets.
You should have seen that thing coming.

                                    JAY

(to Bethany)

Why the hell are we getting yelled at?!

                                SERENDIPITY

Just watch out for Bethany. Go.

Bethany leads Jay and Silent Bob up the stairs.

                                    JAY

(to Silent Bob)

Man, bitch thinks just 'cause she's good-looking, she can tell us what to
do.

                                  BETHANY

She told me that if you behave, she'll give you head.

                                    JAY

(excited)

Yeah?.

                                  BETHANY

Oh, a demon'd have a field day with you.

Serendipity and Rufus watch them disappear up the steps.

                                  OC JAY

(beat)

Shut up.

                                OC BETHANY

You shut up.

                                SERENDIPITY

(to Rufus)

Nice girl.

                                   RUFUS

Comes from good stock.

                                SERENDIPITY

You haven't told her yet?

                                   RUFUS

Not the right time.

                                SERENDIPITY

How uncanny is the resemblance? Those eves, the lips...

                                   RUFUS

The nails.

Serendipity looks at Rufus. He smiles. She hits him, laughing. He cracks
up.

                                SERENDIPITY

Blasphemer.

Then, the OC Golgothan makes a groggy, grumbling noise.

                                SERENDIPITY

Shit. You'd better go. I'll take care of the trash.

                                   RUFUS

(hugs her)

Good luck.

Rufus runs up the steps. Serendipity tunrs on the Golgothan.

                                SERENDIPITY

Alright, Stinky - let's see what you know.

EXT CHURCH -DAY

A suited MAN stands at a podium, addressing a small thrall of reporters.

                                    MAN

And now, to speak on behalf of his Holiness' 'Catholicism - Wow!' campaign,
ladies and gentlemen of the press, I give you the driving force behind the
movement - Cardinal Glick.

The reporters clap as CARDINAL GLICK takes to the podium. He strikes one as
more of an agent than a man of the cloth as he removes his Wayfarers.

                                   GLICK

Thank you, Mister Flanagan - one of this parish's chief patrons, who
donated the stained-glass likeness of Our Lady of Gleeful Misery that
welcomes you as you enter the church every Sunday.

(off index cards)

Ladies and Gentlemen of the press - few would deny that the Catholic Church
has fallen behind somewhat in the times. Catholicism usually strikes the
average person as an old-fashioned remedy for the ills - both moral and
psychological - of a society that has since left it's stringent rules and
ornate rituals on the heap with 45's and eight track cassettes. And in an
effort to disprove that, the Church has appointed this year as a time of
renewal, both of faith and of style. So, it is with great pleasure, that I
present you and your parish - mere days away from it's centennial
celebration - and the continental United States, via Satellite with the
first of man revamps that the 'Catholicism -Wow!' campaign will unveil over
the next year.

                                (applause)

Now, what does this mean for the average church-goer? Are we going to throw
out the rule book and adopt a hippie mentality in regards to our faith? No.
We're simply talking about a few minor alterations to both the aesthetic
and theoretical aspects of a religion that boasts one of the highest
membership numbers on the planet.

A few applause ring out. Glick smiles.

                                   GLICK

Thank you, thank you. So what are we talking about here. Well, for
example...

(pulls out crucifix)

while it has been a time-honored and traditional symboL of our faith, we
have decided to retire the highly recognizable, yet wholely depressing
symbol of our Lord, Jesus Christ, crucified. Why? Well, look at it. Would
you relish being a member of a group that uses a man nailed to two pieces
of wood as it's masthead? Of course not - who would? I've got enough
downers in my daily routine without having to deal with this visual
everytime I go to worship. lnstead, the church is going to adopt this new,
more soothing and inspiring sigil, which we feel is in-line with our new
outlook.

Glick pulls a cover off an object to his right - a two foot figure of
Christ smiling and giving the 'thumbs up'. The crowd buzzes.

                                   GLICK

See? Isn't this better? How could you not feel just great walking into a
church and seeing this behind the priest - a positive reinforcement that
whatever we do, God thinks is 'a~kay'. I love this thing, it's so...

                                REPORTER I

(interupting)

Cardinal Glick - has the church given any thought to it's position on john
Doe Jersey? Will he be given the right to die with dignity?

Another buzz rises from the crowd. Glick rolls his eyes.

                                   GLICK

C'mon people. We're not here to talk about that. It's an issue we stand
firm on - euthanasia is a big no-no, just like abortion. Murder's murder.
Why won't you people accept that? Besides, we're here to talk about this
little guy - your friend and mine... the happy Jesus. Can't you just see it
on chains around people's necks, and as the new background in avant garde,
MTV videos?

INT BUS TERNIINAL - DAY

The image of the 'Happy jesus' - thumbs up and all - is captured on a t.v.
monitor, a label reading U\'E VIA SATELLITE - RED BANK. NEW JERSEY' at the
bottom of the screen. Bartleby and Loki look up at it, then at one another.

                                   LOKI

And you say Siskel and Ebert have no influence over this culture.

                                 BARTLEBY

We're getting out of here at just the right time. These people are nuts.

                                   LOKI

(off t.v.)

And that's the church we're heading to?

                                 BARTLEBY

(steps to ticket window)

If you want to go home...

(to WOMAN in window)

Two tickets to New Jersey, please.

                                   WOMAN

Jersey's sold out, sir.

                                 BARTLEBY

Are you sure?

                                   WOMAN

The computer says.

                                   LOKI

Come on - how many people can possibly be going to New Jersey?

                                   WOMAN

Enough to fill a bus.

                                 BARTLEBY

(to Loki)

You had to drag that judgement out. You couldn't just hit and run.

(to Woman)

When's the next one?

                                   WOMAN

Same time tomorrow.

                                 BARTLEBY

What?! Doesn't this place warrant at least two buses a day?

                                   WOMAN

I take it you've never been to the Garden State. Next.

Bartleby and Loki look around.

                                   LOKI

There's no one else here.

                                   WOMAN

Then I guess it's lunch time.

(she shuts her window)

                                   LOKI

We should have learned to drive a long time ago. Infinite celestial power
and we can't catch a bus.

                                 BARTLEBY

Just shut up, this is your fault.

                                   LOKI

You can either lament over our mass transit folly, or you can listen to my
suggestion.

                                 BARTLEBY

It's your suggestions that prevent us from negotiating what should be a
simple matter of catching or staying on a bus!

                                   LOKI

Why fall victim to gravity when we can just as easily rise above?

                                 BARTLEBY

(stares at him)

Fly?

                                   LOKI

We got wings, right? Let's use them.

                                 OC VOICE

I wouldn't suggest that.

The pair spin and gawk.

AZRAEL leans in the doorway. He removes his hat, revealing two stubby
horns.

                                  AZRAEL

You wouldn't want to stand out, now would you?

INT STRIP JOINT BASEMENT - DUSK

NoMan is tied to a chair in the middle of the floor. Serendipity draws a
circle around him with lipstick. Once finished. she takes a glass of water
and throws it into No Man's face. It roars to life. The Golgothan shakes of
his daze, turning his attention on Serendipity.

                                   NoMAN

The Muse. They told us you were up here.

                                SERENDIPITY

Matter of perspective. NoMan. I like to think of it as 'down here'. I have
a few questions for you, sir.

                                   NoMan

Free us from these binds, that you may have answers.

                                SERENDIPITY

(heads toward it)

Okay.

(stops; sarcastic)

Oh wait. I'm smarter than that.

NoMan lets out a bellow.

                                SERENDIPITY

Face it, big guy - I'm not releasing you until I get answers. This can go
hard or easy. The sooner I get what I want, the sooner you'll be free. Now,
you can start by telling me why you're on this plane?

                                   NoMAN

(beat)

Liquidate the Last Scion.

                                SERENDIPITY

See? That wasn't so hard. Now - who sent you? Was it Lucifer?

NoMan laughs in a sinister fashion.

                                   NoMAN

Our master is no one and all. For a time, he will be prince of this world -
and the fate of those who dwell in it will be at the mercy of his whimsy.
And then he will sever reality and crush existence, like a thumb punctures
a fontanell, giving peace to those who've been without for so long.

                                SERENDIPITY

Did Bartleby and Loki send you?

                                   NoMAN

Resist no further, Muse. Deliver over to us the conflicted one, that this
world may die screaming. No power - divine or inherited - threatens the
crusade. You cannot win. Soon will rise of the cry of the abandonned,
begging your God to put an end to the madness. And only as being becomes
not, will they know that the God of Abraham lay dormant while the dream
perished in a blink. Your God is not dead - He's brain dead.

                                SERENDIPITY

She, you chauvinist bastard - She's brain dead. And no She's not. Stop
trying to be so spooky. Tell me who sent vou, or I'll use whatever
influence I have below' to make Hell even worse for you.

                                   NoMAN

You speak of Azrael.

(he laughs)

We pity you. Muse. You're still playing the old game. The one that could
have made good on your threat is gone.

                                SERENDIPITY

What do you mean. gone? He escaped?

                                   NoMAN

No soul escapes Hell, but one.

(beat - as if It's heard something)

Would that I could cross the threshold of your confining circle, I would
crush your half-life throat. But my Master does not abandon me to this
mockery of a prison. We will come back for the girl. And when we do, it
will take more than fragrant mist to keep our hands from crushing her head.

NoMan goes stiff and then limp. His body begins to melt.

INT TOY STORE - DAY

Azrael leads Bartleby and Loki through the aisles, passing tons of stuffed
animals.

                                 BARTLEBY

Jesus Christ, Azrael - how'd you get out of Hell?

                                  AZRAEL

I told them I was coming up on a routine possession. I don't have much
time. If they figure out my ruse, they'll come looking for me.

                                 BARTLEIBY

You lied?

                                   LOKI

Go figure. Him. A demon.

(to Azrael)

Why'd you bring us in here?

                                  AZRAEL

Because you two fucks are inches away from getting yourselves caught. Going
around killing people, about to uncase your wings... don't you have any
idea what's going on?

                                   LOKI

We're going back home.

                                  AZRAEL

Are you so clueless as to think you can just waltz back into Heaven?

                                 BARTLEBY

Why not? We're going back clean.

                                  AZ RAEL

Let me let you in on a little secret, okay: everyone is looking for you.
Both sides - above and below. The orders are to terminate you on sight.

                                 BARTLEBY

(shocked)

Why?

                                  AZRAEL

You're pissing people off, that's why! Word on the grapevine is that God's
pissed off at your presumption, and I know Lucifer's pissed because you
assholes might just succeed where he's failed so many times, making him
look bad.

                                 BARTLEBY

So they're going to kill us?!?

                                  AZRAEL

They're going to try'. That's why you have to travel incognito - tone down
your behavior, stay off their respective radars. Go about this thing more
subtly. Quit killing people - that's high profile. And for God's sake,
don't uncase your wings until you have to transubstantiate. Because the
minute you let them flap, legions of thrones and hordes of demons will
fight each other over who gets to kill you first.

(looksOC)

Shhhh!

A WOMAN and her small DAUGHTER walk past. While the Woman looks at the
items on the top shelf, Loki pulls off Azrael's hat and taps the Daughter
on the shoulder. He points to Azrael's horns. The Woman pulls the Daughter
further down the aisle, oblivious to the trio.

                                 DAUGHTER

Mommy, that man had horns.

Azrael grabs his hat and puts it back on.

                                  AZRAEL

That's the kind of shit I'm talking about!

                                   LOKI

Oh, lighten up.

                                 BARTLEBY

(still reeling)

I can't believe they want to kill us.

                                  AZRAEL

Believe it, boys. They've even got the Last Scion looking for you.

                                   LOKI

You're kidding!

                                  AZRAEL

This is big. I'm telling you. Your re-entry is a thorn in a lot of sides,
and they'll stop at nothing to prevent it.

                                   LOKI

If that's the case, then why aren't you hunting for us too?

                                  AZRAEL

Because I want to see you go back. You were both given a raw deal; almost
as raw as mine. If you make it back, then I figure there's hope for me.

(looks around)

In the meantime, I suggest you find an alternate mode of transportation. If
anything else comes up, I'll contact you.

                                 BARTLEBY

Thank you, Azrael. You're a true friend.

                                  AZRAEL

Would you expect anything less from a demon. I have to get back to the Pit,
before they get suspicious.

(turns to leave)

                                   LOKI

Hey Az - what's it like down there. Is it as bad as they say?

                                  AZRAEL

Give you a hint: they've been playing 'Mrs. Doubtfire' continuously for two
years now.

(exits)

                                   LOKI

(looks at Bartleby)

Shit man - that is punishment.

EXT CONTRYSIDE - NIGHT

The Train chugs through the darkness.

INT TRAIN - NIGHT

Bethany and Rufus sit across from one another. They stare out the window.

                                   RUFUS

How you coping, kid?

                                  BETHANY

It's weird. just when I think I've got a handle on things. something
wholely unbelievable presents itself. Sometimes I wish I had just stayed
home.

                                   RUFUS

You sound like the Man.

                                  BETHANY

(beat)

What was He like?

                                   RUFUS

Jesus? Black.

                                  BETHANY

Besides that.

                                   RUFUS

The brother was centered. I mean, He was God, right? But I think He felt
left out because He was more than human, you know? We used to sit around
the fire - me and the other guys - and we'd be talking about what ass-holes
the Romans were or getting laid...

                                  BETHANY

Some things never change.

                                   RUFUS

...and He'd just sit there listening and smiling. We'd ask Him why He never
joined in the convo, but He said He just liked to hear us talk; about
anything. Said it was like music. I think He just wished He had unimportant
shit to talk about himself.

                                  BETHANY

How does He feel now?

                                   RUFUS

He still digs humanity, but it bothers Him to see the shit that gets
carried out in His name - wars, bigotry, but especially the factioning of
all the religions. He said humanity took a good idea and, like always,
built a belief structure on it.

                                  BETHANY

Having beliefs isn't good?

                                   RUFUS

I think it's better to have ideas. You can change an idea. Changing a
belief is trickier. Life should malleable and progressive; working from
idea to idea permits that. Beliefs anchor you to certain points and limit
growth; new ideas can't generate. Life becomes stagnant. That was one thing
the Man hated - still life. He wanted everyone to be as enthralled with
living as He was. Maybe it had

something to do with knowing when He was going to die. but Christ had this
vitality that I've never encountered in another person since. You know what
I'm saving?

                                  BETHANY

He was big on life?

                                   RUFUS

It was more than that. He was the only person I ever knew who never engaged
in that most ancient of life-affirming activities.

                                  BETHANY

Sex.

                                   RUFUS

Debate. That's the only way people know how to reaffirm that they're alive
- by debating. In all it's forms. People spend their whole lives debating:
we fight about who's right and who's wrong, we fight ourselves, we fight
each other, we fight death, we fight over beliefs, we fight over fights. We
believe that to stop debating - in any fashion -is to stop living and give
up. People say that life's a struggle, but it's not. Life is living. I'm
even guilty of it myself, the way I go on about Christ's ethnicity,
fighting for the truth to come out. And I'm dead. Even in death, the only
way I know how to live is through debate. That's sad, isn't it?

                                 BETIIANY

Not if you believe it's important for people to know.

                                   RUFUS

A belief's a dangerous thing, Bethany. People die for it. People kill for
it. The whole of existence is in jeopardy right now because of the Catholic
Belief structure regarding this plenary indulgence bullshit. And whether
they know it or not, Bartleby and Loki are exploiting that belief, and if
they're successful, you, me. all of this... ends in a heartbeat.

(beat)

All over a belief.

Bethany nods. Rufus looks around.

                                   RUFUS

I haven't seen the moron twins in awhile.

                                  BETHANY

They went to the lounge car to smoke.

(getting up)

I'll go find them; make sure they're not getting into any trouble.

                                   RUFUS

I'm going to catch a few z's. Forgot how tiring living can be.

Bethanv heads off Rufus looks out the window, then shuts his eyes.

INT LOUNGE CAR - NIGHT

Bethany enters and spots jay and Silent Bob, talking to an unseen party.

                                  BETHANY

You two aren't getting into any trouble, are you?

                                    JAY

Nope. Just about to smoke a bowl with our new friends. You in?

                                  BETHANY

And who are your new friends?

                                    JAY

They just got in at the last stop.

Silent Bob moves over, revealing the new friends.

                                    JAY

This is Larry and Barry.

Bartleby and Loki smile at Bethany.

                                   LOKI

Jay tells us you're going to sleep with him.

EXT TRAIN TRACKS - NIGHT

The train rushes over head.

INT LOUNGE CAR - LATER

Loki, Jay, and Silent Bob pass a joint under the table and take quick hits,
trying to remain casual. Jay pounds the table happily.

Bartleby and Bethany lay on either side of the table in their booth.

                                  BETHANY

You can smoke up with them if you want. You don't have to keep me company.

                                 BARTLEBY

It's a long trip. There'll be plenty of time later.

(beat)

So why are you heading to Jersey?

                                  BETRANY

There's just this thing there I'm supposed to do. How about you?

                                 BARTLEBY

We're going home.

                                  BETHANY

Do you two live together?

                                 BARTLEBY

Unfortunately. Do you live with those guys?

                                 B ETHANY

God, no. Not they just sort of adopted me.

                                 BARTLEBY

They're funny as hell. The big one never says a word.

                                  BETHANY

I wish the little one would take a cue from him. But they're okay, as far
as stoner's go.

                                 BARTLEBY

Lo... Larry's taken an immediate shine to them, and he usually hates
people.

                                 BETIIANY

How long've you two been together?

                                 BARTLEBY

Awhile. He's great company. He can be a little flaky sometimes, but we've
got a lot in common.

                                  BETHANY

How'd you meet?

                                 BARTLEBY

We were stationed together.

                                  BETHANY

See? That's beautiful. And everyone's always up-in-arms about this
'out-in-the-military' issue.

                                 BARTLEBY

What do you mean?

                                  BETHANY

Well there's all that macho bullshit about it being 'This Man's Army'. And
you two meet and hook up while in the service, which is so special -
because it's so hard to meet anyone you can seriously relate to...

                                 BARTLEBY

(catches on)

You think we're lovers?! Oh no. No, we're not gay.

                                  BETHANY

(laughs)

Oh God, I'm sorry'. I just assumed...

                                 BARTLEBY

No. We live together and all, but at the end of the night, I go to my room.
and he goes to his.

(beat)

Why? Do I come off as gay?

                                  BETHANY

(laughing)

No, not at all. I'm sorry. My ex-husband kind of fouled up my relationship
awareness barometer.

                                 BARTLEBY

You're divorced?

                                  BETHANY

That's the nice way of putting it. I consider it being dumped.

                                 BARTLEBY

I was dumped once. More or less.

                                  BETHANY

It's terrible, isn't it? Don't you constantly question your value - like
why was I so easy to cast aside? Didn't I have merit?

                                 BARTLEBY

And you wonder if the other party's going to come to their senses and call
you back.

                                 BETIIANY

The worst is that I still think like a couple. After all these years, I
still have the 'we' mentality.

                                 BARTLEBY

Mine grew out of what was really a stupid misunderstanding. A
misunderstanding that grew into a total withdrawl of communication.
Abandonment. And even though it was years ago, there's not a day that goes
by that I don't wonder what went wrong. And then it hits me - I was
replaced by someone. A lot of someones.

                                 BET HANY

And they always tell you it'll hurt less with time...

                                 BARTLEBY

...when actually, it hurts more.

                                  BETHANY

(beat)

You know what we need? We need some drinks. A lot of drinks. Do you agree?

                                 BARTLEBY

Whole-heartedly.

INT TRAIN CAR - NIGHT

Rufus continues to slumber.

INT LOUNGE CAR - NIGHT

Jay is asleep on Silent Bob's shoulder, drooling slightly. Loki talks with
Silent Bob.

                                   LOKI

I'm telling you, man - it's all about organized religion and society's
battle against it. The Rebels are fighting the Empire, right? Now the
Empire is led by whom? Darth Vader? No. It's led by the Emperor. And the
Emperor is a practitioner of the Force, albeit the Dark Side of the Force.
And the Force is basically a religion.

(Silent Bob nods)

So the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule, and the Imperial government is
run by this old religion. What you have, then, is a theocratic government -
a government run by the church. So Luke, Han, and Leia are fighting that
government to liberate the galaxy from the pious grip of what is, in
essence, holy mother church.

Silent Bob nods in understanding.

Bethany and Bartleby slump in their booth, the table loaded with empty
glasses. Bethany is quite tipsy. Bartleby sips his drinks, and
surreptitiously spits it out.

                                 BARTLEBY

You're saying you still go to church?

                                  BETHANY

(laughs)

Every Sunday.

                                 BARTLEBY

Does it do anything for you?

                                  BETHANY

(thinks)

Gives me time to balance my check book every week.

                                 BARTLEBY

See? That's what I'm talking about. People don't go to church and feel
spiritual. They go to church and feel bored. But they keep going. Every
week. Out of habit.

                                  BETHANY

Or in habit, if you're a nun.

                                 BARTLEBY

Oh... that wasn't very funny at all.

                                  BETHANY

A friend of mine told me that church is like bad sex:it's messy and there's
no foreplay...

(starts laughing)

No. that's not it. I am so buzzed.

                                 BARTLEBY

When do you think you lost your faith?

                                  BETHANY

I remember the exact moment. I was on the phone with my mother, and she was
trying to counsel me through what was happening to me and my marriage. And
she said something like "There's always a plan." And I... just got so
angry. I mean, I know she was talking about God, right - God had a plan.
But I was like "What about my plans?" You know? Like, don't they count for
anything? I had planned to grow old with my husband and have a family -
wasn't that plan good enough for God?

(beat)

Apparently not.

(swigs her drink)

How about you? When did you lose your faith?

                                 BARTLEBY

Me? Years ago. One day, God just stopped listening. I kept talking, but I
got the distinct impression that He wasn't listening anymore.

                                  BETHANY

She. And how do you know She was listening in the first place?

                                 BARTLEBY

(thinks)

I guess I don't.

                                  BETHANY

I hate thoughts like that. But they occur to you with age. When you're a
kid, you never question the whole faith thing - God's in Heaven, and
He's... She's always got her eye on you. I'd give anything to feel that way
again. Which is why I guess I let myself get talked into this pilgrimage. I
needed proof. And the opportunity presented itself to find out if it is
like they told us in Catholic school. And I gotta tell you - the last few
days, I've come across some interesting people that lend toward convincing
me.

                                 BARTLEBY

Where's this pilgrimage to?

INT TRAIN CAR - NIGHT

Rufus stirs. He looks around and stretches.

INT LOUNGE CAR - NIGHT

Bethany and Bartleby continue their discussion.

                                  BETHANY

You'd never believe me if I told you.

                                 BARTLEBY

Try me.

                                  BETHANY

Alright. But I warned you. Okay - I'm going to this church in New Jersey.

                                 BARTLEBY

Really...

INT TRAIN CAR - NIGHT

Rufus heads toward the back of the car. He opens the door between the cars
and exits.

INT LOUNGE CAR - NIGHT

Bethany and Bartleby talk further. Bartleby's intrigued.

                                  BETHANY

I was told that I'm supposed to stop a couple of angels from entering the
church. They're trying...

(laughing)

This sounds so stupid... They're trying to get back into Heaven.

INT TRAIN CAR - NIGHT

Rufus passes through another car and opens the door at the end.

INT LOUNGE CAR - NIGHT

Bartleby grows very tense. Bethany rattles on, half-toasted.

                                  BETHANY

See, they got tossed out of Heaven years ago, right? And if they get back
in, it proves God wrong. And since God is infallible, to prove Her wrong
would...

(laughing hard)

..would unmake existence! I feel so stupid just saying it.

Bartleby's eyes are wide. He looks scared. Then, a calm falls over him.

                                  BETRANY

(laughing)

But the thing I don't get... is how do I stop an angel? Two, even! I guess
I'm supposed to talk them out of it or something.

Bartleby surreptitiously slides a knife off the table.

                                 BARTLEBY

Maybe you're supposed to kill them?

Bethany breaks into hysterics.

INT TRAIN CAR - NIGHT

Rufus pulls open another door and exits.

INT LOUNGE CAR - NIGHT

Bethany's still cracking up, oblivious to the on-the-defensive Bartleby.

                                  BETHANY

Oh yeah! Kill them! Even if that was the case... I mean. how do you kill an
angel?

                                 BARTLEBY

I don't imagine it's much different...

(slowly lifts the knife)

...from killing a human...

The door behind them slides open. Rufus steps in.

                                   RUFUS

Where the hell is everybody? I wake up, and...

He sees Bartleby. They both freeze.

                                 BARTLEBY

The Apostle!

                                   RUFUS

Holy shit!

                                  BETHANY

(stumbling to her feet)

Rufus, I want you to meet my friend, Barry...

Bartleby leaps out of the booth and grabs Bethany, holding the knife to her
throat.

                                  BETHANY

(chuckiing)

Barry! Don't be such a show off!

                                   RUFUS

Take it easy, Bartleby. Just let her go and let's talk about this.

                                 BARTLEBY

After all this time, this is what it comes down to -slaughtered by this
meat puppet?!

                                   RUFUS

There doesn't have to be a slaughter. We can work this out...

                                  BETHANY

Is that a knife?

                                 BARTLEBY

Oh. we can work it out, alright. I'm going to work the blade in and out of
her thorax!

(calling over shoulder)

Loki!

Loki catches the action and reacts.

                                   LOKI

Holy shit - the Apostle!

He leaps from the table. Jay stirs and wakes up.

                                    jAY

(half asleep)

I didn't come in you, I swear...

(looks around)

Bartleby, with Bethany in hand, faces off against Rufus. Loki joins them.

                                   LOKI

(to Rufus)

What are you doing here?

                                 BARTLEBY

They're here to thwart our journey home, my friend. This one just told me
that she's supposed to stop a couple of angels from entering a church.

                                   LOKI

You think she was talking about us?

                                 BARTLEBY

I'd say there was a pretty good chance. What do you say, Rufus - we're to
be liquidated?

                                   RUFUS

It doesn't have to go down like that! You haven't thought about the
consequences of re-entry!

                                   LOKI

Consequences, schmonsequences.

                                 BARTLEBY

I have to agree with him. No one - not you, and especially not this
finite-lifer - no one is going to impede us. We're going home, regardless
of whose pride it may hurt!

                                   RUFUS

It's not a question of pride, it's...

                                 BARTLEBY

Loki - kill the girl

                                   LOKI

(beat)

What are you, high?

                                 BARTLEBY

Do it!

                                   LOKI

I can't kill her if she hasn't done anything, you know that. And it looks
like she's 'on the job', so to speak...

                                 BARTLEBY

Fine! I'll kill her myself...

A hand lands on Bartleby's shoulder.

                                    JAY

(oblivious to the situation)

Hey man - now it's your turn. We got enough for a fatty boom-batty, biggety
blunt!

Bartleby turns the knife on him.

                                    JAY

(not quite getting it yet)

We having cake or something?

Loki backhands Jay, stunning him.

                                    JAY

(dazed)

In grates...

Jay drops to the floor, out cold. Silent Bob grabs Loki and hurls him down
the aisle. Rufus grabs Bartleby's knife hand. They struggle. Bethany
collapses.

                                   RUFUS

TUBBY! THE DOOR!

Silent Bob jumps over Loki and opens the back door of the car. He grabs
Loki by the collar.

                                   LOKI

Wait, man! Can't we talk about this?!

He throws Loki out the door, off the train.

Rufus squeezes Bartleby's hand. Bartleby drops the knife and punches Rufus
in the face. Bethany jumps on Bartleby's back, covering his eyes. They
careen down the aisle, toward Silent Bob. He pulls Bethany off Bartleby's
back and kicks him out the back door, off the train. He quickly slams the
door closed and leans against it.

The Bartender stares at him.

Silent Bob brushes off his coat and thumbs toward the door.

                                SILENT BOB

No ticket.

Rufus rubs his jaw. Bethany crawls up beside him, breathing heavily.

                                 BETH ANY

I should have known something was wrong when he paid for all the drinks.

INT UNDERGROUND GARAGE - NIGHT

A door is kicked open. Loki enters, brushing himself off. Bartleby follows.

                                   LOKI

The Apostle is here!

                                 BARTLEBY

I noticed.

                                   LOKI

If that's the case, then chick with him must be...

                                 BARTLEBY

The Scion, I'd imagine.

(leans against the wall; slides down)

                                   LOKI

(in a panic)

Well, shit man! Maybe we should rethink this whole thing! I mean, you heard
the guy - he said there were consequences. Azrael tells us we're marked.
Maybe there's more to this than we thought about.

Bartleby leans against the wall, sitting on the ground. His demeanor has
changed. He stares into space.

                                 BARTLEBY

There sure is.

(beat)

It's them.

                                   LOKI

(beat)

What?

                                 BARTLEBY

(shakes his head)

Them.

                                   LOKI

(thinks)

The movie about the giant ants?

                                 BARTLEBY

Them - the humans. It's what it all comes down to. you know? Us against
humanity... kind of like that giant ant movie.

                                   LOKI

(beat)

Are you alright?

                                 BARTLEBY

I'm better than alright. I've had an epiphany, my friend.

                                   LOKI

An... epiphany. Yes, well... that'll happen.

                                 BARTLEBY

When that sweet, innocent girl let her mission slip, I suddenly understood
it all - everything. For the first time in all these eons, I get it.

                                   LOKI

(beat)

Get what?

                                 BARTLEBY

In the beginning, it was just us and Him. Angels and God. And then He
created the humans. And He gave them more than He ever gave us. Our's was
designed to be a life of servitude and worship - adoration. But He gave the
humans more - He gave them a choice. They can choose to ignore God, choose
to acknowledge Him. All this time we've been down here, everyday I felt the
absence of the Divine presence. And it pained me... as I'm sure it must
have pained you sometimes, even though you'd gloss over it with jokes. But
we feel his absence, and why? Because of the way He made us -as servants.
Had we been given free will, we could ignore the pain... like them.

                                   LOKI

You know - maybe you should take a nap or something.

                                 BARTLEBY

Loki, don't you get it? It's the humans - it's always the humans. They were
given paradise; they threw it away. They were given this planet; they
destroyed it. They were favored best among all His endeavors; and some of
them don't even believe He exists. Their ego-mania corroded Hell and made
it dark and crimson.

(looks at Loki)

I asked you to lay down your sword years ago - why?

Because I felt sorry for them. And where did it get us?

Thrown out.

(smiles)

We've paid our debt. Don't you think it's time we went home? And to do
that, I think we have to dispatch our would-be dispatchers.

                                   LOKI

Wait, wait, wait - kill them?! You're talking about the Last Scion, for
Christ's sake! And what about Jay and Bob - I mean, those guys were
alright.

                                 BARTLEBY

Don't, my friend. Don't let your sympathies get the best of you, as they
did me way back when. Scion or not, she's just a human. And regardless, our
sins are forgiven by passing through that arch. No harm, no foul.

                                   LOKI

That sounds thin.

                                 BARTLEBY

Fine. We'll cover ourselves. We'll take out a slew of people. Maybe amidst
the body count, He won't notice.

                                   LOKI

Oh, that's being realistic.

Bartleby reaches out and grabs Loki, slamming him against the wall.

                                 BARTLEBY

I'm going home, Loki. And nobody - not even the Almighty Himself - is going
to make that otherwise.

Bartleby releases Loki and smiles. He exits. Loki watches him.

                                   LOKI

Shit.

He follows.

EXT CAMP FIRE - NIGHT

Another Newspaper headline regarding 'John Doe Jersey' fills the frame. It
is lowered to reveal Jay, Bethany, and Rufus sitting around a makeshift
fire in the middle of nowhere. Jay rolls a joint. Silent Bob reads the
paper.

                                  BETHANY

I don't understand why we couldn't stay on the train. You threw those guys
off.

                                   RUFUS

A very basic strategy - if your enemies know where you are, then don't be
there.

                                  BETHANY

And what's with that? Why are we enemies? The guy almost gutted me, for
God's sake!

                                    JAY

He had the knife at your throat. To gut you, he'd have to have the knife at
your stomach.

                                  BETHANY

Semantics! Semantics that don't even answer mv question.

                                   RUFUS

Well, I know I'd perceive the person sent to kill me as my enemy.

                                  BETHANY

What do you mean, kill? I wasn't asked to kill them -just stop them from
going into that church.

                                   RUFUS

And how were you going to do that? Preoccupy them with a game of Bingo?

                                  BETHANY

I've never killed anything before in my life!

                                    JAY

I'll do it.

                                   RUFUS

Shut the fuck up, little man - you couldn't kill a pint of ice cream, let
alone an angel.

                                    JAY

Fuck you - I can kill an angel as good as the next guy.

                                   RUFUS

Oh yeah? How' would you do it?

                                    JAY

I'd give him a Van Damme neck-break, like in 'Hard Target'. D'jou see that
flick?

                                   RUFUS

(ignoring jay; to Bethany)

Killing an angel's a two-step process - first you have to cut off their
wings. which then makes them human. From that point on, it's the same as
killing anything else - head or heart, take your pick.

                                  BETHANY

You say it as if it's easy.

                                   RUFUS

(oblivious to Jay)

Problem is, I don't think we could pull it off even if we wanted to. All
this time away from the Divine Presence should have made those two weaker -
and those guys felt far from weak. Either that or someone's protecting them
- someone with juice.

                                  BETHANY

So then we're screwed?

(shrugs)

Shit, that's the best news l've heard in days.

                                   RUFUS

This doesn't excuse you from tryng to stop them.

                                  BETHANY

Count me out. You're telling me they're unstopable, I'm exhausted - both
psychologically and physically, the odds are against us. I say we kick back
and wait for the end -a little non~xistence might be just what the doctor
ordered.

                                    JAY

I'm with her. I don't care about dying, so long as we're all going to die.

                                   RUFUS

What are you babbling about now?

                                    JAY

If I was the only one, that'd bother me because every-one else would go on
living, having a good time without me. But if we all go at once, that'd be
okay, because I know I'm not missing anything.

                                  BETHANY

See? You know it's right when even he's making sense.

                                    JAY

Besides, she said if we were in a situation where we were going to die in
like five minutes, she'd have sex with me and Silent Bob.

                                   RUFUS

So you're suggesting she throw in the towel and let eons of work and
history get blinked out of existence just so you can get laid?

                                    JAY

(thinks)

No. Just so me and Silent Bob could get laid.

                                  BETHANY

Now that we're all but in total agreement on this, I'd just like to finally
know - why me?

                                    JAY

Because you've got nice tits.

                                  BETHANY

I wasn't talking to you!

(to Rufus)

Why me? Why do I have to do this? Nobody's come

clean on that. Out of everyone on the whole god-damned planet. How come I
got tapped?

Rufus looks at her. He shrugs.

                                   RUFUS

Family ties.

                                    JAY

That show's funny as hell.

                                   RUFUS

Shut up.

(to Bethany)

Do you know what the Apocryphal books are?

Bethany shakes her head no.

                                   RUFUS

Most of that information in the Bible came from the Dead Sea Scrolls -
ancient text discovered in a cave ages ago. And when the Sanskrit was
translated, they discovered data that conflicted with the lore church
officials had already established as the basis of their religion. They
couldn't refute centuries of dogma, so they thought it best to leave
certain passages out - sometimes whole books. Those books make up the
Apocrypha.

                                  BETHANY

What's this have to do with me?

                                   RUFUS

You've never gotten the complete picture. If they had compiled the material
together like they were supposed to, you'd get the whole story. But by
leaving text out, the church has presented you people with an extremely
sterile and unmoving account of religious history. The Creation. the entire
Old Testament, the history of Christ...

(let's her take it in)

Forget about my whole black angle for a minute...

                                    JAY

We might if you'd quit bringing it up.

Rufus backhands Jay. Silent Bob holds jay back. Rufus continues, oblivous
to Jay.

                                   RUFUS

He goes from twelve years old to thirty. Whole volumes of text about the
eighteen year struggle with His Divine nature prior to His acceptance of it
were thown out, forever lost to the faithful.

                                  BETHANY

I don't buy it. Integral material like that would give people a better
understanding of the nature of God. Why leave it out?

                                   RUFUS

Because it was all closely tied in with His family.

His mother and father?

                                   RUFUS

His brothers and sisters.

                                  BETHANY

(beat)

Wait, wait, wait - Jesus didn't have any brothers or sisters. Mary was a
virgin - that's why it's called the Immaculate Conception.

                                   RUFUS

Mary gave birth to Christ without having known a man's touch - that's true.
But she did have a husband. And do you really think he'd have stayed
married to her all those years if he wasn't getting laid? The nature of God
and the Virgin Birth - those are leaps of faith. But believing a wife never
humped her husband - that's just gullibility.

                                  BETHANY

(sudden realization)

MARY AND JOSEPH HAD SEX?!?

                                   RUFUS

All the time, from what I understand. Jesus used to tell me stories about
hearing them through the walls when He was a kid.

(beat)

So you ask why you got tapped. I'll tell you why: a Christ was the
salvation of this world once before. And you're the closest thing to a
Christ that still walks.

                                  BETHANY

Meaning?

                                   RUFUS

The blood that flows in your veins shares a chromosome or two at the
genetic level with the man you call Jesus.

(hand on her shoulder)

You're His great-grand-niece.

Bethany's jaw drops. A high-pitched squeak of a word escapes her lips.

                                    JAY

(takes a hit from his joint)

So... that would make Bethany part black.

(to Silent Bob)

Man, this is just like when Vader told Luke he was his father.

                                   RUFUS

I just wish I knew what the hell we're supposed to do now?

You must go to the Dagobah system and find Yoda - the Jedi Master who
instructed me.

Everyone turns around. Metatron leans against a tree.

                                 METATRON

God. l've always wanted to say that.

                                   RUFUS

my throat?

in with a confession of mine own.

                                    JAY

Now who's this mother fucker?

                                   RUFUS

This is the Voice of God - show some respect.

                                    JAY

The Voice of God? Where's the rest of Him?

                                 METATRON

Funny you should mention that - we're not sure.

                                  BETHANY

Excuse me?

                                 METATRON

Didn't it ever occur to you that this Bartleby/Loki situation was well
within the realm of His control?

                                   RUFUS

If that's the case, then why was Bethany tapped?

                                 METATRON

You know those constitutionals He likes to take?

                                  BETHANY

Constitutionals?

                                   RUFUS

I think we're beyond euphemisms at this point.

(to Bethany)

God's a skee-ball fanatic.

                                 METATRON

Let's not altogether blow some of the mystery that surrounds Him, alright?

(to Bethany)

Yes - the Lord has quite a fancy for the game; been playing it for years -
He assumes a human form once a month and indulges. Doesn't tell anyone
where He's playing; just goes away for a couple of hours. It's quite
understandable - a small exercise in hand/eye coordination has been proven
as a highly effective means of therapeutic relaxation. And from what I
understand, He always gives his free points away to neighborhood children.
Isn't that sweet?

                                  BETHANY

But She hasn't come back from one of those day-trips, is what you're
getting at?

                                 METATRON

(to Rufus)

'She'? I take it she's met the Muse.

(to Bethany)

No, 'She' hasn't. And we've been unable to locate Her.

                                   RUFUS

Maybe He was killed? Human form has that drawback.

                                M ETAT RON

No - there's a different sort of foul-play afoot, children. Whomever has
set the renegade angels on their path and is keeping them quite
well-hidden. is also responsible for the Lord's whereabouts. Were He to be
killed in human form, He'd have immediately returned to Paradise. Somebody
knew enough to keep the body alive, but incapacitate Him in another fashion
- He's trapped in a body.

                                   RUFUS

So God's not dead...

                                    JAY

He's brain dead.

                                 METATRON

So it would seem. And as omnipotent as we are above, I have to admit that
we're more or less lost without His presence. We've had our people looking
everywhere for Him. And I tapped her, because I thought we might be able to
smoke out whoever's behind this. But whoever it is has been clever enough
to send some lackeys after you, as opposed to showing up themselves.

                                   RUFUS

Can it be Lucifer?

                                 METATRON

Thankfully they seem oblivious to the situation in the nether-regions. I
know they're not responsible - at least not Lucifer. If he was, he'd have
made his move by now to conquer Heaven. And I know he's not responsible for
Bartleby and Loki because he'd have just as much to lose by their return as
everyone else.

                                   RUFUS

Then what about the Golgothan and the Triplets?

                                 METATRON

Don't be stupid - demons aren't exclusive to Hell. Anybody can summon one.

                                    JAY

Yeah?

Silent Bob hands Jay his newspaper and points. Jay reads.

                                  BETHANY

Don't encourage them. And why did you lie to me? You said I was tapped as a
test?

                                 METATRON

No, you said that - I just didn't correct you. You were shocked enough -
how do you think you would've taken it if I told you the face of God
belonged on the back of a milk carton?

                                   RUFUS

So what do we do now?

                                M ETAT RON

I say we get drunk, kids - because I'm all out of ideas.

                                    JAY

(off paper)

Why don't we just ask this guy to close the church?

                                 METATRON

'Cardinal Glick has come under fire for the blatant pandering and
questionable direction of his church-sanctioned 'Catholicism - Wow!'
campaign. When asked about his motivations for decommisioning the
traditional baptismal fonts in favor of the proposed Olympic sized
lap-pools beneath parish floors, Click responded "Come on - who doesn't
like a pool party?"

                                    JAY

Maybe you could tell him to shut down the church. If it's closed on that
day, those guys can't get blessed or whatever - right?

                                 METATRON

Good Lord - he's got a point.

                                  BETHANY

I think Silent Bob had a point. But sure - we can go to him and explain the
situation somehow.

'We'? You're back in?

back-hands him.

TELEVISION SCREEN - COMMERCIAL

Two cartoon ALTAR BOYS sift through their bowls of cereal.

                                  ALTAR 1

The same boring cereal again?

A cheesy CARTOON CHRIST floats down from above.

                                  CHRIST

Man cannot live on boring cereal alone!

                                ALTAR I & 2

IT'S JESUS!

Jesus pulls a box of HOSTIES cereal from his sash.

                                  CHRIST

Why not try Hosties!

CL on cereal pouring into a bowl. It's shaped like Eucharistic hosts. Milk
follows.

                                 CHRIST VO

New Hosties is fortified with vitamins and minerals, topped off with an
angelic kiss of frosting that stays crispy in milk!

Christ's hands on their shoulders, the Altar Boys down their cereal
happily.

                                  CHRIST

Hosties is an important part of any nutritious breakfast, and each one is
blessed by a high ranking Vatican Monsignor - good for the body, and good
for the soul. But make sure you've confessed beforehand...

Altar 2 clutches at his throat, gasping.

                                  ALTAR 2

You're forgiven.

Altar 2 stops choking and continues eating, happily.

                                  CHRIST

So try a bowl of Hosties! And don't just take my word for it...

A cartoon POPE pops out of the box, eating a spoonful of cereal.

INT CLICK'S OFFICE - DLSK

A hand switches off the t.v. Pan up to Cardinal Click, all smiles.

                                   GLICK

Well...? Doesn't it pop?

Bethany. Rufus, lay and Silent Bob are at a total loss for words.

                                    JAY

(After a long beat)

Does it come in chocolate flavor?

The Cardinal picks up a golf putter and begins putting into an overturned
glass.

                                   GLICK

You see? Now this one's got vision!

(to Jay)

We're rolling out the flavors in September. Big cereal month with the kids,
back to school and all.

                                  BETHANY

It's a bit... startling.

                                   GLICK

Exactly! And that's what we're looking to do - shake these people up a bit,
get them motivated. That's the whole point of the campaign. Mass attendance
is at an all-time low in this country. And it's not like we're losing them
to the Protestants or Baptists - people aren't practicing at any
denomination these days. If we can sell them some show - let 'em know the
Catholic church has some panache, we can win them back -even get some new
ones. Fill them pews, people - that's the key. And cross-promoting - like
with the cereal tie-in grabs the little ones as well. Hook 'em while
they're young.

(sits at his desk, lights smoke)

                                   RUFUS

Kind of like the tobacco industry?

                                   GLICK

Oh - if only we had their numbers. But we are aiming for the same
demographic, even though mine is the soulsaving biz. And if I have to play
a bit of the devil to bring them closer to the Lord, then I'll wear the
cloven hooves and carry the pitch fork.

Jay and Silent Bob adjourn themselves from the group and approach a hat
rack, where the Cardinal's CASSOCK and MITER hang. Jay nudges Silent Bob.

                                OC BFTHANY

We really appreciate you seeing us this late in the day, your Emminence. My
friends and I have been traveling all night in hopes of getting a chance to
talk to you about the Saint Michael's Re-Dedication ceremony.

The Cardinal blows smoke rings.

                                   GLICK

You'd like to help out in some way?

                                  BETHANY

We'd like you to cancel the ceremony and the re

dedication.

I beg your pardon?

Silent Bob stands alone by the coat rack. Jay leaps into the frame, cassock
tied around his shoulder like a cape. He strikes a Superman pose.

                                OC BETHANY

There's going to be a world of trouble if tomorrow's ceremony goes forward
as planned.

The Cardinal leans back in his chair.

                                   CLICK

What is this - a threat? Are you planning some sort of demonstation?

(pause)

Are you pro-choicers?

                                  BETHANY

No, the trouble's not from us. It's from these renegade angels who've been
stuck on earth since the plagues...

Rufus side-kicks Bethany, nonchalantly.

                                  BETHANY

Uh... these guys who think they're renegade angels.

                                  RUFL'S

See padre, it goes down like this - the boys believe that by passing
through the archway they can get to Heaven. Granted, it's far-fetched, but
the brothers are convinced it's the truth.

Silent Bob watches as the Miter appears slowly from behind the partition,
resembling a shark fin. It 'swims' to and fro, menacingly. Silent Bob
shakes his head.

                                 OC GLICK

And you want me to call off the ceremony... for that?

Bethany leans forward in her seat.

                                  BETHANY

Well. they're very passionate about it. Dangerously so. They could turn
violent if they walk through that arch and nothing happens.

                                   RUFUS

These guys could blow, and if they do, they're going to take some people
with them. Call this thing off.

                                  BETHANY

Stay out of this.

(to Glick)

Your Emminence, it's not a joke. These guys are an accident waiting to
happen. And if the re-edication ceremony goes on as planned...

                                   GLICK

...then these loonies will show up and go nuts, thus endangering the lives
of all assembled, including the Governor, the press, me, the leaders of the
Council of Churches. Heck, let's not stop there, maybe even God Himself.

                                  BETHANY

You can't say Himself; it could be a woman.

                                   GLICK

(rubs temples)

Your passion for all topics insignificant, including the gender of our
almighty lord, tests my patience, people. Now I'm a very important man with
very important matters that demand my attention, so if you'll please...

                                   RUFUS

I'm telling you man. this ceremony is a mistake.

                                   GLICK

The Catholic Church does not make mistakes.

                                   RUFUS

What about the church's silent consent to the slave trade?

                                  BETHANY

And it's platform of non-involvement during the Holocaust?

Alright, those were mistakes. But one can hardly hold the current

Tomorrow goes off without a hitch! Do I make myself clear?! I did not labor
two years and exhaust eve~ ounce of my being to insure that this ceremony
be a cornerstone in the most important liturgical event since Vatican Two
just to cancel it at the zero hour at the insistence of a wandering band of
pranksters who've targeted me as the focus of their evening's merriment!
This occasion is important for the congregation of this parish, for the
massive crowds coming for the plenary indulgence, for me, for his Holiness
the Pope, and - most importantly - for the 'Catholicism - Wow!' campaign!
And neither you, nor any other influence short of the hand of God...

(glares at Bethany)

... HIM -self will prevent it from occurring successfully!

He violently grabs the Miter/shark fin 'swimming' behind the partition.

EXT TURNPIKE - EARLY MORNING

Amidst very little traffic, two figures emerge from the shadows on the

that welcomes motorists to New Jersey.

It's a crime that a guy like him even gets to wear a scarlet cape.

Oh my God. We're going straight to Hell, I know it.

You stole the Cardinal's driver?

                                    JAY

I told him to. You know how much these things are worth? That's at least a
couple of sodas and a pack of smokes right there.

Correction : they won't be killed.

The gang turns to see Azrael sitting at the bar.

                                  AZRAEL

And just to insure that, we're all going to sit tight, right here, until
the two idiots pass through that arch.

                                    JAY

Hey...!

                                  BETHANY

He wasn't talking about you two.

                                 OC VOICE

There's only one idiot here, .Azrael...

Bethany and Rufus react, as does the very surprised Azrael. Serendipity
stands in the doorway.

                                SERENDIPITY

And that's you.

                                  AZRAEL

The Muse. Just in time to join us for a drink.

                                 BARTENDER

(suddenly noticing Azrael)

Hey. Where'd you come from?

                                  AZRAEL

Nothingness. And that's where I'm returning to in approximately...

(checks watch)

...onehour.

                                 BARTENDER

Alright Plato - sounds like you've had enough drinks already. Let's go.

                                  AZRAEL

Come on Barkeep - just one drink for the road. Then I'm gone.

Serendipity joins Bethany and Rufus. She whispers.

                                SERENDIPITY

I was trying to find you - to tell you I'd figured out who was behind all
this.

                                   RUFUS

Is that who I think it is?

                                SERENDIPITY

None other than.

                                  BETHANY

Who is it?

                                SERENDIPITY

That's my worst suspicions confirmed.

The Bartender relents.

                                 BARTENDER

Alright - one drink. Then you're gone.

                                  AZRAEL

Gimme a Holy Bartender.

                                 BARTENDER

Never heard of it.

                                  AZRAEL

(to the group)

He doesn't know how to make a Holy Bartender.

You know - don't you, Muse?

                                SERENDIPITY

Azrael... don't.

                                  AZRAEL

(ignoring her)

Anybody? Well - I know how to make a Holy Bartender.

Azrael pulls an Uzi from his coat and blows a dozen holes in the Bartender.
The Stygian Triplets burst through the doors and everyone jumps to their
feet, with the exception of the Bartender, who dies.

                                  AZRAEL

Get it?

                                SERENDIPITY

Sweet Jesus, Azrael - why?!?

                                   RUFUS

(rushing him)

C'mon, demon - let's see you try that shit on a brother whose already dead!

The Stygian Triplets cross their sticks in front of Rufus to block him as
Azrael trains his Uzi on Bethany.

                                  AZRAEL

(joining them)

You maintain that kind of an attitude and you and the barkeep won't be the
only corpses in the room -the Christ-Bitch will join you.

                                SERENDIPITY

I can't believe you're behind this. Are you really that stupid?! Do you
know what's going to happen if those two jerks enter that church?!

                                  AZRAEL

I'm actually counting on it. And if my calculations are correct, the pawns
are moving in to check-mate as we speak.

Everyone stares at Azrael, with the exception of Jay. He suddenly laughs.

                                    JAY

I get it! Holy Bartender! That's a good one!

EXT SAINT MICHAEL'S CHURCH - MORNING

A formidable crowd of parishoners surrounds a small stage, ten yards from
the front of the church. Banners hang every~ere, heralding 'Catholicism -
Wow!' as well as the Centennial of Saint Michael's. The media eats it up.

Cardinal Glick stands at the podium, all smiles. He's in mid-speech.

                                   GLICK

I'd also like to acknowledge this great state's Governor, Elizabeth Dalton,
for coming out an helping us ring in the first hundred years of this little
parish True. she's a Protestant - but we won't hold that against her.

(crowd laughs)

Now, let me just give you a bit of history on this particular little
hundred years young House of God...

                                OC BARTLEBY

This is no longer God's House. God doesn't live here anymore.

The crowd turns, aghast. Bartleby pushes his way through them, sheepishly
followed by Loki.

                                 BARTLEBY

He's grown weary of your superficial faith and has turned a deaf ear to
your lip-service prayers. He is no longer amused, and has abandonned you -
His favorites - to the whim of judgement. Hypocrites and charlatans -
prepare to taste God's wrath!

                                   LOKI

(whispering)

Maybe we should just go.

                                 BARTLEBY

You wanted your body count, you got it. This lot is rife with sin. We'll
judge them all!

Glick grabs a COP from the crowd and pushes him toward the pair.

                                   CLICK

These are the two I was warned about, Officer McChee. Please assist them
off the church grounds.

The Cop grabs Bartleby's arm.

                                    COP

Alright mouthpiece, let's leave the nice Cardinal alone and go for a
ride...

Bartleby grabs the cops hand on his shoulder.

                                 BARTLEBY

Mister McGhee, don't make me angry. You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.

                                    COP

Is that so? Well, let's just...

Bartleby throws his other hand forward and twists the Cop's head around in
one brisk motion. Loki's eyes bug out. The crowd takes flight.

                                 BARTLEBY

(releasing dead Cop)

Ladies and Gentlemen - you have been judged as guilty of violations against
our Almighty Lord. And this very day - I assure you - you will all pay for
your tresspasses... in blood.

(to Loki)

Wings. Now.

                                   LOKI

I'm not so sure...

                                 BARTLEBY

DO IT!

INT BAR - LATER

Azrael still hosts his captive audience, uzi trained on the mortals. The
Stygian Triplets surround them, brandishing their sticks.

                                  BETHANY

You're a muse too?

                                SERENDIPITY

Former muse. He was kicked out.

                                  AZRAEL

Tell them, Serendipity. Tell them how I was slighted by the Almighty.

                                SERENDIPITY

You got what you deserved, you yellow shithead.

                                  AZRAEL

Ever the apple polisher. I'd hoped that when you left Paradise, you did it
finally because you couldn't tolerate the injustice that was visited upon
your own brother.

                                  BETHANY

He's your brother?!

                                SERENDIPITY

Not technically. We were created at the same time.

                                  AZRAEL

To compliment one another. Two spirits of pure inspiration.

                                 BARTLEBY

So what happened?

                                  AZRAEL

Yes. What. Lucifer got restless and started his little war for the throne.
Heaven became divided into two factions - the faithful and the renegades.
The ethereal planes were chaotic with battle, angel against angel. And when
it was all over, Cod cast the rebels into perdition.

                                SERENDIPITY

But Azrael refused to fight. He wouldn't ally himself to God or Lucifer. He
remained in the middle, waiting to see who came out victorious.

                                    JAY

What are you - some kind of fucking chicken?!

                                  AZRAEL

I was an artist! I was inspiration! A muse has no place in battle! Our job
is to create - not destroy!

                                SERENDIPITY

So after the fallen were banished to Hell, God turned on those that
wouldn't fight, and my brother here was sent down with the demons.
Something he considers a grave injustice.

                                  AZRAEL

Don't tell me that you never questioned the judgement, Serendipity; that
you don't think the Almighty acted too rashly?

                                SERENDIPITY

You've been waiting for millions of years to ask me that, haven't you? It's
been on your mind since the moment you fell. It's been gnawing at you this
long.

                                  AZRAEL

Well?

                                SERENDIPITY

No, Azrael. It never bothered me, and I'll tell you why:

you stood behind your office, you prick. So you were an artist - big deal.
Elvis was an artist, but that didn't stop him from joining the service in
time of war. That's why he's the King... and you're a schmuck.

                                  BETHANY

So all this is about revenge?! You're going to unmake existence because you
have a grudge against God?!

                                  AZRAEL

After the first million years, revenge was the farthest thing from my mind.
Self-preservation became the only necessity.

                                   RUFUS

Meaning?

                                  AZRAEL

Escape. Escape from Hell became my all-consuming reason. So I studied the
religions and waited for my opportunity to present itself; which flnallv
did. in the form of the plenary indulgence And while I couldn't exercise it
myself. I knew the perfect vessels through which I could free myself from
torment.

                                   RUFUS

Bartleby and Loki.

                                  AZRAEL

After that, it was a simple matter or waiting for a church to celebrate
their Centennial, and when that finally happened, applying some of the old
inspiration tactics - bv sending the pair an article laced with ideas. An
incantation I picked up in the Pit kept them cloaked and off Heaven's
radars, and aside from the Triplets and the Gologothan, no soul in Hell had
a clue as to what was going on.

(smiles)

Won't proud Lucifer weep when he realizes I triumphed over the Power in a
way he never dared or dreamed.

(shakes it off)

But no plan, no matter how intricate, could succeed if the Almighty was in
the realm of the quick. So I dispatched Him in a fairly ingenious fashion.

                                  BETHANY

How so?

                                  AZRAEL

Oh no. I've seen way to many Bond movies to know that you never reveal all
the details of your plan - no matter how close you may think you are to
success. Suffice it to say, the Catholics have been even more helpful in
insuring my success than by just supplying the clean-slate archwav.

(gets up)

The only X-Factor was the involvement of the Last Scion. I'm amazed that
someone up there would have the balls to make a move without the Lord's
say-so. Believe me - I sweated when you stumbled upon my boys on that
train. But alas, here you are - powerless to stop the inevitable.

                                  BETHANY

Look, asshole - I don't know if anyone explained the rules to you, but if
you succeed, everything gets blinked out of existence - even you.

                                  AZRAEL

(beat)

Human, have you ever been to Hell? I think not. Do you know that once Hell
was nothing more than the absence of Cod? And if you'd ever been in His
presence. then you'd realize that's punishment enough. But then your kind
came along - and made it so much worse.

                                  BETHANY

Humans aren't capable of one hundredth the evil a shitbag demon like
yourself is.

                                  AZRAEL

Evil is an abstract; it's a human construct. But true to his irresponsible
nature. man won t own up to being the engineer of evil, so he blames his
dark deeds on my ilk. But his selfishness is limitless, and it's not enough
for him to shadow his own existence. He turned Hell into a suffering Pitt -
fire, wailing, darkness - the kind of place anyone would do anything to get
out of. And why? Because he lacks the ability to forgive himself. It is
beyond your abilities to simply make recompense for and regret the sins you
commit. No - you choose rather to create a psychodrama and dwell in a
foundless belief that God could never forgive your 'grievous offenses'. So
you bring your guilt and inner-decay with you to Hell - where the horrid
imaginations of so many gluttons-for-punishment give birth to the sickness
that has infected the abyss since the first one of your kind arrived there,
begging to be 'punished'. And in doing so, they've transformed the cold and
solitude to pain and misery. I've spent eons privy to the flames, inhaling
the decay, hearing the wail of the damned. I know what effect such horrors
have on the delicate psyche of an angelic beihg.

(beat)

Would you like to glimpse pain eternal? Look...

Azrael places his hand over Bethany's eyes. For about ten seconds, we see
some of the most fucked up and disturbing imagery that can be crammed into
240 frames of film.

Azrael pulls his hand away. Bethany is fried, convulsing uncontrolably.

                                  AZRAEL

I'd rather not exist than go back to that. And if everyone has to go down
with me, so be it.

                                SERENDIPITY

(holding up Bethany)

You're still thinking only about yourself, you fuckmg child.

                                  AZRAEL

Now, now, now. Things are getting too tense in here. What say we watch a
little t.v.

(grabs remote control)

                                    JAY

Put on channel nine - 'Davey and Goliath'!

A Stygian Triplet smacks him with it's hockey stick.

                                    JAY

Hey!

                                  AZRAEL

I was thinking more along the lines of current events.

On the T.V. - a sweaty and panicked REPORTER barks into the camera,
obscuring the chaos behind him. Screams are heard.

                                 REPORTER

...I repeat - men with huge fucking wings have laid waste to St.
Michael's... Bullets don't seem to affect them... police who were on the
scene are dead... The remaining crowd has dropped to their knees,
identifying this as the fabled Apocalypse.. I'm not a man of faith, but I'm
inclined to agree with them..

(looking OC)

NO! DON'T COME ANY CLOSER!!

(pulls gun)

PLEASE!! Please...

He puts the gun in his mouth and fires. The screen goes blank.

                                  AZRAEL

(snapping off tv.)

You see that? And I told them to keep a low profile. I'd be pissed, but in
a couple of minutes, it won't matter anymore.

While he speaks, Serendipity looks to Silent Bob. Silent Bob snaps to
attention, and locks eyes with Serendipity. He looks to the golf club, then
back at her. He nods.

Azrael suddenly catches the exchange between the two.

                                  AZRAEL

Now what was that all about?

                                SERENDIPITY

Hunhh? Oh. nothing. I had something in my eye.

                                  AZRAEL

(getting up)

Bullshit. What are you trying to do, Serendipity -get the guy killed? Now
who's the fucking child? What did you tell him - to hit me with the golf
club? Are you serious?

(picks up golf club)

I'm a fucking demon, and you'd have him assault me with athletic equipment?

(hands club to Silent Bob)

Well, here then - take it. Call it a gift.

(stands back and hits his own chest)

Take a shot - take your best shot. C'mon - c'mon, bright boy.

The Stygian Triplets snicker. Silent Bob stares at Azrael, perplexed.

                                  AZRAEL

Don't you know anything?

Silent Bob looks to Serendipity. She nods. He shrugs and swings the club
with all his might into Azrael's chest - which caves in, blowing muck and
shit everywhere.

Rufus, Jay, and Serendipity turn on their captors, grabbing the Stygian
Triplets by the throats.

                                SERENDIPITY

BETHANY! BLESS THE SINK!

                                  BETHANY

WHAT?!?

                                SERENDIPITY

DO IT!

Bethany leaps over the bar, pushing over the dead bartender, and blesses
the melting-ice filled sink. Serendipity urges Rufus and Jay to follow her,
with the Triplets in hand. They submerge them - head first - in the sink.
Cruddy steam and muck blows out of the water. The Triplets convulse and
fall still.

Azrael clutches at his sucking chest wound, dropping to his knees. He grabs
Silent Bob's leg. Silent Bob kicks him onto his back and out cold.

                                    JAY

(joining Silent Bob)

What the fuck have you been eating?

Silent Bob shrugs.

                                  BETHANY

What just happened?

                                SERENDIPITY

(collecting hockey sticks)

He said it himself - he's a demon. You hit a demon with an instrument of
God - the pure side's always going to do the most damage.

                                    JAY

Silent Bob's an instrument of God?!

                                SERENDIPITY

No - but the driver is.

                                  BETHANY

(catching on)

And Glick's the kind of asshole that would bless his own clubs for a better
game. And the sink...?

                                SERENDIPITY

You've got that Divine heritage going for you - sanctifing is just one of
the fringe benefits.

                                  BETHANY

Remind me to try the water-to-wine thing at my next party.

(to Jay)

How far away is this church?

                                    JAY

Three towns over - about five miles.

                                  BETHANY

We've gotta make tracks, people - there isn't much time left. Rufus, grab
his gun.

                                   RUFUS

Ten steps ahead of you.

                                  BETHANY

(going through dead bartender's pockets)

We can take the bartender's car - I don't think he'll be needing it
anymore.

Bethany and Serendipity rush out.

                                    JAY

We gonna make it?

                                   RUFUS

Was Jesus down?

Rufus and Jay exit. Silent Bob stares down at Azrael's body. Jay comes back
and yanks him out the door.

EXT STREET - DAY

Cardinal Click runs to a pay phone. Sweating and bloody, he looks a mess.
He presses '0' and looks around wildly - particularly skyward.

                                   GLICK

(to God)

Look, if you didn't like the cereal thing, we could've gone in a different
direction!

(to phone)

OPERATOR! SEND MORE POLICE TO SAINT MICHAEL'S PARISH - NOW!! PEOPLE ARE
GETTING KILLED BY...!

As he speaks, a large shadow falls over him from above. It grows larger,
enveloping Click. He drops the receiver, drops to his knees, and screams.

EXT SAINT MICHAEL'S - DAY

Bethany, Jay, Serendipity, Silent Bob, and Rufus stare OC, horrified.

                                    JAY

Holy shit.

Bodies, bodies everywhere - partial, whole, bloody - hanging, burning,
upended. No one is left standing. It's a scene straight out of Hell.
Bethany buries her face in Rufus' chest.

                                    JAY

See? And people wonder why I don't go to church.

                                  BETHANY

Are we too late?

                                SERENDIPITY

To save these poor schmucks, yes. But we still exist.

                                  BETHANY

Where are they?

                                   RUFUS

They could already be in the church.

                                SERENDIPITY

Which means that if they come out, nobody touches them.

                                    JAY

Are you shitting me? The brother here is going to shred them with his
Schwarzenneger special - ain't you, homey?

                                SERENDIPITY

If they've passed through that arch, they come out clean. And if they die,
they go straight up - and we know what happens then.

                                    JAY

What if they just kill themselves?

                                  BETHANY

They can't - it's a mortal sin. You die with a mortal sin on your soul and
you burn. They'd go to hell, and that's not what they're after.

                                    JAY

So then what the fuck are we supposed to do?! Just wait for a solution to
fall out of the sky?!

On cue, a body plummets out of the sky and hits the ground before the
group, quite like Rufus had, way back at the start. This body, however,
bursts apart like a body would if dropped from a large height. Jay looks at
Rufus.

                                    JAY

Friend of your's?

                                   RUFUS

'fraid not.

                                 OC VOICE

It was a Cardinal.

They all turn to see Loki, leaning against a body or two, drinking from a
bottle of champagne. His wings lie beside him, filthy - blood spattered and
ashen. He looks exhausted. Rufus trains the gun on him.

                                   LOKI

Kind of hard to tell with his face like that, but the Rosaries are a dead
giveaway.

                                    JAY

(goes for the Uzi)

IT'S ONE OF THEM!! KILL IT!!!

                                  BETHANY

(struggling to stop him)

NO...!

She slaps the Uzi out of Jay's grip. It clatters to the side.

                                  BETHANY

(to Jay)

Don't you listen?! We can't touch them!

                                    JAY

I wasn't gonna touch him, I was gonna shoot him!

                                   LOKI

(looking skyward)

He's been at it for awhile now.

In the distance above - a mere shadow against the sky - something winged
soars and stops, releasing what looks like a very panicky human being.

                                  OC LOKI

We ran out of parishoners, so he just started picking up anyone off the
street. You're looking at eons of repression getting purged. If only we'd
been able to jerk off.

Loki drags himself a few feet backwards.

                                   LOKI

I'd step back if I were you.

They jump back just as the body hits the ground and explodes. Bethany
charges at Loki, grabs his lapels, and shakes him furiously.

                                  BETHANY

WHY?!? WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU HOPE TO PROVE?!? ALL THESE PEOPLE - WHY?!?

                                    JAY

(to Rufus)

I thought we weren't supposed to touch them?

                                   RUFUS

I think our Bethan's about hit her ceiling.

Loki slaps Bethany away, non-chalantly.

                                   LOKI

This wasn't my idea. alright? I just wanted to go home.

(takes a big champagne swig)

We both wanted to go home. But he snapped. When he realized who you were
and what you'd have to do, he just lost it.

(smiles)

You know what's funny about it? He never could stand to see me work. He
said he always felt son~' for you people - that you didn't know any better.

(looks up)

Now look at him.

                                    JAY

This guy's drunker than hell.

                                SERENDIPITY

Which means he's human now - his wings have been cut off.

(slapping Loki to sober him up)

Loki! Loki!

                                   LOKI

(recognizing her)

The Muse. Haven't seen you in a long time. What's with the tits?

                                SERENDIPITY

Loki - have you walked through the arch yet? C'mon. tell me! Have you gone
in and come out through the archway yet?!

                                   VOICE

No.

Bartleby lands beside them, draping his wings at his sides, brushing
himself off.

                                 BARTLEBY

We were awaiting your arrival.

                                SERENDIPITY

Bartleby - listen to me! You can't go through with this! Azrael was just
using you! If you go back this way...

Bartleby slaps her down.

                                 BARTLEBY

I've become aware of the reprocussions, Muse. I know what I'm doing.

Bethany leaps at him, all fists and fury.

                                  BETHANY

YOU FUCK! YOU SICK, TWISTED FUCK!! LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE!! LOOK AT All
you've

done...!

Bartleby subdues her. He strokes her hair.

                                 BARTLEBY

Bethany - you of all people should understand what I'm t~'ing to accomplish
here. You too have been abandonned. You know what it's like to be cast
aside. But while you've only felt the devastating effects for a few years,
I've dealt with it for millenia. And while you never see your ex-husband or
how blissful he is with his new wife...

(picks up her face and smiles at her)

And he is...

(drops her head)

..seeing you people everywhere. everyday, trapped on this perfect little
world He created for you... it's a constant reminder that though my kind
came first, your kind was most revered. And your kind knows forgiveness,
while my kind knows regret. A lesson must be taught. All are accountable...
even God.

(steps back)

Soon a cadre of police will arrive, just in time to kill us as we exit the
church. And then this failed experiment called existence will cease to be.

Loki stumbles to his feet.

                                   LOKI

I can't... let you do this, Bartleby...

(he sways as if drunk)

I didn't know we... would end existence...

                                 BARTLEBY

(to Bethany)

My compatriot. Genocide takes a lot out of him. He's weakened. And more
importantly. he's now a human being. A condition that carries two
liabilities: a conscience...

Bartleby pulls a knife and guts Loki. He stares at Bartleby as he dies,
confused and betrayed. Serendipity nods to Rufus and Silent Bob.

                                 BARTLEBY

..and a short life span.

(in a whisper; to Loki)

Sorry, old friend - but you lost the faith.

Rufus and Serendipity and Silent Bob jump Bartleby and start throwing
punches. Silent Bob bites his wing. Jay grabs Bethany and pulls her behind
a bush.

                                  BETHANY

(peering out from behind)

He's lost it! We're fucked! We're absolutely fucked!

                                    JAY

(pulling off clothes)

I hear you.

                                  BETHANY

I can't believe this shit! We're on the brink of nonexistence and God's
still nowhere to be found! What the fuck kind of deity gets kidnapped?!

                                    JAY

(pulling open pants)

Amen to that.

                                  BETHANY

(suddenly notices him)

What the hell are you doing?!

                                    JAY

I'd say we've got about five minutes left to live; the whole world's going
to end. You said you'd fuck me.

                                  BETHANY

Are you a complete lunatic?! Everyone's out there battling that thing and
you want to cower back here and jump my bones?! We have to go down
fighting!

                                    JAY

No - no time for that foreplay stuff, just sex.

                                  BETHANY

You pig...!

                                    JAY

What?! It's all over; nobody's gonna beat that thing! Now we can either lay
here all comatose like that

John Doe Jersey bastard behind us, or we can make with the love.

Bethany freezes.

                                  BETHANY

(finally!)

What did you say?!

                                    JAY

'Make with the love'? I just said that to be sensitive. Usually I call it
boning.

                                  BETHANY

No - about John Doe Jersey?

                                    JAY

That guy - the one that they won't take off life support - John Doe Jersey.
This is where he's at.

                                  BETHANY

What? Where?

                                    JAY

Saint Michael's hospital - over there.

(points behind them)

There, across the street, sits a HOSPITAL.

                                  BETHANY

(thinks)

Where's the nearest boardwalk?

                                    JAY

Look, I ain't got time to win you a prize or something, we gotta get to it
before...

                                  BETHANY

WHERE IS IT?!?

                                    JAY

(scared)

Asbury Park. About five miles away.

                                  BETHANY

You ever been there?!

                                    JAY

(really scared)

Once. I was banging this girl who worked at the carousel. She wanted to do
it on the ride, but I got sick and started puking...

                                  BETHANY

(grabs his face)

DO THEY HAVE SKEE-BALL THERE?!?

                                    JAY

(piss-scared; high pitched)

...yes.

Bethany kisses Jay hard on the lips, jumps up and looks over the bush.

                                    JAY

(warming up)

Now that's more like it.

Rufus and Serendipity battle Bartleby, his wings thrashing about. Silent
Bob is getting back on his feet.

                                  BETHANY

BOB!

Silent Bob looks to Bethany. She waves him over and bends back down to Jay
who half-closes his eyes, and puckers his lips. Bethany pinches his lips
together and raises jay to his feet, ust as Silent Bob arri\'es.

                                  BETHANY

(to Jay)

Whatever you do - stall Bartleby from going into that church!

(to Silent Bob)

Bob - come with me!

(they exit)
"DRAGONSLAYER"

                                      Screenplay by

                             Hal Barwood and Matthew Robbins

                                      SHOOTING DRAFT

                

               FADE IN:

               CASTLE - NIGHT

               Now comes the moon riding over the horizon. Upon a hill at 
               the edge of the wood squats a castle, its crude stonework 
               bathed in cold silvery light. Queer carvings and runes 
               decorate the ponderous gate. Heavy vines are climbing up the 
               walls. The castle is old, its unfamiliar form testament to 
               an ancient mind and an ancient craft. Flickering candle light 
               dances on a leaded windowpane.

               Inside, the corridors are dark and silent. Under low arched 
               ceilings the uneven floors are paved with stone blocks. 
               Perched over lintels and crouched in niches are icons with 
               strange animal heads.

               HODGE

               A sleep on a straw palette in a room strewn with vegetables 
               and crockery is Hodge, a wrinkled old retainer. A flickering 
               candle and empty jug are beside the bed. He is snoring gently.

               CONJURING ROOM

               This circular chamber at the heart of the castle is stuffed 
               with parchments, scrolls, dusty books, bronze braziers, glass 
               retorts, chemical salts, birds both stuffed and caged. An 
               iron candelabra stands on a work table, tapers burning. In 
               the soft glow it seems that the room is unoccupied, but no, 
               moving in the background is a shadowy figure, preparing for 
               a magical deed. Feet are positioned carefully within a 
               pentagram chiseled into the floor. A scroll is consulted; up 
               comes an arm and a voice blurts out:

                                     VOICE
                         Omnia in duos: Duo in Unum: Unus in 
                         Nihil: Haec nec Quattuor nec Omnia 
                         nec Duo nec Unus nec Nihil Sunt.

               Nothing happens.

                                     VOICE
                         Come on, candles, out!

               But the little flames stand at attention without so much as 
               a tremble.

                                     VOICE
                         In Volunta Divina et Verbum Magi: 
                         Lux! Exstinguat!

               It's no use. There is a sigh and the figure moves forward 
               into the light. Revealed in the glow is the discouraged face 
               of Galen Bradwardyn, sorcerer's apprentice.

               TOWER

               Carrying the candelabra, the youth trudges up a circular 
               staircase.

               TURRET

               The highest point of the castle is a turret, open to the 
               stars and the night air. Here, more magic is afoot. An old 
               enchanter, Ulrich, Magister Ipsissimus, pours water from a 
               silver ewer into a stone bowl. As the surface ripples 
               disappear he leans forward and gazes into the pool. All at 
               once his face hardens as the distant sounds of screams and 
               thunder reach his ears. Lights and shadows, reflected from 
               within the basin, play across his face. His frown deepens as 
               the sound of his own voice comes to him from the vision in 
               the water -- Draco draconis -- suddenly squelched by the 
               roar of flame and an ugly snarl.

               At that moment Galen reaches the top of the steps and holds 
               up the candelabra.

                                     GALEN
                         Vide, Magister. There's something 
                         wrong.

               Ulrich, startled from his trance, slaps the water out of the 
               basin and turns to confront his student. Galen is taken aback 
               by the old man's grim countenance.

                                     GALEN
                         What's the matter? What's happened?

                                     ULRICH
                         I've just seen something. Something 
                         of consequence to you.

                                     GALEN
                         To me?

                                     ULRICH
                              (calm)
                         Yes. My own death.

               With a distracted gesture he causes the flames to extinguish 
               themselves.

                                     ULRICH
                         Perhaps we had better hasten your 
                         training.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BARNYARD - DAY

               Outside the castle wall Hodge is feeding the chickens and 
               ducks. He straightens up and squints through the early morning 
               mists. On a distant hillock two figures are moving toward 
               the woods.

               ULRICH AND GALEN

               Hobbling slowly with the aid of a pair of canes, Ulrich guides 
               his pupil across a wooden bridge and along a stream into the 
               forest.

                                     ULRICH
                              (stern and troubled)
                         This wood, these leaves, the birds, 
                         the very dome of heaven, once they 
                         all rang with one great chord: and 
                         philosophers like me kept it all in 
                         tune. Now, new voices are singing 
                         new songs.
                              (sharply)
                         Have you mastered the threefold 
                         transmutation?

                                     GALEN
                         Of course.

                                     ULRICH
                              (skeptical)
                         You have?

                                     GALEN
                         Well, almost.

                                     ULRICH
                         It's very difficult. Have you 
                         committed to memory undying the Codex 
                         de Profundis?

                              (a shrug)
                         The first two chapters.

                                     ULRICH
                         It's long. And what about the Ritual 
                         of Banishment as prescribed by my 
                         late master Balisarius?

                                     GALEN
                         To tell the truth, I haven't dared 
                         try it. What's the point, anyway?

                                     ULRICH
                         The point? The point is you don't 
                         know it, and you're no magician 
                         without it. It was my hope to school 
                         you, to mold your faculties and 
                         wits... I still believe you have 
                         some talent. Somewhere.

                                     GALEN
                         I hate books. I hate drill. I want a 
                         real task.

                                     ULRICH
                         There's no time now. When I'm gone, 
                         half the powers in the universe will 
                         vanish with me. And what's the use 
                         of a few lingering skills if they're 
                         left in the hands of a child?
                              (pause)
                         Listen!

                                     GALEN
                         I don't hear anything.

               Ulrich gauges the young man standing before him and makes a 
               decision. Reaching under his cloak he lifts off a fine silver 
               chain with an amulet dangling from it. He drapes it around 
               Galen's neck.

                                     ULRICH
                         Here, wear this.

               Galen instinctively wraps his hand around the jewel. He cocks 
               an ear.

                                     GALEN
                         Voices, singing on the road.

               He hastens forward to a promontory, eager to have a look. 
               Ulrich does not follow. Instead, doffing his cloak, he whirls 
               it before him, where it magically floats a few feet off the 
               ground. Awkwardly, the old man clambers aboard.

                                     GALEN
                         I don't see anything.

               He turns back, but the wizard is gone. A shadow falls over 
               him. He looks up. There, two hundred feet above the tree 
               tops his master is soaring on the wind.

               AIRBORNE

               The old conjurer squints into the distance. Miles away and 
               far below a company of drab walkers winds along the margins 
               of the forest. They are singing a mournful round.

               GALEN

               He gawks skyward. Suddenly, the old man leans down and 
               addresses him.

                                     ULRICH
                              (a shout)
                         We have visitors!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ROTUNDA - NIGHT

               Clustering together in the center of a wide reception hall 
               is a contingent of weary peasants, awkward amidst the dusty 
               rugs, drapes and heavy furniture. Their leader is a fineboned 
               youth, not yet twenty. Like the others, he is uneasy; his 
               name is Valerian. Hodge enters and sets a tray of mead before 
               them. He leaves without a word. The visitors stare glumly at 
               the refreshment, but are too timorous to go near it.

               CONJURING ROOM

               Galen helps Ulrich prepare for the audience. The sorcerer 
               peers at himself in a full-length mirror, adjusting the hem 
               of a black robe.

                                     ULRICH
                         Looks forbidding enough, don't you 
                         think?

                                     GALEN
                         Here are your sticks.

                                     ULRICH
                         No -- they'll think me infirm. You 
                         know, Balisarius wore this whenever 
                         he changed lead into gold. He could 
                         really do that, you know. I never 
                         could. Too bad -- you'd stand to 
                         inherit some real wealth.

                                     GALEN
                         You're in a morbid frame of mind. 
                         What's all this about dying? You 
                         don't even look sick.

                                     ULRICH
                              (tying on a sash)
                         You still wearing that amulet?
                              (Galen nods)
                         Good. Don't lose it. It still belongs 
                         to me.

               He backs away from the mirror and fits a silver coronet onto 
               his head.

                                     ULRICH
                         Now, adeptus minor, get yourself a 
                         handful of that sulphurous ash over 
                         there...

               The sorcerer starts down a circular stone staircase.

               THE ROTUNDA

               The visitors watch warily as a door swings open and Galen 
               makes his entrance, his face expressionless and hands pressed 
               together. He looks rather young to be the famous Ulrich.

               Galen allows a moment to go by, then throws his arms wide. 
               Ka-whump! and Ulrich appears in the doorway in a smoky 
               fireball. Alarmed, the visitors retreat.

                                     ULRICH
                         Nunc habeus lux!

               Pffst! around the room candles flare in their niches.

                                     ULRICH
                         Et calor!

               In the fireplace, the birch logs are suddenly ablaze. Ulrich 
               totters to the hearth and extends long bony fingers toward 
               the warmth.

                                     ULRICH
                         Welcome to Cragganmore. I am Ulrich. 
                         Which one of you calls himself 
                         Valerian?

               The travelers are suitably dazzled by the magician's 
               performance. The young leader of the party screws up his 
               courage and speaks.

                                     VALERIAN
                         That would be me. We are here on 
                         behalf...

                                     ULRICH
                         I know why you're here. You're a 
                         delegation from Urland, from beyond 
                         Dalvatia. Let's see the artifacts.

               The travelers exchange nervous glances. Valerian motions to 
               one of his companions. The man steps forward and hands over 
               a leather pouch. One by one, Valerian places the contents on 
               the table for Ulrich's inspection.

                                     VALERIAN
                         A bone. Scorched. A rock, fire-
                         blackened.
                              (pause)
                         Scales.

               At this, Ulrich advances and closely examines three shimmering 
               irridescent disks as big as saucers.

                                     ULRICH
                         All right. How did you come by these?

                                     VALERIAN
                              (proudly)
                         I found them. At the mouth of the 
                         lair.

                                     ULRICH
                              (grim)
                         What else?

               Valerian reaches under his jerkin and withdraws what appears 
               to be a curved sword. He jabs it into the table.

                                     VALERIAN
                         A claw.

                                     ULRICH
                         That's no claw. It's a tooth. By the 
                         gods!

               He runs a finger along a serrated edge and gazes bleakly at 
               his visitors.

                                     ULRICH
                         And you want me to do battle with 
                         that?

               Valerian has lost all trace of timidity.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Who else can we turn to? We all know 
                         what we're dealing with here. This 
                         is a basilicok.
                              (he takes a step 
                              forward)
                         A cockatrice.
                              (another step, bolder)
                         A dragon.
                              (he leans close to 
                              Ulrich)
                         This is no stag, no bear, no natural 
                         creature. This is one of your kind. 
                         And only a necromancer such as 
                         yourself can rid us of it.

                                     ULRICH
                         Did you try the Meredydd sisters? 
                         What about Rinbod? I've heard it 
                         said he killed a dragon once.

                                     VALERIAN
                         They're all dead. You're the only 
                         one left.

               With a sigh, Ulrich lowers himself into a chair. He rubs his 
               withered legs and shakes his head.

                                     ULRICH
                         It's a long way to Urland.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Every quarter, upon the solstices 
                         and the equinoxes there's a new 
                         victim.

               Greil, a grizzled peasant, speaks up.

                                     GREIL
                         My daughter, for one.

                         My sister... cousins...

                                     ULRICH
                         All women?

                         Girls. Virgins, to be exact, chosen 
                         by lot.

               Galen edges over to the table and inspects the scales and 
               tooth.

                                     GALEN
                         Master, don't you think --

                                     ULRICH
                         Silence!

               He broods for a long time.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Are you afraid of dragons?

                                     ULRICH
                         No. Sorcerers and dragons go back a 
                         long long time together. If it weren't 
                         for sorcerers, there wouldn't be any 
                         dragons.
                              (pause)
                         All right. I'll go.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               COURTYARD - DAY

               The travelers are making ready for departure in the grey 
               light of dawn. As Hodge stuffs provisions into a wicker box, 
               Ulrich wraps padding on a newly fashioned pair of crutches.

                                     ULRICH
                         I know of this dragon. Vermithrax 
                         Pejorative: she's four hundred years 
                         old. As far as I can tell she's the 
                         last of her kind. Very appropriate 
                         that I'm the one to finish her off, 
                         don't you think?
                              (he tries out the 
                              crutches)
                         There. Flatten the highest mountain. 
                         What say you, Galen?
                              (no answer)
                         Speak up.
                              (still no answer)
                         You, Hodge.

               Hodge mutters something inaudible and grimly keeps packing.

                                     ULRICH
                              (to Galen)
                         While I'm gone see you keep your 
                         nose in your books and your hands 
                         out of my reagents. Leave my 
                         instruments alone too.

               Galen crouches against the castle wall; he regards his master 
               sullenly.

                                     GALEN
                         Look at yourself. How far will you 
                         get like that? A league, two leagues?

                                     ULRICH
                         I'm not worried about the road.

                                     GALEN
                              (sarcastic)
                         Why don't you wave your hands around 
                         and summon up a coach-and-four?

                                     ULRICH
                         Don't mock me.

               Galen gets up and calls out to the Urlanders.

                                     GALEN
                         You pilgrims: You're used to 
                         lotteries. Why not draw straws to 
                         see who'll be first to carry 
                         ironshanks here.

               This is too much for Hodge.

                                     HODGE
                         Hold your tongue. If the master's 
                         got a mind to go, he'll go.

               Galen approaches the old sorcerer.

                                     GALEN
                         Send me. You're always saying I need 
                         seasoning. I need a test. Let me go.

                                     ULRICH
                         You're not ready.

                                     GALEN
                         I'm ready for anything.

                                     ULRICH
                              (wan smile)
                         Don't be so hasty. Your time will 
                         come.

               The walkers are ready to set forth. Hodge picks up his pack, 
               steps forward and pulls open the great gate.

               HORSEMEN

               Three mounted men are outside the gate, helmets on their 
               heads, swords on the belts and longbows across their 
               shoulders. They look formidable. The Urlanders take a step 
               backward.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Tyrian!?

               Tyrian is a lean, heavily bearded nobleman. There is a coat 
               of arms on the shield strapped to the pommel of his saddle.

                                     TYRIAN
                              (amiable)
                         Good morning, all.

                                     VALERIAN
                         We're not afraid of you. Give us the 
                         road.

                                     TYRIAN
                         Why, the road is yours. All the way 
                         to Urland. It's a long journey, isn't 
                         it? But when you're in search of a 
                         sorcerer, I suppose no distance is 
                         too great.

               Sensing trouble, Galen moves forward. Ulrich touches his 
               arm.

                                     ULRICH
                              (under his breath)
                         Say nothing.

               Galen hears the urgency in the old man's voice and obeys. 
               Hodge takes it upon himself to deal with the strangers.

                                     HODGE
                         What do you want with us?

                                     TYRIAN
                         Well, like my good friends here, 
                         I've come for a bit of black magic. 
                         No doubt you've heard of our troubles 
                         at home. This is Cragganmore, is it 
                         not?

                                     HODGE
                         Aye, this be the place of Ulrich.

               Tyrian dismounts and saunters up to the old magician.

                                     TYRIAN
                         And here we have the mystical presence 
                         himself, no?

                                     HODGE
                         You'd best keep your distance -- and 
                         your manners.

                                     TYRIAN
                         If he's ready to lay a dragon in its 
                         grave, he's got nothing to fear from 
                         me.
                              (turns to the Urlanders)
                         I've no more love for that creature 
                         than you lot. Nor has the King. But, 
                         before you stir things up, don't you 
                         think it a good idea to see you've 
                         got the right man for the job?

                                     HODGE
                         Aha -- it's a test you're looking 
                         for. We don't do tests.

                                     TYRIAN
                         I'm sure you don't. They never do 
                         tests -- and not many real deeds 
                         either. Oh, conversation with your 
                         grandmother's shade in a darkened 
                         room, the odd love potion or two... 
                         but comes a doubter, well then, it's 
                         the wrong day, the planets are not 
                         aligned, the entrails aren't 
                         favorable, we don't do tests.

                                     VALERIAN
                         We've got no doubts. We require no 
                         test.

                                     HODGE
                         And you're not going to get one.

               When Ulrich finally speaks, his voice is low and 
               authoritative.

                                     ULRICH
                              (to Galen)
                         Go to the conjuring room. The iron 
                         box. Fetch me the dagger within.

               Galen's eyes widen with alarm.

                                     ULRICH
                         The dagger. Be quick.

               Galen dashes into the castle. Ulrich gazes almost shyly at 
               Tyrian.

                                     ULRICH
                         You shall have your test.

               CONJURING ROOM

               Galen comes puffing up the steps, locates the iron box, and 
               flings it open. Amidst the tawdry paraphernalia of a 
               professional magician is an ivory-handled dagger covered 
               with runic inscriptions. Galen eagerly examines it to see 
               how the blade might twist aside or collapse into the handle, 
               but it is all too genuine. A murder weapon.

                                     ULRICH'S VOICE
                              (impatient)
                         Where are you, boy? I'm waiting.

               Galen throws open a window and looks down into the courtyard. 
               He displays the dagger.

                                     GALEN
                         Not this one, was it?

                                     ULRICH
                         The very one. Let it fall.

               Galen hesitates, then tosses it. Tumbling end over end, it 
               arcs downward. The old conjurer calmly stretches out a hand 
               and plucks it neatly out of the air. Galen watches as Ulrich 
               passes the weapon to Tyrian and strips back his robe exposing 
               a bony chest. Galen knows what's coming. He rushes for the 
               door. He's only a step away when it bangs shut of its own 
               accord. He sprints for a second exit. Whack! This door slams 
               shut too. Locked in. Quick, back to the window and climb 
               down the vine... Smack! the heavy shutters seal him in.

               ULRICH AND TYRIAN

               Ulrich takes Tyrian's arm and guides the point of the dagger 
               to his breastbone.

                                     ULRICH
                         Vita regula, vita hieratica!

               Everyone is filled with dread. Hodge is shaking. From the 
               castle come the rattling of shutters and Galen's muffled 
               cries. A sick sarcastic smile has crept over Tyrian's lips. 
               He tenses himself to thrust.

                                     ULRICH
                         Go on. Don't worry, you can't hurt 
                         me.

               CONJURING ROOM

               Galen stops hammering and presses his face to a crack in the 
               shutter. Below he can see the participants in this grisly 
               drama. He holds his breath. Tyrian makes a sudden movement 
               and buries the blade in Ulrich's chest. But the sorcerer 
               stands unbent, seemingly unhurt. Then, after a long moment, 
               he slowly sags forward over the dagger and the hand that 
               holds it. Tyrian shrinks back and allows the body to fall in 
               a heap. Very quickly he remounts. In another moment he and 
               his companions are gone. The others are riveted in horror. 
               Hodge sinks to his knees and wails his grief.

               Galen turns away from the window and gazes blankly into the 
               gloomy conjuring room. Click! The doors unlatch themselves 
               and swing open.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               FUNERAL PYRE - DAY

               Ulrich, principal magician and sorcerer of the western world, 
               reposes on a hardwood pyre. His hands are folded on his chest. 
               His face is peaceful. While the visitors wordlessly look on, 
               Galen touches a burning brand to the kindling. At first the 
               fire catches normally enough, but when the flames start to 
               envelop the body they suddenly turn pale green, producing an 
               unearthly roar. The onlookers back away from the intense 
               heat.

               GALEN

               The erstwhile apprentice stands his ground, blinking back 
               tears, his face weirdly illuminated by the fire.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CONJURING ROOM - DAY

               Galen sits alone amidst the museum-like collection of magical 
               apparatus. He stares at the amulet, considering its 
               significance. His reverie is interrupted by the murmur of 
               voices below. At the window he looks down to see Hodge bidding 
               farewell to the delegation from Urland. Valerian is the last 
               to leave. He pauses at the gate and glances up at Galen. 
               Then he moves on. The young student of magic sets his jaw, 
               suddenly filled with resolve.

               Moving through the room, he busies himself with the old man's 
               effects. He scoops up the loose books and parchments and 
               locks them into trunks. He drapes muslin cloths over the 
               alchemical devices. He sows a handful of salt over the 
               pentagram inscribed in the floor. Finally, he opens the cages 
               and releases the crow, the falcon, and the great horned owl.

               COURTYARD

               Hodge is up on the burned out funeral pyre, anxiously scraping 
               ashes and small bones into a leather pouch -- the remains of 
               Ulrich. Up behind him comes Galen, now clad in a traveler's 
               cloak, with a pack on his back and a staff in his hand.

                                     GALEN
                         Hodge -- what are you doing?

               Hodge quickly conceals the pouch.

                                     HODGE
                         Just making my farewell, thank you 
                         very much.

               He quickly climbs down, picks up his pack and follows Galen 
               out through the gate. As the door is pushed shut a huge oaken 
               timber falls into place, barring the castle against the 
               uninvited.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               HILLTOP - DAY

               Galen and Hodge labor to the crest of a grassy hill and turn 
               to look back across a wide valley. There on another hilltop 
               on the far side sits Cragganmore, lit by the red rays of the 
               setting sun. Galen removes the amulet from his neck and 
               clutches it in his fist. Hodge is bug-eyed to see it.

                                     HODGE
                         Be careful with that! You don't know 
                         what you're doing.

                                     GALEN
                         Stand back!

               He raises his hands toward the castle and calls out:

                                     GALEN
                         Cragganmore! Domus non i am! Silva 
                         celet!

               CRAGGANMORE

               The vines on the castle walls begin to twitch and stretch, 
               magically brought to animate life. They flow upward over the 
               masonry, branching out and covering every surface, then up 
               onto the roof. Finally only the tops of the chimneys and the 
               highest turrets stand above the green carpet. A century's 
               growth in a matter of seconds.

               GALEN & HODGE

               On their hilltop the old retainer gives the youth a fearful 
               look. Galen is too flushed with excitement over what he has 
               done to notice.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

               FOREST PATH - DAY

               Galen and Hodge trudge along an overgrown cart-track under 
               an arch of trees.

                                     HODGE
                         Oh, it's a vale of tears in which we 
                         dwell. It doesn't matter who you 
                         are, a king in his robes, a peasant 
                         in his rags, when your time comes, 
                         no magic can save you...

                                     GALEN
                         I guess...

               The apprentice's mind is elsewhere: he's got a coin hovering 
               in mid-air above his palm, bobbing gently as he walks.

                                     HODGE
                         ...the kindest lord a man could ask 
                         for... now he's gone. Ye gods he was 
                         fussy about his bath. And you'd think 
                         he could boil his own eggs with the 
                         snap of a finger, but no, he had old 
                         Hodge do it, of course.
                              (snurfling)
                         Up before five I was, mucking out 
                         the cages, slopping the pigs, and 
                         never once got so much as a thankyou 
                         or a pat on the back...
                              (through tears)
                         I'm going to miss him.

                                     GALEN
                         Me too...

               He plucks a low-hanging leaf, waves a hand over it, and 
               watches it turn into a spray of daffodils.

                                     HODGE
                         No you don't. All you care about is 
                         the tricks and knavery. Well, you 
                         don't pull any wool over these old 
                         eyes. It'll be a mighty long walk 
                         before you fill his shoes, you mark 
                         my word.

                                     GALEN
                         What's the matter, Hodge, pack too 
                         heavy? Here.

               He gives the pack a slap. It flies out of its harness and 
               floats alongside them. Hodge snatches it back and clutches 
               it tightly.

                                     HODGE
                         Careful with that!

                                     GALEN
                         Too cold, is it?

               A great coat drapes itself over Hodge's shoulders.

                                     HODGE
                         Stop it!

                                     GALEN
                         Too warm?

               The greatcoat disappears, as do the rest of his garments, 
               leaving him in his smalls.

                                     HODGE
                              (spluttering)
                         Stop it, I say! Out of respect for 
                         the master!

               Suppressing a grin, Galen mercifully waves his hand and 
               restores Hodge to his usual costume.

                                     GALEN
                         I've got as much respect for the 
                         master as anyone, old man. But -- 
                         then again, I'm master now.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               TRAVELERS' CAMP - NIGHT

               The Urlanders are gathered around a fire, sharing a meager 
               supper. The man named Greil pokes at the stew-pot.

                                     GREIL
                         I left my farm with seeds unplanted, 
                         calves unborn, nothing but a wife to 
                         chase down the strays, and for what? 
                         A funeral, that's what.

               He walks up and down behind Valerian.

                                     GREIL
                         Because some people said, find a 
                         magician. Not just a local fellow, 
                         an import, a good forty leagues from 
                         home. An all-powerful necromancer. 
                         Ha -- some necromancer!

               Malkin, an older man, speaks up.

                                     MALKIN
                         Hold your tongue, Greil. Sit. Eat.

                                     GREIL
                         I'll not sit. I'll not eat. See you 
                         the Great Bear. His tail points east. 
                         It's the equinox. Have you forgotten? 
                         Or rather not think about it?

                                     VALERIAN
                              (miserable)
                         He's right. I brought us here for 
                         nothing. May the gods help whoever's 
                         daughter it is tonight.

               There is a noise from the darkness beyond the campfire. Two 
               of the men get to their feet and listen. At first silence, 
               then more rustling. Without a word the two men dart into the 
               bushes and haul two interlopers before the company: Galen 
               and Hodge.

                                     HODGE
                         Good morrow, good morrow. Peace be 
                         with you.

                                     GALEN
                         Easy now. We mean no harm. We've 
                         been looking for you.

                                     GREIL
                              (growl)
                         Well, you've found us.

                                     GALEN
                              (brushing himself off)
                         More the other way around, I'd say.

                                     VALERIAN
                         What do you want?

                                     GALEN
                         A few words, that's all. You were 
                         looking for a conjurer.

                                     VALERIAN
                         He's dead.

                                     GALEN
                         Right. Requiscat in pace.
                              (he takes a deep breath)
                         Ecce: magister novus!

                                     GREIL
                         How say you?

               Galen surveys the puzzled faces. He draws himself up and 
               plunges in:

                                     GALEN
                         My lord Ulrich is no longer. All 
                         that you asked of him, you may now 
                         expect of me. The dangers he would 
                         face, I will now conquer. The task 
                         he would undertake I will now fulfill. 
                         I am Galen Bradwardyn, inheritor of 
                         Ulrich's craft and knowledge, and I 
                         am the Sorcerer you seek.

               There is a moment of depressed silence. Hodge rolls his eyes. 
               Greil starts to chuckle, then to laugh. Soon the others are 
               laughing too.

                                     GREIL
                         Well, that's a handsome thought, O 
                         wizard of wizards. But if there's 
                         one thing our friend Tyrian has shown 
                         us, it's to beware the pig in the 
                         poke. Who's got a dagger?

                                     HODGE
                         No tests!!

                                     GREIL
                         Call it proof, then.

               Someone brings out a dagger and hands it to Greil. Valerian 
               pushes it away.

                                     VALERIAN
                         We've seen enough tests.

               But Greil persists, waving the knife at the group.

                                     GREIL
                         Well I haven't. All I've seen is 
                         death. Death in our families, death 
                         on the road, and tonight, death at 
                         home.

               He lashes out with the knife. Galen jumps back, but Valerian 
               steps in, delivering a quick kick to Greil's gut, followed 
               by a right to the jaw that sends the bigger man sprawling. 
               He takes the knife.

                                     VALERIAN
                         What's come over you, anyway? Have 
                         you lost your wits?

               He propels Galen out of harm's way and sits him down on the 
               other side of the fire. Greil nurses his jaw.

                                     GREIL
                         I don't like it. Young snot-nose 
                         comes in here for sport at our 
                         expense. We're on a fool's errand, 
                         but we don't have to listen to this. 
                         I don't want to hear any more about 
                         sorcery. I don't want to hear any 
                         more about spells.

               Valerian hands Galen a plate of food.

                                     VALERIAN
                         You must be hungry.

                                     GALEN
                              (nods)
                         What's the matter with him?

                                     VALERIAN
                         It's not just him. It's all of us. 
                         It's the equinox.

               They both look up at the moon.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DRAGON COUNTRY - NIGHT

               The moon shines down on the far reaches of the Kingdom of 
               Urland, coldly lighting a barren landscape filled with the 
               skeletons of dead trees, blackened rock and bare ground. 
               Advancing across this mournful terrain is a troop of armed 
               men leading a blindfolded horse and tumbril. The horse is 
               skittish. Finally, in spite of shouts and lashings, it refuses 
               to go further. The leader, Horsrik, barks out an order:

                                     HORSRIK
                         Close enough! Bring her out!

               A young woman, no more than seventeen, is brought forth from 
               the cart. Long black hair falls down over a white tunic. Her 
               dark eyes dart fearfully around in her pale face. She is 
               half-carried, half dragged to the edge of a steaming crack 
               in the ground where she is manacled to a wooden post. By 
               lantern-light, Horsrik reads from a parchment scroll.

                                     HORSRIK
                         Now be it known throughout the 
                         kingdom, that this maiden, having 
                         lawfully been chosen by a deed of 
                         fortune and destiny, shall hereby 
                         give up her life for the greater 
                         good of Urland.

               There is a low rumble; the earth shakes. Horsrik glances 
               nervously around. He carries on by rote.

                                     HORSRIK
                         By this act shall be satisfied the 
                         powers that dwell underground and 
                         the spirits that attend thereto. In 
                         gratitude for this sacrifice His 
                         Majesty has declared the family -- 
                         what's the name? --

               He prods the girl, but she is too terrified to speak. Beneath 
               them, the earth seems to groan. Smoke issues from the mouth 
               of the pit. One of the nervous witnesses leans forward.

                                     RETAINER
                         Plowman! The family Plowman!

                                     HORSRIK
                              (rushing it)
                         -- the family Plowman to be free of 
                         obligations, taxations, levys and 
                         imposts for a period not to exceed 
                         five years...

               The horse suddenly rears, and blindfold notwithstanding, 
               gallops off, dragging the tumbril over the rocks. The men 
               behind Horsrik break ranks and scatter.

                                     HORSRIK
                         -- ordained and signed this day, 
                         etc., Casiodorus, in his glory the 
                         reigning king of this our realm... 
                         his seal, his mark, duly read by 
                         Chancellor Horsrik in his holy name.

               Now Horsrik joins the flight, chasing his men back over the 
               murky horizon.

               THE GIRL

               She strains against her manacles, cocking her head to listen 
               as the rumblings below subside. Presently the steam and smoke 
               blow away and she can see the horse pawing and stamping a 
               hundred yards distant, the wheel of the cart jammed between 
               rocks. Summoning up a wild will to live, she squeezes her 
               hands against the cold iron rings. No use. She spits on her 
               wrists and twists desperately. Blood starts. One hand slips 
               free. She looks at the horse. The animal tosses off its 
               blindfold and looks back at her. Now she strains again and 
               pulls her other hand free. She wipes the blood on her frock 
               and sprints toward the horse. But she doesn't get there. The 
               earth abruptly shifts from under her feet, tumbling her among 
               cracked and steaming rocks. When she raises her head a huge 
               shadow has fallen over the horse. There is a piteous whinny, 
               then a roar. The girl's face is suddenly lit by flames. She 
               scrambles to her feet and rushes back the other way.

               THE CHASE

               The girl hasn't taken a dozen steps when something huge 
               hurtles forward and blocks her way. Something scaly and 
               glittering. She whirls and stumbles off in a new direction. 
               This time she's cut off by a monstrous claw tipped with rapier-
               like talons. She screams and crawls away. Another claw 
               prevents her escape.

               THE CREATURE

               Membranous wings fold down against the night sky. Up comes 
               the silhouette of a reptilian head swaying on a serpentine 
               neck. There's an angry hiss. A sheet of flame envelops 
               everything.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               FADE IN:

               FOREST - DAY

               Tyrian kneels beside a mountain waterfall, having a drink 
               while his men hover in the background. One of them points 
               down the slope.

                                     MAN
                         There. I see them.

               Tyrian wipes his mouth unhurriedly and strolls over to look. 
               Far below, half hidden by trees, the little company of 
               Urlanders winds its way through the forest.

               A frown creeps over Tyrian's face.

                                     TYRIAN
                         Who's that old man?

                                     MAN
                         Where? Which one?

                                     TYRIAN
                         That one. That's the man from 
                         Cragganmore. Now what's he doing 
                         here?

                                     MAN
                         Filling in for the chief, I reckon.

                                     TYRIAN
                              (weary)
                         What a pity.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               HODGE

               Hodge marches along with the rest. When he's sure no one 
               else is looking he burrows into his garments and brings out 
               the leather pouch containing Ulrich's ashes. Reassured that 
               it's still with him, he tucks it away again. Galen falls 
               into step.

                                     GALEN
                         What have you got there?

                                     HODGE
                         None of your business.

                                     GALEN
                         A little gold, eh? What do you say I 
                         change it into lead?

                                     HODGE
                         Save your jokes for someone else. 
                         Me, I don't care for braggarts.

               They pass Valerian, who has dropped out of line.

                                     HODGE
                         And I don't care for frauds.

                                     GALEN
                         I'm no fraud.

                                     HODGE
                         Call it fool then. Upstart. Whatever 
                         pleases you.

                                     GALEN
                         Hodge, nobody forced you to come 
                         along.

                                     HODGE
                         Oh, I'm here of my own free will, 
                         all right. We each do the master's 
                         bidding in our own way.

                                     GALEN
                         Well, if he told you I needed 
                         wetnursing, why don't you just turn 
                         yourself around and go back home.

               Hodge snorts and fusses with his pack.

                                     HODGE
                         Home, is it? You've seen to that, 
                         haven't you? Gone to seed, I'd say...

               He glances over and discovers Galen missing.

               GALEN

               He walks back along the trail, looking for Valerian. Pretty 
               soon the rest of the travelers are out of sight. He hears 
               the sound of a splash. He turns off the trail and pushes 
               through some shrubbery.

               FOREST POOL

               Under the oaks and hickory, a forest stream has widened into 
               a quiet pool. A pile of clothes lies on a rock at the edge. 
               Out in the middle, Valerian is treading water.

                                     GALEN
                         You're too far behind us. Come on 
                         out.

                                     VALERIAN
                         You go ahead, I'll catch up.

                                     GALEN
                         Not a good idea to get separated. 
                         Let's go.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Right. I'll be along.

               Galen leans over and splashes some water on his face. Feels 
               good. He shucks his pack and starts to throw off his clothes. 
               Valerian doesn't like it.

                                     VALERIAN
                         That's all right. Don't come in.

               But Galen is now naked and walking into the water. He swims 
               out toward Valerian.

                                     VALERIAN
                              (edgy)
                         You better get back to the group, 
                         they're probably worried.

               Galen keeps swimming.

                                     VALERIAN
                         I prefer to swim alone, if you don't 
                         mind.

               But Galen has slipped beneath the surface; he doesn't hear.

               UNDERWATER

               Galen works his way through the murky green underwater world. 
               Suddenly, he stops short and stares. He's only a few feet 
               from Valerian's dangling legs. He gasps in surprise. Valerian 
               is no boy.

               ON THE SURFACE

               Galen comes shooting to the surface, coughing and sputtering.

                                     GALEN
                         By the gods!

               Valerian is pale and frightened.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Stay away.

               She propels herself backward, then turns and swims for shore.

               ON THE SHORE

               Galen and Valerian have taken refuge behind separate bushes. 
               Briskly they pull on their clothes.

                                     VALERIAN
                         I suppose you'll tell everyone. Go 
                         ahead, I don't care. It's a relief.

                                     GALEN
                         I'm not going to say anything.

                                     VALERIAN
                         I don't blame you. I was stupid. 
                         Careless. A silly woman!

                                     GALEN
                              (feeble bluff)
                         Take it easy. I knew the moment I 
                         saw you. I've known the whole time.

                                     VALERIAN
                         You never knew a thing. No one knew. 
                         Not since I was born. Go on, run off 
                         and tell them. It'll make a great 
                         story.

                                     GALEN
                         Don't worry. No one's going to find 
                         out. Just tell me: why?

                                     VALERIAN
                         Ask my father.

               They finish dressing in silence. Finally:

                                     GALEN
                         The lottery! Daughters are chosen, 
                         but sons are not!

                                     VALERIAN
                         That's right. Unless you have plenty 
                         of gold or property.

                                     GALEN
                         What do you mean?

                                     VALERIAN
                         If you're rich enough, your name 
                         never goes in.
                              (bitter)
                         My father is poor. So are a lot of 
                         fathers.

               He studies her. She jams a hat down over her head and, once 
               more the young man, stalks off.

               THE VISION

               Galen walks down to the edge of the pool to retrieve his 
               pack. As he leans over he catches sight of what appears to 
               be a reflection in the water: Tyrian on horseback. He whips 
               around, but no one is behind him. Riveted by the vision, he 
               hurries along the bank to follow it. After a few paces the 
               blurry figure dismounts, unslings a longbow, nocks an arrow 
               and draws the string taut.

                                     GALEN
                              (horrified)
                         No!

               FOREST

               Galen sprints through the trees. Up ahead is Valerian, walking 
               resolutely.

                                     GALEN
                         No!

               She glances back at him and grimly keeps on walking. Galen 
               shoots past her and on into the forest.

                                     GALEN
                         Hodge!

               TRAVELERS

               Galen races up the trail rounds a bend and sees the Urlanders 
               coming toward him. Hodge precedes the group with an unsteady 
               gait. He sees Galen, raises up his arms and flops face down 
               on the trail. A long arrow protrudes from his back. Galen 
               kneels beside him. The uneasy company keeps its distance. 
               Hodge struggles to speak.

                                     HODGE
                         Galen? Can you hear me?

                                     GALEN
                         I hear you.

                                     HODGE
                         You know, somebody shot me, but I 
                         can still talk. There's something 
                         that has to be done.

                                     GALEN
                         I know.

                                     HODGE
                         Not that cockatrice. Ulrich's ashes. 
                         Here.

               Hodge's hand comes out from under his coat gripping the 
               leather pouch. Galen tugs at it, but Hodge can't let go.

                                     HODGE
                         Take it. Sorry, you'll have to peel 
                         it loose.

               Galen pries the sack out of Hodge's clenched fingers. Suddenly 
               the hand comes up, grabs Galen by the hair, and pulls him 
               near.

                                     HODGE
                              (a croak)
                         ...burning water... find the lake, 
                         throw it in...

                                     GALEN
                              (holding up the pouch)
                         What are you doing with this, Hodge?

                                     HODGE
                         ...burning water...

               He dies. Galen frees himself from his grasp.

                                     GALEN
                         Hodge, don't die. Listen to me. You're 
                         not going to die.

               Galen is frantic. He pulls out the amulet and wraps his hand 
               around it.

                                     GALEN
                         Excede, mortem! Revoca, vitam!
                              (he shakes the body)
                         Excede, mortem! Revoca, vitam!

               But Hodge has passed on, and Galen's magic has no way to 
               reach him. Suddenly the youth cries out in pain. He drops 
               the amulet and looks at his palm. The device has burned his 
               flesh. Now he becomes aware of troubled Urlanders looking 
               over his shoulder, witness to his failure.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               LAKE - DAY

               Wind whips the leaden wave tops on a vast rainy lake. The 
               travelers are rowing across in an open longboat, aided by a 
               tattered lateen sail. Valerian mans the steering oar at the 
               stern while Galen broods in the bow. He feels like an imposter 
               in their eyes.

               FJORD

               The boat pulls into a long narrow waterway with granite cliffs 
               on either side. Moving through swirls of fog, they beach the 
               boat and step out onto a craggy shore. Greil leans over and 
               kisses a rock.

                                     GREIL
                         Urland!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DRAGON COUNTRY - DAY

               The travelers descend a mountain pass and emerge through a 
               wrack of cloud into a gray and cheerless region. Fire-
               blackened trees dot the barren landscape. As they reach the 
               flatlands, the Urlanders instinctively pick up the pace. 
               Galen slows to inspect the weird surroundings. Valerian trots 
               past him.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Come on. Don't dawdle here.

               Galen falls into step with her.

                                     GALEN
                         The whole kingdom like this?

                                     VALERIAN
                         No. We're near the lair. Keep moving.

               Galen looks around with new interest.

                                     GALEN
                         Where?

                                     VALERIAN
                         Over there. Doesn't matter. We're in 
                         no danger if we just pass through 
                         quickly.

               Galen stops. High on the slope beside them is a gaping 
               fissure.

                                     GALEN
                         I see it. Let's have a look.

                                     VALERIAN
                         No!

               But Galen is already toiling up the incline.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Greil! Malkin! Help!

               The travelers turn to see what's the matter.

               THE LAIR

               Galen approaches the lair, pausing beside a wooden post with 
               iron manacles dangling from it. He fingers them thoughtfully. 
               Malkin, Greil and Valerian rush up behind him, their faces 
               drawn with worry.

                                     GREIL
                         Look, you don't have to do this. We 
                         know you're a fine young magician. 
                         None better. There's no need to prove 
                         it to us.

                                     GALEN
                         Are there other entrances?

                                     VALERIAN
                         No. One's enough.

                                     GREIL
                         Come on. The road's this way. We'll 
                         tell everybody how close you got.

                                     GALEN
                              (coolly)
                         No smoke. How do you know it's in 
                         there?

                                     GREIL
                         Don't be a fool. Come away now and 
                         live to tell about it.

               Instead, Galen starts into the crack. Greil and Malkin hasten 
               away, but Valerian lingers, watching in mounting frustration 
               as Galen probes further and further into the lair. She picks 
               up a fistful of stones and throws them at him.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Go ahead! You're going to die! What 
                         a fine trick that will be!

               But Galen is lost in the gloom. She flees.

               UNDERGROUND

               Galen puts his hand on the rugged wall: the rocks are hot to 
               the touch. Something glinting on the floor catches Galen's 
               eye: an irridescent disk, a dragon scale. It flashes the 
               colors of the rainbow as Galen examines it. All at once the 
               ground shudders; chunks of rock fall from the ceiling. A 
               pall of smoke billows up from the depths.

               OUTSIDE

               Galen staggers out of the fissure coughing and gagging in a 
               swirl of smoke. There is no sign of the Urlanders. He throws 
               down his pack, climbs onto a huge boulder and surveys the 
               massive cliffs rising behind the lair. He grasps the amulet 
               and closes his eyes.

                                     GALEN
                         Now, great mountain, hear my command: 
                         Terrae lapsus consignet latibulum 
                         draconis! Evanescat latibulum 
                         draconis!

               LANDSLIDE

               With a thunderous splitting sound, the entire top of the 
               cliff pitches forward and topples onto the lower half of the 
               mountain, sweeping tons of debris into the air. Boulders the 
               size of houses bound down the mountain toward the magician. 
               Eyes wide with awe, he turns and runs for his life. Even as 
               he careens down the slope, chunks of rock rumble past. One 
               catches him at the knee and sends him flying.

               He covers his head and joins the landslide. Finally the dust 
               lifts and he finds himself in a gully face to face with the 
               cowering Urlanders. They look with real fear at the man who 
               just conjured up the Apocalypse. Tattered and torn, covered 
               with dirt, Galen climbs up out of the shelter for a look at 
               his handiwork.

               LANDSCAPE

               The territory has been drastically transformed: the dragon's 
               lair is now buried beneath hundreds of tons of broken granite. 
               The Urlanders look upon the new landscape with stupefaction. 
               Galen grins a triumphant split-lip grin that fails to win 
               them over. Presently they back away and run off down the 
               trail, Valerian in their midst. Galen's grin fades.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               VILLAGE - DAY

               The Village of Swanscombe is little more than a rough and 
               ready collection of thatched huts and mud-daubed outbuildings 
               surrounded by cultivated fields. Dogs sleep in open door-
               ways; chickens peck around the communal well -- but there 
               are no people in evidence as Valerian and her company troop 
               into town.

               VALERIAN

               She trots across the square and enters a deserted blacksmith 
               shop.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Father? Hello?

               She goes over to the forge. Hot coals are burning. She becomes 
               aware of a sound -- voices -- chanting.

               SQUARE

               She walks across the square toward the voices. She is joined 
               by Greil, Malkin and the other travelers, all of them puzzled 
               by the desolation. As they approach the grange hall the voices 
               grow louder. They seem to be singing. The main doors open 
               briefly and three villagers scamper out, dripping wet and 
               wrapped in white muslin. Valerian and her companions look at 
               each other in astonishment.

               IN THE GRANGE HALL

               In a wooden cistern in the middle of the hall a woman is 
               being held under water. After a few moments she is pulled to 
               the surface by a tall red-haired man with long bony fingers: 
               Brother Jacopus Januensis, a Carthusian monk. There's a wooden 
               cross on his chest and a mad look in his eye. Gathered around 
               him are the missing villagers, every man woman and child, 
               here to be baptised and sing a few newly-learned hymns in 
               praise of Our Lord Jesus Christ.

                                     BROTHER JACOPUS
                         Now are you cleansed of your sins! 
                         Now are you born again, purified in 
                         spirit, into the fellowship of Jesus 
                         Christ!

               The travelers enter and mingle with the congregation. Valerian 
               scans the crowd until she locates her father, Simon, a balding 
               sturdy journeyman. He's overjoyed at her return and gives 
               her a hearty embrace.

                                     SIMON
                         Welcome back, my son.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Father, what are you doing? Have you 
                         all lost your minds?

                                     SIMON
                         Some have.

               He points to the monk, who is dunking a screaming infant and 
               carrying on about the Bishop of Rome.

                                     SIMON
                         It's this monk. He can read and write, 
                         and talk too, I'm afraid.

                                     VALERIAN
                         And they listen?

                                     SIMON
                         Shh! They think this a holy place, a 
                         tabernacle.

                                     VALERIAN
                         This is the granary. What kind of 
                         welcome is this? I've got news of 
                         the sorcerer and news of the dragon.

                                     SIMON
                         You were brave to go, you and your 
                         friends. But nobody cares. Listen -- 
                         he knows what they want to hear.

               MONK

               Brother Jacopus strides back and forth before the assembly 
               in an inspired state.

                                     BROTHER JACOPUS
                         The man who walks with Christ is not 
                         a man to fear a dragon: Yea, though 
                         I walk through the valley of the 
                         shadow of death I will fear no evil! 
                         You say you are preyed upon by a 
                         foul beast. Yes, but what is the 
                         nature of this beast? It comes to 
                         you on bat's wings and clawed feet, 
                         does it not? It breathes fire, does 
                         it not? And it lives under ground. 
                         This is no dragon. This is Lucifer!

                                     VOICE
                         Whoever it is, he's dead.

               This is Galen, who has just stepped into the hall, tattered, 
               bedraggled and triumphant.

                                     BROTHER JACOPUS
                         Nay, brother! It is not as easy as 
                         that. Allegiance to Christ, to be 
                         sure, but also prayer and confession. 
                         These are the arms by which Satan 
                         may be put down.

                                     GALEN
                         You're talking about superstition, 
                         friend. None of that has anything to 
                         do with what I, Galen, have already 
                         achieved.

               He marches to the center of the gathering.

                                     SIMON
                              (to Valerian)
                         You brought this stranger?

                                     VALERIAN
                         Ulrich's apprentice. He's a braggart, 
                         but it doesn't matter.

                                     GALEN
                         People of Urland! Send a messenger 
                         to the king. Vermithrax is dead. 
                         Crushed by the power of the moon and 
                         the stars! Laid low by ancient wisdom. 
                         Dropped into the Abyss by mystical 
                         practice.

                                     BROTHER JACOPUS
                         Spoken like a pagan. Every word as 
                         reprobate as it is false!
                              (holding up his cross)
                         Solum in hoc signo vinces!

                                     GALEN
                         Nihil plus mysterium!

               He gestures boldly and a fireball crackles at the monk's 
               feet. The holy man scurries back. A hush falls upon the 
               congregation.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DRAGON COUNTRY - DAY

               A procession of curious villagers winds its way into the 
               badlands. They gather on a promontory overlooking the dragon's 
               lair. They stand there for a long time, a chill wind whipping 
               their garments, trying to understand what's happened. The 
               monk is mightily displeased.

                                     BROTHER JACOPUS
                         Praise God! Blessed is he that is 
                         humble before the Lord!

                                     VALERIAN
                         Your god had nothing to do with it.

               Indeed, Galen's act is already the stuff of legend:

                                     MALKIN
                         We saw it with our own eyes. He flew 
                         to the mountain top. He was a bird. 
                         He brought forth lightning. I saw 
                         it.

               Some of the younger villagers scamper forward to the spot 
               where the cave had its opening. With yells and whoops they 
               beat the ground with clubs. In the crowd Simon begins to 
               smile, then to laugh. Soon he leads the villagers in a 
               tumultuous cheer. Brother Jacopus and some of his converts 
               drop to their knees and pray.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CELEBRATION

               The inhabitants of Swanscombe have decked out the town square 
               and are making a night of it. By torchlight they dance merrily 
               to jigs and reels provided by the local fiddlers. Ale flows 
               freely from oak casks.

               VALERIAN'S HOUSE

               Valerian is kneeling before a trunk full of women's clothing. 
               She pulls out a long simple frock, goes to a crude mirror, 
               and holds it up against her body to gauge the effect. Her 
               father comes up behind her. He is angry and frightened.

                                     SIMON
                         Put that away. What if you were seen?

                                     VALERIAN
                         I'm going to be seen. I want to be 
                         seen. Tonight the world finds out 
                         that you never had a son.

                                     SIMON
                         No, you mustn't do that. It's too 
                         soon. We've got to think about this, 
                         we've got to make a plan.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Father: the danger is over.

               He sits on the bed and puts his head in his hands.

                                     SIMON
                         I know. What am I going to say to my 
                         friends who still mourn for their 
                         lost girls.

                                     VALERIAN
                         You'll say you did what you had to. 
                         This is a time for celebration -- 
                         and forgiveness.

               He looks up at her, trying to imagine what it's going to be 
               like having a daughter.

               CELEBRATION

               Galen is surrounded by a crowd of wide-eyed kids and not a 
               few adults, entertaining them by pulling duck's eggs out of 
               their ears and causing coins to disappear. Presently he feels 
               the attention of his audience shift away to someone standing 
               behind him. He turns to find a shy but determined Valerian 
               sweetly decked out in her blue frock. A buzz goes through 
               the crowd. Valerian blushes and wavers: she seems ready to 
               bolt for home. But Galen takes her by the hand, and with 
               conspicuous politesse leads her to the dance.

               DANCE

               It's forward, back and around sixth-century style: the young 
               sorcerer can't take his eyes off his partner. But she's too 
               shy to return his gaze.

                                     GALEN
                         Looks like you've been up to a little 
                         sorcery yourself.

               Valerian doesn't know what to say.

                                     GALEN
                         Or is it witchcraft?

               She still doesn't reply. It's all she can do to keep on 
               dancing.

                                     GALEN
                         What's the matter? A real woman never 
                         stops talking.

                                     VALERIAN
                         I think it was much easier being a 
                         boy.

               SIMON & GREIL

               They stand on the sidelines, watching the young couple step 
               to the music.

                                     SIMON
                         The damnedest thing is, she was twice 
                         the man of anyone else in the village. 
                         Now she's twice the woman.

                                     GREIL
                              (grim)
                         Would that I had been as clever as 
                         her father.

                                     SIMON
                         Come now, Greil. Don't begrudge a 
                         life spared.

                                     GREIL
                         I begrudge nothing. But I wonder at 
                         what we have seen and how it was 
                         done.

                                     SIMON
                         You were there.

                                     GREIL
                         I saw what I saw. But this jack-anapes 
                         was barely ready to carry his master's 
                         chamberpot. Isn't it strange that at 
                         the very moment the beast is put 
                         down we should have a holy man here 
                         in the village?

                                     SIMON
                         You don't believe that superstitious 
                         Christian rot, do you?

                                     GREIL
                              (defensive)
                         It is said God works his wonders in 
                         mysterious ways.

               CELEBRATION

               While the proud Simon dances in the background with his 
               daughter, a group of tipsy villagers clusters around Galen, 
               belching forth a drinking song. The young magician raises 
               his own mug and joins in on the chorus. Abruptly the music 
               stops. The singing dies away. The ensuing silence is broken 
               by the sound of galloping hooves. Presently three horsemen 
               appear at the end of town: Tyrian and his henchmen. They 
               guide their horses forward into the midst of the merry-makers. 
               Tyrian dismounts and looks around in his usual friendly way.

                                     TYRIAN
                         A celebration! Don't stop on my 
                         account. You -- musicians, more music!

               The musicians leave their instruments in their laps. Tyrian 
               draws himself a measure of ale and raises it above his head.

                                     TYRIAN
                         A toast! To the deed of the day! You 
                         see, good news travels fast. The 
                         King himself has already heard it. 
                         And like yourselves, tonight he's 
                         overcome with joy.

                                     MALKIN
                         What would you have of us then?

                                     TYRIAN
                         Not a thing. It's this one.
                              (he gestures toward 
                              Galen)
                         The King would meet our new benefactor 
                         and offer his gratitude to the man 
                         who succeeded where so many have 
                         failed.

                                     GALEN
                              (sobering up)
                         What sort of gratitude? A knife in 
                         the belly? An arrow in the back?

               Tyrian's smile freezes on his face. He steps in front of 
               Galen, towering over him.

                                     TYRIAN
                         My young friend, I'd as soon dispatch 
                         you as I did the others, and for the 
                         same reason. But his Majesty would 
                         like a cozy chat, and commands 
                         otherwise.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Don't go, Galen. Cast a spell and 
                         turn them into toads. It should be 
                         easy; that's what they are.

               Tyrian regards her coolly, taking in her change of costume 
               and its meaning.

                                     TYRIAN
                         Well, well: still plenty of cheek 
                         under those skirts, it seems.

               Having buried the dragon under a mountain, Galen decides 
               he's not worried about an appearance at court. He smiles at 
               Valerian.

                                     GALEN
                         Don't worry. I'll be back.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               RIDERS

               Three horses gallop through the moors and fens of central 
               Urland. Galen is tucked up behind Tyrian. On the distant 
               horizon, the battlements of the King's castle glow in the 
               slanting light of a new day.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THRONE ROOM - DAY

               Within the castle is a great hall with shafts of daylight 
               poking in through narrow windows set high in the walls. In 
               the middle of the room stands a carved oak throne. There is 
               Casiodorus Rex, King of Urland, a bearded man in his fifties, 
               as spare and somber as the room in which he sits. He is 
               flanked by a few servants, assorted courtiers and Tyrian. 
               Standing before them all is Galen, looking unhappy. He pours 
               a pitcher full of water into a small glazed goblet.

                                     GALEN
                         One of the best things about the 
                         water here in Urland is that there's 
                         so much of it -- look at that!

               Water continues to pour into the goblet without overflowing. 
               Galen takes a sip.

                                     GALEN
                         Mmm. Good. But not cold enough. 
                         Perhaps I could borrow a scarf from 
                         his Majesty.

               The King makes no sign. Galen approaches stiffly, takes a 
               scarf and retreats.

                                     GALEN
                         I cover the goblet, so... remove, 
                         so... and behold: winter in a mug!

               And he's done it: he turns the goblet over and a small chunk 
               of ice hits the floor. The royal reaction is equally frosty. 
               Galen is bombing, and he knows it.

                                     GALEN
                         All right. How many of you have ever 
                         seen a table fly?

               He mutters an incantation. In the audience, Tyrian notes 
               that Galen has his hand wrapped around the amulet. There is 
               a loud clatter as the heavy oak table before the throne begins 
               to jitter and buck. As the wine spills and plates go flying, 
               the King wearily raises a hand.

                                     KING
                         Enough! That's fine.

                                     GALEN
                         Wait, it'll rise now.

                                     KING
                         Don't bother. Not necessary.

               The table cracks in half and dumps a mess of fruit and 
               crockery at the onlookers' feet.

                                     KING
                         Tell me: the landslide -- it was 
                         accomplished this same way?

                                     GALEN
                         Yes.

                                     KING
                         I see. And having rendered such unique 
                         service to our kingdom, what would 
                         you claim as a reward?

                                     GALEN
                         Please -- no payment. I have always 
                         found magical practice to be its own 
                         reward. I seek only some yet greater 
                         challenge.

               This handsome sentiment doesn't go over any better than his 
               tricks.

                                     KING
                         Did you ever hear of King Gaiseric? 
                         Of course not, you weren't even born. 
                         He was my brother, a great King and 
                         a valiant man-at-arms. When he 
                         ascended to the throne, the dragon 
                         was unbridled. No one knew where it 
                         might strike next. So he brought 
                         forth his broadsword and his spear, 
                         assembled a company of his best 
                         fighters and went out to do battle.
                              (pause)
                         He was never seen again. But his 
                         attack provoked the most terrible 
                         reprisals: whole villages incinerated, 
                         entire crops burned. Death, famine, 
                         horrible.

               The King grimaces as the memories come flooding back.

                                     KING
                              (quietly)
                         How did you arrogate to yourself the 
                         role of savior?

                                     GALEN
                         I was invited.

                                     KING
                         Not by me. Did you ever consider the 
                         consequences of failure?

                                     GALEN
                         What failure? What's the matter with 
                         you people? You want the dragon back?

                                     KING
                         Then the beast is dead?

                                     GALEN
                         Yes, of course. Dead.

                                     KING
                         We shall see.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DUNGEON

               Two guards thrust Galen into a narrow cell and slam the barred 
               door shut. The young sorcerer waits until they're safely out 
               of sight, then takes out his amulet. He ponders it for a 
               doubtful moment. Suddenly a gloved hand darts in and whips 
               it off his neck and out through the bars.

                                     TYRIAN
                         Thank you.

               He makes an ironic salute and leaves. Galen sits down heavily 
               and stares at the stone walls.

               CORRIDOR

               Unseen by Galen, a figure clad in silk and lace skitters 
               down a murky dungeon hallway and peers around a corner. 
               Stealing a look at Galen is the Princess Elspeth, a fey beauty 
               in her early twenties. After a moment, spooked by some 
               imagined noise, she flits away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DRAGON COUNTRY - DAY

               Dark clouds slide across a pale sun, throwing the ruined 
               land below into shadow. Soon fat droplets of rain are 
               splattering on the rocks above the dragon's lair. With each 
               tiny splash there is a sizzle and a puff of steam. These 
               rocks are hot!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DUNGEON

               Outside the barred window, a steady rain is falling. Inside, 
               Galen uses a chunk of limestone to inscribe a pentagram on 
               the floor of his cell. He marks runic signs on the window 
               sill and lintel. Then, positioning himself in the center of 
               the mystic symbol, he raises his hands and spreads his 
               fingers.

                                     GALEN
                              (authoritative)
                         Cubiculum gravis aperat!

               There's a long moment when nothing happens. A very long 
               moment. Finally, a thoroughly frustrated Galen leaps to the 
               window and rattles the bars.

                                     GALEN
                         Open up, dammit! Fenestra gravis 
                         aperat! Asser gravis aperat! 
                         Divinitus!

                                     VOICE
                         Salve, magistrum iuvenilum.

               Startled, Galen whirls around to find Elspeth standing outside 
               his cell. She hands some food and blankets through the bars.

                                     ELSPETH
                         I've studied Latin. Greek, too. Me 
                         appelo Elspeth, filia regis.

               Galen looks her over. He's never seen anyone so angelic.

                                     GALEN
                         How do you do.

                                     ELSPETH
                         Please don't think ill of us. My 
                         father is a wonderful man, a wise 
                         man. The lottery was his idea.

                                     GALEN
                         I see.

                                     ELSPETH
                         You don't understand. From the moment 
                         it began, the dragon was tame. The 
                         kingdom prospered.

                                     GALEN
                         And only a few had to be sacrificed.

                                     ELSPETH
                         Yes, that's true. Isn't it better 
                         that a few should die that many might 
                         live?

                                     GALEN
                         Depends on who does the dying.

                                     ELSPETH
                         Oh, but we all take our chances. My 
                         father is a just man. My name is 
                         entered on the lists, along with 
                         every other young --

                                     GALEN
                         Virgin?

                                     ELSPETH
                         Maiden.

                                     GALEN
                         If you say so.

                                     ELSPETH
                         What do you mean?

                                     GALEN
                              (sighs)
                         Nothing.

                                     ELSPETH
                         I've participated in every drawing 
                         since I came of age.

                                     GALEN
                         Maybe.

                                     ELSPETH
                         It's true. You don't believe me. You 
                         think I'm lying. Well I'm not.

                                     GALEN
                         I'm sorry. I heard a rumor. Families 
                         with money, that sort of thing.

                                     ELSPETH
                         Don't listen to rumors. They're lies. 
                         I have to go now.

                                     GALEN
                         Wait -- how long do I have to stay 
                         in here?

                                     ELSPETH
                         Until we know. Not long. Goodbye. 
                         Vale. Dormi bene.

               She slips away down the corridor.

               LIBRARY

               King Casiodorus and Tyrian are huddled over a table piled 
               high with manuscripts and papers. Tyrian clears a spot and 
               sets out a stack of lead bars.

                                     KING
                         That's enough. Let's not be greedy 
                         here.

               The King picks up Galen's amulet, and holds it over the bars 
               in his clenched fist.

                                     KING
                         Now then: I, Casiodorus Rex do hereby 
                         command thou base metal to change 
                         thy essence and become gold.

               There is a rustle of skirts and Elspeth appears behind him.

                                     ELSPETH
                         Father?

                                     KING
                         Not now. Tyrian, remove all but one 
                         bar. We'll try it one at a time.

                                     ELSPETH
                         Father: did you know that some 
                         families have paid bribes to stay 
                         out of the lottery?

               The King and Tyrian glance up at her.

                                     KING
                         Nonsense. By the power of this amulet, 
                         justly wielded by my hand in 
                         accordance with the laws of Urland, 
                         now lead be thou gold.

               The lead remains unchanged, but the King gives out a cry and 
               drops the amulet.

                                     KING
                         I'm burned! What devilish thing is 
                         this?

                                     ELSPETH
                         Have you ever kept my name off the 
                         lottery list?

                                     KING
                         That'll be all, Tyrian. You may 
                         withdraw.

               Tyrian bows and exits. The King uses his sceptre to pick up 
               the amulet and chain. He conceals it in a hollowed-out book 
               and places the volume on a shelf among many others.

                                     KING
                         Now, my dear, what's troubling you?

                                     ELSPETH
                         Answer my question: am I not exposed 
                         to the same risk as every other man's 
                         daughter?

               The King paces over to the window and stares out. The rain 
               has stopped.

                                     ELSPETH
                         Well?

                                     KING
                              (finally)
                         Your father loves you very much.

               Elspeth sways in dismay.

                                     ELSPETH
                              (a wail)
                         It's true! What have you done to 
                         me!?

                                     KING
                         Who fills your head with such ideas?

               At that moment a tremor passes through the room. King and 
               daughter look at each other in alarm.

               DUNGEON

               The same tremor shakes the bars in Galen's cell. Puzzled, he 
               rolls off his straw palette and gets to his feet. The tremor 
               dies away. Suddenly a violent shaking hits the cell, bouncing 
               Galen off the walls.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               VILLAGE SQUARE

               Swanscombe is gripped by the same earthquake. Dodging panicky 
               barnyard animals, Valerian and her father join other 
               frightened villagers in the center of town.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DRAGON COUNTRY

               Above the dragon's lair, boulders are shifting and grinding 
               together. Massive chunks of stone break loose and tumble 
               down the incline.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               GALEN

               The shaking has stopped. Rock dust filters down from the 
               ceiling. Galen picks himself up and stares: the door to his 
               cell is off its hinges and is sagging open. He darts out.

               CORRIDOR

               Galen dashes along the hallway, rounds a corner and stops. 
               At the other end of the passage is Tyrian.

                                     TYRIAN
                         You little meddler! It's alive!

               He draws his sword and advances. Galen warily retreats. Tyrian 
               breaks into a run. Galen turns and sprints away.

               COURTYARD

               Unruly horses, terrified by the quake, rush blindly around 
               the courtyard. Hostlers try vainly to catch them. Tyrian 
               leans down from an upstairs window.

                                     TYRIAN
                         Close the main gate! Quick!

               The men below scramble for the gates. Galen bursts out of 
               hiding, sees the untended horses, and swings aboard as one 
               goes past. A cry goes up from the guards.

                                     TYRIAN
                         There! Stop him!

               Galen rides like mad for the exit, but he's a half-second 
               late: the doors boom shut in his face. He wheels the horse 
               around. The King's men are coming toward him with pikes. 
               Digging his heels into the horse's sides, he urges the animal 
               back across the courtyard, up the steps and right into the 
               building!

               THRONE ROOM

               Galen gallops into the empty chamber, knocking over the throne 
               and vaulting a table. Hot on his heels are armed soldiers. 
               He kicks the horse again and shoots under an archway.

               The kitchen is already in chaos from the earthquake when 
               Galen charges in on his wild steed. Food, utensils and cooks 
               go flying. He reins in, ducks his head, and squeezes the 
               horse out into a narrow hallway.

               HALLWAY

               He clatters down the passageway. But here comes a contingent 
               of footmen from the opposite direction. Galen rides them 
               into the walls!

               STAIRS

               The horse scrabbles up the stairs, Galen tucked low against 
               its neck. On the upper landing he comes face to face with 
               Tyrian and more soldiers.

                                     TYRIAN
                         Get him! Stab the horse!

               Galen jerks the animal around and plunges back down the 
               stairs.

               LIBRARY

               Whinnying and blowing the horse bursts in, a wild-eyed Galen 
               still in the saddle. He finds himself confronting the King 
               and his daughter.

               Casiodorus grabs Elspeth and retreats into a corner.

                                     KING
                         Tyrian! Tyrian!

               Tyrian sweeps in with his men. The doors slam shut.

                                     KING
                         So much for your magic! So much for 
                         your sorcery!

               Galen is trapped. Just as Tyrian reaches for the horse's 
               reins, the animal rears up, rolling its eyes. At that moment 
               the floor heaves and cracks in a new series of shocks. The 
               men at arms go down like ten pins. Tyrian reels back, dodging 
               stone blocks loosened from the ceiling. As the shaking 
               continues, a weakened section of wall gives way. Galen sees 
               daylight! Without even waiting for the quake to cease, he 
               prods the horse across the room and through the wall to 
               freedom.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DRAGON COUNTRY - DAY

               The unnerved citizens of Swanscombe gather on the promontory 
               overlooking Galen's landslide. Every few seconds there is a 
               new shudder and more rocks pour down the long slope. Valerian 
               stands trembling with her father. Presently Brother Jacopus 
               elbows his way forward.

                                     BROTHER JACOPUS
                         Listen to me, my brethren. The moment 
                         of our fear is the moment of our 
                         triumph. This is a sign from God. 
                         Follow me, and our faith will send 
                         this creature straight to hell.

               Holding a cross before him, he starts up the slope. No one 
               follows. They haven't been Christians all that long. One or 
               two near Valerian get down on their knees and pray silently. 
               Greil looks things over.

                                     GREIL
                         You call yourselves Christians?

               He strides after the monk. But he's the only one.

               NEAR THE LAIR

               The determined monk has arrived at the epicenter. His sandals 
               are smoking on the hot gravel. Sweat shines on his face and 
               neck.

                                     BROTHER JACOPUS
                         The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not 
                         want. Thou makest me to lie down in 
                         green pastures. Thy rod and staff 
                         they comfort me...

               Greil toils up the slope a hundred yards back. He's crossing 
               himself, but he's carrying a sickle.

               VERMITHRAX

               There is a thunderous noise. Part of the mountain is tossed 
               into the air. Up from the depths comes a huge shining wing. 
               Then a neck uncoils and a head appears. It tips down toward 
               the tiny human.

                                     BROTHER JACOPUS
                              (firm)
                         ...for Thine is the kingdom and the 
                         power and the glory forever -- amen.

               At the base of the slope the villagers scatter. Greil wavers.

                                     BROTHER JACOPUS
                         Unclean beast, get thee down! Be 
                         thou consumed by the fires that made 
                         you!

               The dragon's head sways back and forth, then belches out a 
               waterfall of flame. It engulfs Jacopus and sends him to a 
               better world, if there is one.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               HILL ROAD - NIGHT

               Horse and rider race across a night landscape under brooding 
               clouds. Up ahead, the sky glows with an angry red light. At 
               the crest of a hill Galen reins in and looks down across a 
               long valley. There, miles away, is the village of Swanscombe. 
               Many buildings are ablaze. As he watches in horror, fires 
               spring up in the fields and trees. Intermittently he can see 
               the silhouette of the dragon as it spreads destruction. 
               Finally the creature swoops up and away. Galen stares skyward, 
               losing sight of it in the clouds. For a moment, silence. 
               Then, with a thunderous rush of air that almost blows him 
               from the saddle, the dragon reappears and hurtles a few feet 
               over his head! It is gone in an instant.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               VILLAGE - NIGHT

               Half the buildings in the town are on fire. Desperate 
               villagers dash here and there, herding children and animals 
               to safety, trying to save their household goods. Galen walks 
               woodenly into the confusion, leading his horse, taking in 
               the scope of the disaster. He comes upon a line of men who 
               have formed a bucket brigade. He attempts to join up. As 
               soon as he is recognized, he is shouldered roughly aside.

                                     MAN
                         Get away, you little bastard. We've 
                         had enough help from you.

               Galen staggers back, reaching for his horse. The animal shies 
               and trots off. A middle-aged woman appears in front of him, 
               her face contorted with rage. She swings a flaming broom and 
               catches him on the back of the head. Galen reels away.

                                     WOMAN
                         This is your doing!

               Galen looks up and sees a couple of burlies moving his way 
               with boards in their hands.

                                     BURLIES
                         Get him! He's back!

               Before they can get too close, Galen runs down an alley and 
               bumps smack into a glassy-eyed, haunted man. It is Greil.

                                     GALEN
                         Greil -- help!

                                     GREIL
                         May the Lord forgive you for what 
                         you have done.

               He pushes past. Galen ducks behind a smoldering building.

               VALERIAN'S HOUSE

               The roof has burned off, but at least the walls are standing. 
               Valerian is wrestling charred timbers out of the center of 
               the room. She is covered with soot. There is a hammering on 
               the door and Galen barges in. He slams the door behind him 
               and puts his back against it.

                                     GALEN
                         It's me. Are you hurt?

                                     VALERIAN
                         Where have you been? Doesn't matter -- 
                         listen: Quick! Make it rain. That'll 
                         put the fire out.

                                     GALEN
                         I can't.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Then get the animals back. They're 
                         all running loose. There's people 
                         been hurt. Stop their pain. You can 
                         cure them. And we'll need food...

                                     GALEN
                         I can't do it.

                                     VALERIAN
                              (this stops her)
                         What? Why not?

               Galen's hand moves up to where the amulet used to hang.

                                     GALEN
                         I just can't.

                                     VALERIAN
                         But you're a sorcerer.

                                     GALEN
                         I'm no sorcerer. Whatever power I 
                         might have had, it's gone.

                                     VALERIAN
                         It can't be!

                                     GALEN
                         I know: I'm an imposter. A fraud. A 
                         fake. I'm sorry...

               For a moment, Valerian is too stunned to speak. Then her 
               face colors.

                                     VALERIAN
                         You're sorry?! Listen to that! The 
                         damn thing is loose, we're all on 
                         fire and you're sorry!

               Galen sinks to the floor and sits in the ashes.

                                     VALERIAN
                         You didn't have the faintest idea 
                         what you were doing, did you? You're 
                         a fool -- and I'm a bigger one for 
                         bringing you here.

               She snatches up a pitchfork and glowers at him.

                                     VALERIAN
                         I don't want you in this house. Get 
                         out.

               But Galen still sits there like a puppet with its strings 
               cut, every dream of glory utterly crushed. This piteous sight 
               touches Valerian's heart. Her gaze softens. She slowly lowers 
               the pitchfork.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               FADE IN:

               TOWN SQUARE - DAY

               A knot of villagers lead Tyrian and his henchmen across the 
               square directly to the blacksmith's shop. The King's men 
               dismount and pound on the door. It swings open. Valerian is 
               standing there.

                                     TYRIAN
                         Where is he?

                                     VALERIAN
                         Not here. I can't help you.

               A cry goes up from the villagers. They know damn well he's 
               in there.

               VALERIAN'S HOUSE

               Tyrian pushes Valerian aside and steps into the room. Aided 
               by some townfolk, his men proceed to ransack the premises, 
               overturning barrels, sticking their swords through flour 
               sacks, poking through the tumbledown thatch. Valerian's eye 
               falls on Malkin, who has involved himself in the search.

                                     VALERIAN
                         You too?

                                     MALKIN
                              (returning her look)
                         Damn right.

               Finding nothing, the group pushes into the metal shop, where 
               Simon is hammering an iron wheel rim back into shape on an 
               enormous anvil. He lays down his tools and grimly watches 
               the men go through, overturning benches and tables. Tyrian 
               props a leg up on the anvil and addresses himself to Simon.

                                     TYRIAN
                         As the proud new father of an eligible 
                         daughter who was some-how overlooked 
                         all these years, it may interest you 
                         to know that the King has called for 
                         a new lottery.

                                     SIMON
                         But it's months til the solstice.

                                     TYRIAN
                         In view of what's happened, we all 
                         know what's required.

                                     SIMON
                         I've never taken part in your cursed 
                         lottery, and I'll have nothing to do 
                         with it now.

                                     TYRIAN
                         You were very clever. But she'll 
                         take part, like all the rest. No 
                         exceptions.

               The search party has exhausted the room's hiding places.

                                     HENCHMAN
                         Nothing. If he was here, he's gone 
                         now.

               Tyrian nods and leads the way out. Simon catches up and pulls 
               Tyrian aside at the door.

                                     SIMON
                         All right. I know what you want. How 
                         much?

                                     TYRIAN
                         Are you offering me a bribe?

                                     SIMON
                         Yes.

                                     TYRIAN
                         Don't waste your time.
                              (pause)
                         You could never afford it.

               He spins on his heel and joins his men as they ride out of 
               town. Valerian and Simon watch them go. When the riders are 
               out of sight, they return to the shop. With a couple of stout 
               poles, they strain to lift the anvil off its base. Finally 
               it topples over. Valerian slides the base aside, revealing a 
               trap door. She raises it and a cramped Galen unfolds himself 
               from the space below. On his face is a curious look of 
               determination.

                                     GALEN
                         Smith -- have you ever forged a 
                         weapon?

               WEAPONS

               Simon is going through a cabinet, tossing out hoes, rakes, 
               sickles, scythes, plow blades, and a knife or two. Galen 
               examines them doubtfully. Now Simon produces an armload of 
               swords. Galen is impressed; he looks them over carefully, 
               testing and rejecting them in turn.

                                     GALEN
                         These are your sharpest?

               Simon plucks up one of the swords, carries it to the center 
               of the room. He lays a horseshoe on the anvil. He brings the 
               sword down -- whack! -- and cuts the horseshoe in half.

                                     SIMON
                         Even Tyrian carries one of these.

               Galen hefts it dubiously.

                                     GALEN
                         It's sharp -- but it's not sharp 
                         enough.

               Valerian has been watching all this with growing concern.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Not sharp enough for what?

                                     GALEN
                         For what I'm going to do with it.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Nothing's that sharp.

               Simon gnaws his lip. Reluctantly, he brings a long box from 
               the bottom of the cabinet. He opens it. Lying on a bed of 
               silk is an exquisite two-handed broadsword. The flat blade 
               gleams like a mirror. Galen reaches in and lifts it out.

                                     SIMON
                         The best I ever made.

               Valerian is as awed as Galen.

                                     VALERIAN
                         It's beautiful.

               Galen brings up a finger to test the edge. Simon grabs his 
               hand away.

                                     SIMON
                         Don't do that!
                              (he looks at Valerian)
                         Girl-child, when you were born I 
                         knew I had to do something, so I set 
                         about the task of fashioning an 
                         extraordinary weapon: I had the skill 
                         to make it --
                              (bleak pause)
                         -- but not the nerve to use it.

               She looks at him with affection. Leaning forward, she plants 
               a kiss on his bald pate.

                                     VALERIAN
                         I'm thankful for that.
                              (to Galen)
                         No man should choose a senseless 
                         death.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               STREAM - DAY

               Galen, Valerian and Simon tramp through a glade to a mossy 
               bank. There a wide stream flows lazily under a canopy of 
               trees.

                                     VALERIAN
                         If it's me you're worried about, 
                         don't. So my name has been entered, 
                         what of it? There are hundreds of 
                         girls. My name just won't be drawn. 
                         I know it won't.

               Galen walks out into the shallows and pushes the sword-tip 
               into the sandy bottom, angled so that the edge splits the 
               current.

                                     GALEN
                         Valerian, this isn't just for your 
                         sake.

               He walks back to shore. All three watch the sword to see 
               what will happen.

               SWORD

               Big flat oak leaves are gliding along the current. Very 
               slowly, they go by the sword, some of them very close. 
               Finally, one of them floats against the leading edge of the 
               blade and without a ripple is cleft in two. Simon gives Galen 
               a significant look.

                                     VALERIAN
                         I don't care. It doesn't matter. 
                         What you want to kill isn't flesh 
                         and blood.

                                     SIMON
                         Oh, it'll bleed, all right.

                                     VALERIAN
                         How do you know? No one's so much as 
                         even scratched it.

               They look to Galen. The apprentice's face is full of doubt.

                                     GALEN
                         I'll need the amulet.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               KING'S CASTLE - NIGHT

               Carrying torches to light their way, families -- some with 
               maiden daughters -- gather from all over the country in the 
               courtyard of the King's castle. Simon is there with Valerian, 
               and so is Galen, disguised in rough farm clothes and a wide-
               brimmed hat. Like many others, he carries a stick topped 
               with a bleached skull -- to all appearances, just another 
               participant in this weird pagan ritual. A barrel decorated 
               with flames and dragon's wings sits on a raised dais in front 
               of the main entrance. Horsrik, the King's herald, supervises 
               preparations for the lottery. Armed guards appear carrying a 
               sealed chest. Horsrik breaks the seal and the guards pour 
               the contents -- hundreds of wooden tiles, each bearing the 
               name of a potential sacrifice -- into the barrel. Trumpets 
               blare and drums roll and the royal party strolls onstage: 
               the King, his daughter, courtiers and Tyrian. Valerian nudges 
               Galen.

                                     VALERIAN
                              (pointing)
                         Look at her. The Princess.

                                     GALEN
                         I know. We've met.

               Valerian gives Galen a sharp look. Horsrik unrolls a 
               parchment.

                                     HORSRIK
                              (reading)
                         People of Urland: whereas the peace 
                         of the kingdom has been disrupted by 
                         the mischief of an interloper; and 
                         whereas this interloper being fled; 
                         now therefore, his majesty the King 
                         hereby proclaims the sum of thirty 
                         ducats to be paid to anyone producing 
                         the miscreant Galen Bradwardyn, fraud 
                         enchanter, to our satisfaction.

               Galen pulls his hat low over his eyes. As the moment for the 
               drawing approaches, Valerian becomes more and more uneasy. 
               She pushes forward through the crowd until she's just below 
               the barrel. She eyes the people around her. Some of them 
               seem equally worried, others -- the better dressed and better 
               fed -- are smug and complacent. The King and his retinue are 
               serene. A chant goes up from the crowd:

                                     CROWD
                         Stir the tiles! Stir the tiles!

               Horsrik picks up a wooden staff surmounted by a carved 
               dragon's head and stirs up the names. This done, a new chant 
               goes up:

                                     CROWD
                         Bare the arm! Bare the arm!

               At a signal, a guard comes forward and cuts the sleeve from 
               Horsrik's right arm. He holds it high. The crowd surges 
               forward. The atmosphere is full of dread and excitement. 
               Valerian looking pale and determined, is jostled and pushed 
               to the edge of the platform.

                                     CROWD
                         Draw the name! Draw the name!

               The moment has come. Down goes Horsrik's arm and up it comes, 
               holding one little wooden square, one young woman's fate. An 
               expectant hush falls over the mob. The virgins of Urland 
               tremble and wait.

                                     HORSRIK
                         Now, my countrymen, hear me: behold, 
                         for I am chosen. I shall die that 
                         many may live. I shall lay down my 
                         life for family and fellows. I shall 
                         go to my grave for the love of our 
                         King and his wise policy. And my 
                         name is --

               He looks down at the tile to read the name, but no sound 
               comes to his lips. He looks back at the crowd, a cold sweat 
               breaking over his face. He swallows, but still can't bring 
               himself to speak. At his feet, Valerian is holding her breath. 
               A new chant goes up.

                                     CROWD
                         The name! The name!

               By now Horsrik is trembling. He stares down at the tile, his 
               mouth set in a grim line. The King is getting annoyed. He 
               gestures and the crowd falls silent.

                                     KING
                         Read the name.

                                     HORSRIK
                              (mastering himself)
                         The name is: Princess Elspeth Ulfilas, 
                         filia regis.

               There is a moment of profound shock. Then a low murmur of 
               wonder moves through the crowd. Galen looks at Valerian; she 
               sags with relief. The King turns to his daughter. She shows 
               nothing. He rises from his chair, comes forward and snatches 
               the tile from Horsrik.

                                     KING
                         That's not the name. It's been 
                         misread.

               Valerian will not stand for such hypocrisy.

                                     VALERIAN
                         There's no mistake! The name's been 
                         chosen -- let it stand!

                                     KING
                         No, the good Horsrik has misspoke 
                         himself.
                              (he looks at the tile)
                         In fairness to this individual, whose 
                         name I can't make out, we'll destroy 
                         this tile.

               He quickly tosses the wood chip into a brazier at his elbow. 
               Led by Valerian, the crowd cries out in protest.

                                     VALERIAN
                         No! What better name than your own 
                         kin? At last we see justice done!

                                     KING
                         Silence! We will have a new choosing. 
                         I will draw the name myself.

               He reaches into the barrel and extracts another tile. He 
               looks at it and his eyes widen. Betrayed, he swivels to face 
               his daughter. The din of the crowd reaches a crescendo.

                                     CROWD
                         Let it stand! Let it stand!

               Elspeth takes the tile from her father's nerveless fingers, 
               looks at it with satisfaction and holds it aloft.

                                     ELSPETH
                         The name is as you heard it and as 
                         Horsrik read it: Elspeth.

               The King moils through the tiles, finding his daughter's 
               name again and again.

                                     KING
                         The lottery is invalid. Another and 
                         another. What treachery is this?

               Valerian, chanting with the rest, falls silent. She looks at 
               Elspeth with sudden interest and respect, then awe.

                                     ELSPETH
                         Hear me, good people! It is true, 
                         that my name appears on many of the 
                         lots. This does not falsify the 
                         drawing, it certifies it! I have 
                         learned that my name has been kept 
                         from jeopardy in all the drawings in 
                         the past. So I have put my name among 
                         the rest many times -- once for each 
                         risk that, over the years, you took 
                         and I did not.

               The crowd is dumbfounded. Gradually voices erupt in a 
               cacophony of shouts, whistles and excited conversation. Galen 
               sees his chance: there's an unguarded door near the stable. 
               He drifts toward it and slips inside.

               THRONE ROOM

               Galen pokes his head in: the room is empty. He scurries over 
               to a chest, flings it open and starts rummaging. Finding 
               nothing he moves on to a cabinet. He breaks the lock and 
               pries it open. Again, nothing.

               CASTLE CORRIDOR

               Galen can hear the voices in the courtyard as he rushes down 
               a hall. Suddenly he stops short. There in front of him is a 
               guard leaning out a window to watch the proceedings. Galen 
               hovers on the verge of panic as the guard abruptly moves. 
               But the man is only headed for another window and a better 
               view. Galen manages to fall into step an arm's length behind 
               him and slip by without a sound.

               LIBRARY

               Galen enters the library, his enormous shadow dancing crazily 
               on the torchlit walls. Hurrying through, his attention is 
               drawn to some open books on a table. Closer inspection reveals 
               magical writings and symbols. Galen paws over everything, 
               suddenly aware that he must be close to the amulet. But where 
               is it?

               COURTYARD

               As the crowd disperses Valerian watches Elspeth walk back in 
               the castle, lofty and composed. She looks for Galen and 
               discovers he has gone.

               LIBRARY

               By now, the room is in total disarray. Galen has opened all 
               the chests and trunks and knocked half the books from the 
               shelves. No amulet. He's feverishly working on a locked drawer 
               when a voice interrupts him.

                                     KING
                         Don't go to all that trouble.

               Galen whirls around to find the King standing in the doorway. 
               The monarch looks shattered. Galen edges toward the split in 
               the wall and finds that it has been shored up with timbers. 
               At that moment Tyrian comes through the door, sizes up the 
               situation and draws his sword.

                                     GALEN
                         I'm unarmed. If you want a fight, at 
                         least give me a weapon.

                                     TYRIAN
                              (pushing by the King)
                         I think not!

                                     KING
                         Stop! Don't harm him.
                              (to Galen)
                         And you -- don't run away... please...

               The King's voice is cracking. Galen and Tyrian are equally 
               taken aback. The King searches through the books remaining 
               on the library shelves.

                                     KING
                              (shaky)
                         I've always had the greatest 
                         admiration for the black arts. You 
                         chaps with your mysterious spells... 
                         I didn't think it would be necessary, 
                         you see. Vermithrax is an old dragon. 
                         And that, I thought, was the beauty 
                         of my plan -- buying time. We'd wait 
                         her out. I'd live to see the end of 
                         her.
                              (firm)
                         That's still going to happen.

               The King finds the book and takes the amulet out. With 
               trembling hands, he passes it to Galen.

                                     TYRIAN
                         Sire!

                                     KING
                         He shall have it.
                              (pleading)
                         It's my daughter. Save her, I beg 
                         you.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               VILLAGE - DAY

               The people of Swanscombe are clearing up the rubble and 
               beginning repairs on their dwellings. Standing in their midst, 
               lecturing every passerby, is Greil. He holds up the charred 
               remains of Brother Jacopus' wooden cross.

                                     GREIL
                         Holy of holies -- he did not die in 
                         vain. Can you hear me, brothers?

               Some workmen go by lugging new thatch. Malkin is with them.

                                     MALKIN
                              (gently)
                         We hear you, Greil.

                                     GREIL
                         Well and good, but I'm Greil no 
                         longer. Call me Gregorius, after the 
                         Bishop of Rome.

               Malkin and the others stop to listen.

                                     GREIL
                         I saw him die. Like Our Lord Jesus 
                         on the cross he was, scourged by 
                         evil. But he showed no fear. Such is 
                         the power of the Holy Ghost.

               BLACKSMITH SHOP

               Galen lurks in the shadows of Simon's metal shop looking out 
               on the square where Greil is holding forth.

                                     GREIL
                         Of what avail is magic? The old gods 
                         died with our daughters. From whence 
                         comest my help? My help comest from 
                         the Lord!

               Galen quietly shuts and bars the door. He moves deeper into 
               the gloomy workroom where Simon is pumping a bellows to heat 
               up the forge. Galen looks at the coals.

                                     SIMON
                         Good and hot.

                                     GALEN
                         Don't bother. That's not the kind of 
                         fire we need.

               Valerian is staring at the sword, sitting on the anvil in 
               its silk wrapping. Galen uncovers it, holds it high, and 
               puts his hand on the amulet.

                                     GALEN
                         Nunc, per Potestatem Hermeticum -- 
                         ex flammis, ferrum sangrinarium!

               The sword starts to hum and to heat up. From the hilt outward 
               the blade glows brighter and brighter: red, orange, white. 
               It lights up the room, throwing long shadows into the corners. 
               Galen lays the white hot steel on the anvil. Simon takes up 
               his hammer and begins the reforging. Valerian sees their 
               resolve. After watching for several moments she slips out 
               the side door, looking sad.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DRAGON COUNTRY - DAY

               Clouds scud low over the lifeless region. The dragon's lair 
               now has a newer, bigger entrance. Vapors drift upward from 
               it. Down the slope a lonely figure works its way from rock 
               to rock: it's Valerian with a wicker basket on her arm, 
               searching for dragon scales. The basket is already more than 
               half full when she finds herself ominously near the mouth of 
               the cavern. She's about to turn back when she spies a 
               particularly large and beautiful scale just a few yards 
               further on. As she reaches for it, there is a sudden hiss! 
               She jerks her hand back and freezes. There in the shadows is 
               a baby dragon, a basilisk, all coppery bronze with stubby 
               winglets. As she backs away, she sees two more come up to 
               join the first. They watch her retreat through wicked little 
               green eyes.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               STREAM - DAY

               On the mossy bank Galen and Simon unwrap the reforged sword. 
               Now the blade carries a faint blue halation. Galen walks to 
               the middle of the current and once again stabs the tip down 
               into the sand. Then he rejoins Simon onshore to await results. 
               This time, as the oak leaves approach the sharp edge, they 
               gently but definitely veer sideways to avoid contact. Such 
               is the power of the sword that even after many leaves, not a 
               single one has come close enough to be sliced. Simon is agog 
               and even Galen seems satisfied. They clasp hands.

                                     SIMON
                         An edge like no other on this earth.

                                     GALEN
                         Well done, Simon. Thank you.

               Simon hands him a bundle of fighting equipment.

                                     SIMON
                              (grave)
                         I'll say goodbye to Valerian for 
                         you. I'm sorry she's not here, but 
                         you know how she is.

                                     GALEN
                         I understand.

               They look at each other for what could be the last time.

                                     SIMON
                         Fare thee well.

               The old man departs. Galen unfolds the bundle and brings out 
               its contents: mail hauberk with coif, studded leather gloves, 
               padded jerkin, a scabbard and a small wooden shield. He lays 
               them out on the stream bank, then strips off his tunic and 
               kneels down to splash some water in his face. As the cups 
               the water between his hands, an image comes alive and shimmers 
               on the surface: Valerian, stripping off her own clothes, 
               shyly turning toward him, solemn and romantic.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Galen.

               It's as if the vision is speaking to him, but it's not. He 
               spins around and sees her standing there, fully clothed, and 
               possessed of a brisk and businesslike air.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Here.

               She throws down a shield. It's remarkable in its construction -- 
               overlapping layers of iridescent dragon scales have been 
               ingeniously fastened to a leather-clad frame.

                                     VALERIAN
                         It's a shield. I made it. Might keep 
                         the fire off you. Might not. You 
                         know, you're an idiot. You're going 
                         to die tonight. You'll be ripped 
                         limb from limb. This is the last 
                         time I'll ever speak to you.

               Galen turns the shield over and over, marveling at it. He 
               fixes her with a piercing look.

                                     GALEN
                         Thank you.

                                     VALERIAN
                              (rushing)
                         Another thing. That thing isn't alone 
                         up there. There's little ones. Young, 
                         I think. I don't know how many.

               She shudders. Galen's eyes are still fastened on her. She's 
               fighting to retain her hard manner, but the agitation and 
               dread are plain.

                                     GALEN
                         Hatchlings. They'll have to be killed 
                         too. Anything else?

               Valerian wants to be bold, but on this final point, can't 
               muster the courage.

                                     VALERIAN
                              (tiny voice)
                         You're in love, aren't you?

                                     GALEN
                              (slowly nodding)
                         Yes.

                                     VALERIAN
                         That's all right. I understand. She's 
                         very beautiful, very brave.

                                     GALEN
                         Who is? What do you mean?

                                     VALERIAN
                         Your Princess. But I don't care. It 
                         doesn't change the way I feel.
                              (firm)
                         Listen to me, Galen Bradwardyn, 
                         sorcerer's apprentice; you're going 
                         to be dead, the dragon will be worse 
                         than ever, there will be more 
                         lotteries, and I'm not a boy any 
                         more.

                                     GALEN
                         And you'll be eligible because --

                                     VALERIAN
                         Because I'm still a virgin, and I 
                         want you to do something about it.

               Galen takes her in his arms; she is trembling. He tilts her 
               face up toward his and kisses her.

                                     GALEN
                         I am in love. But not with the 
                         Princess.

               Their image is reflected in the waters. Through the ripples 
               she is visible pulling briefly away to remove her clothes.

               From afar, they are two tiny figures under the overarching 
               oaks and willows. They embrace and sink down into the deep 
               grass beside the water. The leaves continue their unhurried 
               course downstream.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DRAGON COUNTRY - NIGHT

               A cold wind whistles through the rocks near the dragon's 
               lair. By the light of a flickering torch two workmen finish 
               driving a heavy post into the ground. As they affix a pair 
               of iron manacles they see the torches of a procession coming 
               up the slope. They hurry down to meet it. Horsrik is in the 
               lead, followed by soldiers and royal attendants. Elspeth 
               rides in the tumbril behind a blindfolded horse. Bringing up 
               the rear is Tyrian. At last the cart can go no further. 
               Elspeth alights and leads the rest of the troop to the post. 
               As the soldiers put the irons around her wrists, Horsrik 
               unrolls a parchment, turns his back on the wind and begins 
               to read:

                                     HORSRIK
                         Now be it known throughout the 
                         kingdom, that the Princess, having 
                         been chosen by a deed of fortune and 
                         destiny --

               Horsrik blinks. There's a black stain growing in the middle 
               of the parchment; all at once it bursts into flames. He cries 
               out and flings the document away. There follows a flash of 
               light and a puff of smoke and Galen is standing there, as if 
               he had materialized out of thin air. Horsrik and his startled 
               men backpedal down the slope.

                                     HORSRIK
                         No fire, I beg you.

               Galen raises his hands in a menacing gesture.

                                     GALEN
                         Be gone!

               That's enough for Horsrik and company: he and the soldiers 
               depart.

                                     HORSRIK
                              (over his shoulder)
                         I declare these proceedings duly 
                         ordained...

               Only one man remains behind the challenge the young sorcerer: 
               Tyrian. He draws his sword.

                                     TYRIAN
                         I knew I'd find you here. Well, I'm 
                         not as sentimental as some. The 
                         kingdom, every one of us, need this 
                         sacrifice. If you intend to interfere, 
                         you'll have to kill me.

                                     GALEN
                         I've got plenty of reasons to kill 
                         you that have nothing to do with 
                         this sacrifice.

               Galen draws his own sword. As it emerges into the night air 
               it seems imbued with a blue phosphorescence.

                                     TYRIAN
                         Most impressive. Can you use it?

               Elspeth twists around in her chains.

                                     ELSPETH
                         Let it be! Please! Tyrian is right -- 
                         it's our only hope!

               Galen starts to reply, but as soon as his attention wavers, 
               Tyrian is lunging toward him, sword point directed at his 
               neck. Galen barely manages to parry the thrust before Tyrian 
               is at him again, blade swinging toward his knees. Galen drops 
               the tip of his sword to catch the blow. When the two steel 
               edges connect, sparks fly. In a series of thrusts and counter-
               thrusts, each accompanied by a shower of sparks, Tyrian backs 
               Galen up the mountain.

                                     ELSPETH
                         Tyrian -- both of you -- run! Flee! 
                         It's coming!

               Sure enough, at that moment the earth gives out a low moan 
               and undulates in a sickening movement. Vapors begin rising 
               from the lair.

                                     TYRIAN
                         In a trice! This is no swords-man.

               He might be right, for Galen turns and bolts across the slope. 
               When he reaches the post with Tyrian two steps behind, he 
               whirls and brings his blade down on Princess Elspeth's chains. 
               The chains part in an explosion of sparks.

                                     GALEN
                         Run! Get out of here!

               The Princess darts from the piling as Tyrian swoops down to 
               continue the attack. Galen dodges and the stake catches 
               Tyrian's blow. The earth shakes again. Galen glances at the 
               Princess.

                                     GALEN
                         No! Stop! What are you doing?

               Elspeth is not running away down the mountain. Instead she 
               is walking, slowly and deliberately, right into the smoking 
               cave. Swoosh! Tyrian's sword comes down again. The dismayed 
               sorcerer ducks back and Tyrian's blade again bites deep into 
               the wood.

                                     TYRIAN
                         You've failed, my friend, and I thank 
                         the gods for it. Come out from behind 
                         that post.

               It's now or never. Elspeth is no longer in sight. Galen grits 
               his teeth, grasps the sword with two hands and swings it as 
               hard as he can in a wide arc. The blade never even slows 
               down as it sails right through the post, lopping it clean 
               off. The glowing sword flashes above Galen's head and eagerly 
               buries itself in Tyrian's chest. The King's man is as startled 
               by the amputated piling as he is by his own death. His eyes 
               roll up in his head, his knees buckle and he topples backward -- 
               the blade sliding free.

               DRAGON'S LAIR

               Smoke swirls at the mouth of the cave as Galen enters, holding 
               his sword before him, lighting his way with its faint blue 
               glow.

                                     GALEN
                         Elspeth!

               The floor of the cave as it winds down into the mountain is 
               paved first with rock, then with dragon scales, then with 
               bones. With each footfall, clusters of mysterious insects 
               scuttle away. Galen pauses to mop his brow; it's getting 
               hot. A sound echoes up from the depths, a grinding sound 
               like the gnashing of teeth, followed by hissing and squealing. 
               Galen grips his sword tighter and pushes on. Suddenly he 
               stoops and picks up an embroidered slipper: Elspeth's. The 
               grinding sounds are louder. He hurries forward and rounds a 
               corner. He stops and gags.

               BASILISKS

               Two disgusting little reptiles -- like scaly raccoons -- are 
               perched on the corpse of Princess Elspeth Ulfilas, feeding 
               contentiously on choice bits of the royal flesh. Galen groans: 
               he lashes out and his sword beheads one of the tiny monsters.

               The other one buzzes its half-formed winglets and hisses a 
               hot stream of air. Galen brings down the sword and slices it 
               in half. Eyes riveted on Elspeth's remains, he edges around 
               the carnage and backs away. Hissss! -- there's a third one, 
               lurking in the shadows, munching on something; it might be a 
               hand. Galen shrieks and jumps away. The little creature comes 
               at him and clamps its jaws on his leg. Galen stabs at it 
               repeatedly. Finally it lets go, and flails and flops across 
               the bloody floor, ululating its death agony. As the creature's 
               last mewlings echo down through the cavern, the ground 
               quivers. Bits of stone fall from the ceiling.

               LAKE OF FIRE

               Galen works his way down a narrow passage whose walls are 
               alive with insects and beads of sulphurous water. As before, 
               he holds the sword in front of him; he marvels at its 
               increasing brightness. The heat is increasing too; sweat 
               mats his hair and runs down his face. A few yards further on 
               the sword starts pulsating. Now the walls take on a flickering 
               rosy sheen and the passage widens into an underground vista 
               of staggering immensity: an underground lake, its surface 
               bubbling and torn with sheets of flame. Arching over it is a 
               vault of stone, penetrated here and there by natural chimneys. 
               The dimensions of this internal world are unknown -- the 
               fiery lake disappears into half a dozen side chambers. The 
               one clear path is accessible only by a series of flat stones 
               leading across the hot liquid. Galen grips his sword and 
               resolutely hops from rock to rock.

               VERMITHRAX

               He's halfway across when the earth rumbles and the stepping 
               stones teeter beneath his feet. A fiery wave washes over his 
               legs, leaving his boots smoking. Another tremor knocks Galen 
               to his knees. As he scrabbles to pick up his sword and shield, 
               the great head of Vermithrax rises up out of the depths on 
               its long neck. It gazes at him through huge pale eyes under 
               armored lids. A tongue flicks out and runs around its lipless 
               mouth. The head sways from side to side. The mouth hinges 
               open, the nostril-like igniters come on and touch off the 
               jet of gas squeezed up out of its innards. A roaring tube of 
               flame engulfs Galen. He crouches behind his dragon scale 
               shield which deflects the fire just enough to save his life. 
               The dragon pauses to take a breath. Galen springs to his 
               feet, and bounds back the way he came, his skin and clothing 
               singed. Flames lick at his back as the dragon lets fly with 
               a second burst.

               TUNNEL

               Coughing and weeping, Galen staggers up through the tunnel, 
               nearly tripping over the body of one of the baby dragons. A 
               few seconds later, Vermithrax follows, squirming and clawing 
               its way upward. When it reaches its dead offspring it surveys 
               the scene with expressionless eyes. Bringing its head low, 
               it sniffs and nudges at the lifeless little ones.

               AMBUSH

               At that moment Galen leaps out from behind a niche in the 
               tunnel wall and lunges forward. Striking sparks, the point 
               of his sword slides across the dragon's plated cheek and 
               stabs deep between the scales of its heavy neck. There is an 
               unearthly shriek and the creature flicks its head back and 
               upward. Galen goes sprawling and finds himself holding half 
               a sword. The rest is buried in the beast's neck, and 
               Vermithrax doesn't like it. It flings its head this way and 
               that, knocking rocks loose from the ceiling. Its movements 
               cause the ground to quake. As boulders tumble around him, 
               Galen drops to the floor under his shield. Dragon flame 
               reaches through the cascading debris and washes over him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DAWN

               Valerian roams the rock-strewn slope not far from the dragon's 
               lair. Presently she comes upon a once-familiar object -- the 
               fire shield. Half the scales are gone, the rest are charred 
               and curling. Grimly, she moves on. A few paces away she picks 
               up the blunted sword. She scans the rocks and finally sees 
               what she's looking for.

               GALEN

               He's lying face down behind a boulder, his clothes charred, 
               patches of skin scorched. He looks dead. Valerian rolls him 
               onto his back. She gasps: the eyes are open, regarding her.

                                     GALEN
                         Still alive.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BLACKSMITH SHOP - DAY

               Simon is standing by the anvil with the broken sword in his 
               hand, lost in thought.

               HOUSE

               In the adjoining house Valerian tends Galen's wounds. He's 
               propped up on a palette enduring the application of poultices.

                                     VALERIAN
                         You know what we have to do.
                              (he looks at her with 
                              dull eyes)
                         We have to leave Urland.

               He winces in pain.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Not because of what happened. I 
                         brought you here -- it didn't work -- 
                         now I'm taking you away. Do you 
                         understand?
                              (Galen does not react)
                         You said you loved me. Is it true? 
                         If it is, it's the only good we've 
                         done. Let's not lose that too.
                              (pause)
                         Galen?

               He seems miles away. She turns aside, on the verge of tears. 
               Simon is standing there, still holding the sword hilt.

                                     SIMON
                         She's right. What kind of a life 
                         could you have here? It's too late 
                         for me, but you're young enough.
                              (he shows them the 
                              sword)
                         You know what I think? Magic is dying 
                         out, fading from the world. But that 
                         makes me happy. That means the dragon 
                         will be dying too.

               Galen looks at him; he has heard everything. He sits up and 
               fondly regards Valerian.

               PACKING

               Valerian packs her belongings into a rucksack. The last item 
               in is her blue frock, carefully rolled. Beside her, Galen 
               dons clean traveling clothes. He stiffly crosses the room 
               and drags his pack out of the corner. He sorts through the 
               effects, and amidst the clothing and supplies discovers the 
               leather pouch containing Ulrich's remains. He contemplates 
               it.

                                     VALERIAN
                         What's that?

                                     GALEN
                         Nothing. I was just thinking -- poor 
                         Hodge.

               He tucks the pouch away, throws some clothes on top and ties 
               the satchel shut.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               STREAM - DAY

               Beside the quiet stream Simon bids farewell to the young 
               couple, embracing each in turn. They slosh across the shallow 
               water and follow a path into the woods.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               VILLAGE SQUARE - DAY

               Greil is standing outside the half-burned grange hall, 
               summoning the Christian faithful. He proclaims the call to 
               worship by hammering on a small bell. One by one the townsfolk 
               arrive. Among them is Simon, looking bereft.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               FOREST PATH - DAY

               Valerian and Galen trudge along side by side.

                                     VALERIAN
                         How's your leg?

                                     GALEN
                         Hurts. That thing was small, but its 
                         teeth were sharp.

                                     VALERIAN
                         At least you killed it. You got all 
                         the young.

               This is small consolation, and Galen sighs.

                                     GALEN
                         But the big one's alive. Somewhere 
                         down in that burning lake.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Don't think about it. You had your 
                         fight, and you're still here. That's 
                         more than anyone else can say. Let's 
                         think about what lies ahead.

               She reaches out to take his hand. But Galen is no longer at 
               her side. She stops and looks back.

               GALEN

               Galen has come to a halt in the middle of the path. He's 
               staring into the middle distance with a sudden inspiration 
               bubbling in his brain. He flings off his sack, drops to his 
               knees and tears through the contents. Valerian comes back, 
               baffled. Galen's gear is strewn all over the trail.

                                     VALERIAN
                         What are you doing?

               Galen comes up with what he's looking for -- the leather 
               sack. When he replies, it is not to her, but to Ulrich:

                                     GALEN
                         You old trickster! The burning water! 
                         The lake of fire!

                                     VALERIAN
                         Galen, what are you saying?

               He regards her with astonishment.

                                     GALEN
                         He had it planned. He knew this was 
                         going to happen.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Who did? What happened?

                                     GALEN
                         We've got to go back, I want to talk 
                         to him!

               He heads back down the trail, leaving his belongings on the 
               road.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Where are you going?

               She hurries after him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               GRANGE HALL - DAY

               Greil, a.k.a. Gregorious, stands in the center of the burned-
               out granary, delivering a sermon. Behind him, men are filling 
               the baptismal cistern.

                                     GREIL
                         The Church is mother to us all. Not 
                         just one lonely orphan who has lost 
                         his way, not just a few, but all of 
                         us that believeth in Him. When enough 
                         voices come together in prayer, He 
                         shall hear, we shall live and the 
                         beast shall die.

               In the gathering Simon ponders the hilt of his once fabulous 
               sword. With its blade shortened, it looks a lot like a 
               crucifix.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DRAGON COUNTRY - DAY

               Galen bounds up the rocky slope as fast as he can manage, 
               trailed by a desperate Valerian.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Galen, stop! Please, I beg you!

               But Galen pays no attention. In a burst of speed and fury, 
               Valerian comes up behind and tackles him.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Stop! I won't let you kill yourself.

               Galen waves the leather pouch in Valerian's face.

                                     GALEN
                         He couldn't walk -- he knew he 
                         couldn't make the journey. So he had 
                         us make the journey for him! Don't 
                         you see?

               He jumps up and runs to the mouth of the lair.

                                     VALERIAN
                              (pursuing)
                         No!

               She tackles him again.

                                     VALERIAN
                         All right, all right. You're going 
                         in there, I'm going too.

                                     GALEN
                              (brought up short)
                         What? Why? No you're not, this is my 
                         job. Absolutely not.

               But Valerian springs to her feet and starts into the lair.

                                     VALERIAN
                         I'm not afraid. And you're not going 
                         to stop me. After all -- I've been a 
                         man longer than you have.

               Galen pauses long enough to snatch up a discarded torch near 
               the remains of the wooden stake, then charges after her.

               UNDERGROUND

               Running footsteps resound in the steamy passageway and Galen 
               comes around the corner holding his torch high to light the 
               way. Valerian stumbles after him. He grabs her hand.

                                     GALEN
                         Stay close.

               Down and down they go. Soon they reach Elspeth's body.

                                     VALERIAN
                         What's that?

                                     GALEN
                         Never mind. Come on.

               But she pulls the torch from his hand and goes over to see.

                                     GALEN
                         All right. Wait here.

               He darts off. In the flickering torchlight Valerian can see 
               the Princess' remains all too clearly. She suppresses a 
               scream.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Galen? Galen? Where are you?

               No answer. The torch reveals several passages. She doesn't 
               know which one to take.

               LAKE OF FIRE

               The passage widens out and once again Galen is standing on 
               the shores of the lake of fire. He looks around. The water 
               is rolling with bubbles of gas, and flames run hither and 
               yon across the surface, but there is no sign of the dragon. 
               Gathering his courage, he hops across the stepping stones to 
               the middle of the lake. There he hurriedly opens the pouch.

                                     GALEN
                         Ex favilla, vita nova!

               Gripping the amulet with his free hand, he scatters Ulrich's 
               ashes in a wide arc over the burning water. Instantly, there 
               is an ominous rumble and the earth gives a shrug. But no 
               wizard appears. No dragon, either. There follows another and 
               stronger quake. Galen crouches to keep his balance. Still no 
               wizard.

               OUTSIDE

               Thoroughly bewildered, Valerian stumbles out into daylight. 
               She wanders a few yards down the slope and collapses against 
               the stake. Something is strange: it's getting dark. Squinting 
               up at the sun, she frowns in puzzlement, then gapes at what 
               is happening.

               ECLIPSE

               Slowly and ponderously the black disk of the moon slides 
               over the face of the sun, plunging the world into crepuscular 
               half-light.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               GRANGE HALL - DAY

               The congregation is confused and frightened by the sudden 
               darkness.

                                     GREIL
                         Be calm. He watcheth over us! And 
                         this is His sign! Let us pray! Our 
                         Father who art in heaven...

               The faithful bow their heads and join in. Simon as well.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               LAKE OF FIRE

               The earthquakes have subsided; the water is calm. Galen stares 
               bleakly into the flames. As he watches, they gather themselves 
               into a lazy spiral. Gradually the spiral speeds up and becomes 
               a vortex. Now the flames become tinged with green, and as 
               the cavern moans with the sound of rushing air, a form takes 
               shape at the crest of a jet of flame. It is Ulrich, supine 
               as upon his pyre, reforming before Galen's eyes.

                                     GALEN
                         Ulrich! Magister! Over here! I can 
                         see you! Over here!

                                     ULRICH
                              (looks at him)
                         Not so loud. I'm not deaf, you know.

               He slowly raises himself into an upright posture and strides 
               through the flames.

                                     ULRICH
                         Sic redit magus ex terra mortis.

               The apprentice throws himself at his master's feet.

                                     GALEN
                         Wonder of wonders -- you're back! I 
                         thank the powers that made me!

                                     ULRICH
                         Glad to see you, too. You didn't 
                         bring along anything to eat, by any 
                         chance?

                                     GALEN
                         Food?

                                     ULRICH
                         No? Oh well, no time anyway.

               OUTSIDE

               Valerian is standing in the unearthly twilight, anxiously 
               peering into the mouth of the lair. Suddenly she is hit from 
               behind by a gust of wind. She does not turn to see the 
               enormous Vermithrax alighting silently behind her.

               GALEN & ULRICH

               Ulrich raises Galen to his feet.

                                     ULRICH
                         Come along. There's much to be done.

                                     GALEN
                         Wait, I have something to tell you.

                                     ULRICH
                         It can wait.

                                     GALEN
                         No it can't. Listen: I thought I was 
                         a sorcerer -- but I wasn't. I thought 
                         I had power -- but I didn't. I thought 
                         I was you -- but I'm not.

               He hangs his head. Ulrich regards him steadily.

                                     ULRICH
                         Well said. Now hurry.

               He leads the way across the rocks to the shore and into the 
               tunnel.

               VALERIAN

               Time seems to have come to a stop. Overhead, the moon is 
               locked in front of the sun. At the lair, Valerian stands 
               frozen as the dragon leans over her. The great head sways 
               from side to side. The jaws hinge open. Suddenly, Valerian 
               recovers herself and makes a run for it, leaping and 
               scrabbling over the rocks. A plume of flame licks at her 
               heels. She sees a protective crevice and heads for it, but a 
               winged claw drops to block her way. She changes direction 
               and is cut off again. Cat and mouse.

               VERMITHRAX

               The pale yellow eyes stare implacably down at the hopeless 
               victim. The igniter jets come on, then off, as the beast 
               suddenly stiffens. The head rotates, almost as if catching a 
               new scent. Finally the eyes focus on the entrance to the 
               cavern.

               ULRICH

               There is the sorcerer, leaning on Galen, coolly regarding 
               the creature. The old man's expression hardens.

                                     ULRICH
                         Draco draconis...

               The dragon lifts its wings as if to menace them, then flaps 
               twice and is airborne. The thing shoots overhead and, with a 
               rush of wind, flies off into the gloom.

               IN THE ROCKS

               Valerian struggles out of her hiding place.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Galen!

               Galen runs to her. They embrace. When they look up, Ulrich 
               is at their side.

                                     ULRICH
                         Where's my amulet? Give it to me, 
                         please.

               Galen's hand locates the jewel under his shirt. He finds 
               himself reluctant to part with it.

               With a hurricane howl, a column of flame touches down nearby 
               and rushes toward them. They stagger back as the dragon sweeps 
               past.

                                     ULRICH
                         Be quick!

               Galen hands his treasure over. Ulrich closes his hand around 
               it.

                                     ULRICH
                         Come close to me.

               Galen and Valerian approach. The old man's hand is suffused 
               with an internal glow. Behind them, the dragon is turning 
               for another pass.

               VORTEX

               All at once the glow brightens, and in another instant the 
               world spins off into a blur, setting all three afloat in a 
               timeless netherworld. Valerian and Galen cling to each other 
               in terror.

                                     ULRICH
                         Don't be afraid. You have served me 
                         with great courage. Now you must 
                         show me you have even more.

                                     GALEN
                         Anything!

               The voices seem to be coming from a huge distance. Starlike 
               gleams whiz by, and fleeting glimpses of half-recognizable 
               faces and forms. The wizard's eyes are like glittering 
               crystals. Tiny motes and planetoids dance in the hairs of 
               his beard. He seems wreathed in luminescence.

                                     ULRICH
                         You must destroy the amulet, and me 
                         along with it.

                                     GALEN
                         No!

                                     ULRICH
                         You brought me from the flames, you 
                         must send me back.

                                     GALEN
                         I can't.

                                     ULRICH
                         When the time comes, you'll 
                         understand. Here.

               He dangles the amulet in front of Galen. Even more reluctantly 
               than he let it go, he takes it back.

               MOUNTAIN TOP

               Abruptly, the vortex is gone and they find themselves atop a 
               rocky crag overlooking the eclipse-darkened fields and farms 
               of Urland. Galen glances at his surroundings and stares at 
               the amulet, full of awe.

                                     ULRICH
                         I know what you're thinking. You 
                         have learned much and done well. 
                         Don't worry, you won't need it any 
                         more.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               GRANGE HALL - DAY

               Greil is urging Simon, the last of the converts, into the 
               cistern.

                                     GREIL
                         Make haste, brother.

               He dips Simon's head under water.

                                     GREIL
                         Now be thou baptized in the name of 
                         the Father, Son and Holy Ghost. May 
                         the Lord our God light our way.

               In the background, half the congregation is staring through 
               the burned-out walls, fervently praying and crossing 
               themselves, wondering if they'll ever see the sun again. A 
               cry goes up: a shape crosses the solar corona, wheels over 
               the village and streaks away toward the mountains -- the 
               dragon.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               MOUNTAIN TOP

               Galen and Valerian peer out from behind a boulder and watch 
               Ulrich hobble perilously close to the edge of the cliff. The 
               old man spreads wide his arms and tilts his head back.

                                     ULRICH
                         Nimbus! Tempestas! Fulmen!

               From over the horizon roiling inky-black clouds churn down 
               upon them. Thunder booms and echoes. A bitter wind whips 
               their clothing. As the storm gathers fury, the dragon 
               reappears, circling in the distance. Finally it homes in on 
               the mountain crag and dives at Ulrich. The conjurer makes a 
               gesture and strokes of lightning explode against the beast's 
               scaly flanks. It emits a high thin scream and rockets past.

               GALEN & VALERIAN

               Valerian crawls away and comes back with a hefty chunk of 
               granite.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Here. Do as he said. Smash it.

                                     GALEN
                         Not if it means killing him.

               ULRICH

               He resolutely waits as the dragon banks against the clouds 
               and starts another pass. Again, the sorcerer summons lightning 
               bolts. But the dragon keeps coming; this time a talon splits 
               the old man's cape.

               GALEN & VALERIAN

               Valerian wrestles the amulet away from Galen. It falls to 
               the ground.

                                     VALERIAN
                         You heard what he said.

               She lifts the chunk of stone. Galen grabs for it.

                                     GALEN
                         No! You can't!

               THE LAST ATTACK

               Vermithrax spirals up into the storm, then drops earthward. 
               Ulrich watches as the beast comes straight at him. He folds 
               his arms and bows his head. Leathery wings humming, the 
               creature levels out, swoops up past the crag and lifts the 
               master magician away in its huge hind claw.

                                     ULRICH
                         Galen!

               Galen and Valerian are horrified to see the dragon circling 
               upward with the sorcerer writhing in agony in its grip. As 
               the monstrous thing flies high over them, they can hear 
               Ulrich's faint screams.

               DEATH

               Now Galen understands. He seizes the granite block from 
               Valerian and raises it with both hands over his head. He 
               takes a final look at the amulet, glowing at his feet, then 
               brings the rock down with all his might. There is a blinding 
               flash as it shatters into a million fragments.

               Far above there is another blinding flash as Ulrich's earthly 
               body explodes against the belly of the beast. The darkened 
               sky lights up as huge gouts of flame spew forth from the 
               dragon's gut. Wings fluttering uselessly, this reptilian 
               torch plummets to the ground.

               LAKE

               Below, a stock pond nestled in the foothill pastures. Trailing 
               a wake of flame, Vermithrax plunges like a comet into the 
               water. There is a stupendous splash and eruption of steam.

               GALEN & VALERIAN

               They stare down from their lofty perch, watching as further 
               explosions boil the water from the pond.

               ECLIPSE

               Behind a tattered wrack of cloud, the moon slowly uncovers a 
               pale sun.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

               THE CARCASS - DAY

               Grey misty light reveals the beast's mangled remains. Galen 
               and Valerian emerge from the fog, walk under a blackened 
               wing and make their way through the mud and loose scales to 
               the huge charred head. The death agony has twisted it upside 
               down. The mouth is frozen in a grotesque look of surprise. 
               The eyes are glazed. Now the sound of voices floats toward 
               them, chanting an ancient hymn. A moment later a mob of 
               Christians, led by Greil, crests a hill and moves toward the 
               hulk. The song ends.

                                     GREIL
                         Let us pray.

               The members of the congregation fall to their knees.

                                     GREIL
                         We thank thee, Lord, for this divine 
                         deliverance. Verily is thy presence 
                         amongst us, fully manifest in this, 
                         thy great work.

               Galen and Valerian look at each other. She takes his hand.

                                     GREIL
                         Arise, children of the Lord and 
                         forsake evermore the pagan mysteries. 
                         Rejoice in the true power of the 
                         Christian God!

               Galen turns and leads Valerian away. They disappear into the 
               mist.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

               FLENSING - DAY

               In the clear light of a new day, ladders have been tipped up 
               against the creature's back. Teams of men swarm over the 
               crusted flesh, slicing off long strips for piecemeal burial. 
               Below, yoked oxen drag the heavy carrion away on sledges. In 
               the background other workmen dump the remains into an open 
               pit.

               THE KING

               With the crack of a whip and the clatter of hooves, the royal 
               coach pulls up to the shore of the lake. A door creaks open 
               and King Casiodorus totters out. His face is puffy, his eyes 
               are red. He slogs through the mud to the head of the dragon 
               and commences hacking at it with a ceremonial sword. Horsrik 
               steps out of the coach and draws himself up.

                                     HORSRIK
                              (loud)
                         All hail Casiodorus Rex -- Dragon 
                         slayer!

               The workers pause long enough to listen to this pronouncement 
               and cast a glance at the sorry spectacle. Wordlessly they 
               resume their labors.

                                     HORSRIK
                              (nodding)
                         Hail and praise be!

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

               ON THE ROAD - DAY

               The trail leads through copses and open meadows. Side by 
               side, Galen and Valerian march up a long slope under a hot 
               sun. He limps a bit; she finds a staff and hands it to him.

                                     VALERIAN
                         You want to rest?

                                     GALEN
                         No. I'm fine.

                                     VALERIAN
                         You miss Ulricn.

                                     GALEN
                         Yes.

                                     VALERIAN
                         And the amulet.

                                     GALEN
                         That too.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Not me. I'm glad it's gone. I'm glad 
                         you did what you did.
                              (he doesn't reply)
                         You may not be a sorcerer, Galen, 
                         but I love you anyway. I don't regret 
                         anything that happened. I just wish --

                                     GALEN
                         Yes?

                                     VALERIAN
                              (sighs)
                         -- that we had a horse.

               Galen falls a step behind. He briefly closes his eyes and 
               mutters something. They walk on a few paces. Then there is a 
               whinny from the nearby woods and a white stallion canters 
               forth. It crosses a meadow, comes right up to Valerian and 
               nuzzles her.

                                     VALERIAN
                         What is this?

                                     GALEN
                         A horse.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Did you...!?

                                     GALEN
                         No. It must have been wandering loose. 
                         Or wild.

               Galen climbs aboard. He reaches out to help her up.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Wait a minute. I just wished for a 
                         horse and here it is.

                                     GALEN
                         You don't want to wish it gone, do 
                         you?

               She thinks for a moment, then lets him help her up. Galen 
               touches the horse's flanks with his heels and they ride off.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

FADE IN:

EXT. PROVIDENCE, RHODE ISLAND - WINTER MORNING

A PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN is standing on the street corner waiting
for a bus. She's carrying books and looking very collegiate.

A black stretch LIMOUSINE with darkened windows drives past,
SLAMS ON ITS BRAKES, and backs up. The Young Woman stares at
her reflection in the windows, wondering what this is all
about.

Finally, the REAR PASSENGER WINDOW zips down, revealing LLOYD
CHRISTMAS, age 30. He's a pleasant-enough looking guy, if a
little shaggy. He's wearing a dark suit.

                       LLOYD
           Excuse me, can you tell me how to
           get to the medical school? I'm
           supposed to be giving a lecture in
           twenty minutes and my driver's a bit
           lost.

                       YOUNG WOMAN
               (heavy European accent)
           Go straight aheads and makes a left
           over za bridge.

Lloyd checks out her body.

                       LLOYD
           I couldn't help noticing the accent.
           You from Jersey?

                       YOUNG WOMAN
               (unimpressed)
           Austria.

                       LLOYD
           Austria? You're kidding.
               (mock-Australian accent)
           Well, g'day, mate. What do you say
           we get together later and throw a
           few shrimp on the barbie.

The Young Woman turns her back to him and walks away.

                       LLOYD (CONT'D)
               (to self)
           Guess I won't be going Down Under
           tonight...

He SIGHS and zips the window back up.

                                                            2.

INT. LIMO

Lloyd climbs through the driver's partition into the front
seat. Then he puts a CHAUFFEUR'S CAP on his head and drives
away. We see that HE'S THE DRIVER!

The dispatch radio CRACKLES TO LIFE:

                (v.o.)
            Carr 22, come in, car 22...

Lloyd grabs his CB mike.

                          LLOYD
            This is 22.

                        DISPATCHER
            22, where the hell are you, Lloyd?
            You're running late on the East Side
            pick-up.

                        LLOYD
            Cool your jets, Arnie. I'm on my
            way.

                        DISPATCHER
                (v.o.)
            Well hurry it up. And make sure you
            park legally. One more ticket and
            your ass is history.

                                                     CUT TO:

EXT. MUTT CUTS DOG SALON - DAY
This building is white with black spots on it, like a
DALMATION. Over the front door is an awning shaped like a
DOG'S SNOUT, whiskers included. A van pulls up outside.

The vehicle is decorated like a GIANT POODLE, with four legs
hanging off the sides, a tail in the rear, and a dog's snout
on the front grill. MUTT CUTS is written on the side of it.

HARRY DUNNE climbs out. He's in his early 30s and dressed in
a ridiculous BEAGLE COSTUME, including a CAP WITH FLOPPY
EARS. He goes to the rear of the van, opens it, and a swarm
of DOGS pile out.

                        HARRY
            Okay, gang, single file. You know
            the rules: No pushing, no humping,
            and no sniffing heinies...

                                                           3.

The door to the shop opens and Harry's annoyed boss, MR.
PALMER, sticks his head out.

                      PALMER
          Hey, why aren't those mutts on
          leashes?

                      HARRY
          The same reason you're not on a leash,
          sir because it's demeaning and it
          chafes like hell.

                      PALMER
          Just get them in here now! They all
          have to be bathed and clipped in an
          hour.

Palmer disappears back inside. Harry CALLS to the dogs but
they pay no attention. He struggles to keep them from
wandering off. He grabs a couple of SMALL POOCHES and sits
them on a wall.

                      HARRY
          You kids stay right here...

As he turns to round up the other, we discover that the wall
isn't a wall it's a flatbed truck. The truck drives away,
taking the two dogs with it.

                      HARRY (CONT'D)
              (at truck)
          Hey, wait a minute!

Harry chases after the vehicle.

                                                     CUT TO:
EXT. EAST SIDE ESTATE - DAY

Lloyd Christmas pulls the limousine into a long, tree-lined
driveway. He gets out and looks up in awe at an IMPRESSIVE
STONE MANSION. He WHISTLES to himself, then walks to the
front oor and RINGS THE BELL.

The double-front doors of the mansion open and MARY SWANSON
appears. She's 25 and gorgeous. Lloyd's jaw drops open when
he lays eyes on her.

                      MARY
          Hello.
              (beat)
          I'll be just a minute...

                                                          4.

As Mary steps back inside, Lloyd takes out a tiny can of
Binaca. He sprays his mouth, under his arms, his hair, behind
his ears...

                                                     CUT TO:

INT. LIMO - DAY

Lloyd is driving and Mary is in the back, looking out the
window, lost in thought. She's got a BRIEFCASE resting on
her lap and she fingers the leather nervously. Lloyd keeps
glancing at her in the rear-view mirror, but for a moment he
is speechless. Then:

                      LLOYD
          Why you going to the airport? Flying
          somewhere?

                      MARY
              (dead-pan)
          How'd you guess?

                      LLOYD
          Well, I saw your luggage, then when
          I noticed the airline ticket, I put
          two and two together.
              (beat)
          So where you heading?

                      MARY
          Aspen.

                      LLOYD
          Oh, you're gonna love it. I hear
          California's beautiful this time of
          year.
Mary looks back out the window and Lloyd sneaks another
glance.

                      LLOYD (CONT'D)
          Name's Christmas. Lloyd Christmas.

                      MARY
          I'm Mary.

ON LLOYD - we can almost see his mind work. He's desperate
to impress her.

                      LLOYD
          Uh, this isn't my real job, you know.
          It's only temporary.

                                                         5.

                         MARY
          Oh?

                      LLOYD
          Yeah, you see, my friend Harry and I
          are saving up our money so we can
          open our own pet store.

                         MARY
          That's nice.

                       LLOYD
              (smiling)
          I got worms.

                      MARY
          I beg your pardon?

                      LLOYD
          That's what we're gonna call it: I
          Got Worms. We're gonna specialize in
          selling worm farms you know, like
          ant farms. A lot of people don't
          realize that worms make much better
          pets than ants. They're quiet,
          affectionate, they don't bite, and
          they're super with the kids.

                      MARY
          Aren't ants quiet, too?

Lloyd realizes she has a point.

                        LLOYD
          Uh... well, sure but they aren't half
          as affectionate. And if you cut an
          ant's head off, it won't grow back.

                         MARY
          I see.

                      LLOYD
          And best of all, worm farming is a
          seventy-five-thousand-dollar-a-year
          industry. I wouldn't mind having a
          piece of that pie, if you know what
          I mean.

To her credit, she doesn't. They continue driving. Mary looks
at her watch and crosses her legs. Lloyd can see that she's
concerned about something.

                                                            6.

                      LLOYD (CONT'D)
          What's the matter? Little tense about
          the flight?

                      MARY
              (beat)
          Something like that.

Lloyd SWIVELS AROUND and STARES over his shoulder at her.

                      LLOYD
          It's really nothing to worry about,
          Mary. Statistically, they say you're
          more likely to get killed on the way
          to the airport. You know, like in a
          head-on crash, or something.

                      MARY
          Um, Lloyd, could please keep your
          eyes on the road.

                      LLOYD
          Good thinking. There's a lot of bad
          rivers out there.

Lloyd turns back to the steering wheel.

                                                     CUT TO:

EXT. AIRPORT - DAY

Lloyd is putting the last bags on a cart. He closes the trunk
and turns to Mary. She looks nervous and disconcerted as she
reaches into her purse. She pulls out a ten-dollar tip.

                         MARY
          Here you go.

                      LLOYD
          Keep it. It was my pleasure.

For the first time, Mary Swanson offers a slight smile. This
makes her more lovely than ever.

                      LLOYD (CONT'D)
          Relax, Mary. Just get trashed and
          pass out. You'll be there before you
          know it.

                      MARY
          Thanks Lloyd.
              (beat)
          And good luck with your worms.

                                                            7.

Then she PICKS UP HER BRIEFCASE and walks into the terminal,
followed by a PORTER pushing her bags. Lloyd watches her,
ENCHANTED, until she's out of sight.

Afterwards, he climbs back into the limo,  LOVESICK. For a
moment he doesn't even have the energy to  turn the key. He
just drops his head against the steering  wheel, DEVASTATED.
There's a TAP on the window. Lloyd looks  up to see a POLICE
OFFICER standing there.

                      POLICE OFFICER
          Come on, move it, you're in a red
          zone.

Lloyd starts the limo and pulls away.

                                                      CUT TO:

INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY

Mary looks tense as she moves through the throngs of
travelers. Her pace is slow, deliberate, and her eyes are
focused straight ahead.

She passes a row of phone botths and two MEN one dressed in
an ARMANI SUIT, the other in a PLAID SPORTCOAT watch her.

                       ARMANI SUIT
          She's gonna leave the briefcase at
          the foot of the escalator. You make
          the pick-up.

                      PLAID SPORTCOAT
          Piece of cake.

EXT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY
As Lloyd pulls his limo slowly away, he glances in the airport
window and SEES MARY

WALKING ALONG.

When she stops at the foot of the escalator, he stops, too.
She puts down the briefcase and checks her coat pocket for
her ticket. Lloyd's attention is distracted by a HONK. He
turns to see a car irectly behind him.

                      LLOYD
              (to car's driver)
          Drive around me, you pinhead!

When he turns back to watch Mary in the terminal he sees
that SHE'S GONE, and she's LEFT HER BRIEFCASE AT THE FOOT OF
THE STAIRS. Lloyd jumps to ATTENTION.

                                                           8.

He pulls the car into a HANDICAPPED SPOT and hops out. He
starts to run into the terminal, then notices the Police
Officer and suddenly goes into a spastic walk, limping and
dragging him leg behind him like a palsy victim.

INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL

The Armani Man nods to the Plaid Sportcoat and he starts to
approach the briefcase. Just as Plaid Sportcoat is reaching
for the handle, LLOYD RUNS BY AND GRABS IT. He CONTINUES UP
THE ESCALATOR three steps at a time. The two men look at
each other, dumbstruck.

INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - BOARDING GATE

Lloyd runs with the briefcase to the TV monitors that post
the departure times. He looks frantically at the confusion
of numbers.

                        LLOYD
          Damn!

QUICK CUT of a dejected Lloyd looking out the window as he
watches as Mary's airplane taxiing away.

EXT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY

Lloyd comes out with the briefcase, passing the two men, who
FOLLOW HIM AT A DISTANCE. He starts walking down the sidewalk
when suddenly he STOPS IN HIS TRACKS.

HIS POV - his limo is being towed away    under the supervision
of the Police Officer.

He takes off after it, but to no avail.
                      LLOYD
          You can't do this! I'll lose my job!

As Lloyd watches the limo get towed out of site, he runs his
fingers through his hair.

                                                       CUT TO:

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - AFTERNOON

We see the Mutt Cuts van pull up and park at the curb. A
dejected Harry climbs out. At the same time, a taxi pulls up
and drops off Lloyd. (He's clutching Mary Swanson's
briefcase.) Both he and Harry climb the steps of the building.
They disappear inside without acknowledging each other.

                                                            9.

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET - a black Cadillac pulls up
and parks. Inside are the Armani suit and the Sportcoat.
They are J.P. SHAY and JOSEPH MENTALINO (aka JOE

MENTAL).

                        MENTAL
           Who the hell do you figure this guy's
           working for?

                       SHAY
           I don't know, but we'd better find
           out...

Mental takes some PILLS and starts CHOMPING them.

                         SHAY (CONT'D)
           Your ulcer?

                       MENTAL
           It ain't gonna kill me.

INT. APARTMENT CORRIDOR

Lloyd and Harry trudge up the stairs and proceed silently
toward the door of their apartment.

INT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM

Lloyd and Harry ENTER and   pass each other quietly as they
both plunk down in their   favorite easy chairs. (Lloyd still
has the briefcase in his   lap.) Harry's caged parakeet, PETEY,
tweets hello, but the two   guys just sit there SILENTLY.

The place is a mess. Wallpaper's peeling off the walls. The
carpet is threadbare and filthy. In the corner we see a
miniature WORM FARM and a large terrarium filled with dirt
and worms. Here are a couple pieces of haggard furniture
with stuffing spilling out of the gashes.

                       HARRY
           I got fired again.

Lloyd shakes his head.

                       LLOYD
           I don't mean to be harsh, Harry, but
           let's face it, you are one pathetic
           loser. No offense.

                       HARRY
           None taken. Were you shitcanned,
           too?

                                                        10.

                      LLOYD
          Of course not.
              (beat)
          I quit.

                      HARRY
          Why'd you quit?

                      LLOYD
          I had a hunch Arnie was gonna fire
          me.

                      HARRY
          Why didn't you wait and see if your
          suspicions were well-founded?

                      LLOYD
          Winners control their own destiny,
          Har.

Lloyd fetches a couple beers from the fridge and throws one
to him.

                      HARRY
          You know, the thing that really chaps
          my ass is that I just spent my life
          savings turning my van into a poodle.
              (beat)
          The alarm alone cost me two hundred.

                      LLOYD
          Big deal. That car's an old bomb
          anyway.

                      HARRY
          What are you talking about? It's
          only six years old.

                      LLOYD
          That's forty-two in dog years.

They open their beers and drink simultaneously. Then Harry
notices the briefcase.

                      HARRY
          What's with the briefcase?

                      LLOYD
          It's a love memento.

                      HARRY
          Huh?

                                                        11.

                        LLOYD
            The most beautiful woman alive. Her
            name was Mary. I drove her to the
            airport. Sparks flew, emotions ran
            high, breasts heaved. She left this
            case in the terminal and flew to
            Aspen and out of my life. End of
            story.

                        HARRY
            What's in it?

                        LLOYD
            DO you really expect me to go snooping
            around in someone else's private
            property?

                           HARRY
            Why not?

                           LLOYD
                (beat)
            It's locked.

They take another sip of their beers. Suddenly we hear a
LOUD KNOCK at the door. Petey the parakeet starts to SQUAWK.
The guys look at each other, ALARMED, then Harry tip-toes to
the

PEEPHOLE.

HARRY'S POV - a DISTORTED-LOOKING J.P. Shay and Joe Mental
are standing at the door.

                        LLOYD (CONT'D)
                (WHISPERING to Harry)
            Friend or foe?

                        HARRY
                (WHISPERING)
            We don't have any friends.

Harry is still squinting out the peephole.

                        HARRY (CONT'D)
            Can't recognize them. Could be student
            loan thugs again, or the IRS, or
            maybe somebody pissed off about that
            case of Girl Scout cookies you bounced
            a check on.

                                                           12.

                      LLOYD
          Hey, I ordered Mystic Mint. The little
          swindlers gave me Peanut Butter
          Praline.

                      HARRY
          Well, whoever they are, they look
          serious. One of them's even wearing
          plaid.

                      LLOYD
              (cringing)
          That's a hostile pattern. I say we
          bail and get down to unemployment.

Lloyd GRABS THE BRIEFCASE and the two of them EXIT out the
window and down the fire escape.

                                                        CUT TO:

EXT. UNEMPLOYMENT OFFICE - AFTERNOON

The poodle van pulls up to the curb in front of the building
and PARKS NEXT TO A FIRE HYDRANT. Lloyd and Harry climb out.
Lloyd takes a trash can and places it OVER THE

HYDRANT, COVERING IT COMPLETELY.

INT. STANLEY GRABNER'S OFFICE - UNEMPLOYMENT OFFICE -
AFTERNOON

STANLEY GRABNER is small, plump, balding, not a lot of laughs.

                      GRABNER
          Gentlemen, I'm delighted to say that
          neither I nor the unemployment
          epartment of the state of Rhose Island
          can do anything for you.
              (beat)
          You've run out of chances. You're
          unemployable. Remember last year?
          Middle of winter I busted my butt to

GET YOU BOTH PRIME JOBS. TWELVE-

fifty an hour, and you went and blew it!

                      LLOYD
          Blew it? For your information, we
          only missed three days in two months.

                      HARRY
          Yeah, and that was because of a
          blizzard

                                                         13.

                      GRABNER
              (exploding)
          YOU WERE SNOW PLOW OPERATORS!

Grabner falls back in his chair, exhausted.

                      HARRY
          Come on, Stan. I'm sure you can find
          something else for us. How about
          another crack at that Suicide Hotline?

Grabner jumps up.

                      GRABNER
          OUT!!!!!

                                                     CUT TO:

INT. HARRY & LLOYD'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

J.P. Shay is looking through Harry and Lloyd's kitchen
cupboards as Joe Mental comes out of the bedroom.

                      MENTAL
          The briefcase ain't here. He must've
          taken it with him.

                      J.P. SHAY
          Shit.
              (beat)
          Well he's gotta come home sometime.

Joe Mental ominously approaches Petey the parakeet's cage.

                      MENTAL
          Maybe we should leave him a little
          message to let 'em know we're playing
          hardball.

Mental opens the cage door and wraps his meaty fist around
the bird, who SCREECHES IN

TERROR.

                      MENTAL (CONT'D)
              (a la Tweety Bird)
          I taut I taw a puddy cat.

Mental smiles, and as we PAN to J.P. Shay, we hear a bone-
chilling O.S. SNAP and Petey the bird stops SQUAWKING.

                                                          14.

                      MENTAL (CONT'D)
              (still Tweety)
          I did, I did...

                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

The Mutt Cuts van pulls up to the curb. A depressed Lloyd
and Harry climb out and mope up to their apartment building
entrance.

                       LLOYD
          Give me what's left of our dough.
          I'll go to the corner and buy a few
          necessities.

Harry hands his friend some crumpled bills.

                      LLOYD (CONT'D)
          What's cheaper, Thunderbird or Night
          Train?

                      HARRY
          Get Robitussin it's a better buzz.

                                                      CUT TO:

EXT. CORNER GROCERY STORE - NIGHT

Lloyd comes out of the store with his arms full of groceries.
He stops at a newspaper machine, pulls out his WALLET and
removes a quarter.

He drops the quarter in the machine, opens it, and realizes
that he DOESN'T HAVE A FREE HAND to pick up the newspaper.
He puts his wallet inside the machine, picks up the newspaper,
and as he does so THE MACHINE SLAMS SHUT WITH HIS WALLET
STILL INSIDE.

Lloyd SIGHS, puts his grocery bags on the machine, and checks
his pockets. NO MORE CHANGE. Just then, an ELDERLY WOMAN
struggles by using a WALKER.

                      LLOYD
          Excuse me, little old lady, do you
          have change for a dollar?

                      ELDERLY WOMAN
          Change? No, I'm sorry, I don't...

                      LLOYD
          Well could you do me a favor and
          guard this while I go break a dollar?
          My wallet's locked in this machine.

                                                           15.

                      ELDERLY LADY
          Of course, young man...

Lloyd runs back into the store. We HOLD ON THE STORE DOOR as
Lloyd EXITS a few seconds later with a handful of quarters.
Suddenly he stops in his tracks. The ELDERLY LADY, HER WALKER,
AND HIS GROCERIES ARE GONE. As he takes a closer look, he
sees that

SHE HAS TAKEN HIS WALLET ALSO.

                                                     CUT TO:

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING STAIRWELL - NIGHT

A thoroughly beleaguered Lloyd is trudging empty-handed up
the steps to his apartment.

INT. LLOYD & HARRY'S APARTMENT

The door opens and Lloyd ENTERS. Harry is sitting on the
couch, looking almost comatose.

                      HARRY
          Where's the booze?

                      LLOYD
          It's gone. I got robbed by Grandma
          Walton. She got my wallet, too.

Harry drops his head and lets out a MOAN.

                      LLOYD (CONT'D)
          Come on, man, cheer up. We've been
          own before. I'm sure we'll land on
          our heads somewhere.
                       HARRY
          It gets worse, Lloyd. My parakeet
          Petey he's... he's dead.

Lloyd looks touched by this.

                      LLOYD
          Oh man, I'm sorry, Harry. What
          happened?

                      HARRY
          His head fell off.

                      LLOYD
          His head fell off?

                                                           16.

                        HARRY
            Yeah, he was pretty old.

Lloyd puts his hand on Harry's shoulder compassionately.

                        LLOYD
                (hopeful)
            I don't suppose he had a warranty...?

                        HARRY
            Nah, I bought him used.

As Lloyd thinks about the unfairness of life, he grows upset.

                        LLOYD
            That's it! I've had it with this
            ump! We don't have food, we don't
            have jobs, our pets' heads are falling
            off, we're surrounded by roving gangs
            of larcenous old

LADIES...

                        HARRY
            Okay, calm down.

                        LLOYD
            No I won't calm down.

Lloyd flops down in a chair.

                        LLOYD (CONT'D)
            What the hell are we doing here
            anyway, Harry? We've got to get out
            of this town.
                        HARRY
            Yeah, and go where?

                        LLOYD
            I'll tell you where: someplace warm,
            a place where the beer flows like
            wine, where beautiful women
            instinctively flock like the salmon
            of Capistrano.
                (dramatic PAUSE)
            I'm talking about Aspen.

                        HARRY
            Aspen?

                        LLOYD
            That's right, Aspen.

                                                        17.

                      HARRY
          I don't know, Lloyd, the French are
          assholes.

                      LLOYD
          Let me ask you something: do you
          want to end up like Petey dead in
          some flea-ridden apartment, face-
          down on a Dear Abby column, with a
          soggy sunflower seed pressed against
          your beak? Or do you want to enjoy
          your life?
              (beat)
          Come on, Harry, don't let Petey's
          eath be in vain. Don't you see what
          he was saying? Spread your wings,
          man. he was saying? Spread your wings,
          man. Fly.

                      HARRY
              (confused)
          What are you talking about, Lloyd?
          His head fell off.
              (dawning realization)
          Wait a second, I know what you're up
          to. You just wanna go to Aspen so
          you can find that girl who lost her
          briefcase and you need me to drive
          you there.

                      LLOYD
          That's bullshit. I'll drive.
              (beat)
          And what's so wrong about going
          someplace where we know someone who
          can plug us into the social pipeline?
                      HARRY
              (torn)
          I don't know, Lloyd. I think we should
          stay here, hunt for jobs, and keep
          saving money for the worm store. I'm
          getting a little sick and tired of
          always running from creditors.

Lloyd moves to the window and looks out at the gray, wintry
cityscape.

                      LLOYD
          You know what I'm sick and tired of,
          Harry? I'm sick and tired of having
          to eek my way through life. I'm sick
          and tired of being a nobody.
                      (MORE)

                                                           18.

                      LLOYD (CONT'D)
              (beat)
          But most of all, I'm sick and tired
          of having nobody.

There's a deadly SILENCE as they both think about this. Then
Harry tries to lighten the mood. He opens his arms wide.

                      HARRY
          Come on, Lloyd. Give us a kiss.

                      LLOYD
          On the other hand, maybe you're right,
          Harry. Maybe we should stay here and
          try our luck in bankruptcy court.
          With all those lawsuits against us,
          I'm sure we'll win at least one. It
          could be a boost to our egos.

Harry sees that Lloyd has a point. He stands and approaches
Petey's cage. His eyes fill with tears.

                         HARRY
                 (emotional)
          Petey, I made a promise to you once,
          man...
                 (thinking hard)
          ...and I'll be damned if I can remember
          what it was.

                                                     CUT TO:

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

The Mutt Cutts van is going down the highway while Danny
Wilson's "Mary's Prayer" plays on the soundtrack. The van
drives past and we HOLD ON a sign that reads: "YOU ARE LEAVING

PROVIDENCE, RHODE ISLAND. COME BACK SOON." VARIOUS OTHER
AERIAL

SHOTS of the car travelling down the road while the song
continues to play.

INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - DAY

Harry's behind the wheel and Lloyd's in the passenger seat.
The Animal's "We've Got to Get Out of This Place" is BLASTING
on the radio and the guys are SINGING ALONG:

                                                        19.

                      LLOYD & HARRY
          "We've got to get out of this place,
          If it's the last thing we ever do,
          We've got to get out of this place,
          Girl, there's a better life, for me
          and you..."

Lloyd turns down the radio.

                      LLOYD
          Well, we're finally doing it. Do you
          realize that in all the years we've
          known each other, this is the first
          time we've done this together.

                      HARRY
          Been run out of town?

                      LLOYD
          Taken a trip.

Harry reaches over and UNDOES HIS SEATBELT. Lloyd watches,
curious.

                      LLOYD (CONT'D)
          Why'd you do that?

                      HARRY
          What?

                      LLOYD
          Take your seatbelt off.

                      HARRY
          Because we just cleared the danger
          zone.
                      LLOYD
          Huh?

                      HARRY
          Don't you know anything, Lloyd? Ninety
          percent of all accidents happen within
          five miles of home. We've already
          traveled 6.3 miles.

LLOYD THINKS ABOUT THIS. THEN:

                      LLOYD
          Well what about the people who live
          around here? What if we got into an
          accident with one of them?

                                                        20.

Harry considers this, then sheepishly puts his seatbelt back
on. Lloyd opens a bag of Doritos and fiddles with the radio.

                      HARRY
          Where'd you get those?

                      LLOYD
          Bought 'em when we filled up.

                      HARRY
          Lloyd, I thought we agreed to confer
          on all expenditures. We're on a tight
          budget, remember?

                      LLOYD
          This didn't come out of our travel
          fund. I was able to scrape up twenty-
          five bucks before we left. You know,
          so we could live in style.

                      HARRY
          Where'd you get twenty-five extra
          bucks?

                      LLOYD
          I sold some stuff to Billy in 4-C.

                      HARRY
          You mean the blind kid?

                      LLOYD
          That's right.

Lloyd looks out the window guiltily.

                      HARRY
          What did you sell him, Lloyd?

                      LLOYD
          Just some odds and ends.

                      HARRY
          Specifically?

                      LLOYD
          Oh, a few baseball cards, a sack of
          marbles, Petey, three comic books a
          second, are you telling me you sold
          my dead bird to a blind kid? Well
          who else was I gonna sell it to?

                      HARRY
          But Lloyd, Petey didn't even have a
          head.

                                                         21.

                      LLOYD
          Put your mind at ease, friend. I
          took care of it.

                                                     CUT TO:

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

At the bottom of the stairs leading up to the building is a
little blind boy, BILLY. He sits in a wheelchair playing
with a PARAKEET WHOSE HEAD IS SCOTCH-TAPED ON. He throws the
ead bird up, but it flops into his lap.

                        BILLY
          Fly!

Joe Mental and J.P. Shay approach and climb the steps.

                                                     CUT TO:

CLOSE ON A NOTE - taped to Harry and Lloyd's apartment door.
It reads: TO ALL OUR

LOVED ONES - PACKED UP AND DROVE TO ASPEN - HAVE A NICE LIFE -
LLOYD AND HARRY.

PULLBACK to reveal Joe Mental and J.P. Shay.

                      MENTAL
          Those bastards. They're rubbing it
          right in our faces.

                      J.P. SHAY
          Shit! Andre will have a goddamn
          aneurysm if we don't get that
          briefcase back.
                        MENTAL
          Don't   worry, we'll get it back. And
          I'll   tell you something else. They
          ain't   gonna reach Aspen, either.
          I'll   make sure of that.

Mental takes out more ANTACID PILLS and starts to chew on
them.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

A pissed-off Shay and Mental EXIT the building. Mental pops
more antacid pills into his mouth as they descend the stairs.
Little Billy is still tossing the lifeless parakeet into the
air.

                                                        22.

                      BILLY
          Come on, boy, fly!

Plop. Then Billy hears Shay and Mental on the steps and CALLS
OUT:

                      BILLY (CONT'D)
          Excuse me, mister. Is there something
          wrong with my bird?

Mental picks up the bird, studies it, then angrily and WINGS
IT DOWN THE STREET as hard as he can.

                      MENTAL
          Don't worry, Ironside, he just flew
          south for the winter.

INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - AFTERNOON

Harry is still driving while Lloyd studies a map spread out
before him.

                      HARRY
          How far have we gone?

                      LLOYD
          According to this map, about an inch
          and a half.

                      HARRY
          Shit. We're gonna need a smaller map
          or we'll never get there. We don't
          have enough gas money.
                      LLOYD
          Relax. We have more than enough.

                      HARRY
          I believe you're wrong, Lloyd.

                      LLOYD
          And I believe I'm right, Harry.

                      HARRY
          I still say wrong, Lloyd.

                      LLOYD
          How much you wanna bet?

                         HARRY
          I don't bet.

                                                        23.

Lloyd looks at his friend, incredulous.

                      LLOYD
          What do you mean you don't bet?

                      HARRY
          I mean I don't gamble, you know that.
          Never have and never will.

                      LLOYD
          Oh, bull. I'll bet you our next meal
          that I can get you gambling before
          the day's out.

                      HARRY
          There's no way, Lloyd. You can't do
          it.

                      LLOYD
          I'll give you three-to-one odds.
          That's three feedbags if you win,
          against only one if you lose.

                      HARRY
          You're wasting your money, Lloyd. I
          already told you, I don't gamble.

                      LLOYD
          Okay, five-to-one I can get you
          gambling before the day's out.

                      HARRY
          Sorry, pal, no way.

                      LLOYD
          Make it ten-to-one.
Harry sticks out his hand.

                      HARRY
          You got yourself a bet, sucker!

As Harry SHAKES LLOYD'S HAND, Lloyd breaks into a BIG SMILE.
Harry immediately realizes he's been had.

EXT. TRUCK STOP CAFÉ - AFTERNOON

The Mutt Cutt van is sandwiched between mountainous tractor-
trailer trucks.

INT. TRUCK STOP CAFÉ

Lloyd and Harry are sitting at a booth, surrounded by tables
of tough-looking TRUCKERS. Harry oesn't look happy. A middle-
aged, no-nonsense WAITRESS approaches their table with a
couple of burgers and drinks. She puts them down in front of
the boys and starts to walk away.

                           LLOYD
                   (to Waitress)

UH, EXCUSE ME...

The Waitress reluctantly returns to the table.

                         LLOYD (CONT'D)
             What's the soup du jour?

                         WAITRESS
             It's the soup-of-the-day.

                         LLOYD
             Sounds tasty. I'll have a bowl.

                         WAITRESS
                 (sarcastic)
             Anything else before I leave the
             area?

                         HARRY
             Actually, this chocolate milk isn't
             mixed very well. Could you please
             bring me a spoon?

The Waitress SIGHS and picks up the milk. Then she BLOWS
INTO THE STRAW, MIXING
THE DRINK.

                         WAITRESS
             There. Now you don't need one.

The guys watch her stomp away.

LLOYD

FEELS GOOD TO MINGLE WITH THESE LAID-

back country-folk, don't it, Harry?

Harry wipes off his straw with a napkin. As he moves to put
it in the ashtray, he accidentally

KNOCKS OVER THE SALT SHAKER.

                                                           25.

                      LLOYD
          Uh-oh...

                      HARRY
          What's the matter?

                      LLOYD
          You spilled the salt. That's bad
          luck. We're driving across the country
          and the last thing we need is bad
          luck. Quick, toss a handful of salt
          over your right shoulder.

                      HARRY
          What for?

                      LLOYD
          Because that's good luck.

Harry shrugs, shakes some salt into his palm, and flings it
over his shoulder. Suddenly they hear a

YELP.

                      MALE VOICE
              (o.s.)
          What the fuck?!

                      LLOYD
          Or was it the left shoulder?

They turn and see a burly TRUCKER wiping salt out of his
eyes.

                      TRUCKER
          Who's the dead man threw shit in my
          eye?

The huge Trucker stands and squints at Lloyd and Harry. He's
wearing a FOAM BASEBALL CAP that says: WINE 'EM, DINE 'EM,
SIXTY-NINE 'EM.

                      HARRY
          It was a terrible accident, Sir.
          Believe me, I would never do anything
          to offend a man of your size. Please
          accept my most sincere apology.

The Trucker GROWLS and approaches the table, egged on by his
equally burly FRIENDS.

                      BURLY FRIEND #1
          Teach him a lesson, Sea Bass!

                                                          26.

Sea Bass glares down at Harry's hamburger.

                      SEA BASS
          You gonna eat that?

                        HARRY
          Um... the thought had crossed my mind.

At this, Sea Bass leans over and DROPS A BIG, BROWN WAD OF
TOBACCO SPIT ONTO

THE HAMBURGER.

                      SEA BASS
          Still want it?

Harry stares at the burger non-commitally.

                      HARRY
          Nah, you go ahead.

Sea Bass picks up the burger and walks back to his table, to
the LAUGHTER of his friends.

The Waitress drops the check on Lloyd and Harry's table and
STOMPS away. Harry studies the bill and SIGHS.

                      HARRY
          Perfect. I'm out eight bucks and I
          still haven't eaten.

                      LLOYD
          Well if you'd stop picking fights
          with the locals...
              (brightening)
          Wait a second. I think I just had an
          idea. Follow me...

Lloyd stands and walks over to Sea Bass and his pals. A
nervous Harry trails after him.

                                                           27.

                      LLOYD (CONT'D)
          Excuse me, gentlemen, I'd just like
          to apologize for that unpleasant
          scene a little earlier.

                      SEA BASS
          Huh?

                      LLOYD
          What I'm trying to say is, my friend
          and I would like to buy you guys a
          round of beers, just to bury the
          hatchet.

Harry stares at Lloyd like he's out of his mind, but the
Truckers seem to like the idea.

                      SEA BASS
          Make it four boiler-makers.

                      LLOYD
          Whatever you want, sir. I'll have
          the waitress send them over. Oh, and
          fellas hope to see you again down
          the road.

Lloyd and Harry move away from the table toward the CASHIER.

                      HARRY
          Lloyd, what are you doing? You know
          we can't afford to buy them drinks.

Lloyd hands the Cashier their check.

                      LLOYD
          Um, Sea Bass and the fellas offered
          to pick up our check. They said just
          add this to their tab.

                      CASHIER
              (skeptical)
          Sea Bass said that?

                      LLOYD
          Well, if that guy at the table over
          there is Sea Bass...

He points across the room to Sea Bass and company. Sea Bass
NODS TO THE CASHIER AND GESTURES TO HIS TABLE, NOT WANTING
TO MISS OUT ON HIS FREE DRINK. The Cashier is convinced.

                      CASHIER
          Okey-dokey, if that's what he wants...

                                                           28.

Harry smiles at this. He grabs a couple Beef Jerky's, a candy
bar, and a copy of The National Enquirer off the counter.

                      HARRY
          Oh, and put these on there, too.

                        CASHIER
          You got it.

          Island from here?

                      CASHIER
          Hurry and you'll catch 'em. They was

The Truckers jump in their rigs and RUMBLE AWAY   in the
OPPOSITE DIRECTION our boys are headed.

          I just wish we could've seen Sea
          Bass's face when he got the bill.

                      HARRY
          I hope we never have to.

                      LLOYD
          Don't worry. That fish-head is

          now.

          I hope so.

Harry checks his rear-view mirror nervously.

                      LLOYD
          Hey, stop the car. I gotta take a
          whiz.

                      HARRY
          Are you crazy? I'm not stopping now.
          What if they figure out we went the
          other way. They'll be on us in no
          time.

                      LLOYD
          But I gotta go. What am I supposed
          to do?

                       HARRY
          Hold it.

                      LLOYD
          I can't hold it. I'm about to explode.

                        HARRY
          Well... just take a whiz in an empty
          beer bottle. There's a couple on the
          floor in the back seat.

                      LLOYD
          Are you serious?

                      HARRY
          Yes, I'm serious. I'm not stopping
          now. We could get killed.
Lloyd SIGHS. He takes an EMPTY BEER BOTTLE from the back
seat and UNZIPS his fly. Suddenly we hear a PEEING SOUND.
Then:

                       LLOYD
          Uh-oh...

          What's the matter?

          The bottle's almost full and I'm
          still going.

                      HARRY
          Well stop going.

                                                           30.

          I can't stop once I already started,
          you know that. Quick, get me another
          bottle.

Harry can BARELY HOLD THE STEERING WHEEL as he reaches way
in the back seat for an empty.

                      LLOYD (CONT'D)
          Jesus, be careful! You almost went
          off the road.

                      HARRY
          I'm sorry, Lloyd. I'm doing the best
          I can.

He hands Lloyd another empty and Lloyd quickly makes the
switch.

                      LLOYD
          Here, hold this.

Before Harry knows it he's holding the full BOTTLE OF URINE.

EXT. HIGHWAY - LATE DAY

As the Mutt Cutts van travels down the highway, it passes a
STATE TROOPER on a motorcycle hidden in the bushes. The
Trooper takes off after them.

INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN

Harry is doing his best to steer while now holding FIVE FULL
BOTTLES AND Lloyd is still going at it in the passenger seat.

                      HARRY
          What are you, a goddamn camel?

                      LLOYD
          Hey, I haven't gone all day.

Just then they hear a LOUDSPEAKER:

                       STATE TROOPER
              (o.s.)
          Pull over!

They turn to see the POLICE MOTORCYCLE cruising right beside
then. Harry rolls down his window and CALLS OUT:

                       HARRY
          Huh?

                                                        31.

                       STATE TROOPER
          PULL OVER!

Harry glances down at his sweater he's wearing, then back at
the Trooper.

                      HARRY
              (calling out)
          No, it's a Cardigan! But thanks for
          noticing!

He rolls his window back up and turns to an equally baffled
Lloyd.

                      HARRY (CONT'D)
          Jesus, what is this, the fashion
          police?

The Cop turns on his SIREN.

Harry hands him the papers.
                      STATE TROOPER (CONT'D)
          You know, you fellas were all over
          the road back there.

                      HARRY
          Yes, sir, we had a little... ifficulty
          in the car.

          Uh-huh.

          Have you boys been doing a little
          rinking maybe?

          No, sir.

           Then what's that?

He points to the OPEN, FULL BEER BOTTLES hidden in the seat
between them.

                       HARRY
           Oh, that's nothing, sir.

                       STATE TROOPER
           Do you know it's against the law to
           rive with an open alcohol container
           in this state?

                       LLOYD
           But, your honor, he's telling the
           truth. It's not beer.

The officer smirks.

                       STATE TROOPER
           Is that right?

The Trooper reaches in and picks up one of the bottles. He
inspects the beer label, then MOVES

THE BOTTLE TO HIS LIPS.

                       HARRY
           Sir, I wouldn't TROOPER --You'd keep
           your mouth shut if you knew what was
           good for you.

                       LLOYD
               (under breath)
YOU WOULD, TOO...

Harry shoots Lloyd a look as the Trooper begins GULPING down
the piss. He pauses uncertainly and a SICK LOOK COMES OVER
HIS FACE. He takes a DEEP BREATH. Then:

                        STATE TROOPER
               (pained)
           Get the hell out of here.

The Mutt Cutts van is pulling back onto the highway while
the officer remains in the breakdown lane with his hands on
his knees.

EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

The van is making steady progress through the dark night.

INT. MUTT CUTT VAN - NIGHT

Lloyd is driving now while Harry sleeps in the passenger
seat. The song, "Cut Flowers" by The Smithereens, starts to
play as Lloyd FANTASIZES about his future in Aspen.

                                                DISSOLVE TO:

LLOYD'S FANTASY:

Lloyd is walking up the steps of a luxurious, snow-covered
chalet, carrying Mary's briefcase. The sky is absurdly blue
and children are making a snowman on the lawn. It's all out
of a dream world. He KNOCKS on the door, tentatively. Mary
opens it. She looks at him, then at the briefcase, and breaks
into the BIGGEST, SWEETEST SMILE he's ever seen. Then she
slowly backs into the house, gesturing for him to follow...

Lloyd follows Mary down a hallway. As he trails after her,
she pulls off her shirt, revealing her bare back, and glances
over her shoulder at him.

CAMERA MOVES around a corner and now we're in a STEAMY
BATHROOM. The shower is running and we see the silhouette of
two people behind the curtain.

                             LLOYD
                    (v.o.)

OOH... OOH... MARY...

                          MARY
                  (v.o.)
              How does that feel, Lloyd?

                             LLOYD
                    (v.o.)

MMMM... TINGLY...

INT. SHOWER

CLOSE ON LLOYD - we see he's taking the TEGRIN CHALLENGE,
with different shampoos on either side of his head and a
noticeable part down the middle.

                          MARY
                  (o.s.)
              How's the other side?

                                                          34.

                        LLOYD
            Nothing. Nothing at all.

                        MARY
                (o.s.)
            Lloyd, will you wash my nipples...?

ON MARY - her   hair is slicked back, making her look better
than ever. As   the CAMERA PANS DOWN toward her breasts, we
are surprised   to see not breasts but a SET OF HEADLIGHTS
SUPERIMPOSED   OVER HER CHEST AREA. The headlights FLASH ONCE.
Then TWICE.

ON LLOYD - he blinks, confused at what's happening.

JUMP CUT   TO - an eighteen-wheeler is ROARING RIGHT TOWARD
THE MUTT   CUTTS VAN on the highway. Lloyd quickly veers back
into his   lane and avoids tragedy by a whisker. A shaken Lloyd
lets out   a SIGH OF RELIEF, and we

                                                       CUT TO:

EXT. SECOND HONEYMOON HOTEL - NIGHT

The Mutt Cutts van is parked outside this seedy establishment.
A neon sign blinks: GROUP

DISCOUNTS - HAVE YOUR NEXT AFFAIR HERE.

                        HARRY
                (v.o.)
            I don't know, Lloyd, I feel a little
            sleazy staying here when we're not
            even engaged.

                        LLOYD
                (v.o.)
            Hey, it's the only motel that charges
            by the hour. We can't afford anything
            else.

INT. BATHROOM - SECOND HONEYMOON MOTEL

Lloyd and Harry are sitting in a large, HEART-SHAPED JACUZZI.
Lloyd is sipping a beer and Harry is absorbed in the Enquirer
as the water swirls around them.

                          LLOYD
            Yep, this sure is the life. Cold
            beer, a hot tube, and fuzzy pink
            sheets... You know, there's only one
            thing that could make this moment
            any better.

                                                        35.

                         HARRY
          What's that?

                      LLOYD
          If you had a nice set of knockers.

                      HARRY
          That's two things, Lloyd.

                      LLOYD
          Right now I'd settle for one.

Lloyd takes a swig of beer. Harry puts down the paper and
looks around at the romantic decor.

                      HARRY
          I don't know, Lloyd, these places
          just don't do it for me. Brings back
          too many memories.

                      LLOYD
          What happened, Harry? Some little
          filly break your heart?

                      HARRY
          Nah, it was a girl. Fraida Felcher.
          We stayed at a place like this once
          No-Tell Motel out on Route 31.

                      LLOYD
          Felcher? You mean the babe who worked
          for the tractor company?

Harry nods.

                      HARRY
          The same. We had this incredibly
          romantic time. Boy, I thought we'd
          be together forever.
              (SIGHS)
          Then about a week later, right out
          of the blue, she sends me a John
          Deere letter.

                      LLOYD
          That's cold, Har. Give you any reason?

                      HARRY
          I called her up and she gave me some
          crap about me not listening to her
          enough or something like that. I
          wasn't really paying attention.

                                                          36.

Harry reaches for a beer and busts it open. He takes a big
gulp.

                      HARRY (CONT'D)
          Thing that really hurts is I think
          she was seeing another guy. Never id
          find out who.

ON LLOYD - he does his best to hide his GUILT.

                                                       CUT TO:

EXT. SECOND HONEYMOON MOTEL - NIGHT

We see that the black Cadillac is   parked a few cars over
from the Mutt Cutts van with J.P.   Shay in the passenger seat.
PAN OVER to a payphone. Inside is   Joe Mental. Outside the
booth, an ANXIOUS MAN impatiently   paces back and forth as he
waits for the phone.

                      MENTAL
              (into phone)
          The boys are holed-up in a little
          love nest for the night. I think
          they're a couple of fucking weirdos.

INT. NICHOLAS ANDRE'S STUDY - NIGHT

NICHOLAS ANDRE is pacing around the room with a cordless
phone. He's in his late 30s, wears a ponytail, and dresses
in Aspen/Rodeo Drive chic.

                      ANDRE
          What in hell are those guys up to?
          Is it possible that they're Feds?
INTERCUT CONVERSATION

                      MENTAL
          Unlikely from what I've seen.

The ANXIOUS MAN taps on the phone booth and motions for Mental
to hang up.

                      ANDRE
          I don't like this one goddamn bit,
          Mental. You and Shay were supposed
          to grab that bag so we could end
          this shit. Now I don't know what the
          hell's going on.

Andre SIGHS and wipes some perspiration from his upper lip.
The Anxious Man KNOCKS on the booth again.

                                                           37.

                      MENTAL
          Hold on a second, Mr. Andre...

Mental puts the phone down and motions the    Anxious Man closer
to the booth. The Man moves forward a few    inches. Mental
motions him even closer. When he's about a    foot away, Mental
punches his hand through the glass of the    booth and knocks
the Anxious Man out cold. Then

Mental picks up the phone again.

                      MENTAL (CONT'D)
          Sorry, boss. You were saying...?

                      ANDRE
          Look, Mental, just find out what
          they're up to. I want to know who
          these guys are.

                      MENTAL
          Don't worry. I'm on it.

Mental hangs up the phone, looks around to make sure he's
not being watched, then approaches the parked Mutt Cutt van.
He's joined by J.P. Shay.

As they get within five feet of the vehicle, we hear a LOW
GROWL. They stop in their tracks and turn, expecting to see
a dog but there isn't one. They both take another step
forward, and the GROWL GETS LOUDER AND MEANER. Again, Mental
and Shay stop. He peeks under the car. Nothing.

                      SHAY
          What the fuck...?

Finally, Shay reaches for the door handle. As soon as he
touches it, though, the car alarm goes off but instead of a
siren, it's the incredibly annoying sound of a POODLE YAPPING.
Mental jumps back and pulls his gun.

                      MENTAL
          Where's the goddamn dog?

Shay shrugs, nervous. The YAPPING grows EVEN LOUDER now,
forcing a flustered Shay and Mental to retreat from the scene.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. SWANSON CHALET - ASPEN - NIGHT

ESTABLISHING SHOT of a luxurious mountainside home.

INT. LIVING ROOM - SWANSON CHALET

An agitated Mary Swanson (the young woman who lost her
briefcase) is pacing back and forth in

AN IMPRESSIVE, ANTIQUE-FILLED LIVING ROOM. SEATED ON A COUCH
ARE HER FATHER KARL AND HIS MUCH-

younger second wife, HELEN.

                      MARY
          It just doesn't make any sense. I
          left the money exactly where they
          instructed me to.

                      HELEN
          Actually, it makes a great deal of
          sense, Mary. We should have called
          in the authorities the moment we
          knew Melvin had been kidnapped.

                      KARL
          Now, Helen, we've been through this
          already for Christ's sake, Karl,
          these bastards will extort us into
          bankruptcy if we let them.

                      MARY
          But I'd never forgive myself if
          something happened to Melvin.

                      KARL
          Stop upsetting my daughter, Helen.
          She's been through quite enough
          already.
                      MARY
          It's not her fault, Daddy. We're all
          a little on edge.

Just then the living room door opens and the pony tailed
Nicholas Andre ENTERS. He looks appropriately solemn.

                      ANDRE
          Has there been any word, Mr. Swanson?

                      KARL
          Nothing yet, Nicholas.

Andre looks upset.

                      ANDRE
          Perhaps I should call off the
          Preservation benefit this weekend.

                                                           39.

IT WOULD BE EASY ENOUGH TO RE-

schedule.

                        HELEN
            No, Nicholas, it's imperative that
            we carry on as usual.

The atmosphere in the room couldn't be more somber. Karl
Swanson holds his hand out to his aughter.

                        KARL
            Don't worry, sweetheart. I'll do
            everything they ask. Nothing's going
            to happen to Melvin, I promise you.

                        MARY
            Thank you, Daddy.

Karl Swanson looks out the window, concerned.

                                                     CUT TO:

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

The black Cadillac pulls over to the side of the road. Joe
Mental gets out of the car and props the hood open. He takes
out his gun, SLIDES IN A NEW CLIP, and puts it back in his
pocket.

                        MENTAL
                (to Shay)
            Lie down on the front seat. After
            they pick me up I want you to follow
            us.
Then he folds his arms and the two killers wait for the van
to come along.

Lloyd taps Harry's shoulder.

                         LLOYD
            You're it.

Harry taps Lloyd back.

                         HARRY
            You're it.

Lloyd immediately taps Harry.

                                                           40.

                      LLOYD
          You're it. Quitsies.

                      HARRY
              (tapping him back)
          Anti-quitsies. You're it. Quitsies.
          No anti-quitsies. No startsies.

Lloyd shakes his head, defeated.

                      LLOYD
          Damn, you're good, Harry.
              (beat)
          Hey, didn't I tell you this trip
          would be a blast?

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

Joe Mental squints down the road, sees the Mutt Cutts van
approaching, and starts WAVING HIS HANDS to flag them down.

INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN

Through the windshield we can see Mental waving. The guys
don't slow down, through. The just WAVE BACK as they BLOW
RIGHT BY HIM. Harry also toots the horn, which makes the

SOUND OF A DOG BARKING.

                      LLOYD
          See, I told you these country folks
          were friendly, Harry.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

As an angry Mental watches them disappear down the road,
Shay sits up in the front seat.

                      SHAY
          What happened?

                      MENTAL
          These fuckers are really pissing me
          off now.

                                                     CUT TO:

EXT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - LATER THAT DAY

We hear The Zombie's 'Time of the Season' as the van flashes
by.

INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - DAY

                      HARRY
          Refresh my memory on something, Lloyd:
          what exactly do we do when we get to
          Aspen?

                      LLOYD
          Well the first thing we do is take a
          good deep breath of that famous
          Aspenese air.

                        HARRY
          Fresh, huh?

                      LLOYD
          The freshest. They say on any day of
          the week you can smell a moose-fart
          ten miles away.

                        HARRY
                (sincere)
          Wow... talk about paradise.
                (beat)
          And after we're finished breathing,
          what next, Lloyd?

                      LLOYD
          Then we make a splash on the social
          scene.

Just then, Lloyd notices something up the road.

                      LLOYD (CONT'D)
          Harry, look the golden arches. Pull
          over, I'm starving.

The Mutt Cutt car is at the drive-through window.

                        MCDONALD'S EMPLOYEE
          ...That's two cheese burgers, two fries,
          and two medium Cokes. Five seventy-
          two.

Harry hands a ten-dollar-bill to the Employee, who returns a
handful of change.

                        HARRY
          Thanks.

                                                           42.

Then, before he can  give them   the bag of food, the guys
absentmindedly DRIVE  OFF. As   they pull out of the parking
lot, the McDonald's  Employee   sticks his head out the window
and WAVES THE BAG OF  FOOD at   them.

                       MCDONALD'S EMPLOYEE
           Hey!

But the guys are already around the corner.

The Mutt Cutt van is on the road again, cruising along.

           About this social scene how do you
           expect a couple mutts like us to
           make a splash in the land of pedigrees
           when we don't even have any money?

                       LLOYD
           Look, once we drop the briefcase off
           to Mary, she'll be so grateful she'll
           plug us right into the party circuit.
           After that, we do a little of the

rubbers, and walk out of there in the spring with enough
business connections to open a first-class worm operation.
You see, you don't get rich working, Harry. You get rich
knowing the rich.
                       HARRY
           Where'd you hear that?

                       LLOYD
           Some bum down at unemployment.

Harry thinks about this.

                       HARRY
           I don't know, Lloyd.

                       LLOYD
           What's the matter?

                       HARRY
           Money does terrible things to people.
           I mean, we could lose our friendship.

                                                          43.

Lloyd thinks about this.

                        LLOYD
          Yeah? So?

Harry nods and looks out the window. Suddenly SOMETHING DAWNS
ON LLOYD.

                      LLOYD (CONT'D)
          Hey, wait a second. Hold everything.

                        HARRY
          What?

                      LLOYD
          Aren't you forgetting something?

Harry thinks about this.

                      LLOYD (CONT'D)
          Back at Mickey D's? A little matter
          you might've overlooked...?

Harry wracks his brain, but to no avail.

                        HARRY
          What?

Lloyd rolls his eyes.

                        LLOYD
          My change.

As a sheepish Harry gives Lloyd his change, they notice
something up ahead.
HARRY & LLOYD'S POV - ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, JOE MENTAL IS
WAVING THEM

DOWN AGAIN. This time the Cadillac is PARKED SIDEWAYS ACROSS
THE ROAD,

BLOCKING THEIR PATH.

                      HARRY
          I think this guy's in trouble. Why
          on't you pull over.

Lloyd looks at Harry. Harry remembers that he's driving. He
pulls the car to the side of the road. Mental approaches the
passenger window.

                                                           44.

                      MENTAL
          You guys going as far as Des Moines?
          My car died and I'm late for a
          business meeting.

INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - DAY

They're back on the highway and Joe Mental is SITTING BETWEEN
THEM, looking extremely ANNOYED. The guys are in the middle
of an argument.

                      HARRY
          It's a fruit.

                      LLOYD
          It's a vegetable.

                      HARRY
          I'm telling you, it's a fruit.

                      LLOYD
          And I happen to know it's a vegetable.

                      HARRY
          Tell you what, why don't we leet an
          impartial judge decide.

                      LLOYD
          Fine with me.

Harry turns to Joe Mental.

                      HARRY
          Hey, Mr. Mentalino, settle our bet:
          Are jelly beans fruits or vegetables?

Mental grits his teeth as he pops a few antacid pills in his
mouth. He reaches into his coat pocket and we see a GLINT OF
STEEL. Just when he's about to pull the gun out, though,
Lloyd hits the breaks and SKIDS to a stop beside a bunch of
hitchhiking MIGRANT WORKERS.

INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - LATER

The trio have picked up SIX MIGRANT WORKERS and everyone is
crammed into the car including a CRYING BABY who sits on a
pissed-off Mental's lap. Someone's playing a FLAMENCO GUITAR
and the gang is SINGING a SPANISH SONG.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

                                                            45.

INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - LATER STILL

The Migrant Family is gone now. Harry and Lloyd are playing
a game while Mental stares straight ahead, furious. His eyes
are watering and he looks ill.

                      LLOYD
          Okay, Harry, my turn. Let 'er rip.

Harry lifts a cheer and lets out a LOUD FART. Lloyd SNIFFS a
few times, then closes his eyes and WAFTS it up toward his
nostrils, as if it was the aroma of a fine wine.

                        LLOYD (CONT'D)
          Hmmm... full-bodied, delicate bouquet,
          aged to perfection will rip no fart
          before it's time.
              (beat)
          Come on, Marquis of Dingleberry's
          rules: you got ten seconds. All right.
          I'll say: cheese doodles, chili dog
          extra onions, garden salad with blue...

                         HARRY
          And...?

                         LLOYD
          Kit-Kat bar.

Harry throws up his arms, defeated. He hands Lloyd a buck.

                      HARRY
          You're the best, man.
              (beat)
          Okay, my turn.
                      LLOYD
          Where are your manners, Harry? We
          have a guest.

Harry punches Mental's shoulder playfully.

                      HARRY
          Come on, Mr. Mentalino. Let one fly.
          It's only a buck.

EXT. DANTE'S INFERNO CAFÉ - LATE AFTERNOON

A large neon road sign beside the café shows a man's
exasperated face with FLAMES SHOOTING FROM HIS NOSE, MOUTH
AND EARS. The sign advertises: HOTTEST CHILI

                                                        46.

PEPPERS NORTH OF THE BORDER.

INT. DANTE'S INFERNO

Lloyd and Harry are sitting at a table with a hateful Joe
Mental. The boys are each holding up a

POINTED RED CHILI PEPPER.

                      HARRY
          I'll do one if you will.

                      LLOYD
          Okay, you go first.

                      HARRY
          No, you go first.

                      LLOYD
          No, you go first.

                      MENTAL
          Why don't you both stop being a couple
          of pussies and go at the same time.
          It ain't that hot.

Lloyd and Harry exchange a look, then simultaneously BITE
INTO THE PEPPERS.

                      LLOYD
          Hmmm, not bad...

                      HARRY
          Yeah, more tingly than hot.

Suddenly the boys' EYES LIGHT UP. THEY LET OUT A SHRIEK. A
smile begins to curl on Mental's lips. He pours them a couple
glasses of water from a pitcher.

                      MENTAL
          Have some water. It'll help.

Lloyd and Harry who are both sweating profusely now start
to GULP down their water. This, of course, makes it burn
more.

                      MENTAL (CONT'D)
          Aw, shucks, that's right. Water just
          makes it worse...

The boys run to the bar and DUMP PITCHERS OF WATER ON THEIR
HEADS, much to the elight of a CHUCKLING Joe Mental.

                                                     CUT TO:

EXT. DANTE'S INFERNO - DAY

Mental is on the phone outside the front door TALKING to
Nicholas Andre.

INTERCUT CONVERSATION

                      MENTAL
          It's Mental. I'm just sitting down
          to a nice meal with our boys.

                      ANDRE
          Good work. What did you find out so
          far?

                      MENTAL
          Nothing yet, but I'm gonna shake 'em
          own for information at lunch.
              (beat)
          Then I'm gonna kill 'em for dessert.

                      ANDRE
          Well eat fast, time's running out.

And whatever you do, don't let them get any closer. I don't
need them here running around Aspen.

Mental pulls a BLACK VIAL OF PILLS out of his jacket.

                      MENTAL
          Relax, they ain't gonna be running
          around anywhere after I dump a little
          cyanide in their pops.

INT. DANTE'S INFERNO - DAY
Back at the table, the boys are soaked and HUFFING as if
they just finished the Boston Marathon. The burgers have
been served, but Lloyd and Harry are still too traumatized
to touch them.

                      HARRY
          That really wasn't very polite of
          him, was it? Maybe we should loosen
          the screws of his chair.

                      LLOYD
          Harry Dunne, I'm surprised at you.
          Perhaps it's about time you brushed

UP ON A LITTLE TOME THAT WE GOD-

fearing adults call the Bible. It's crammed with all kinds
of pithy rules to live your life by.

                                                        48.

                      HARRY
              (humbled)
          You mean like 'turn the other cheek?'

                      LLOYD
          No, I mean like 'an eye for an eye.'
          Hand me those peppers the atomic
          ones.

Harry passes the jar and the two of them LOAD JOE MENTAL'S
BURGER WITH CHILI

PEPPERS, EXPERTLY CAMOUFLAGING THEM WITH LETTUCE.

                      HARRY
              (whispering)
          Here he comes.

Lloyd and Harry bite into their food as Joe Mental sits back
down at the table.

                      MENTAL
          Feeling any better, boys?

As he pours ketchup on his burger, the guys glance at each
other and TITTER. Then he picks it up and brings it to his
mouth. Just before biting into it, though, he PAUSES.

                      MENTAL (CONT'D)
          So tell me, why you fellas headed to
          Aspen? Vacation?

                      LLOYD
          More like re-location.

Mental starts toward the burger but stops again.
                      MENTAL
          Doesn't look like you packed much.
          All I saw was a couple bags... and
          that briefcase.

                      HARRY
          The briefcase isn't even ours. Some
          lady just left it at the airport.
          We're bringing it back to her.

This is news to Mental.

                      MENTAL
          You mean you don't even know her?

                      LLOYD
          Not really. I was just her limo river.

                                                               49.

Mental looks at the two of them and realizes that they're
serious. Then he BREAKS OUT

LAUGHING.

                        MENTAL
            Talk about being in the wrong place
            at the wrong time...

Lloyd and Harry share a     confused look. Mental shakes his
head and BITES INTO HIS     BURGER, CHEWING HEARTILY. Almost
immediately, his happy     demeanor is replaced by a LOOK OF
HORROR. His FACE TURNS     RED, HE GRABS HIS STOMACH AND FALLS
TO THE

GROUND, GASPING.

The boys look at each other guiltily, then bend down to help
him.

                        HARRY
            Hey, you okay, man? It was just a
            goof.

                          MENTAL
                (STRAINED WHISPER)
            My ulcer... quick... pills... in my coat...

Harry checks Mental's coat pocket        for his antacid pills but
unwittingly brings out the BLACK        OF CYANIDE PILLS. He shakes
some pills out and hands them to        Mental, who tosses them in
his mouth and starts to MUNCH on        them.

For a moment, he appears to improve. His BREATHING SLOWS and
he sits up. Then his EYES
LIGHT UP.

                                                        50.

                      LLOYD
          Life is a fragile thing, Har. One
          minute you're chewing on a burger;
          the next minute you're dead meat.

                      HARRY
          But he blamed me. You heard him.
          Those were his last words.

                      LLOYD
          If you don't count that gurgling
          sound.

Harry lets out a GROAN.

                      LLOYD (CONT'D)
          Hey, relax, man, I'm just as
          responsible as you are we both
          slipped him the peppers and look at
          me, I on't feel guilty at all.

                      HARRY
          Small comfort coming from a man who
          sells dead birds to blind kids.
              (SIGHS)
          Don't you get it, Lloyd. I've got a
          ead guy pissed at me. His restless
          spirit will probably haunt me for
          the next seventy-five years.

                      LLOYD
          That's ridiculous. You probably won't
          live to see forty.

Harry perks up, cheered by this thought.

          ...My official conclusion is that the
          eceased expired from oxygen eprivation
          caused by the presence of cyanide in
          the bloodstream.

                      DT. DALE
          You mean he was poisoned?

                      DOCTOR
          Unquestionably. We found these by

He holds up the container of cyanide pills. Dt. Dale nods
and approaches another COP in the b.g.

          Waitress says he was with a couple
          of younger guys. They're the ones

Dale frowns at this and the Cop shrugs.

          Yes, sir. They were driving an '84

We hear MUFFLED HUMAN WHIMPERING coming from deep within the
well. Andre walks to the edge of the dark hole.

                      ANDRE
          How you doing today, Melvin?

                                                         54.

Andre takes a hit off his cigarette and flicks it into the
well.

                                                     CUT TO:

EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

The Mutt Cutts van cruises down the lonely interstate.

INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - NIGHT

Lloyd is now FAST ASLEEP in the passenger seat as Harry drives
on. A roadsign reading DENVER - 602 MILES whizzes by. Todd
Rundgren's "Too Far Gone" begins to play while Harry peers
at the empty highway INTROSPECTIVELY. As the song plays we
see a series of quick shots:

A new sign says DENVER - 421 MILES. Lloyd is still asleep
with his feet now on Harry's lap.

Another sign reads DENVER - 201 MILES. Harry stares straight
ahead, practically catatonic. Lloyd's feet are out the window
and his head is on Harry's lap.

The next roadsign says DENVER - 157 MILES. Lloyd's feet are
now up over the headrest and his head is down where his feet
should be. Harry looks on the verge of blacking out.

Finally, a sign reads COLORADO STATE LINE - 25 MILES/FOOD,
GAS NEXT EXIT.

EXT. TRUCK STOP - 2:10 IN THE MORNING

The Mutt Cutts van pulls up to a gas pump. In the background
are several tractor-trailer rigs and a café. Harry climbs
out, thoroughly exhausted, walks around and opens the
passenger door.

Lloyd tumbles to the asphalt, STILL ASLEEP. Harry nudges him
with his foot.

                      HARRY
          Come on, wake up. You pay, I'll pump.

Lloyd comes to and grudgingly pulls himself up to his feet.

EXT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - NIGHT

Harry moves to the back of the poodle van. He has to LIFT
ONE OF THE CAR'S REAR LEGS to unscrew the gas cap. Then he
sticks the nozzle in and starts to fill her up.

                                                          55.

EXT. GAS STATION MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

Lloyd comes around the   corner, dragging a BATHROOM KEY
ATTACHED BY A CHAIN TO   A CAR ENGINE toward the Men's Room.
When he gets it to the   door, he struggles to lift the engine
on it's side, finally   managing to slip the key into the lock.

EXT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - NIGHT

Harry is yawning as he pumps the gas. Suddenly a Jeep Cherokee
pulls up and a long-legged, tanned, ATHLETIC BEAUTY climbs
out. This seems to wake Harry up.

The Athletic Beauty   smiles at Harry as she grabs a pump and
starts to fill her   jeep. Harry makes a feeble attempt to
brush his hair into   place, then CLEARS HIS THROAT and nods
to the skis on her   roof-rack.

                         HARRY
          Skis, huh?

                      ATHLETIC BEAUTY
          That's right.

                         HARRY
          Great.

She continues to pump gas.

                         HARRY (CONT'D)
          They yours?

                         ATHLETIC BEAUTY
          Uh-huh..

                         HARRY
          Both of 'em?

                         ATHLETIC BEAUTY
          Um, yeah.

                      HARRY
              (impressed)
          Cool.

THE GAS FROM HARRY'S NOZZLE STARTS TO OVERFLOW, BUT HE DOESN'T
NOTICE. FROM HER POV IT LOOKS

like a BIG DOG IS PISSING ON HIS LEG.

                      ATHLETIC BEAUTY
          Excuse me, you're spraying everywhere.

                                                           56.

Harry turns to see the gas GUSHING ALL OVER HIS SHOES. He
immediately removes the nozzle and replaces it on the pump
as she smiles to herself.

INT. GAS STATION MEN'S ROOM

Lloyd is standing in a stall urinating. He starts to read
the graffiti scrawled on the wall. Finally, he comes to one
that says: FOR A GOOD TIME, MEET ME HERE NOVEMBER 8, 1993,
2:15

A.M. SHARP.

He frowns at this, then looks nervously at his watch.

CLOSE UP OF DIAL - the date reads NOVEMBER 8.

ZOOM IN on the minute hand as it CLICKS TO EXACTLY 2:15.

Just as a concerned look crosses Lloyd's face, we hear the
BATHROOM DOOR SQUEAK OPEN AND SLAM SHUT! Terrified, Lloyd
quickly locks the stall door, then crouches on the toilet
bowl so his feet aren't visible. The sound of HEAVY FOOTSTEPS
approaches the stall and then stops. Lloyd looks down to see
a pair of SIZE 16 WORKBOOTS beneath the door. We can barely
hear a LOW GROWL. Then the stall handle JIGGLES. Lloyd holds
his breath. The ominous boots MOVE AWAY and Lloyd lets out a
SIGH OF RELIEF.

All of a sudden the DOOR IS KICKED IN, AND A TOWERING FIGURE
STEPS INTO FRAME. Lloyd looks up and GASPS.

HIS POV - it's the Redneck trucker, Sea Bass.

                      SEA BASS
          Well, well, well, if it ain't my old
          friend.
              (checks watch)
          And right on time...

As Sea Bass STEPS INTO THE STALL, we

                                                        CUT TO:

EXT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - NIGHT

The Athletic Beauty is back in her Jeep now and Harry has
sidled up to the driver's side. He leans against her side-
view mirror.

                                                           57.

                      HARRY
              (re: suitcases in
               back seat)
          That's a lot of luggage for a little
          vacation.

                      ATHLETIC BEAUTY
          Actually, I'm moving to Aspen. I've
          got to get away from my boyfriend.

He's such a klutz. My astrologer told me I should avoid
accident-prone guys.

Just then, the side-view mirror Harry has been leaning on
SNAPS OFF THE CAR. HE CRACKS

HIS HEAD AGAINST THE WINDSHIELD, FALLS TO THE GROUND, THEN
QUICKLY LEAPS TO HIS FEET AS IF NOTHING HAPPENED.

                      HARRY
              (holding out mirror)
          Here, this is a little loose.

She throws the mirror into the back seat and takes out a
cigarette.

                        HARRY (CONT'D)
          Allow me...

He pulls out a match and lights it with a debonair flourish.
The Athletic Beauty nods her thanks. Harry tosses the match
to the ground, and we hear an O.S. WHOOSH! Wisps of smokes
rise around him and we hear the LOW CRACKLE OF SOMETHING
BURNING. (Neither of them notice this.)

                      HARRY (CONT'D)
          Look, um, maybe when I get to Aspen
          we can meet up... you know, for hot
          chocolate or something.

She looks him over and smiles.

                      ATHLETIC BEAUTY
          Why not? You seem pretty harmless.
          I'll give you my number. Just let me
          find a pen.

As she starts to rummage through her purse, Harry SMELLS THE
SMOKE. He looks down and sees that his RIGHT SHOE IS ABLAZE!
He shakes it, then tries to put it out with the other shoe,
but to no avail. Meanwhile, the Athletic Beauty is still
searching for a pen.

                                                        58.

                      ATHLETIC BEAUTY (CONT'D)
          I know I have one here somewhere...

Harry starts doing a soft-shoe dance to extinguish the flames.
This only helps to fan them.

                      HARRY
              (urgently)
          Look, why don't you just tell it to
          me, I've got a good memory.

                      ATHLETIC BEAUTY
          Are you sure you won't forget?

                      HARRY
              (desperate)
          Positive please hurry.

He begins hopping around violently.

                      ATHLETIC BEAUTY
          Is something wrong?

Harry shakes his head no as he bites his lip to keep from
screaming.

                      ATHLETIC BEAUTY (CONT'D)
          Okay, my number is 652-2553.
              (beat)
          Oh, wait a second, that's my old
          number. It's so funny how your mind
          god sakes, give me the damn number!

She's taken aback by this outburst.

                      ATHLETIC BEAUTY (CONT'D)
          Look, man, if you're gonna get pushy
          you can just forget it!

She throws the car into drive and PEELS AWAY.

INT. GAS STATION MEN'S ROOM

Sea Bass has his meaty paw wrapped around Lloyd's neck as he
slides him up the wall of the toilet stall.

                      SEA BASS
          First I'm gonna rape you, then I'm
          gonna kill you. Any last request?

                      LLOYD
          Um, yeah could you do it the other
          way around?

                                                           59.

Sea Bass pushes Lloyd to his knees. Then the trucker steps
back and UNDOES HIS FLY. The sound of the zipper brings a
green color to Lloyd's face.

ON THE MEN'S ROOM DOOR - it bursts open and a FLAME-FOOTED
Harry rushes into the bathroom, panic-stricken. In his
desperation he PLOWS THROUGH THE STALL DOOR KNOCKING SEA
BASS ON THE HEAD and thrusts his flaming foot into the
toilet,

EXTINGUISHING THE FIRE.

Harry breathes a DEEP SIGH of relief. Only then does he notice
LLOYD ON HIS KNEES AND

SEA BASS UNCONSCIOUS ON THE FLOOR WITH HIS PANTS UNDONE.

Harry has to do a DOUBLE-TAKE for this to sink in. Then he
lets out an admonishing

WHISTLE.

                       HARRY
           You've got some serious explaining
           to o, young man.

           Look, Harry, I told you what happened,
           now drop it.
                       HARRY
           Sure thing, Lloyd. I promise not to
           mention another word about you being
           in a bathroom stall with a six-foot,
           five-inch trucker with his pants
           own.

                       LLOYD
           That's a low blow, man.

                       HARRY
           Not at that height it's not.

                       LLOYD
           Listen, bud, if you're trying to
           imply that I'm that thought look,
           we're almost in Colorado.

                                                         60.

LLOYD SQUINTS THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD. A SIGN UP AHEAD SAYS:
LAST EXIT IN NEBRASKA -

COLORADO STATE LINE - 3 MILES.

                      HARRY
          I think it's about   time we pull over
          and change seats.   I've been driving
          for nine straight   hours I  don't
          have the energy to   start a new state.

Lloyd nods, and as he pulls off the exit, we

                                                      CUT TO:

CLOSE ON A SIGN - it reads WELCOME  TO COLORADO, HOME OF THE
ROCKY MOUNTAINS. PAN DOWN to reveal  a number of POLICEMEN
stopping and checking cars as they  cross the border. A
HELICOPTER lands on the side of the  road and Detective Dale
hops out. He hurries to the COP in  charge.

                      DT. DALE
          Any sign of them yet?

                      COP
          No, but we're expecting them shortly.
          A motorist said he spotted a pooch
          about thirty miles back headed this
          way.

Detective Dale nods, satisfied.

The door opens and Lloyd gets in carrying a bag of Doritos
and a soda. He settles into the driver's seat and pulls a
Beef Jerky out of his back pocket.

                      LLOYD
          Hey, I picked you up a Beef Jerky...

When he gets no response, he notices that Harry is already
fast asleep in the passenger seat. Lloyd shakes his head.

                      LLOYD (CONT'D)
          Boy, some guys just weren't cut out
          for life on the road.

Lloyd starts the engine and    pulls out of the parking lot to
the nearby freeway entrance.    As he enters the on-ramp, we
ZOOM IN on a sign that says:    ROUTE 80 - EAST. He's unwittingly
headed BACK IN THE DIRECTION    THEY JUST CAME FROM!

INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - SUNNY MORNING

It's bright daylight now. Harry is sleeping peacefully in
the passenger seat while Lloyd sips a coffee. The van hits a
bump which causes Harry's eyes to flutter open.

                      LLOYD
          Hey, Mr. Sleepy Head, welcome back.

                       HARRY
              (groggy)
          How long have I been out?

                      LLOYD
          I'd say a good five hours, anyway.

Harry yawns and stretches.

                      HARRY
          Great. We must be getting real close,
          huh?

                      LLOYD
          Should be. I've been averaging about
          ninety miles an hour all night.

                       HARRY
          Good man.

                      LLOYD
          Boy, I'll tell you, this is one
          angerous highway. You wouldn't believe
          all the road pizza two dead ogs, a
          couple of rabbits, a snake and some
          big thing I couldn't even recognize.

                      HARRY
          That's awful. Did you see them get
          hit or were they already lying there?

                       LLOYD
          I hit 'em.

Harry rubs his eyes and looks at the passing FLATLANDS.

                                                           62.

                      HARRY
          Funny. I expected the Rocky Mountains
          to be a little rockier than this.

                      LLOYD
          I was thinking the same thing. That
          John Denver's some full of shit,
          huh?

They both stare out the window.

                      LLOYD (CONT'D)
          I must say, Des Moines sure is a
          pretty little town.

                      HARRY
          Yeah, it really is.
              (beat)
          Wait a minute when did you visit
          Des Moines?

                      LLOYD
          Last night. We drove through it.

                      HARRY
          What are you talking about? You were
          snoring like a baby when we went
          through Des Moines.

Lloyd shakes his head in amusement, then SNAPS HIS FINGERS
in Harry's face.

                       LLOYD
              (sing-song)
          Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Rise and
          shine.
              (LAUGHS)
          You were the one who was asleep,

numbskull. Here, take a sip of coffee. You're delirious.

A confused Harry sips the coffee and checks out the passing
terrain. Then something starts to awn on him. Slowly.

                      HARRY
          Uh, Lloyd, refresh my memory: Doesn't
          the sun rise in the east and set in
          the west?

                      LLOYD
          In our country it does, yes.

                                                        63.

                      HARRY
          Then perchance you can explain to me
          why the sun is in our face at 7:30
          in the morning when we're heading
          west.

Lloyd thinks about this and then looks SICKENED.

EXT. TRUCKSTOP - MORNING

The Mutt Cutts van is parked next to a couple rigs and Harry
is sitting beside it on the pavement, a BROKEN man.

                      LLOYD
          I'm only human, Harry. Anybody can
          make a mistake.

But Harry just sits there, practically catatonic.

                      LLOYD (CONT'D)
          Come on, man, pull yourself together.

                      HARRY
          You know, I got half a mind to just
          jump on the bus to Europe and say
          goodbye to your ugly mug forever.

                      LLOYD
              (rolls his eyes)
          You can't take a bus to Europe, dodo.

                      HARRY
          Oh yeah? Why not?
                      LLOYD
          You don't have a passport.

Harry lets out a defeated SIGH.

                      LLOYD (CONT'D)
          Come on, stop being a baby about
          this. Okay, so we back-tracked a
          tad.

                      HARRY
          A tad? Lloyd, you drove almost a
          sixth of the way across the country
          in the wrong direction. Now we don't
          have enough money to get to Aspen,
          we on't have enough money to get
          home, we don't have enough to eat,
          we don't have enough to sleep!

                                                           64.

                      LLOYD
          Well it doesn't do any good having
          you sitting there on your butt whining
          about it. If we're gonna get out of
          this hole, we're gonna have to dig
          ourselves out.

Harry thinks about this.

                      HARRY
          You know, you're absolutely right,
          Lloyd.

He stands up, brushes off his pants, and starts to walk toward
the highway.

                      LLOYD
          Where you going?

                      HARRY
          Home. I'm walking home.

                      LLOYD
          You can't be serious.

                      HARRY
              (sarcastic)
          Why not? We're probably only five
          miles away.

Harry starts resolutely toward the road while Lloyd watches.

                      LLOYD
              (CALLING OUT)
          Thanks a lot, Mr. Perfect. Like you
          never screwed up.
Harry suddenly STOPS IN HIS TRACKS and turns back to his
friend. He seems completely rained.

                        HARRY
          Look, man... I'm sorry.
              (beat)
          I never should have let you talk me
          into this in the first place. You've
          got a good reason to goo a beautiful
          girl's waiting for you. But let's
          face it, Lloyd, there's nothing
          waiting for me in Aspen.
              (beat)
          There's nothing waiting for me
          anywhere.

                                                         65.

Lloyd just stands there, SPEECHLESS, as Harry turns and walks
away. Out of frustration, he BANGS the snout of the car,
causing it to BARK.

                                                      CUT TO:

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

Harry is walking down the highway, his thumb stuck out
unenthusiastically. A few cars WHIZ by, the cold wind whipping
at his clothes.

A station wagon blows by and throws a BAG  OF GARBAGE out the
window. It lands at Harry's feet. EXTREME  CLOSE-UP OF HARRY'S
FACE - a TEAR slowly rolls down his cheek  (like the Indian
in the commercial). PAN DOWN to the bag of  garbage. We see
it's a BAG OF ONIONS that's ripped open.

Suddenly a HEARSE pulls up and stops. It's an ominous-looking
vehicle and Harry hesitates. Then the passenger window rolls
down, revealing a contrite Lloyd at the wheel.

                      LLOYD
          Got room for one more, if you still
          want to go to Aspen.

Harry looks the hearse over.

                      HARRY
          Where'd you find this baby?

                      LLOYD
          Used car dealer. I   traded the van
          for it. Plus I got   the guy to throw
          in fifty bucks for   gas money.
              (beat)
          Come on, man, what   do you say? We
          still partners?

An impatient Detective Dale is still staked-out at the
Colorado border with several other officers.

          It doesn't make sense. They should've
          been here hours ago.

                      COP
          Maybe they're smarter than we thought.

          How smart can they be? They're riving
          a goddamn dog!

Another COP rushes over holding his walkie-talkie.

                      COP #2
          We just got a report that they were
          spotted about two hours ago heading
          east near Des Moines on I-80.

                      DT. DALE
              (incredulous)
          Des Moines?! Why that's five hundred
          miles from here!

                      COP #1
          Guess they got wind of our welcoming
          party.

                      DT. DALE
          We're wasting time. Let's mobilize.

Dt. Dale heads for his cruiser while the other Cops follow.

INT. HEARSE - DAY

Lloyd is driving and Harry has his feet out the window.

                      LLOYD
          Tell me something, Harry. Would you
          really have kept going home if I
hadn't come back to get you?

                      HARRY
          Well let me put it this way, Lloyd:
          Do you remember when we were Cub
          Scouts and we got lost in the woods
          uring that blizzard? We huddled
          together all night, and we made an
          oath that if we ever got out of there
          alive we'd never ever leave each
          other's side again. Do you remember
          that?

Lloyd thinks hard about this.

                      LLOYD
          We were never Cub Scouts.

                                                        67.

                      HARRY
          Exactly.

Just then several COP CARS whiz by them in the opposite
direction with SIRENS BLARING and LIGHTS FLASHING. When Harry
glances back at the cop cars, he notices that there's a COFFIN
in the rear of the vehicle.

                      HARRY (CONT'D)
          What the hell is this? There's a
          coffin in the back!

                      LLOYD
          Relax, it's empty.

                      HARRY
          I don't give a shit. I'm not driving
          anywhere with a casket. You know I'm
          superstitious calm down. We'll dump
          it off first chance we get.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

Harry and Lloyd are swerving through traffic in the hearse.
Ahead of them is a REAL FUNERAL PROCESSION. The lead car is
a CADILLAC.

INT. CADILLAC (LEAD CAR) - DAY

(This is the car right behind the funeral hearse.) A MAN and
a WOMAN are arguing.

                      WOMAN
          I married a cheapskate.

                      MAN
          Shut your trap, Gerdie.

                      WOMAN
          I'm so embarrassed. I'll never be
          able to show my face again.

                      MAN
          I knew something good would come out
          of this.

                      WOMAN
          We could have given him a more
          ignified burial.

                                                           68.

                      MAN
          Your uncle was a cheap man. Remember
          what he got us for our twenty-fifth?
          A friggin' fern. There's no way I'm
          gonna spend a load to get him planted.

While the couple ARGUES ON, Harry and Lloyd cut in front of
them. The Man and the Woman on't notice this an soon the
ENTIRE FUNERAL PROCESSION IS UNWITTINGLY

FOLLOWING THE WRONG HEARSE.

Harry and Lloyd pull up to a large green dumpster behind the
market. The procession comes to a halt behind them. The guys
get out of the hearse and remove the coffin from the back.
Then they unceremoniously HEAVE THE COFFIN INTO THE DUMPSTER
AND WIPE THEIR HANDS

OFF.

ON THE LEAD CAR OF THE PROCESSION - The Woman's jaw is
practically on the floor.

                      WOMAN

The boys stroll down the sidewalk, looking in the windows,
studying the passersby, taking in the sights and sounds of
the ski town.

                      LLOYD
          Isn't this wonderful? What more could
          a couple of single guys like us ask
          for?

                      HARRY
          How about food and shelter?

                      LLOYD
          You're so materialistic.
              (beat)
          Why don't we get down to business
          and eliver the briefcase to Mary.
          Who knows, maybe she'll invite us in
          for tea and a strumpet or two?

                      HARRY
          Jolly good idea, chap. And where oes
          the lovely young lady reside?

                        LLOYD
          Um... good question.

Harry throws Lloyd a concerned look, but then notices a phone
booth next to them.

                      HARRY
          Well what's her last name? We'll
          look it up in the phone book.

                        LLOYD
          Hmmmm... You know, I don't believe I
          caught that either.

Harry's concern grows.
                      HARRY
          What about the briefcase, Lloyd?
          There must've been a name on it,
          right?

                      LLOYD
              (brightening)
          Come to think of it, there is. It's
          engraved right into the leather.

                         HARRY
          What is it?

                       LLOYD
          Samsonite   spelled just like it
          sounds.

                                                           70.

Harry starts flipping through the phone book. Then abruptly
HE STOPS and puts the book down, a DEFEATED look on his face.

                                                     CUT TO:

INT. HEARSE - NIGHT

The car is parked in a parking lot across the street from a
picturesque bridge. Harry and Lloyd are shivering in the
front seat as a LOUD, ICY WIND WHIPS though the hearse.
They're each spooning something out of a coffee cup and
sipping it.

                      HARRY
          Any soup left?

                      LLOYD
          A little. Shall we share it?

                      HARRY
          Please.

Lloyd opens a TINY KETCHUP PACKET and squirts half of it
into Harry's cup and the other half into his. They pour a
few drops of water in and mix it with their spoons.

                      LLOYD
          Mmmm mmmm good...

Lloyd smiles bravely at Harry. Harry notices something and
leans toward him.

                       HARRY
          Hey, you got something stuck in your
          front teeth.
Lloyd picks a small speck out of his mouth and studies it.

                        LLOYD
          Hmmm... looks like an old piece of
          Beef Jerky.

HARRY STARES AT IT. THEN:

                      HARRY
          Wanna split it?

                      LLOYD
          You're pathetic. Get your own.

Loyd puts the floss-meat back in his mouth and chews it.
Another gust of wind swirls around them.

                                                         71.

                      HARRY
          I'm freezing my ass off, Lloyd.

                      LLOYD
          Roll up your window.

                      HARRY
          It is rolled up.

                      LLOYD
          Then I guess the damn anti-cold system
          isn't working. You really should get
          it fixed if we're gonna live here
          all winter.

                      HARRY
          What anti-cold system?

Lloyd points to the dash.

                      LLOYD
          Right here the A/C button. I put it
          on full blast about an hour ago and,
          if anything, the car's getting colder.

Harry stares at Lloyd and then throws down his cup, disgusted.
He opens the car door and starts to climb out.

                      LLOYD (CONT'D)
          What are you going out there for?

                        HARRY
          To warm up.

EXT. HEARSE - NIGHT
Harry gets out and leans against the car with his arms
crossed. Lloyd comes from around the other side.

                      LLOYD
          What are you worrying about now?

                      HARRY
          I'm worried about how you're gonna
          survive the pummeling I'm about to
          give you.

                        LLOYD
          Huh?

Suddenly Harry LUNGES at Lloyd, who takes off around the
other side of the car. Harry leaps across the hood, but Lloyd
manages to evade his grasp.

                                                           72.

                      LLOYD (CONT'D)
          Harry, calm down! You're acting like
          a wild animal!

                      HARRY
          Get over here and take your medicine,
          Lloyd!

                      LLOYD
          Sorry, doc, I can't take medicine.
          I'm a Christian Scientist!

Lloyd continues to outrun him around the car. Frustrated,
Harry opens the car and PULLS THE

BRIEFCASE OUT.

                      LLOYD (CONT'D)
          What are you doing?

                      HARRY
          Something I should've done a long
          time ago. This stupid thing has been
          the root of our problems all along.

Harry starts walking toward the bridge spanning a river.

                      LLOYD
          Don't do anything foolish, Harry.

                      HARRY
          Foolish? This is the most sensible
          thing I've done in years. I'm gonna
          toss this goddamn curse right into
          that river.
Lloyd starts to follow after Harry.

                      LLOYD
          You're making a big mistake, Harry!
          I'll never forgive you for this!

Harry keeps marching toward the bridge, determined to dispose
of the briefcase.

                      LLOYD (CONT'D)
          Harry, hold up! Things are gonna get
          better, I promise! In fact, I think

I feel another piece of Beef Jerky in my left molar! It's
yours, Harry, all yours!

Harry stops in his tracks, intrigued.

                                                           73.

                      HARRY
          You're bluffing.

                      LLOYD
          No I'm not, man look.

Lloyd pulls his cheek back, revealing a molar. Harry squints
at it.

                      HARRY
          That's a filling, you liar!

Just then, Lloyd makes a dash at Harry. Harry turns and runs,
but Lloyd TACKLES HIM as they reach the bridge. The briefcase
GOES FLYING, and the guys wrestle pitifully with one another
in the snow, rolling over and over.

Finally, Harry manages to get the upper hand. He climbs on
top and CLASPS HIS HANDS

AROUND LLOYD'S THROAT.

                      HARRY (CONT'D)
          I used to have a life! A miserable
          one, but a life, nonetheless!

Suddenly Lloyd's EYES LIGHT UP as he sees something O.S.
behind his friend.

                       LLOYD
              (CHOKED VOICE)
          Harry, look!

Harry turns and HIS EYES LIGHT UP, TOO. He lets go of Lloyd
as we see
THEIR POV - THE BRIEFCASE IS LYING BUSTED OPEN ON THE GROUND,
REVEALING STACKS AND

STACKS OF BIG, BEAUTIFUL HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS!

Harry and Lloyd are hurrying down the sidewalk, clutching
the briefcase. The city is lit up with millions of tiny
lights, like a fantasy winter wonderland.

                       LLOYD
          Okay, here's the plan: We borrow a
          few bucks just a small loan from
          the briefcase, and we check into a
          cheap motel.

                                                         74.

                         HARRY
          Sounds good.

                      LLOYD
          And we'll keep track of the money we
          spend with IOUs.

                      HARRY
          We'll be meticulous    right down to
          the last penny.

                      LLOYD
          That way, whatever we borrow we can
          pay back.

                      HARRY
          Absolutely. We're good for it.

                      LLOYD
          You know, as soon as we get jobs.

                      HARRY
          It'll come right out of our first
          paycheck.

INT. ELEGANT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

A tuxedoed Bell Captain, BARNARD, is showing the guys around
an ENORMOUS AND LUXURIOUS SUITE. The place is big enough to
throw a touchdown bomb in.

                        BARNARD
          ...This is the Hotel Danbury's
          Presidential Suite, gentlemen. It's
          normally reserved for royalty,

          stars of stage and take it.

The Bell Captain is a bit taken aback, but pleased.

                      BARNARD (CONT'D)
          Very good, sir. Are there any bags
          you'd like sent up?

          I wasn't talking about ladies.

                                                          75.

                        HARRY
            Oh. Then go ahead and send thim up.
            What are their names?

Barnard SIGHS.

                        BARNARD
            Sir, I meant your luggage.

Harry forces a. embarrassed half-smile.

                        LLOYD
            Tell you what you can send up, my
            friend how about some chow?

The Bell Captain nods.

                        BARNARD
            I'll bring you a menu.

                        LLOYD
            Don't bother. Just order us one of
            everything.

At this, Harry serves Lloyd a reproachful look.

                        HARRY
            One of everything? Lloyd...

Lloyd looks guilty.

                        LLOYD
            Oh, sorry.
                (beat)
            Make that two of everything.
Harry smiles at this as Lloyd pulls a wad of HUNDRED DOLLAR
BILLS out of his pocket. He rips one off and tucks it in
Barnard's top pocket.

                        LLOYD (CONT'D)
            And here you go, Barney. You keep us
            happy, we'll keep you happy.

The Bell Captain, Barnard, is energized by this tip.

                         BARNARD
            Yes, sir!

He bows and leaves the room. Then Lloyd cracks open the
briefcase and inserts a SMALL PIECE

OF PAPER.

                                                           76.

                         LLOYD
                 (proudly)
             Our first IOU. Signed and dated.

                                                     CUT TO:

EXT. SWANSON CHALET - NIGHT

Helen Swanson is KNOCKING on her step-daughter's bedroom
door. She's holding a tray with a couple of mugs on it.

                         HELEN
             Mary? You awake?

                          MARY
                 (o.s.)

COME IN...

INT. MARY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Mary is sitting in a chair looking sadly out the French
windows when Helen ENTERS.

                         HELEN
             I brought you some tea. I thought it
             might help you relax.

Mary smiles.

                          MARY
             Thank you.

She takes a mug, sips, and pulls back.

                         MARY (CONT'D)
             Yech! What's in this, whiskey?

                           HELEN
             Uh, sorry... that one's mine.

Helen grabs the mug from Mary and hands her the other one.

                         HELEN (CONT'D)
             Feeling any better, honey?

Mary can't take her eyes from the window.

                         MARY
             Just knowing that Melvin's out there,
             being held by God knows who...
                 (fighting back tears)
             It's all my fault. I should've been
             there.

                                                        77.

                       HELEN
           Bullshit. You can't blame yourself
           for this. If you'd been there they
           would've taken you, too.

Helen pulls out a joint and torches it up. She takes a hit.

                       MARY
           Maybe we should just pay them the
           money again and get this thing over

with.

                       HELEN
           Now Mary, everything that can be
           done is being done. You've got to
           stop torturing yourself.

                       MARY
           What am I supposed to do? Go about
           my life as if everything were fine?

                        HELEN
           That's exactly what you should do.
           Get the hell out more, go skiing,
           socialize. Don't you see, honey? We
           can't let on that anything is wrong.
           If the press or authorities get wind
           of this, the kidnappers might panic.
               (beat)
           Who knows what they'd do to poor
           Melvin then?

AS MARY THINKS ABOUT THIS, WE

                                                     CUT TO:
EXT. HOTEL DANBURY - DAY

The Guys pull up to the front of the hotel in the hearse.
Several HOTEL EMPLOYEES rush to help them. Harry and Lloyd
get out wearing OVERLY TRENDY SKI GARB, complete with fur
boots, NASA designed goggles, and splashy fluorescent colors
everywhere. The Employees all grab the shopping bags and
then line up as Lloyd TIPS THEM ALL handsomely.

INT. BEDROOM - PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - NIGHT

The huge beds are covered in boxes and bags of new goodies.
Lloyd is going through it all. Harry is sitting out on the
balcony with his feet up on the railing, checking out the
mountain view.

                                                         78.

                       HARRY
           Oh god, it's really true. Last night
           I thought I might've been dreaming.

                       LLOYD
           It's no dream, Har. We finally cracked
           the big time.

                       HARRY
           And it was so simple. All it took
           was somebody else's money.

Harry LIGHTS A CIGAR WITH A TWENTY DOLLAR BILL, takes a hearty
puff, and

EXHALES.

                       HARRY (CONT'D)
           You know, Lloyd, I think you might've
           gone a little overboard with the
           spending today.

He blows out the twenty and tosses it off the balcony.

                       LLOYD
           What's the big deal? We're gonna pay
           it all back anyway, right?

                       HARRY
           Sure, but do you really think you
           needed to buy those two surfboards?

                       LLOYD
           Surfboards? I thought those were
           beginner's skis.
This suddenly makes sense to Harry.

                       HARRY
           Ahhh. I was wondering why you had
           those bindings put on them.

Lloyd opens a box and holds up a SCANTY NEGLIGEE.

                       LLOYD
           Where'd this come from?

                        HARRY
               (sheepishly)
           I bought it.

                       LLOYD
           What for?

                                                        79.

                        HARRY
          I like the feel of it against my
          skin...
                (defensive)
          ...I mean, you know, when a woman's
          wearing it.

Lloyd inspects it more closely.

                      LLOYD
          Harry, how many women do you know
          who wear a size XXL?

                      HARRY
          Look, leave me alone. I'm rich now.
          I'm supposed to have a few
          eccentricities.

There's a KNOCK on the door.

                      LLOYD
          Enter, parlez vous!

The Bell Captain, Barnard, ENTERS with a champagne bucket
and a newspaper under his arm.

                      BARNARD
          I brought you your newspaper and
          some champagne, gentlemen.
          Unfortunately, we didn't seem to
          have the, um, label you requested.

Lloyd examines the champagne's label and frowns.

                      LLOYD
          All out of Boone's Farm, huh?
                      BARNARD
          You have a rapier wit, sir. I took
          the liberty of bringing a comparable
          substitute: Dom Perignon.

                      LLOYD
          Guess it'll have to do, slugger, eh?

Lloyd smiles and over tips him.

                      BARNARD
          Thank you so much, sir.

He puts the tray down, hands Lloyd the newspaper, and heads
for the door.

                                                         80.

                      LLOYD
          Oh, one more thing: You can     dispense
          with the 'sir' crap. Let's     face it,
          Barney, we're all from the     same mold.
              (winks)
          We just have a little more     dough
          than you right now.

Barnard smiles and EXITS. Harry comes back in the room. He
picks up a champagne glass and flicks it with his finger,
sending out a resonant RING.

                      HARRY
          Cocktail hour has commenced!

He starts to open the champagne bottle as Lloyd begins
thumbing through the newspaper.

                      HARRY (CONT'D)
          Hey, later on what do you say we...?

He notices that Lloyd's mouth has dropped open at something
he's found in the paper.

                        HARRY (CONT'D)
          Lloyd... you okay?

                      LLOYD
              (dumbstruck)
          Harry, it's her.

                       HARRY
          Who?

                      LLOYD
          Mary with the briefcase. This is
          her...

He shoves the newspaper at Harry.

CLOSE ON THE HEADLINE - it reads: SWANSONS TO HOST
PRESERVATION GALA TONIGHT; CITY'S ELITE EXPECTED. Underneath
this is a photograph of Mary with her parents.

                      LLOYD (CONT'D)
          Mary Swanson...

                      HARRY
          Come on, Cinderella, it's time to
          get you ready for the ball...

Roy Orbison's "Pretty Woman" plays over a...

MONTAGE OF HARRY AND LLOYD'S GLAMOUR MAKE-OVER:

                                                          81.

-The boys are in a beauty parlor getting their hair shampooed.

-Harry and Lloyd sit beneath old-fashioned hair dryers. The
ATTENDANTS lift the dryers from their heads, revealing both
guys' hair in curlers.

-Lloyd's getting shaved by an ATTENDANT with a straight-razor.
Suddenly Lloyd grabs his neck

as if he's been nicked. BLOOD SQUIRTS OUT from between his
fingers. The other CUSTOMERS stare in horror at this. Lloyd
LAUGHS and shows everyone a SQUEEZE KETCHUP BOTTLE hidden in
his hand. Only Harry and Lloyd seem to find this joke amusing.

-We see them getting their nose hairs clipped. PAN DOWN to
the floor to reveal a PILE OF

NOSE HAIR CLIPPINGS.

-Then a   shot of a MAN next to them getting a pedicure. PAN
OVER to   Lloyd's bare feet  he has toe nails like Howard
Hughes.   Sparks are flying as an ATTENDANT wearing safety
goggles   tries to sand down Lloyd's toenails with an electric
sander.

-Harry is lying on his stomach with his shirt off, getting a
massage from a beautiful ORIENTAL MASSEUSE. He pulls a hundred
dollar bill from under his towel, hands it to her, and
WHISPERS in her ear. She smiles.

-Next we see the Oriental Masseuse lying on her stomach with
her shirt off, while Harry happily massages her back.

-The guys are in an expensive haberdashery. Harry comes out
of the dressing room in a very elegant BLACK TUXEDO. He
couldn't look any more suave. The SALEMAN nods, impressed,
but Lloyd shakes his head no and Harry goes back in.

-Harry reappears in another stylish WHITE TUXEDO. The Salesman
looks on hopefully, but Lloyd again disapproves.

-This time Harry comes out in a JUNIOR-PROM-LIKE SKY-BLUE
TUXEDO, complete with TACKY FRILLS. The Salesman looks
sickened as Lloyd give Harry the thumbs up.

PAN ACROSS THE STREET from the haberdashery - an apprehensive
J.P. Shay is sitting in a parked car, WATCHING HARRY AND
LLOYD.

                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

                                                           82.

EXT. ASPEN PRESERVATION SOCIETY - NIGHT

Throngs of GUESTS in black-tie and elegant gowns are entering
the building. Suddenly the hearse pulls up with Harry and
Lloyd BUMPER SURFING BEHIND IT. Harry's wearing his blue
tuxedo. Lloyd's tux isn't any better it's pumpkin orange.
(THEY'VE GOT MATCHING TOP HATS AND CANES.) When the hearse
stops, the boys hand the driver Barnard a couple hundred
dollars.

                      LLOYD
          Thanks for the lift, Barney.

INT. ASPEN PRESERVATION SOCIETY

Nicholas Andre is greeting people at the door. However, when
Harry and Lloyd try to enter, he stops them and gives them
the once over.

                      ANDRE
          Excuse me, gentlemen, but this is a
          five-hundred-dollar-a-plate dinner.

Harry and Lloyd look at each other and shrug. Then Lloyd
takes out a WAD OF BILLS and peels

off TEN HUNDREDS, much to the amazement of Andre.

                      LLOYD
          This should cover a couple plates.

                      HARRY
          I'm kind of hungry, Lloyd. What if
          we want seconds?

Lloyd thinks about this. Then he peels off another thou.
                      LLOYD
          Put us down for four plates, my good
          man.

They ENTER the party. As Andre watches them go, his associate
J.P. Shay comes up beside him, an alarmed look on his face.

                      J.P. SHAY
              (WHISPERING)
          Jesus Christ, boss... it's them.

BACK ON HARRY AND LLOYD - the guys make their way through
the affluent crowd.

                      LLOYD
          I'm getting nervous, Harry.

                                                        83.

                      HARRY
          relax, Lloyd. These people are just
          like you and me.

                      LLOYD
          What are you talking about? They're
          educated, well-bred, charming, and
          sophisticated.

                      HARRY
          So what? We can be sophistica holy
          shit, would you look at the fun bags
          on that hose hound.

He points out a busty BLONDE BOMBSHELL entering the party.
Lloyd rolls his eyes.

                      LLOYD
          Don't do this to me, Harry. I'm
          already a wreck. What if Mary oesn't
          like me?

                      HARRY
          Look, let's just go saddle up to the
          bar and down a couple bowls of
          loudmouth soup. A little booze'll
          bring back that old Lloyd Christmas
          over-confidence.

The guys stand out at the glittering social scene as they
make their way to the bar.

                      LLOYD
              (to BARTENDER)
          Two martinis, straight up.
As Harry and Lloyd silently take in the party, a BEAUTIFUL
RED HEAD reaches between them for a cocktail napkin, then
walks away.

                      LLOYD (CONT'D)
          Shut up, Harry.

                      HARRY
          I didn't say anything.

                      LLOYD
          Yeah, well I know what you were gonna
          say and I'm telling you to shut up
          in advance.

                      HARRY
          How do you know what I was gonna
          say?

                                                        84.

                      LLOYD
          I read you like a book.

                      HARRY
          Okay, if you read me like a book
          then what was I gonna say?

                      LLOYD
          You were gonna say:
              (in Harry's looped
               VOICE)
          'That's one fiery bush I wouldn't
          mind roasting my weenie in.'

Harry raises his eyebrows, IMPRESSED.

                       LLOYD (CONT'D)
          And I would say 'shut up', because
          this is our chance to get in with
          the rich and powerful and you don't
          ingratiate yourself to the kind of
          people by acting like Ron Jeremy on
          Spanish Fly.

The Bartender delivers their martinis as we hear the o.s.
CLINKING of a glass. The guys turns to

see Nicholas Andre standing at a podium. Next to him is a
LARGE, COVERED DISPLAY. On his other side are Karl and
Elizabeth Swanson.

                      ANDRE
          If I could have your attention,
          please...

The crowd QUIETS.
                      ANDRE (CONT'D)
          I'd like to thank you all for coming
          to this very special event. As you

KNOW, THE ASPEN PRESERVATION SOCIETY -

founded and chiefly funded by our great benefactors, Karl
and Helen Swanson - is the world's foremost efender of
endangered species. Our

SPRAWLING GROUNDS ARE HOME TO TWENTY-

three separate varieties of animals that are currently listed
on the United Nation's charter of protected species. Tonight,
we are deeply honored to have Mr. Karl Swanson welcome our
twenty-fourth.

                                                        85.

The crowd CLAPS as Mr. Swanson takes Andre's place at the
podium.

                      MR. SWANSON
          Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the
          Icelandic Snow Owl.

He pulls the cover off, revealing TWO MAJESTIC, FLUFFY WHITE
OWLS IN A CAGE. Everyone OOHS and AHHS.

                      MR. SWANSON (CONT'D)
          These magnificent specimens were

RESCUED RECENTLY, CULMINATING A FIVE-

year, two-million-dollar effort on our part. Together, they
constitute one-seventh of the snow owl population left on
the planet.

ON ANDRE - he's nervously eyeing Harry and Lloyd. He looks
pale.

                      MR. SWANSON
          Here these lovely birds will be
          allowed to breed in a natural but
          protected habitat. And, God willing,
          with your help and that of the
          Society's, we will see these wonderful
          creatures flourish once more.

More APPLAUSE.

                      MR. SWANSON (CONT'D)
          Again, thank you, and enjoy your
          evening. Oh, and feel free to take a
          closer look at our new friends here.
          Enjoy.

The crowd APPLAUDS and begins to mingle again. Lloyd turns
back to the Bartender and holds up his empty glass.

                      LLOYD
          Two more, please.

Harry stares at Lloyd with concern.

                      HARRY
          Lloyd, I've never seen you this
          uptight. You've gotta chill out.

                      LLOYD
          I can't help it. This is a very
          important night for me.
                      (MORE)

                                                        86.

                       LLOYD (CONT'D)
              (beat)
          Harry, have you ever wondered why
          you and I never have long-term
          girlfriends?

                      HARRY
          What are you talking about? I went
          out with Fraida Felcher for two and
          a half weeks.

                      LLOYD
          That was a fluke.
              (beat)
          The reason we never have long-term
          girlfriends is because of one thing:
          We're afraid of the C word.

                      HARRY
          That's crazy. We live for the C word.

                      LLOYD
          I'm talking bout commitment.

                         HARRY
                (beat)
          Oh.

                      LLOYD
          Well I'm ready for commitment, Harry.
          The first time I laid eyes on Mary
          Swanson, I knew she was the one.
              (beat)
          Some things you feel in your heart,
          other things you feel in your groin.
          This girl makes me feel it all in
          the heart.

Suddenly Lloyd notices something across the room.

HIS POV - A BEGUILING MARY SWANSON IS TALKING WITH A COUPLE
OF GUESTS. SHE'S WEARING A

spectacular black cocktail dress.

Lloyd quickly turns toward the bar.

                      LLOYD (CONT'D)
          Oh shit, there she is.

                                                   87.

                      HARRY
              (checking her out)
          Wow. You weren't kidding, Lloyd.
          She's an angel.
              (beat)
          Well, what are you waiting for? Get
          over there and talk to her.

                      LLOYD
          She's gonna think I'm some kind of
          psycho when she realizes how far I
          came just to see her.

                      HARRY
          You have her briefcase she's gonna
          be thrilled to see you.

                      LLOYD
          And then what? She'll take it back
          and that'll be it. I'm a nobody.

Harry thinks about this a moment.

                      HARRY
          Look, man, you just drove two thousand
          miles to see this girl. Don't quit
          on the last fifty feet.

                       LLOYD
               (brightening)
          Wait a second, I have an idea. You
          go over and introduce yourself. That
          way you can build me up so when I
          come along I won't have to brag about
          myself. Tell her I'm good-looking
          and I'm rich and I have a rapist's
          wit.

                      HARRY
          I can't tell her you're good looking,
          Lloyd she's got eyes.

Lloyd takes a big gulp of his new martini.

                      LLOYD
          Please Harry, I'm appealing to you
          as one loser to another. Just build
          me up and then give me a signal to
          come over. Please.

Harry SIGHS.

                                                           88.

                      HARRY
          All right. But you're gonna owe me a
          big one for this.

Harry straightens his polka-dot bow-tie, then APPROACHES
Mary, who is now standing alone, admiring the owls.

                      HARRY (CONT'D)
          Nice set of hooters you got there.

Mary turns to Harry, stunned.

                      MARY
          I beg your pardon?

                      HARRY
          The owls. They're beautiful.

                      MARY
          Oh. Yeah.
              (beat)
          Are you a bird lover?

                      HARRY
          Well, I used to have a parakeet, but
          my main area of expertise is canines
          that's dogs to the layperson.

She smiles at this.

                      MARY
          Thanks. I love dogs, too. So how

are you involved with them?

                      HARRY
          Oh, I've trained them, bathed them,
          clipped them; I've even bred them.

                      MARY
          Really? Any unusual breeding?

                      HARRY
          Nah, mostly just doggie-style. But
          one time we successfully mated a
          Bulldog and a Shitzu.

                      MARY
          Really? That's weird.

                      HARRY
          Yeah. We called it a Bullshit.
              (breaks out LAUGHING)
          Just a little breeder joke.

                                                           89.

She seems strangely charmed by this.

                      HARRY (CONT'D)
          Anyway, the real reason I came over
          is because I want to introduce you
          to a friend of mine.

Just then, Mary's stepmother approaches. She's holding a
martini and looking a little sloshed.

                      HELEN
          Mary, I don't believe I've met your
          friend.

                       MARY
          Actually, we haven't been introduced
          yet.
               (holds out hand)
          I'm Mary Swanson, and this is my
          stepmother, Helen.

                      HARRY
          Harry Dunne. Pleasure meeting you
          both.

                      HELEN
          I saw you come in earlier, Mr. Dunne.
          I was hoping we'd get a chance to
          meet.

                      HARRY
              (taken aback)
          You were?

                      HELEN
          That tuxedo I love a man with a
          sense of humor. So does Mary.

Mary shoots Helen a look, then smiles at Harry.

                      HARRY
          Really?

For a moment, he's caught up in Mary's eyes, but then manages
to snap out of it.

                      HARRY (CONT'D)
          Anyway, about my friend you doing
          anything tomorrow, Mr. Dunne? Because
          I believe Mary's looking for somebody
          to hit the slopes with. Whuh?

                      MARY
          Helen, you're embarrassing me.

                                                           90.

                      HELEN
          Well you are, aren't you?
              (to Harry)
          Poor girl doesn't get out enough. So
          what do you say, Harry? Are you
          available?

Harry thinks about this, then looks across the room at a
hopeful Lloyd.

                      HARRY
          Oh, I don't know. You see, my friend
          your friends for one day. You and
          Mary will have a ball.

Mary's captivating eyes meet his, waiting for an answer.

                          HARRY (CONT'D)
          Um... well... I don't know. You see, the
          thing is... sure.

ON LLOYD - he waits impatiently at the bar as Harry returns.

                      LLOYD
          How come you didn't call me over?

                      HARRY
          Relax, you're golden. I got you a
          ate with her tomorrow.

Lloyd falls back against the bar and grabs his chest. He's
SPEECHLESS.

                            LLOYD
          Wha... you... I... it's...
                (smiles)
          I love you, man. I love you!

Lloyd clamps an embarrassed Harry in a TIGHT EMBRACE.

                      HARRY
          Okay, get a grip, Lloyd. You're making
          a scene.

Lloyd steps back elated.

                      LLOYD
          This calls for a toast!

He grabs a bottle of champagne out of a bucket and starts to
open it.

                                                           91.

                      LLOYD (CONT'D)
          You're gonna be my best man, Har, I
          mean it. It was always between you
          and my future wife's brother, but
          you just earned a seat at the head
          table, pal.

Suddenly the CORK SHOOTS OUT OF THE CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE AND
ZIPS ACROSS

THE ROOM LIKE A BULLET   DIRECTLY TOWARD ONE OF THE NOW EVEN
WIDER-

EYED OWLS. In quick succession we hear a BOK!, a SQUAWK!,
and a THUMP!

A HUSH falls over the entire party as everyone turns their
stunned attention to the cage.

THEIR POV - FEATHERS ARE FLOATING IN THE AIR THROUGHOUT THE
CAGE, AND ONE OF THE ICELANDIC SNOW

Owls LIES ON ITS BACK, its species now one bird closer to
extinction.

Harry and Lloyd look on in horror. Harry takes the smoking
champagne bottle from Lloyd and places it on the bar.

                      HARRY
              (under breath)
          I think we've done enough hobnobbing,
          Lloyd.

The guys LOWER THEIR HEADS and slink out of the room before
anyone can figure out what happened anyone except for
Nicholas Andre, that is; we PAN to show that he's been
standing nearby watching their every move. And he doesn't
look very happy.

                                                      CUT TO:

INT. AASPEN APARTMENT - NIGHT

Nicholas Andre is pacing the room with a drink in his hand
while J.P. Shay looks on nervously.

                      J.P. SHAY
          Maybe it was just a coincidence.

                      ANDRE
          Don't be stupid. It's a message,
          plain and simple: We killed their
          bird, now they killed ours.

                                                          92.

                       J.P. SHAY
          But how could anybody off a bird
          with a cork?

                      ANDRE
          These guys arent' just anybody.
          They're good. Look what they did to
          Mental. He was the best, and yet he
          fell right into their web.

                      J.P. SHAY
          But the bastards already got our
          money. What the hell more could they
          want?

Andre runs his fingers through his hair.

                      ANDRE
              (at wit's end)
          I don't know, god damn it!

                                                       CUT TO:

INT. BEDROOM - PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - THE NEXT MORNING

A jubilant Lloyd is fixing his hair in the mirror. In the
b.g., Harry is putting on his new ski clothes including a
pair of thermal tights.

                      LLOYD
          Mrs. Christmas... Mary Christmas... Mrs.
          Mary Christmas. You

know, it has kind of a ring to it, oesn't it, Har?

                      HARRY
          Sounds nice, Lloyd, but don't you
          think you may be jumping the gun a
          little? I mean, who knows, when you
          get to know her, you may find out
          she's not your type.

                      LLOYD
          Impossible. I know my type    when I
          see it. Now let me get this    straight,
          she wants me to meet her at    the
          Avalanche Bar and Grill on    Main
          Street?

                      HARRY
          That's what she said. Ten o'clock
          sharp.

This is when Lloyd notices Harry's get-up.

                                                        93.

                      LLOYD
          Time out. Where are going ressed
          like that.

                      HARRY
          I, uh, thought while you were making
          your love connection I'd try my luck
          on the slopes.

                      LLOYD
          You mean you're gonna go out in public
          dressed in tights?

                      HARRY
          These aren't tights. They're
          fashionable Euro-trash ski trousers.

                      LLOYD
          But you can see the outline of your
          who-who.

Harry looks down at his crotch.

                        HARRY
          Really?

                      LLOYD
          Turn sideways.

Harry turns his profile against the window.

                      LLOYD (CONT'D)
          Actually, it's just a tiny little
          lump. No one will ever notice.

                      HARRY
          You're right. I can't go out dressed
          like this.

                                                     CUT TO:

EXT. ASPEN BASE LODGE - DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT of the building.

INT. ASPEN BASE LODGE

People are putting their boots on and their skis are lined
up on the wall behind them. Mary is waiting by the fireplace
in an incredibly sexy snowsuit.

                                                          94.

Suddenly Harry appears in the room, dressed ridiculously. As
he begins to clumsily make his way through the lodge toward
Mary, we see that he ALREADY HAS HIS SKIS ON. He kicks over
a row of skis and gets glares from all sides. Finally he
reaches her, OUT OF BREATH.

                      HARRY
          Sorry I'm late. It's a bitch driving
          a clutch with these things.

EXT. CHAIR LIFT - DAY

Harry and Mary are at the front of the lift line. The couple
ahead of them get on a chair, and then they shuffle into
position. Harry crouches nervously, waiting for the chair.
The chair swings around, comes up behind them, and makes a
smooth pick up of Mary, that is. An embarrassed Harry is
STILL IN THE CROUCHING POSITION, having missed the ride.
Mary looks back at him, confused. Suddenly he pretends to be
stretching.

                      HARRY
              (CALLING OUT)
          You take the first run alone. I'm
          gonna loosen up down here.

INT. AVALANCHE BAR & GRILL - DAY

Lloyd ENTERS the bar as the WAITERS are setting up for the
day.

                      WAITER
          I'm sorry, we don't open until eleven.
This is disconcerting news to Lloyd.

                      LLOYD
          I'm meeting someone. Mind if I wait
          at the bar?

The Waiter shrugs and Lloyd sits down at the empty bar.

                                                     CUT TO:

EXT. CHAIR LIFT - DAY

Harry and Mary are now sitting together on a chair as it
rises higher and higher toward the imposing mountain top.
Harry holds onto the chair's frame nervously.

                      MARY
          Beautiful day, huh, Harry?

                                                           95.

                       HARRY
          Glorious.

Mary takes a DEEP BREATH.

                      MARY
          God, it feels so good to get up here.
          I haven't been outdoors much in the
          last couple of weeks.

                       HARRY
          Why not?

                      MARY
              (evasive)
          There's been... family problems. I
          on't want to bore you with them.

                       HARRY
          Thanks.

He looks mindlessly off in the distance. Then Harry notices
a PATCH OF FROST on the chair lift bar.

                        HARRY (CONT'D)
          Oh, look... frost.

He licks it and his TONGUE IMMEDIATELY FUSES WITH THE FROZEN
METAL. He tugs a few times, but it won't budge.

                      MARY
          Are you okay?

                      HARRY
              (lisping)
          Sure. I do this all the time...

As Mary and Harry arrive at the top of the lift, Mary
disembarks but Harry stays on.

          See ya at the bottom...

Harry and the chair lift swing around and start heading down
the hill.

EXT. BOTTOM OF MOUNTAIN - DAY

The chair lift comes back around with Harry still sitting on
it, stuck to the bar. Two LITTLE KIDS climb on with him.

                        HARRY
                (lisping)
          Hi.
              (off their looks)
          Say, kids, you wouldn't happen to
          have a cup of warm water, would you?

The two kids just stare at him.

INT. AVALANCHE BAR & GRILL - AFTERNOON

A despondent   Lloyd's got a couple of empties in front of him
now. The bar   is open and there are a few CUSTOMERS sprinkled
about. Lloyd   takes a sip of his drink and looks up at the
clock on the   wall. It's 12:30.

We see a pair of beautiful legs slide onto the stool next to
him. PAN OVER to reveal that it's the Athletic Beauty that
Harry had tried to pick up at the truck stop.

                        ATHLETIC BEAUTY
          Hi.

Lloyd GRUNTS a hello.

                      ATHLETIC BEAUTY (CONT'D)
          Bad day, huh?

Lloyd GRUNTS once more.
                      ATHLETIC BEAUTY (CONT'D)
              (big smile)
          well don't worry, Mercury's supposed
          to be coming out or retrograde
          tonight. Things will get better.

AS LLOYD GRUNTS AGAIN, WE

EXT. BASE LODGE - AFTERNOON

Mary gracefully carves her way to the bottom of the hill and
stops with a snow-spraying flourish. She looks around the
outdoor patio for Harry. She spots something and does a DOUBLE-
TAKE.

                                                           97.

MARY'S POV - HARRY IS SITTING AT A TABLE, STILL ATTACHED TO
THE CHAIR LIFT (WHICH

has been removed from the cable). He's drinking a cup of
coffee and trying to act nonchalant, espite the gawking of
the other SKIERS. There's a MIME performing in the b.g.

                      MARY
          My god. Harry, are you okay?

                      HARRY
              (lisping)
          I'm fine, I'm fine. It'll come off.

As his trigger finger TWITCHES with anticipation, we go

BACK TO SCENE

                      MARY
          This is silly. Let me help you...

Mary gets up and stands behind Harry. He MOANS nervously.
She grabs his head in both hands and starts pulling it away
from the bar. We see HARRY'S TONGUE STRETCH RIDICULOUSLY...
FIVE INCHES... SIX... THEN EIGHT. Harry GROANS in pain. Suddenly,
his TONGUE COMES UNDONE and Harry and Mary fall backwards
out of the path of J.P. Shay's bullet as it WHIZZES BY. We
hear the Mime in the b.g. CRY OUT in pain:

                      MIME
          GODDAMN IT! WHAT THE FUCK?!

The poor Mime holds his bleeding hand and retreats nervously
into the lodge as the CROWD BOOS him.

Lloyd's now swimming in despair, as the Athletic Beauty
RAMBLES ON beside him.

          ...Anyway, after my boyfriend backed
          into my garage for the third time, I
          said to myself, 'Run, Cathy, run for
          your life before he kills you both'.
          Then you know what the klutz does
          and to be perfectly honest, I on't
          really care.
                (beat)
          Look, I'm sorry, but I'm not very
          good company today. I'll say.
                (beat)
          I have an idea. Why don't you tell
          me a little about yourself.

                      LLOYD
          Maybe some other time.

Lloyd motions for the BARTENDER.

                      LLOYD (CONT'D)
          Excuse me, you wouldn't happen to
          know a Mary Swanson, would you?

                      BARTENDER
          Sure. Her family comes in here all
          the time.

                      LLOYD
          Do you know where she lives?

                      BARTENDER
          Yeah, they got that big place up on
          Alpine Drive.

The hearse pulls up to the house and stops.

INT. HEARSE

          I've got to tell you, today was really
          just what I needed. Thanks a lot,
          Harry.

                      HARRY
          My pleasure, Mary.

She beams and gives him a KISS on the cheek.

                                                           99.

          So you'll pick me up tonight at 7:45?

                      HARRY
          Better make it quarter to eight.
          I've got a few things to take care
          of first.

Harry watches, lovestruck, as Mary gets out of the car and
walks toward the house.

                        HARRY (CONT'D)
              (to himself)
          Mary Dunne... Mrs. Mary Dunne... Got a
          nice ring to it.

We PAN from the hearse to some nearby bushes, where we see a
SHATTERED LLOYD

WATCHING ALL THIS IN DISBELIEF.

                      LLOYD
          Some best man.

INT. BEDROOM - PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - EVENING

Lloyd is sitting forlornly on the bed while Harry feigns
surprise at what he's just heard.
                      HARRY
          It doesn't make any sense, Lloyd.
          She told me ten o'clock sharp. Are
          you sure you went to the right bar?

                      LLOYD
          Believe me, it was the right place.
              (SIGHS)
          I don't know, Har, maybe she just
          had second thoughts.

                      HARRY
          I have a hard time believing that,
          Lloyd. The girl said she couldn't
          wait to see you again.

Harry paces back and forth when suddenly SOMETHING OCCURES
TO HIM.

                                                       100.

                      HARRY (CONT'D)
          Wait a minute...

                       LLOYD
          What?

                      HARRY
          It just occurred to me. She must've
          meant ten o'clock at night.

                        LLOYD
              (brightening)
          Do ya think...?

                      HARRY
          Of course! Why would she have you
          meet her at a bar at ten in the
          morning?

                      LLOYD
              (shrugging)
          I just figured she was a raging
          alcoholic.

Harry BARKS OUT A LAUGH at their stupidity.

                      HARRY
          Boy, aren't we a couple of beauties?

                      LLOYD
          I knew there was an explanation. And
          here I thought she was standing me
          up.

                       HARRY
          That'll teach you to jump to
          conclusions.
              (beat)
          Anyway, since you have your night
          all

planned, I think I'll run out and catch a flick.

As Harry walks into the closet to change, Lloyd clenches his
fist and glares after him. Then he regains his composure and
moves to the bar.

                      LLOYD
          Will you join me in a good luck toast
          before you head out?

                                                       101.

                      HARRY
              (o.s.)
          Sure thing, pal. Whatever you think
          will help your chances.

Lloyd BITES HIS LIP at this. He fills two mugs with coffee
and throws a splash of Bailey's in each. He check to make
sure Harry is still in the closet, then pulls out a BOX OF
EX-LAX.

LLOYD DUMPS THE ENTIRE PACK INTO ONE MUG AND MIXES IT IN.

WHEN HARRY COMES OUT OF THE CLOSET DRESSED IN A NEW SUIT AND
TIE, LLOYD DOES A DOUBLE-

take.

                      LLOYD
          Pretty snazzed out for a movie, aren't
          you?

                        HARRY
          Uh... it's for mature audiences. I
          on't wanna chance getting turned
          away at the door.

                      LLOYD
          I see.

Lloyd hands him the mug with the Ex-Lax. Then he lifts his
own glass.

                      LLOYD (CONT'D)
          To my friend Harry the matchmaker.

Harry feels a pang of guilt but drinks up anyway.
                      HARRY
          Mmmmm...

He GULPS DOWN THE DRINK.

                                                     CUT TO:

INT. HEARSE - NIGHT

Harry's driving along, WHISTLING happily to himself in
anticipation of the night. Suddenly we hear a LOW, INTESTINAL
RUMBLE. He reacts and rubs his stomach.

                                                       102.

EXT. SWANSON CHALET - NIGHT

The hearse parks on the street and Harry gets out. He's
walking up the steps to the house when we hear more GASEOUS
THUNDER from his stomach. Harry stops in his tracks, gets
his insides under control, and continues to the front porch,
where he RINGS the bell.

Mary answers the door, fiddling with her earrings.

                      MARY
          Hi. Come on in.

INT. SWANSON CHALET

Harry follows her inside.

                      MARY
          Make yourself at home. I'm almost
          ready. Just give me one more minute.

As she disappears down a hallway, we hear Harry's UPSET
STOMACH again. He notices a bathroom off the hallway and
rushes inside.

INT. BATHROOM

HOLD ON Harry's face as he quickly pulls his pants down and
nestles onto the throne. He lets out a SIGH OF RELIEF as he
does his business, then leans over and SLIDES OPEN THE WINDOW
to air the room out. He's still glued to the toilet when he
hears a KNOCK on the door.

                      MARY
              (o.s.)
          Are you in there, Harry?
                      HARRY
              (nervously)
          Be right out.

                       MARY
              (o.s.)
          I hope you're not using the toilet.
          It's broken.

ZOOM IN TIGHT on Harry's face - his EYES GO WIDE and a visible
SWEAT breaks out on his forehead.

                      HARRY
          Huh?

                                                         103.

                      MARY
              (o.s.)
          It doesn't flush.

                      HARRY
          Um, no, I was just... shaving.

EXT. HALLWAY

A confused Mary is standing outside the bathroom door.

                       MARY
          Shaving?

                      HARRY
              (o.s.)
          Yeah! I was running a little late.
          Thought this would save time.

                      MARY
          Okay. Well I'll be in the living
          room whenever you're ready.

INT. BATHROOM

Harry's got his pants back on and is lifting the lid off the
toilet tank. He starts tinkering with a few valves.

                      HARRY
              (under breath)
          Come on, flush, you bastard...

EXT. LIVING ROOM - SWANSON CHALET - NIGHT

Mary's sitting patiently on the couch with her legs crossed.
She looks at her watch, then flips on the TV.
ON THE TUBE - the news is on. A WOMAN REPORTER is addressing
the CAMERA gravely:

                      REPORTER
          We'll be back in a minute with the
          story of the blind Indiana boy who
          was duped into buying a dead parakeet.

We see Billy the blind boy from apartment 4-C sitting in
his wheelchair, holding up Petey the parakeet with its head
Scotch taped on its body.

                        BLIND BOY
          ...I thought he was real quiet...

                                                       104.

The Reporter shakes her head and they go to a commercial.
Mary SHIVERS at this and turns off the television. Suddenly
the DOORBELL RINGS. She gets up and opens the front door.

HER POV - a dapper Lloyd is standing there in his new Aspen-
chic clothes.

                        MARY
          Yes...?

                        LLOYD
          Hi.
              (beat)
          Don't you remember me?

          Um... I'm not really...

                      LLOYD
          South Bend. I drove you to the airport
          last week.

                      MARY
              (dawning on her)
          Oh my god. Lloyd, right?

Lloyd is thrilled at this.

                      LLOYD
          You remembered.

                      MARY
          What are you doing in Aspen?

                      LLOYD
          I brought you your briefcase You
          left it at the airport so I picked
          it up for you.

Mary's MOUTH DROPS OPEN.

                      MARY
          You're the one who took my briefcase?

                      LLOYD
          Yeah, it's back at my hotel room.
          Come on, let's take a ride. I'll
          give it to you.

Mary is torn between getting her briefcase and waiting for
Harry.

                      MARY
          Wait right here.

                                                         105.

She goes to the bathroom door. Inside we hear the LOUD
CLANKING of metal against metal.

                      MARY (CONT'D)
          Harry, what are you doing in there?

INT. BATHROOM

Harry's got the eintire toilet completely DISASSEMBLED now.
Various pieces of the commode litter the floor, including
the big plastic float ball. He's on his knees tinkering with
some pipes coming out of the wall.

                      HARRY
          Uh... just cleaning my teeth. Give
          me a minute, Mary, I'll be right
          with you.

                      MARY
              (o.s.)
          Sorry, but something important's
          come up and I have to run out. It's
          sort of an emergency. I'll explain
          later.

                        HARRY
          But Mary --

                      MARY
              (o.s.)
          --I'm really sorry, Harry. I promise
          we'll do this another time.

Harry hears her FOOTSTEPS echo down the hallway and then the
front DOOR CLOSING. Harry slumps against the sink, defeated.
                        HARRY
          Great...

Lloyd is in the passenger seat, wearing a subtle, SATISFIED
SMILE. An anxious looking Mary is at the wheel.

EXT. HOTEL DANBURY - NIGHT

The Jaguar pulls up in front of the hotel. As Lloyd and Mary
get out, we PAN OVER to reveal that they were being followed
by Nicholas Andre and J.P. Shay in a Mercedes.

                                                       106.

INT. ANDRE'S MERCEDES

Andre pulls a PISTOL from beneath his seat and slips it into
his coat.

          They're mine...

INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE

The door opens and Lloyd and Mary ENTER.

                      LLOYD
          ..So anyway, as soon as I got to
          town I tried to look you up but I
          idn't know your last name.

He leads her to the closed BRIEFCASE which is sitting on the
bed.

                      MARY
          I don't believe it. You really have
          it.

                      LLOYD
          'Course I have it. When Lloyd
          Christmas drives a woman to the
          airport, he makes sure she gets all

Mary looks at Lloyd and smiles.

                      MARY
          This is incredible. You mean to say
          you drove two thousand miles just
          for me?

                      LLOYD
          Well... no... I mean, you know, there
          were other reasons...
              (beat)
          Actually, yeah, I guess I did.

She can't believe her ears.

                      MARY
          That is the sweetest thing I've ever
          heard.

                                                       107.

He drops his head and Mary leans over and kisses him on the
cheek.

INT. HEARSE - NIGHT

A sullen Harry is driving back to the hotel.

                      HARRY
              (MUMBLING to himself)
          It's all Kharma, Harry. You screw
          your best friend over and it's gonna
          come back to haunt you, plain and
          simple...

                                                     CUT TO:

INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE

CLOSE ON LLOYD'S FACE - he's starry-eyed in love as he spills
his guts.

                      LLOYD
          Look, Mary, I know this may seem a
          little sudden but I've given it a
          lot of thought: You're the woman
          I've been waiting for my whole life,
          and I'm not ashamed to admit it --
              (holds up his hand)
          --Please, let me finish.
              (DEEP BREATH)
          I'm crazy about you. I've never felt
          this way about anyone. You make it
          so easy for me to tell you my
          innermost desires.
              (NERVOUS LAUGH)
          Listen to me, I feel like a schoolboy
          again.
              (beat)
          A schoolboy who desperately wants to
          make sweet, sweet love to you.

Suddenly we hear   TOILET FLUSHING O.S.

REVERSE ANGLE REVEALS that Lloyd has been talking to an EMPTY
CHAIR. The bathroom oor opens and Mary comes out. She looks
around, expecting to see someone else.

                      MARY
          Oh... I thought I heard you talking
          to someone.

                                                       108.

Lloyd is flustered. He swallows hard. It's the moment of
truth.

                      LLOYD
          Mary...
              (BLURTING OUT)
          I desperately want to make love to a
          schoolboy.

                      MARY
              (taken aback)
          Maybe I should be going now.

                      LLOYD
          No, that's not what Imeant. I meant...
          I really like you, Mary. I like you
          a lot.

She smiles at this.

                      LLOYD (CONT'D)
          I'm gonna ask you something flat out
          and I want you to answer me honestly:
          What do you think the chances are of
          a girl like you and a guy like me
          ending up together?

Mary is obviously thrown by this question.

                      MARY
          Lloyd, that's difficult to say. I

mean we hardly --

                      LLOYD
          --I asked you to be honest, Mary.
                      MARY
          But Lloyd, I really can't --

                         LLOYD
          --Come    on, give it to me straight. I
          rove a    long way to see you, the least
          you can    do is level with me. What
          are my    chances?

                         MARY
          Not good.

BEAT

                      LLOYD
          You mean not good, like one out of a
          hundred?

                                                        109.

                      MARY
          I'd say more like one out of a
          million.

BEAT

                      LLOYD
              (Duh)
          So you're telling me there's a chance?

Just then, there's a KNOCK at the door. When Lloyd opens it,
he's face to face with Nicholas Andre.

                      MARY
          Nicholas... what are you doing here?

                      ANDRE
          I've been looking for you, Mary.

I've got some interesting news about your husband.

Lloyd looks at MAry, devastated.

                          LLOYD
          Husband?

                      ANDRE
          Aren't you two going to invite me
          in?

Lloyd and Mary hear a CLICK and turn to see Andre POINTING A
GUN at them. Andre steps into the room, and we

As Harry mopes through the lobby, we hear someone CALL OUT:

                          WOMAN'S VOICE
                 (o.s.)
          Hey!

Harry turns to see the Athletic Beauty approaching.

                      HARRY
          You...? What are you doing here?

Nicholas Andre has his gun pointed at a stunned Lloyd and
Mary.

                                                        110.

                      ANDRE
          Well at least you two got to say
          your goodbyes.

                         LLOYD
          Who are you?

                      ANDRE
          Don't play dumb with me, asshole.
          I'm the rightful ower of that
          briefcase you've been carrying.

                         LLOYD
          Uh-oh.

Mary can't believe what's happening.

                      MARY
          Nicholas, you... you motherfucker!
          My family trusted you!

                         ANDRE
          Shut up!

                      LLOYD
          Uh, sir, about the briefcase, I want
          you to know, my friend Harry and I
          have every intention of reimbursing
          you.

Andre looks alarmed. He motions Mary to the briefcase with
his gun.

                      ANDRE
          Open that damn thing!
Mary opens the briefcase and a pile of WHITE, CRUMPLED-UP
BALLS OF PAPER fall out along with a few packets of hundreds.

                      ANDRE (CONT'D)
          What the hell's this? Where's all
          the money?

                      LLOYD
          That's as good as money, sir. Those
          are our IOUs. You can add them up
          yourself. Every penny's accounted
          for.

Andre looks like his head is about to BURST in anger.

                      ANDRE
          You're fucking dead!

                                                       111.

                      LLOYD
          Now don't do anything hasty, man.

Harry gets out of the elevator and lets himself into the
Presidential Suite.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE

Harry ENTERS looking contrite and CALLS OUT:

                      HARRY
          Lloyd, are you home? We've gotta
          talk, man. I have a serious confession
          to make.

Harry comes around the corner and STOPS COLD.

HIS POV - Lloyd and Mary are lying on the bed, their arms
handcuffed to the bedpost.

                      HARRY (CONT'D)
          Oh good, you found her. I'll just
          leave you two kids alone.

Harry turns to go, but bumps into the MUZZLE OF ANDRE'S GUN.

                      ANDRE
          Why don't you stay and join the party?

INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - A FEW MINUTES LATER
Harry is sitting beside Lloyd and Mary on the bed. Nicholas
Andre keeps his gun trained on them while he SPEAKS on the
phone:

                      ANDRE
          ..I want a one-way ticket to Rio De
          Janerio departing as soon as
          possible...

ON THE BED - Harry and Lloyd can't look each other in the
eye.

                      MARY
          You mean you two know each other?

                                                  112.

                      LLOYD
              (cutting)
          Yeah, we used to be best friends.

                      HARRY
          Until he turned into a backstabber.

                      LLOYD
          Me a backstabber? You got a lot of
          nerve. I saw her first.

                      HARRY
          Hey, I couldn't help it if she found
          me irresistable.

Mary ROLLS HER EYES at this.

                      LLOYD
          But you knew how crazy I was about
          her.

                      HARRY
          Yeah, and you knew how crazy I was
          about Fraida Felcher, but that didn't
          stop you, did it?

                      LLOYD
              (waning righteousness)
          What are you talking about?

                      HARRY
          Don't deny it, Lloyd. Fraida told me
          the whole sordid story.

Lloyd can't muster a defense.
                      LLOYD
          Look... I was gonna tell you about
          that. It was gonna be mentioned at
          the reading of my will. I swear, you
          can ask my lawyer.

Harry glares at him.

                      HARRY
          Well I guess we both learned a little
          something about each other, didn't
          we?

                      LLOYD
          You said it, pal. Maybe we're not as
          good friends as we thought we were.

                                                       113.

                         HARRY
          Guess not.

                      LLOYD
          I mean, if one beautiful girl   could
          rip us apart like this, then   it seems
          our friendship isn't worth a   damn.
              (beat)
          Maybe we should call it quits   right
          here.

                      HARRY
          Just tell me where to sign, bud.

Suddenly they hear the metallic CLICK-CLACK OF A GUN BEING
COCKED.

                      ANDRE
          Okay, which one of you losers wants
          to die first?

The guys exchange a look and SWALLOW HARD.

                      HARRY
          I wouldn't pull that trigger if I
          were you.

                      ANDRE
          Why not? It'll look like just another
          Aspen love triangle. You caught the
          two of them in bed, handcuffed them
          to the post, murdered them, and killed
          yourself.

                      HARRY
              (smug)
          Except you're forgetting one minor
          etail.

                         ANDRE
          What's that?

Lloyd and Mary look at Harry, hopeful.

                      HARRY
          If you kill us, you'd be killing
          yourself.

                         ANDRE
                 (puzzled)
          Huh?

                                                   114.

                       HARRY
           You see, philosophers believe that
           we're all really just tiny pieces of
           one huge universal being. In other
           words, I am you and you are me, so
           if you were to kill us you'd be
           committing suicide, you unenlightened

idiot --

                        ANDRE
           --Shut up!

Mary sees that they're in deep shit now.

                       MARY
           What about my husband? Did you kill
           him, too?

                       HARRY
           Husband? What husband?

                       LLOYD
           Mary's married, Harry.

                       ANDRE
           No need to worry about Melvin.
               (beat)
           Now this is the last time I'll ask:
           Who wants to die first?

Harry gestures with his head at Mary.

                       HARRY
           Kill her. The bitch should've told
           him she was married back at the
           airport. It would've saved us a lot
           of trouble.

Andre points the gun at Mary.

                       LLOYD
           No, I'll go first, Harry. I was the
           one who got you into this mess.

Andre points the gun at Lloyd.

                       HARRY
           No, wait, do me first. I'm the one
           who stole your girl, Lloyd. I eserve
           it.

                                                          115.

Andre SIGHS and points the gun at Harry. Then, as Mary and
Lloyd look on in horror, he FIRES TWICE. Harry grabs his
stomach and falls off the bed to the floor.

                      LLOYD
          Jesus Christ! You killed my best
          friend, you bastard!

Andre smiles.

                      ANDRE
          If it's any consolation, you're about
          to be reunited.

He aims the gun at Lloyd, COCKS THE TRIGGER. Suddenly, a
SHOT RINGS OUT and the gun is blown out of Andre's hand.

ON THE FLOOR - Harry is very much alive and pointing a pistol
at the stunned Nicholas Andre.

                      LLOYD
          Harry! You're alive!

Just them, the door BURSTS OPEN and SEVERAL POLICE OFFICERS
storm in with their weapons drawn.

                      COP #1
          Get your hands up, asshole!

Lloyd and Harry throw their hands into the air. A stunned
Andre turns to see six guns pointing at his head. He
reluctantly raises his hands. Mary and Lloyd are flabbergasted
by the turn of events.

There's a sudden commotion in the room. Pushing her way
through the mass of cops comes the Athletic Beauty. She
flashes an ID.

                      ATHLETIC BEAUTY
          Special Officer Kathryn Frick. Federal
          Bureau of Investigation.

                      LLOYD
              (dumbstruck)
          You gotta be kidding.

                      ATHLETIC BEAUTY
          Good work, Harry.

Lloyd looks to his friend, confused. Harry opens his shirt,
revealing a BULLET-PROOF VEST.

                                                       116.

                      HARRY
          She grabbed me down in the lobby and
          explained what was up. They slapped
          this on me and gave me a gun.

                      LLOYD
              (to Athletic Beauty)
          But how did you...?

                      ATHLETIC   BEAUTY
          We've been following   you two all the
          way from Providence.   Mr. and Mrs.
          Swanson had a homing   device plated
          in the briefcase.

The guys glance guiltily at one another.

                      HARRY
          Yeah, about that dough...

                      ATHLETIC BEAUTY
          Every bill was counterfeit and marked.

Harry and Lloyd EXHALE A SIGH OF RELIEF.

                                                     CUT TO:

EXT. HOTEL DANBURY - NIGHT

There's a swarm of ONLOOKERS as Andre and J.P. Shay are
hustled into a police car and driven away. While Mary TALKS
to the police, Harry and Lloyd stare at her lovingly.

                      LLOYD
          She's something, ain't she, Har?
                      HARRY
          You were right, Lloyd. She was
          efinitely worth the trip.

                      LLOYD
          Guess we have to admit it, she was
          too good for us.

Just then, a cruiser pulls up and Mary's husband jumps out.

                      MELVIN
          Oh god, baby, I missed you!

Harry and Lloyd stare in wonder as MEL GIBSON climbs out of
the car. Mary and Mel embrace, then Mel turns to the guys.

                                                         117.

                      MELVIN (CONT'D)
          I can't thank you enough, fellas. It
          was so darn dank in that well, I
          really thought it would be the death
          of me.

Harry and Lloyd are too stunned to respond. They look at
each other, and we

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

INT. LOBBY - HOTEL DANBURY - THE NEXT DAY

Lloyd and Harry come out of the elevator with their meager
luggage, but this time nobody rushes to their aid.

EXT. HOTEL DANBURY - DAY

The guys EXIT the hotel and approach the Bell Captain,
Barnard.

                      HARRY
          Hey, Barney...

                      BELL CAPTAIN
          Yes, gentlemen?

                      LLOYD
          Look, we just wanted to say that we
          appreciate all you did for us during
          our stay.

                      HARRY
          And we're, um, sorry about the money
          we gave you turning out to be phony.
                      BELL CAPTAIN
          Don't worry about it, gentlemen. The
          Swanson family has promised to
          reimburse everyone.

This seems to please Lloyd and Harry. The hearse is delivered
to the front door.

                      LLOYD
          Well, anyway, thanks again for
          everything.

They turn to go, but Barnard CALLS TO THEM:

                      BARNARD
          Where are you two headed?

                                                       118.

                      HARRY
          I dunno. I'm sure we'll find a trailer
          camp somewhere to call home.

                      BARNARD
          Why not right here?

Harry and Lloyd look at each other, confused.

                      LLOYD
          This joint is a little out of our
          budget, Barney.

                      BARNARD
              (smiling)
          Oh, I think we might be able to find
          you a free room somewhere -- after
          all, like you once told me, we're
          all from the same mold.
              (winks)
          You just don't have any dough right
          now.

The guys are STUNNED by Barnard's generous offer.

                      HARRY
          Are you on the level?

                      BARNARD
          Absolutely. We'll just slide you
          into one of the employee rooms...

The guys beam at this.

                      BARNARD (CONT'D)
          ...Provided, of course, you don't
          mind working one or two afternoons a
          week.

Harry and Lloyd lock eyes. Then:

                      LLOYD
          You know what, Barney, I think we'll
          take out chances down the road.

Barnard shakes his head as the two fools climb into their
hearse and drive off.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

As the hearse drives down the road, we hear V.O.:

                                                       119.

                      HARRY
              (v.o.)
          Since we're finished elbow-rubbing,
          what next, lloyd?

                      LLOYD
              (v.o.)
          I say we head due south and try a
          little nose-rubbing with some of
          them slinky eskimo babes.

                      HARRY
              (v.o.)
          Now you're talking my language. You
          know I got a weakness for blondes.

As they head toward their next adventure, the CAMERA PULLS
UP, UP, UP...

     BLACK

     FADE IN to the dark eyes of the mysterious face of
     the REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO, who sits against smooth
     black rock. Her eyes are deep blue-within-blue and
     her skin is a haunting translucent white. Her voice
     ECHOES as if in a great cavern.

                 REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO
               We are the secret of the Universe.

                 REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO
               We are the secret of the Universe. We know
               of spice...the spice called melange...the
               greatest treasure in the Universe. It
               exists on only one planet - ours Arrakis,
               Dune. We know of spice and the Bene
               Gesserit sisterhood's selective breeding
               plan of ninety generations to produce the
               Kwisatz Haderach, the one the spice will
               awaken.

                 REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO
               And now the prophecy...

     Silence...then a powerful low organ NOTE resounding
     in the cavernous space.

            REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO (CONT'D)
               He will come...the voice from the outer
               world, bringing the holy war, the Jihad,
               which will cleanse the Universe and bring
               us out of darkness. He will have been born
               of a Bene Gesserit mother.
--
     The Reverend Mother continues speaking of the
     Prophecy, but we do not hear it. The huge wind organ
     BLOWS louder and louder, obscuring her voice.

     The picture FADES.

1B.  KAITAIN - A SCENE FROM SPACE

     Home planet of House Corrino and Shadam IV, Emperor
     of the known universe.

2.   INT. DROP - NIGHT

     FADE IN to:

     ...interior of one drop of water. The image changes
     subtly.

2A.  EXT. - DROP - NIGHT

     PULL BACK to a shot revealing the outside of the
     drop. There is a distant ROARING and within the drop
     we can see the distorted image of a space ship
     landing on a sophisticated landing field.

3A. EXT. LANDING FIELD - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT

     On the dark landing field, chemicals spill out of
     the ship in troughs and tank-suited Guildsmen begin
     to swarm out of a hatch opening.

7.   INT. THRONE ROOM - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT

     The EMPEROR is surrounded by crowds of COURTIERS in
     his Throne Room.

     Suddenly a GUARD enters from a small door and
     quickly crosses to ANOTHER GUARD. A warning SOUND
     begins. The Emperor turns nervously. Guards quickly
     begin to clear the large room. Several women are
     rushed toward us to a door beyond. One of the woman,
     IRULAN, stops and turns back for a worried, caring
     look to her father, the Emperor.

                         IRULAN
               Father.
--
                         EMPEROR
               Irulan.

     She sees that SARDAUKAR OFFICERS are surrounding him
     now, speaking to him. Irulan turns and leaves. The
     Emperor moves away from his officers to the center
     of the now-empty room. He drops his golden robe from
     his shoulders. He stands in his elegant black
     uniform, thinking.

     The Reverend Mother is ushered in and the Sardaukar
     Officers leave her alone with the Emperor.

                         EMPEROR
                    (quickly)
               A Third Stage Guild Navigator will be here
               within minutes!

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               We felt his presence.

                         EMPEROR
               I shall want telepathy during his visit
               and a report when we're finished.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               Their minds are so.... They move in
               strange directions....

                         EMPEROR
               Yes?

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               Forced spice evolution of humans changes
               many things.... I must sit close to him.

                         EMPEROR
               He will not permit anyone but me to see
               him. You must be outside this room.... Do
               what you can.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               I am your Truthsayer, my lord...
                    (sensing something outside the room)
               He is here, my lord.

     Under the carved inscription "Law is the Ultimate
     Science", the doors to the Emperor's chambers slide
     open and FIFTY GUILDSMEN wheel in a forty-foot long
     giant black box. One of the Guildsmen addresses the
     Emperor through a translating device.

               The Bene Gesserit witch must leave.

     The Emperor looks to the Reverend Mother.

                         EMPEROR
               Leave us.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               Yes, my Lord.

                         EMPEROR
                    (after she has gone)
               We are alone...

8.   INT. HALLWAY - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT

     The Reverend Mother enters through doors and takes a
     seat on a chair just outside the door. She closes
     her eyes.

9.   INT. THRONE ROOM - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT

     Inside the Emperor's chamber, the TANK-SUITED
     GUILDSMEN are arranging themselves in a "V"
     formation around the box. Suddenly the box opens,
     slowly and beautifully revealing a huge, thick glass
     tank. Inside the tank floats a THIRD STAGE NAVIGATOR
     twenty feet long, much like a cross between a pasty,
     pale human being and a fleshy grasshopper.

     The tank is filled with swirling orange spice-gas,
     and Guildsmen continuously vacuum up the toxic
     chemical spills dripping from under the tank.
     Suddenly the Guild Navigator swims towards the
     Emperor. His head is enormous and fleshy, like a
     huge grasshopper head -- the eyes are totally deep
     blue. His voice is a high, fleshy whispering and an
     intricate electrical apparatus in the front of the
     tank translates into English and broadcasts it into
     the room.

                        NAVIGATOR
               We have just folded space from Ix...

                         EMPEROR
                    (extremely nervous)
               Yes?... How was your journey?

                        NAVIGATOR
                    (after a long pause)
               Many machines on Ix... new machines.

                         EMPEROR
               Oh yes?
--
                        NAVIGATOR
               Better than those on Richesse.. You are
               transparent... I see many things... I see
               plans within plans.

                         EMPEROR
               Is there a problem?... Usually there is a
               problem when one of you makes a visit.

     No answer.

                        NAVIGATOR
                    (finally)
               The answer is within the problem...

10.  INT. HALLWAY - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT

     Outside the Emperor's chamber the Reverend Mother
     sits, her eyes closed, straining.

11.  INT. THRONE ROOM - EMPEROR'S PALACE - REVEREND
MOTHER'S MENTAL IMAGE - NIGHT

     A very blurred scene of the Emperor with the Guild
     Navigator. She is not getting the English version
     but a much different language version which is
     fascinating to listen to. A lilting, sing-song
     monologue.

12.  INT. THRONE ROOM - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT

                        NAVIGATOR
               I see two Great Houses -- House Atreides,
               House Harkonnen -- feuding... I see you
               behind it.

                         EMPEROR
               Yes.

     The Navigator breathes the spice-gas heavily and
     swishes gently in his tank.

                        NAVIGATOR
               You must share with us.
--
                         EMPEROR
               The Atreides house is building a secret
               army!... using a technique unknown to
               us... a technique involving sound. The
               Duke is becoming more popular in the
               Landsraad... he could threaten me.... I
               have ordered House Atreides to occupy
               Arrakis to mine the spice... thus
               replacing their enemies the Harkonnens....
               House Atreides will not refuse because of
               the tremendous power they think they will
               gain. Then, at an appointed time Baron
               Harkonnen will return to Arrakis and
               launch a sneak attack on House Atreides...
               I have promised the Baron five legions of
               my Sardaukar terror troops.

                        NAVIGATOR
               So the Harkonnens will rid you of House
               Atreides...

                         EMPEROR
               Yes.

13.  INT. HALLWAY - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT

     Outside, the Reverend Mother is seeing the scene
     mentally. She suddenly sees and flinches.

14.  INT. THRONE ROOM - EMPEROR'S PALACE - REVEREND
MOTHER'S MENTAL IMAGE - NIGHT

     The Guild Navigator turns toward her and comes very
     close to her. We hear the Navigator speak to her.

                        NAVIGATOR
                    (to Reverend Mother, mentally)
               Reverend Mother... I will give you the
               Tleilaxu Path.

                 REVEREND MOTHER (V.O.)
                    (an excited whisper)
               A chance for escape? But for whom?

15.  INT. THRONE ROOM - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT

                         EMPEROR
               Can you hear me?... If this visit has
               anything to do with spice...
--
     The Guild Navigator shudders and swishes quite
     violently in his tank.

                        NAVIGATOR
               LISTEN TO ME!! The spice must flow... the
               spice has given me accelerated evolution
               for four thousand years... it has enabled
               you to live two hundred years... the spice
               helps make the sapho juice, which gives
               the red-lipped mentats the ability to be
               living computers... the secret side of
               spice... the water of life.

16.  INT. HALLWAY - EMPEROR'S PALACE  - NIGHT

                 REVEREND MOTHER (V.O.)
               He shouldn't speak of this...

15.  BACK TO SCENE

                        NAVIGATOR
               ...gives the Bene Gesserit sisterhood the
               metaphysical ability to see beyond...to
               have superior powers... Our power to fold
               space is in the spice... Without us, your
               empire would be lost on isolated scattered
               planets... You would be lost.

                         EMPEROR
               I can assure you...

                        NAVIGATOR
               Do not interrupt!!! Do not speak lightly
               of the spice... ONE SMALL POINT...

16.  BACK TO SCENE

                 REVEREND MOTHER (V.O.)
               Here it comes...

                        NAVIGATOR
               We ourselves... foresee a slight problem
               within House Atreides.... Paul.... Paul
               Atreides.

                         EMPEROR
               You mean, of course, Duke Leto Atreides...
               his father.

               Each day the palms along the outer wall of
               the Palace at Arrakeen consume enough
               water to sustain the lives of one hundred
               men. The palms were placed by the
               Harkonnens to flaunt their water wealth in
               front of the city Fremen.

25.  BACK TO SCENE

                          PAUL
               Where are the Harkonnens from here?

25A. INSERT - FILMBOOK

     The star fields and galaxies move slightly then.

                       PAUL (V.O.)
                    (whispering)
               There!... Geidi Prime and the Baron
               Harkonnen... the enemy.

25.  BACK TO SCENE

     In the background, FOOTSTEPS grow louder, pounding
     on thick wooden floors. THUFIR HAWAT, GURNEY HALLECK
     and DR. YUEH enter. Paul has his back to the door.
     Thufir suddenly looks perturbed when he notices
     this.

                          PAUL
                    (without turning)
               I know, Thufir, I'm sitting with my back
               to the door.

     Hawat suppresses a smile.

                      PAUL (CONT'D)
               I heard you, Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming
               down the hall.

                         THUFIR
               Those sounds could be imitated.

                          PAUL
               I'd know the difference.

     Paul rises and turns to face them.
--
                         THUFIR
                    (inner voice)
               Yes. Perhaps he would at that.

                          PAUL
               My father sent you to test me. Music then?

     Thufir scowls.

                         GURNEY
               No music. I'm packing this for the
               crossing. Shield practice.

                          PAUL
               Shield practice? Gurney... we had practice
               -- this morning..... I'm not in the mood.

                         GURNEY
                    (angered)
               Not in the mood?! Mood's a thing for
               cattle and love play... not fighting.

                          PAUL
               I'm sorry Gurney.

                         GURNEY
               Not sorry enough.

     Gurney draws his knife.

25B. SHIELD EFFECT - THE FIGHT

     Gurney activates his body shield, sending a
     shimmering FORCE FIELD around his body. He advances
     swiftly toward Paul. Paul snaps on his FORCE FIELD,
     draws his knife and jumps back, collecting himself
     hurriedly for the fight.

                         GURNEY
                    (his voice sounding strange through
                    the forcefield)
               Guard yourself for true!

     Gurney leaps high, then forward, pressing a furious
     attack. Paul falls back. The shield edges CRACK
     loudly as they touch each other.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               What's gotten into Gurney? He's not
               faking.
     Paul presses forward and the fight moves quickly
     around the room. The smell of ozone grows stronger
     as the shields hit and SPARK off one another. Paul
     directs a parry downwards, turns, and leads Gurney
     against the table, plunging at just the right moment
     to pin Gurney against the table top with his blade
     right at Gurney's neck.

                          PAUL
                    (strange shielded voice)
               Is this what you seek?

                         GURNEY
                    (strange shielded voice)
               Good... the slow blade penetrates the
               shield... but look down.

     Paul looks and sees Gurney's blade at his groin.

                     GURNEY (CONT'D)
               We'd have joined each other in death.
               However, you did seem to finally get the
               "mood".

                          PAUL
               Would you really have drawn my blood?

                         GURNEY
               If you'd fought one whit below your
               abilities I'd have scratched you a good
               one.

     Paul stands and snaps off his shield as does Gurney.

25.  BACK TO SCENE

                          PAUL
               Things have been so serious here lately.

                         GURNEY
               Yes. I sensed the play in you lad, but
               this can no longer be play. Tomorrow we
               leave for Arrakis! Arrakis is real. The
               Harkonnens are real.

     Thufir, Yueh, Gurney and Paul stare at each other
     for a moment in silence. Dr. Yueh moves forward and
     begins to take Paul's pulse rate and to collect
     other data with a small black machine.

                          PAUL
               Dr. Yueh, do you have any information on
               the worms of Arrakis?
--
                        DR. YUEH
               I have obtained a filmbook on a small
               specimen... only 125 meters long.

                          PAUL
               Only?!

     They smile at each other.

                        DR. YUEH
               There are have been documented sightings
               of worms as large as 450 meters in the
               deep desert -- far from where we'll be in
               Arakeen.... The desert belt and the south
               polar regions are marked forbidden....
               Why?

                          PAUL
               The storms and the worms. Is it true, that
               the sand can blow at seven hundred
               kilometers per hour?

                          YUEH
               It can render flesh to dust in minutes.
               And these dry winds can generate
               tremendous static electricity in the
               atmosphere. Our body shields won't have
               enough power to operate in the open air on
               Arrakis.

                          PAUL
               Well, how do the Fremen survive there?

                          YUEH
               We don't know much about the Fremen...
               They live in the deep desert... some of
               them in the cities and they have blue-
               within-blue eyes...

                          PAUL
                    (smiling)
               The eyes -- yes, yes... saturation of the
               blood by the spice -- melange. Could the
               spice affect us in other ways?

                         THUFIR
               Many dangers exist on Arrakis. For one, we
               know the Harkonnens would not have given
               up their CHOAM company contract so easily.

                          PAUL
                    (rising)
               The Harkonnens are our enemies, yes... but
               behind them, I suspect, is the Emperor.
--
                         THUFIR
               You will make a formidable Duke!

     Paul bows.

                     THUFIR (CONT'D)
               Now remember... the first step in avoiding
               a trap is knowing of its existence.

                          PAUL
               I know.  But if it is a trap then why are
               we going?

                         THUFIR
               We have our new army.
                    (in the same breath)
               Dr. Yueh, put the weirding module on him.

     Thufir, noticing a SQUAD OF GUARDS at the other end
     of the training room, calls out to them.

                     THUFIR (CONT'D)
               Clear and lock the room.

     Gurney activates a series of locks.  LIGHTS GLOWS
     above each doorway.

                     THUFIR (CONT'D)
               Activate a fighter.

25C. ROBOT FIGHT

     Suddenly a FIGHTER ROBOT lowers from the ceiling.
     As the robot begins to rotate and go through several
     frightening, complicated movements, Dr. Yueh places
     a plastic device around Paul's neck.  He tightens it
     around the Adam's apple above Paul's voice box.
     Paul turns and emits a very strange, powerful sound
     through the weirding module as he rushes towards the
     robot.

                         GURNEY
                    (to Yueh)
               Precise control....

26.  INT. HALLWAY - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

     The hallway is empty in the foreground but in the
     distance a changing of the guard is seen.
--
26A. through 26B.   (Deleted)

27.  INT. HALLWAY - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

     Paul walks down the stairway.  In the distance,
     moving troops are packing Atreides belongings.
     Beyond, Paul sees some troops carrying a large
     bull's head.  The horns are covered with dried
     blood.

                          PAUL
               The bull that killed my grandfather... is
               this an evil omen?

     Suddenly, DUNCAN IDAHO appears from behind the giant
     black head.

                          PAUL
                    (happily)
               Duncan!

                         DUNCAN
               Paul.
                    (they shake hands)
               I was on my way to say goodbye to you.  I
               have to go on ahead.

                          PAUL
               Why?  I wish you were coming with us.

                         DUNCAN
               It's something for your father.  He wants
               to talk to you.
                    (places hand on Paul's chest)
               I'll see you in Arrakis.  May the hand of
               God be with you.

                          PAUL
               May the hand of God be with us all,
               Duncan.

28.  EXT. CLIFF WALL - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

     Paul walks to meet his father near the wall.

                          PAUL
                    (diffident)
               Father.

                        DUKE LETO
               Thank you for joining me, Paul.
                    (voice tired)
               It will be good to get to our new home and
               have all this upset behind us.

28B. DUKE LETO AND PAUL AGAINST SEA

     They look out over the sea.  A huge wave crashes
     below.

     The Duke turns to Paul.

                   DUKE LETO (CONT'D)
                    (inner voice)
               My son.
                    (out loud)
               Thufir Hawat has served House Atreides
               three generations....  He swears you are
               the finest student he's ever taught.
               Yueh, Gurney and Duncan say the same....
               It makes me feel very proud...

                          PAUL
               I want you to be proud of me.

     Paul smiles up at his father.  The WIND blows the
     Duke's hair and behind him stands the castle and the
     green and black Atreides banner against the night
     sky beyond.  The RAIN starts again -- lightly.  Paul
     takes a closer look at the Atreides banner moving in
     the wind.

                        DUKE LETO
                    (studying the dark sea below)
               I'll miss the sea... but a person needs
               new experiences... they jar something deep
               inside, allowing him to grow.  Without
               change, something sleeps inside us... and
               seldom awakens... The sleeper must awaken.

     Paul's attention goes to his father's hand where he
     sees the Duke's signet ring.  Again he smiles at his
     father.

                                                FADE TO:

29. through 29A.    (Deleted)

30.  INT. PAUL'S ROOM - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

     Paul is sweating during his sleep and WHISPERS as if
     struggling with some disturbing thought.
--
                          PAUL
               Arrakis... Dune... Desert
               Planet...Arrakis... Desert Planet...
               moving... moving.

31.  DARK WATER - MENTAL IMAGE

     We see Paul's dream. It is very dark.

                       PAUL (V.O.)
               Arrakis... Dune... Desert Planet.

     Suddenly a drop falls into the black, and white hot
     widening rings appear on the dark water's surface.

     Darkness again. Two moons rise in the darkness. As
     the second appears:

                          VOICE
               The second moon, your moon...

31A. INT. RESERVOIR - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT

     Dark again. A figure turns toward Paul. It is a
     BEAUTIFUL GIRL in deep shadow. She speaks.

                     BEAUTIFUL GIRL
               Tell me of your homeworld, Usul.

32.  INT. PAUL'S ROOM - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

     CU Paul's face in fitful sleep.

33.  EXT. COURTYARD - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

     In a small stone courtyard, the back-lit figure of a
     woman moves towards us through the heavy RAIN and
     darkness. As she nears us, the large, protective
     glowglobe overtakes her and in an instant we see a
     beautiful woman -- JESSICA.

                         JESSICA
                    (inner voice)
               I  know she has come to test him... no man
               has ever been tested with the box... only
               Bene Gesserit women. I may lose my son.

     The doors open, she meets the Reverend Mother Gaius
     Helen Mohiam (the Emperor's truthsayer) and takes
     her back toward the Castle. The rain rushes loudly
     into the storm drains.
--
34.  INT. PAUL'S ROOM - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

                          PAUL
                    (whispering again)
               Arrakis... Dune... Desert planet...
               moving... moving.

     CU Paul's face.

     Paul's eyes snap open. He hears footsteps outside
     his door. As the door opens he closes his eyes,
     however, and he pretends to be asleep. Jessica and
     the Reverend Mother enter and stand in the doorway
     looking at him.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               We'll salvage what we can... but I can
               tell you.. dear God... for the father...
               nothing.

     Jessica turns to the Reverend Mother, stunned! She
     turns back to look at Paul. Her hands tremble.

                REVEREND MOTHER (CONT'D)
               Did you really think that you could bear
               the Kwisatz Haderach?... How dare you!

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               My greatest student... and my greatest
               disappointment.... He's awake!... He's
               listening to us.
                    (considering)
               Good... Ready yourself, young Paul
               Atreides... I want to see you in your
               mother's chamber in one quarter of an
               hour.

     She turns and walks away. Jessica remains at the
     door and calls out to Paul in the darkness.

                         JESSICA
               Paul?... This is very important...

     Jessica leaves, closing the door behind her. Paul
     sits up in bed.

                          PAUL
               Kwisatz Haderach?... For the father...
               nothing?

35.  INT. JESSICA'S CHAMBER - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

     Jessica and the Reverend Mother enter. It is quite
     dark. Jessica WHISPERS a code number and a glowglobe
     LIGHTS on a very dim setting.
--
                     REVEREND MOTHER
                    (angrily)
               Jessica... You were told to bear only
               daughters to the Atreides... Jessica!

                         JESSICA
               It meant so much to him...

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               You thought only of a Duke's desire for a
               son?... Desires don't figure in this! An
               Atreides daughter could have been wed to a
               Harkonnen heir and sealed the breach. We
               may lose both blood lines now.

                         JESSICA
               I vowed never to regret my decision. I'll
               pay for my own mistakes.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               And your son will pay with you.

42.  INT. DUKE LETO'S QUARTERS - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

     Under a dim glowglobe, the DUKE is writing a note on
     a scroll-like piece of paper.

     Finishing reading, the Duke seals the message in a
     cylinder and presses his signet ring, with a red
     hawk symbol of House of Atreides, into a hole, which
     seals the cylinder with a swift HISSING.

     He pauses, studying the metal tube. With a VOICE
     COMMAND, he extinguishes the glowglobe above him. He
     leans back in his chair as lightning flashes outside
     the window.

     FADE TO:

35.  BACK TO SCENE

     Paul enters the room and Jessica closes the door
     behind them.

                         JESSICA
               Paul, this is the Reverend Mother Gaius
               Helen Mohiam. She is going to... observe
               you...
                    (to Reverend Mother)
               Please...
--
                     REVEREND MOTHER
               Jessica, you know it must be done. I
               enjoin you to stand guard at the door and
               practice the meditation of peace.

                         JESSICA
               Your Reverence.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               What does she fear?
                    (out loud)
               What about my Father?

                         JESSICA
               Paul... please, Paul... listen to the
               Reverend Mother and do what she tells you.

     Jessica leaves the room. The Reverend Mother speaks
     to Paul using The Voice, a Bene Gesserit training
     which permits an adept to control others merely by
     selected tone shadings of the voice. It sounds as if
     two people are talking -- one normal and the other
     gutteral and slightly electronic. The effect is
     strange, yet subtle.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
                    (using The Voice)
               Now you come here.

     Paul finds he cannot help but obey her, yet he
     fights her controlling him.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               She's using The Voice.
                    (out loud)
               No.

     She sees him struggling.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
                    (inner voice)
               Some strength there. Surprising!
                    (out loud)
               Come here.

     The Reverend Mother holds up a green metal cube.

                REVEREND MOTHER (CONT'D)
               See this... Put your right hand in the
               box.

     Paul stares at the hole in the box.
--
                          PAUL
               What's in the box?

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               Pain.

     Just then, she raises one hand to his neck. Paul
     sees a glint of metal. He tries to back away.

                REVEREND MOTHER (CONT'D)
                    (The Voice)
               STOP! Put your hand in the box.

     Paul's hand goes in. Fear passes over his face.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               The Voice again.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               I hold at your neck the gom jabbar. Don't
               pull away or you'll feel that poison. A
               Duke's son must know about many poisons --
               this one kills only animals.

                          PAUL
               Are you suggesting a Duke's son is an
               animal?

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               Let us say I suggest you may be human.
               Your awareness may be powerful enough to
               control your instincts. Your instincts
               will be to remove your hand from the box.
               If you do so you will die. You will feel
               an itching -- there... see? Now the
               itching becomes burning... heat, upon
               heat, upon heat.

                          PAUL
                    (whispering)
               It burns.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               SILENCE... SILENCE.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)(struggling to compose
                    himself)
               I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer.
               Fear is the little death that brings total
               obliteration. I will face my fear... I
               will permit it to pass over me and through
               me.
--
     The Reverend Mother moves her face up to his. Her
     ancient face with its metal teeth gleaming inches
     away breathes hotly. She is smiling.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               You feel the flesh crisping?

36.  THE HAND - PAUL'S MENTAL IMAGE

     Paul's inner mind sees his hand on fire with all
     sorts of sores. The skin is bubbling.

37.  INT. JESSICA'S CHAMBER - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               Flesh dropping off.

38.  THE HAND - PAUL'S MENTAL IMAGE

     He pictures this. The destruction of his hand is
     complete -- now only blood spurts out and burns.

39.  INT. JESSICA'S CHAMBER - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

     Paul's face registers extreme pain.

                          PAUL
                    (cannot help the explosion)
               THE PAIN!

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               NO!! ENOUGH!! Kull wahad! No woman child
               ever withstood that much. I must have
               wanted you to fail. Take your hand out of
               the box and look at it, young human.... Do
               it!

     Paul pulls his hand out of the box. No sign of
     anything wrong. He turns his hand, flexes his
     fingers. He looks to the Reverend Mother.

                REVEREND MOTHER (CONT'D)
                    (explaining)
               Pain by nerve induction... A human can
               resist any pain. Our test is crisis and
               observation.

                          PAUL
               I see the truth of it.
--
                     REVEREND MOTHER
                    (inner voice)
               Could he be the one?... Maybe... but will
               he be ours to control?
                    (out loud)
               You know when people speak the truth?

                          PAUL
               I know it.

     Suddenly the Reverend Mother holds her hand against
     Paul's head. She closes her eyes.

40.  INT. RESERVOIR - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT - REVEREND
MOTHER'S MENTAL IMAGE

     She sees a blurred image of Paul's earlier dream.
     She sees the beautiful girl turn. She hears a
     muffled voice say "Tell me of your homeworld, Usul".

41.  INT. JESSICA'S CHAMBER - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               Your mother wants you to tell me about
               your dreams. I only want to know one
               thing.... Do they come true?

                          PAUL
               Not all of them... I know which ones will.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach.

                          PAUL
               What is it?

                     REVEREND MOTHER
                    (profoundly)
               The person who can be many places at
               once... the one who bridges space and
               time.... He will look where we cannot.

                          PAUL
               Where?

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               Do you know of the Water of Life?... the
               Truthsayer drug?

                          PAUL
               I have heard of it.
--
                     REVEREND MOTHER
               It is very dangerous... very painful. The
               Bene Gesserit sisterhood drink it to see
               within.... There is a place terrifying to
               us... to women. It is said a man will
               come... the Kwisatz Haderach... he will go
               where we cannot... Many men have tried...

                          PAUL
               Did they try and fail?

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               They tried and died....
                    (she calls out loudly)
               Jessica!

     Jessica enters immediately and sees with great
     relief that Paul is still active.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               I sense your teachings in him. Ignore the
               regular order of training. His safety
               requires The Voice.

                          PAUL
               I've heard enough of my safety... What
               about my father?... I heard you talking.
               You speak as if he was dead. Well, he
               isn't!

                         JESSICA
               Paul!

     She tries to hold him.

                          PAUL
               Well he isn't... and he won't die... Tell
               me he won't die!

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               What can be done has been done.

                          PAUL
               MOTHER! Tell me!

     The Reverend Mother covers herself and moves quickly
     to the door.

46.  EXT. GEIDI PRIME - DAY

     HOME PLANET OF HOUSE HARKONNEN - As seen from space,
     the black planet as we saw it in Paul's filmbook.

47.  EXT. GEIDI PRIME - DAY

     The surface of the planet is a vast sea of black
     oil. A small cable car traverses high above the sea
     toward a gigantic black city in the shape of a
     rectangular box over 100 stories high. Before the
     city there are rows of huge black towering steel
     heads atop massive furnaces. SMOKE billows out of
     their mouths.

48.  INT. CABLE CAR - GIEDI PRIME - DAY

     Inside the cable car stands PITER. In one hand he
     holds the cylinder with DUKE Leto's ring imprint.

                          PITER
               It is by will alone I set my mind in
               motion.
               It is by the juice of Sapho that thoughts
               acquire speed -
               The lips acquire stains -
               The stains become a warning -
               It is by will alone I set my mind in
               motion.

48A. INT. GREEN PORCELAIN ROOM - GEIDI PRIME

     Somewhere in the interior of Geidi Prime, we are in
     a green porcelain room. Two large Harkonnen
     soldiers, using large hoses, are washing down the
     walls and floors of the room. WE MOVE DOWN into the
     water rushing along the floor towards troughs.
     Closer, WE SEE bits of flesh, hair, and blood.

49.  EXT. GEIDI PRIME - DAY

     The car zooms past gigantic faces, and the furnaces
     far below ROAR with tremendous power. The city now
     looms gigantic and overpowering -- millions of
     electrical cables stretch off the top into dark
     energy taps above the city.
--
50.  INT. GEIDI PRIME - DAY

     Inside the city the cable car passes into a huge
     inner chamber filled with open-topped lime green
     porcelain rooms with tremendous electrical lines
     criss-crossing above.

51.  (Deleted)

52.  INT. BARON'S ROOM - GEIDI PRIME - DAY

     In front of a huge steam boiler, the cable car stops
     and Piter gets out, steps down steel stairs and
     enters a porcelain room where the Baron is being
     treated by a DOCTOR for sores on his face and body.
     The doctor uses a lasbeam on a big sore on the
     Baron's lips. The Baron is sickly and hugely fat and
     sweaty and looks like he has been sickly for some
     time. He turns to Piter as he enters the room.

                          PITER
               My Lord!

                          BARON
               Piter.

     Piter moves up to the Baron.

                          PITER
               The Atreides will be leaving Caladan soon,
               Baron, and I have here your answer from
               Duke Leto.

                          BARON
               What does Leto say, Piter?

                          PITER
               He wishes to inform you that Vendetta --
               as he puts it, using the ancient tongue,
               the art of Kanly -- is still alive. He
               does not wish to meet or speak with you.

                          BARON
                    (swallowing; angry)
               I made my peace gesture... the forms of
               Kanly have been obeyed.

     He throws down the cylinder.

                          PITER
               As you instructed me, I have enlightened
               your nephews concerning my plan t...
--
                          BARON
               My plan!

                          PITER
               The plan to crush the Atreides.  Feyd,
               Rabban... go quietly... no other great
               house of the Landsraad must ever know of
               the Emperor's aid to the Baron.  The
               entire Landsraad would turn against the
               Baron and the Emperor.

                         DOCTOR
               Put the pick in there Pete
               And turn it round real neat.

     His assistant does so.

     Rabban breaks open a squood (living food).  The
     squood makes a tiny SCREAM, then Rabban drinks the
     blood and bodily fluids.  He throws the empty
     container of tiny animal meat into the dark water
     trough running through the center of the room.
     Across the room, TWO HARKONNEN SOLDIERS enter,
     holding big guns on a BOY who is wearing white
     pants.  The Baron smiles when he sees the boy, who
     is deeply afraid.  The guards force the boy to
     arrange violet flowers on a stand by the far wall
     opposite the Baron.

                          BARON
                    (as the Baron watches the boy)
               You're so beautiful my Baron
               Your skin, love to me
               Your diseases lovingly cared for
               For all eternity.

                          BARON
               I will have Arrakis back for myself... he
               who controls the Spice, controls the
               universe... and what Piter didn't tell you
               is we have control of someone who is very
               close to Duke Leto.  This person... this
               traitor... will be worth more to us than
               ten legions of Sardaukar.

                          FEYD
               Who is the traitor?

                          BARON
                    (laughs)
               I won't tell you who the traitor is or
               when we'll attack.  However, the Duke will
               die before these eyes and he'll know that
               it is I -- Baron Vladimir Harkonnen -- who
               encompasses his doom.
--
     The Baron gives a hand signal and seven gates in the
     wall open, emitting tremendous SOUNDS.  Suddenly the
     Baron begins to float straight up, twenty-five feet
     in the air.  It is a frightening sight.  He floats
     down under the giant, humming electrical tube light
     and rubs his head and body with a black fluid which
     drips from tiny holes in either side of the pink
     glow.  Feyd and Rabban watch nervously.  The
     Attendants stand completely still with fear.

     The Baron swoops down to the Boy, who stands
     petrified.  The Harkonnen guards smile nervously as
     they step slightly backwards.  The boy begins
     SCREAMING as the Baron pulls the boy's heart plug,
     located in his chest.  The violet flowers are bumped
     and disarrayed by the violence which ensues.  Then
     the Baron turns smiling to Feyd as the SOUNDS
     continue to roar.

52C. EXT. ATREIDES SHIP - CALADAN - DAY

     A DRUM CORPS pounds out a powerful cadence in front
     of a water and cannon show as the Duke, Paul and
     Jessica mount the steel stairs to their ship.  In
     the doorway, they turn back for a final look.

     The Duke places a hand on Paul's shoulder.  We see
     the signet ring.  Jessica is there.  She tries to
     get Paul to look at her but he scowls and turns to
     his father.

                         JESSICA
                    (turning away)
                    (inner voice)
               I must not fear.  Fear is the mind-
               killer... the little death that brings
               total obliteration...

     The door of the spaceship closes.

53.  EXT. HEIGHLINER - SPACE

     3,415 Atreides ships are approaching the Guild
     Heighliner, which is staggeringly colossal.  The
     Atreides ships look like dots next to the sun.  The
     Duke's ship enters the frame and moves toward the
     Heighliner.

     Paul, Jessica and Duke Leto look out the forward
     viewing glass as tiny lights move outside in the
     darkness. They hear and feel their ship stop with a
     huge, echoing, metallic jolt. They look at each
     other in the silence which follows.

57.  INT. CONTROL ROOM - HEIGHLINER - SPACE

     We pass through electrical shields into a 2,000-foot
     high control room filled with orange spice gas. On
     the floor are large gratings covering an exhaust and
     filtering system. Tons of spice gas are being
     converted into the clouds of gas along a wall of
     machinery. From within a dark metal tunnel comes a
     Guild Navigator. He exits the tunnel and swims
     through the gas 1,000 feet to a six-dimensional
     layered miniature replica of the entire Universe.
     The Navigator emits a long piece of light from his
     mouth which travels to one edge of the Universe and
     changes into a likeness of the planet Caladan. The
     Navigator turns and emits another piece of light
     which travels to the opposite side of the Universe.
     It changes into a likeness of Arrakis. The Navigator
     begins to put his slender fingers in amongst the
     stars and he emits SOUNDS and bursts of light into
     the mass of stars and galaxies. The Universe begins
     to vibrate and elongate, then to curve. Electrical
     lightening traverses from Caladan to Arrakis as the
     Universe bends into a U-shape. Arrakis submerges
     deep into the light. The navigator swims to the
     point where Arrakis disappeared. He begins to pull
     and tear a hole in the Universe. Stars like sparks
     and SOUNDS and rings of light appear, along with a
     roaring WIND. The Navigator swims deep into this
     hole through the rings of light. The Navigator
     becomes more and more transparent, until he's lost
     in darkness. The sounds fade.

     The engineers activate a series of atometric
     Holtzman generators. Suddenly SOUNDS begin. The
     machines start; at first low, then they WHINE
     upwards to a high pitch. When the pitch is steady, a
     series of levers are pulled.

     Two giant glowglobes drift into the Great Hall where
     Jessica and Dr. Yueh stand watching a giant bull's
     head is being hung above the massive fireplace. The
     MOVING TROOPS are unpacking crates and organizing
     furnishings. Jessica watches them. Distant SOUNDS
     reverberate inside an elaborate air vent beside
     them.

                        DR. YUEH
               Listen here.... You can here the people of
               Arrakeen outside.... Can you here the cry
               "Soo Soo Sook" of the water sellers?

                         JESSICA
               So many reminders of the scarcity of
               water.

                        DR. YUEH
               Have you noticed the line of palms along
               the wall... the Harkonnen put them in...
               to flaunt their water wealth in front of
               these people.... Each day those palms take
               enough water to sustain the life of one
               hundred men.

                         JESSICA
               The way you say Harkonnen... I didn't know
               you had so much reason to hate them.

                        DR. YUEH
                    (swiftly)
               My wife... you didn't know my wife...

                    (inner voice)
               ... His wife was Bene Gesserit too... the
               signs are al over him.... They must have
               killed here.

     Jessica sees a droplet of sweat break out on Yueh's
     cheek.

                        DR. YUEH
               I'm sorry I'm unable to talk about it.

     Above them a series of iron curtains begins to open
     over deep rock window slots, sending  narrow shafts
     of light down across the room. TWO ATREIDES WOMEN in
     uniform approach.

                    ATREIDES WOMAN #1
                    (referring to several robed figures
                    standing in the room)
               My lady... the local people... the maids
               and servants await your inspection. Hawat
               has cleared them.

     Dr. Yueh turns to Jessica.

                        DR. YUEH
               The Harkonnens may have tampered
               medically.... please wait.

     He turns a yellow light on a moves it over the
     crowd. The yellow light beam plays over the blue-
     within-blue eyes. One of the women, the Shadout
     Mapes, watches Jessica continuously. Yueh's hand
     shakes slightly.

                         JESSICA
                    (inner voice; noticing Yueh's hands)
               He's hiding something -- holding something
               back.
                    (She studies his face closely.)
               It's not just his wife... He's a good man
               though. He's probably trying to save my
               feelings...
                    (We see her mouth.)
               I could use The Voice... make him tell
               me... It would only shame him.
                    (We see her eyes.)
               I must place more trust in my friends.
                    (We see Yueh turn toward her,
                    fearful.)

     Paul wanders through the darkened passageways alone,
     his footsteps echoing as goes. He takes pleasure
     observing the details of the rock Palace but all the
     while he feels an uneasiness -- a feeling of fear
     builds in him.

78.  INT. PAUL'S BEDROOM - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY

     Paul enters a small bedroom and sits down on the
     bed. He opens the filmbook, and activates it.

78A. INSERT - FILMBOOK

     We SEE a gigantic carryall lower down above a spice
     harvester and pick it up off the desert floor as a
     narrator speaks over.

                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
               One carryall handles four spice mining
               teams; however, it will fly only two
               harvesters at a time. Today, we have nine
               hundred and thirty harvesters and nine
               hundred and eighty-one carryalls....

78.  BACK TO SCENE

     Paul looks up. Across the room he sees a tray of
     small pastries which have been laid out. He goes to
     them and scans them with his poison detector, which
     he carries on his belt. A pleasant tone SOUNDS and
     the word "safe" appears in green light. Paul takes a
     pastry bites it and turns back towards the bed.
     Suddenly he stops. He looks at the pastry.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               Spice...

     As he continues eating he notices the sunlight
     through the slates over the window begins to GLOW
     white hot. Paul's eyes are intense as the light
     GLOWS brilliantly.

                      PAUL (CONT'D)
                    (whispering inner voice)

     is uneven rock and the ceiling is low. The troops
     fan out shining chemical lamps here and there. A
     soldier suddenly stops. Ahead in his light is a dead
     Harkonnen -- bloody vomit dried around his mouth. He
     lies beside an electronic device.

     al-Gaib." Others hold up one open hand as a sign
     they feel the messiah is near. A slow-moving spike-
     backed dog sucks ants up out of a small anthill; he
     snorts.

     brilliant light bursts over his face. The others are
     all talking among themselves. Suddenly Thufir's face
     turns brilliant red (as red as his sapho-stained
     lips) and he begins speaking rapidly into the
     machine in code using a strained high voice.

     The machine FLASHES several bright irregular
     SIGNALS. Then it stops and HUMS. The blood leaves
     Thufir's face.

     up. Everyone is quiet now.

               The Palace is now secure. The city of

               the troops are stationed in Arrakeen and
               we have some on the airfield. Our new army
               is still training, but everything is
               shielded.... With the shielding, we are
               impenetrable. Dr. Kynes is waiting, Sire,
               for your inspection of spice mining
               operations, but since the attempt of the
               young master, I am against your leaving
               the Palace.

                    (very angry)
               The attempt failed... Harkonnen captives

               Harkonnen machine on Arrakis.... You all
               know what to do.
                    (Turning towards Gurney)

               miners... many are threatening to leave on

                    (inner voice)
               That's it! The Missionaria Protectiva has
               been here planting protective legends
               against a day of Bene Gesserit need. And
               that day has come. I must play out this
               sham.
                    (out loud)
               I know the Dark things and the way of the
               Great Mother. Miseces prejin.

     Mapes takes a step backward to flee.

                    JESSICA (CONT'D)
               I know many things. I know you came
               prepared for violence with a weapon in
               your bodice.
--
                          MAPES
               My lady, I... the weapon was sent as a
               gift if you should prove to be the one.

                         JESSICA
               And the means of my death should I prove
               otherwise.
                    (inner voice)
               Now we will see which way the decision
               tips.

     Slowly Mapes reaches into her dress and brings out a
     sheathed knife. She unleashes it.

                          MAPES
               Do you know this my lady?

                         JESSICA
                    (inner voice)
               It could only be one thing....
                    (out loud)
               It's a crysknife.

                          MAPES
               Say it not lightly...
                    (very slowly)
               Do you know its meaning?

                         JESSICA
                    (inner voice)
               Here is why this Fremen has taken service
               with me, to ask that one question. Delay
               is as dangerous as the wrong answer.
               Shadout is Chakobsa... knife, in Chakobsa
               is... maker of death.
                    (out loud)
               It's a maker...

     Mapes SCREAMS with elation and grief.

                    JESSICA (CONT'D)
                    (inner voice)
               Maker?... Maker is the key word... the
               tooth of the worm? That was close...
                    (out loud)
               Did you think that I, knowing the
               mysteries of the Great Mother, would not
               know the maker?

                          MAPES
               My lady, when one has lived with prophecy
               for so long, the moment of revelation is a
               shock.

     Mapes sheathes the blade... slowly
--
                         JESSICA
                    (inner voice)
               There's more here... yes!
                    (out loud)
               Mapes, you've sheathed that blade
               unblooded.

     With a GASP Mapes drops the knife into Jessica's
     hands and opens her blouse.

                          MAPES
               Take the water of my life!

     Jessica withdraws the knife from the sheath and,
     with the blade, scratches a line just above Mapes'
     right breast.

                     MAPES (CONT'D)
               You are ours.... You are the one.

     Jessica's eyes stare ahead. She knows these words
     ring with truth.

93.  INT. TUNNEL - OBSERVATION ROOM - ARRAKEEN PALACE -
DAY

     The Duke, Paul and SEVERAL ARMED GUARDS enter a
     tunnel to a `thopter landing pad which is
     illuminated by a shaft of light coming from a
     chimney-like exit above. DR. KYNES and his Fremen
     guard are standing next to Gurney.

                          KYNES
                    (to Gurney)
               So, this is Leto the Just...

                         GURNEY
                    (sharply)
               I hope I made myself clear. You may call
               him "The Duke," "My lord," or "Sire." And
               there is a more ancient term you might
               keep in mind -- "Noble Born."

                          KYNES
                    (inner voice)
               Play out your little comedy while you can
               off-worlders...

     Gurney turns and activates a device...

93A. INSERT - ORNITHOPTER OPENING

     ...which causes the ornithopter behind to fold open
     ready for flight.

93B. INT. TUNNEL - OBSERVATION ROOM - ARRAKEEN PALACE -
DAY

     The two parties meet and are introduced.

                        DUKE LETO
               So you are Dr. Kynes, the Imperial
               Ecologist?

                          KYNES
                    (turning to Gurney)
               I prefer the more ancient term,
               planetologist... Noble Born.

                        DUKE LETO
               This is my son, Paul.

                          PAUL
               Are you a Fremen?

                          KYNES
               I am a servant of the His Majesty the
               Emperor. I have served His Majesty on
               Arrakis long enough for my eyes to change.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               He's hiding something.

                        DUKE LETO
               I understand we have you to thank for
               these stillsuits, Doctor.

                          KYNES
               They are Fremen suits. I hope they fit
               well, my lord.

                          PAUL
               "Your gift is a blessing of the river."

     Kynes' FREMEN GUARDS, hearing this are siezed with
     agitation. Kynes QUIETS them, then studies Paul.

                          KYNES
                    (inner voice)
               The Mahdi will greet you with holy words
               and your gifts will be a blessing.
                    (spoken, nonchalantly)
               Most of the desert natives here are a
               superstitious lot. They mean no harm. With
               your permission, I will check the security
               of your suits.

     Gurney and the guard move forward warily.

                         GURNEY
                    (angrily)
               The Duke is to be addresses as...
--
     Kynes comes forward and adjusts the Duke's suit,
     checking seals and pulling on straps.

                          KYNES
               Basically...

                         GURNEY
                    (leaping forward to protect his Duke)
               Sire!

                        DUKE LETO
               It's all right Gurney.

     Gurney steps back.

                         GURNEY
               Yes, Sire.

                          KYNES
               It's a high-efficiency filter and heat
               exchange system. Perspiration passes
               through the first layer and is gathered in
               the second. The salt is separated.
               Breathing and walking provide the pumping
               action. The reclaimed water circulates to
               catchpockets from which you can drink
               through this tube at your neck. Urine and
               feces are processed in the thigh pads.
               Should you be in the open desert, remember
               to breathe in through your mouth, out
               through the nose tubes.

     The Duke is now properly fitted. Kynes places the
     noseplug into his nose.

                     KYNES (CONT'D)
               With a Fremen suit in good working order,
               one can sustain life for weeks, even in
               the deep desert.

     He removes the noseplug.

                        DUKE LETO
               My thanks.

                          KYNES
               With your permission...

     Kynes turns to Paul, running his hands over the
     slick fabric. He stands back with a puzzled
     expression.
--
                          KYNES
               You've worn a stillsuit before?

                          PAUL
               No.

                          KYNES
     Your suit is fitted desert fashion. Who told you how
     to do that?

                          PAUL
               No one. It... seemed the proper way.

                          KYNES
               That it is.
                    (inner voice)
               He shall know your ways as if born to
               them.

     Kyne's Fremen guard are watching Paul very closely
     now.

                         GURNEY
               We're wasting time, Sire.

     Duke Leto, Dr. Kynes, Gurney and Paul enter the
     ornithopter...

     From outside the Palace's atomic shield we see the

               Southeast over the Shield Wall. That's
               where I told your sandmaster to
               concentrate his harvesting.

95.  EXT. ATREIDES ORNITHOPTER - DAY

     They crest the top of the wall which opens out into
     a black, level expanse of rock, cratered and
     fractured. On the other side is the huge, seemingly
     endless plain of sand, the Great Desert. In the hazy
     distance, flashes of light can be seen.

96.  INT. ATREIDES ORNITHOPTER - DAY

                          PAUL
               Will we see a worm?

                          KYNES
               Where there is spice and spice mining
               there are always worms.

                          PAUL
               Always?

                          KYNES
               Always.

                          PAUL
               Why do they come?

                          KYNES
               To protect their territory. Vibrations
               attract them.
--
                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               I've registered him now... a knife is a
               sheath on his left arm... He's strong... a
               person born to command... He's hiding many
               things.
                    (out loud, suddenly)
               Is there a relationship between the worms
               and the spice?

     Kynes turns instantly and stares at Paul. Gurney
     sees the wonder in Kynes' eyes.

                         GURNEY
               The young master is a trained Mentat, an
               advanced student of Prana Bindu has
               studied under some of the finest teachers
               in the Universe.

     Kynes takes a second look at young Paul.

                          KYNES
               As I said... they defend the spice sands.
               As to their relationship with the spice...
               who knows.

                          KYNES
               That's it... spice mining... no other
               cloud quite like it. See the spotters over
               it? They're watching for wormsign... the
               telltale sand waves. Seismic probes on the
               surface, too Sire... worms can travel too
               deep for their waves to show... Looks like
               a good patch of spice.

                        DUKE LETO
               Wormsign? Is it wormsign?
--
                          KYNES
               Yes!... worm. Big one! You've got sharp
               eyes Sire.... May I?

     Kynes grabs the microphone and dials in the correct
     frequency.

     Kynes clicks off the radio.

                        DUKE LETO
               What happens now?

                          KYNES
               The carryall will come and lift off the
               spice harvester. Try and get in close over
               the harvester... you'll find this
               interesting Sire.

                    (over radio)
               Yes... yes, Sire!

                        DUKE LETO
               How many men do you have?

                          VOICE
                    (over radio)
               Full crew -- twenty-six men -- but Sire,
               we can't leave this spice...

                        DUKE LETO
               Damn the spice! Get out of there.

103. EXT. HARVESTER - DESERT - DAY

     All the spotters begin landing and the Duke descends
     directly in front of the harvester which has stopped
     mining yet emits a tremendous rythmic GRINDING
     noise. No one is coming out.

104. INT./EXT. ATREIDES ORNITHOPTER/DESERT - DAY

     Gurney nervously scans the sky for enemy ships. A
     very low, powerful SOUND starts now and the ground
     begins to shake.

105. EXT. HARVESTER - DESERT - DAY

     A hatch opens and MEN come pouring out.

                    (yelling at the men)
               Two men in each of the spotters... You!...
               over here... run!!

     The ground is really shaking now.  A tremendous low
     THUNDERING sound grows along with a high rasping
     HISS.

                          KYNES
                    (to Paul and Gurney -- yelling over
                    the noise)
               I can't see him yet but he's very close...

                        DUKE LETO
                    (out loud to himself as he watches
                    the men scrambling)
               Damn sloppy -- really damn sloppy.

     FOUR MEN begin tumbling into the Duke's machine.

                         GURNEY
               Come on boys... come on.
                    (Then, to the Duke)
               We're going to be heavy, Sire.

     The men press on Gurney and Paul.  Paul can feel the
     fear. The sound is a horrible ROAR and deeper
     RUMBLING now and the `thopter is vibrating and
     shaking violently.  The air suddenly begins to SPARK
     with static electricity.

                          KYNES
                    (nervous)
               Here he is... We've got to go.

     The Duke closes the doorways, surveys the area one
     last time, then takes the controls.

106A.     INT. ATREIDES ORNITHOPTER - DAY

     The ship strains and lifts off -- slowly.

     Paul sees the brown powder clumped on the suits of
     the men... their bluish eyes.  He smells the spice.
     He begins to feel its affect.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice as a blinding light
                    comes and goes)
               Spice!... pure un-refined spice!

                          KYNES
                    (murmuring)
               Bless the Maker and his water... Bless the
               coming and going of him.  May his passage
               cleanse the world.

                        DUKE LETO
                    (yelling)
               What's that you're saying?

                          KYNES
               Nothing.

     A spice miner turns and sees Kynes, who remains
     silent.

                     SPICE MINER #2
               Shhhhh.

     Paul hears this, then looks to Kynes -- locks on his
     image.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               Liet?

               You are about to witness something few
               have seen -- watch!  Watch!

     Paul looks down as the Duke banks over the
     harvester.

107. EXT. HARVESTER - DESERT - DAY

Static electricity is IGNITING in the air and the sand is
swirling around the harvester.  Then they see it.  A wide
hole emerges from the sand, glistening spokes within it.
The hole is twice the size of the harvester.  Suddenly
the machine turns and slides into the hole, parts of it
EXPLODING.  The SOUND is deafening.  The Duke's ship is
WHINING to stay aloft.

108. INT. ATREIDES ORNITHOPTER - DAY

                         GURNEY
               Gods, what a monster.

               Someone is going to pay for this... I
               promise.

                          KYNES
                    (inner voice -- as he studies the
                    Duke)
               This Duke is more concerned over his men
               than the spice!  I must admit... against
               all better judgement... I like this Duke.

     Duke Leto walks into the room.  The NIGHT GUARD
     comes to attention as he passes.  DUNCAN IDAHO,
     wearing a dark, dusty stillsuit, emerges from the
     shadows.  DUKE LETO and DUNCAN meet at the foot of
     the steps.  The men embrace and separate.

                        DUKE LETO
                    (happily)
               Duncan!  What have you discovered about
               the Fremen, Duncan -- tell me.  Why
               haven't we heard from you?

                         DUNCAN
               My lord... I suspect so much.  I think
               they are the allies we seek... they are
               strong and fierce... they do not give
               their loyalty easily or quickly....  As
               you know, the Imperium has never been able
               to take a census of the Fremen.  Everyone
               thinks that there are but few -- wandering
               here and there in the desert.... My lord,
               I suspect an incredible secret has been
               kept on this planet... that the Fremen
               exist in vast numbers... vast numbers...
               and it is they that control Arrakis.

     The Duke smiles at Paul then leaves the room, but

     The BARON's face --  expressionless.  The SOUND of
     his ship screams in the background.  The DOCTOR is
     seated beside him.

118  INT. SUB-BASEMENT PASSAGEWAY - ARRAKEEN PALACE -
NIGHT

     The Duke walks down the steps to a very narrow
     passageway.  The passageway becomes very dark.

     Suddenly the Duke hears a strange MEWLING sound.  He
     turns down an even darker passageway.  He can hear
     the shield WHINING in the distance.  He almost has
     to feel his way.  Up ahead he sees a shape.  He
     bends down and sees the SHADOUT MAPES dying on the
     cold stone floor in the darkness.  She tries to
     speak but cannot.  She falls.  Suddenly the Duke
     HEARS the shield generator start whining down.

                        DUKE LETO
               What happened?  What?
                    (as Mapes dies)
               The shield!

     The Duke reaches to activate his shield be a large
     dart is shot into his shoulder.  The Duke lurches
     upwards then tumbles to the ground.  Out of the
     darkness comes Dr. Yueh.  The dart drops and
     CLATTERS as if a dream.

                   DUKE LETO (CONT'D)
                    (mind racing -- struggling)
               Yueh!

               He's sabotaged the house generators, we're

                    (with self-disgust)
               I've brought House Atreides down.  I've
               destroyed the new army's weirding modules.

                    (hoarse whisper)
               ... Why?

     The generator WHINES lower and lower
--
                          YUEH
               I wish to kill a man... not you, my dear
               Duke, but the Baron....  You were dead
               already... but you will be close to the
               Baron before you die.  You will be tied
               and drugged but you can still attack.
               When you see the Baron you will have a new
               poison tooth.  He will want you close so
               he can gloat over you.  One bite on this
               tooth and a strong exile...

                        DUKE LETO
               Refuse...

                          YUEH
               No! -- You mustn't... for in return I will
               save the lives of your Paul and Jessica.

     Yueh removes the Duke's signet ring and shows it to
     him.

                      YUEH (CONT'D)
               For Paul...

     He implants the tooth.

     Yueh becomes more and more blurred.  His image
     begins to fade.  His lips move in the darkness.  The
     generator WHINE is low and going lower and lower.

                      YUEH (CONT'D)

     battle.  Gurney and a squad of TROOPERS climb
     through bodies and thick smoke.  Gurney has the
     Duke's dog safely inside his coat.  The little dog's
     head sticks out -- looking about.  Gurney strokes

     Suddenly twelve huge Sardaukar round a corner on a

     them.  Behind them he sees Paul and Jessica bound in
     straps and being carried.

     Duncan attacks and fights valiantly but he is

     It flashes into his back.  A GASP escapes Yueh's
     throat, a sad look passing over his face, as if to
     say "I thought as much."  He stands stiffly, then
     falls gasping.  He tastes his own blood, then dies.

                          BARON
               Take him away.

145. EXT. LANDING FIELD - ARRAKEEN PALACE - NIGHT

     Rabban strides in front of his uncle's ship,
     carrying Kynes over his shoulder.  Harkonnen and
     Sardaukar SOLDIERS stand at attention.  Rabban tears
     off Kynes' stillsuit. Kynes falls.

                         RABBAN
               He was in the Palace with the Atreides...
               I also say he was a spy for the Emperor.
                    (looking up to the troops)
               Go now!  Take him to his desert to die.
               Go!

129A.     EXT. HARKONNEN ORNITHOPTER - NIGHT

     The small `thopter climbs toward the Shield Wall
     through a SMOKEY atmosphere illuminated by distant
     EXPLOSIONS.

130. INT. HARKONNEN ORNITHOPTER - NIGHT

                         JESSICA
                    (inner voice)
               Yueh's sign.  He's left a satchell.

     Jessica and Paul, bound by cabin straps, lie in the
     back, the two guards at the controls.  Outside,
     `thopters and ships fly past them toward the city.
     The distant FIRES play over Jessica's face as she
     sees Yueh's triangular tattoo scratched in the cabin
     roof.

                   HARKONNEN GUARD #1
               I'd like to have some fun before we kill
               her.

                   HARKONNEN GUARD #2
                    (laughing)
               Of course... what did you think?

     Jessica looks to Paul.

                          PAUL
                    (struggling to use The Voice)
               Don't touch my mother...

                         JESSICA
                    (inner voice)
               Oh great mother!  He's trying the voice.
               The Reverend Mother said it could save
               him.

                   HARKONNEN GUARD #1
               Did you hear a noise from the little one?
--
                   HARKONNEN GUARD #2
               I didn't hear anything.

                   HARKONNEN GUARD #1
               No?

                   HARKONNEN GUARD #2
               No.

     He turns and hits Paul in the shoulder with a
     stungun.  Paul recovers and starts taking long,
     calming breaths.

                         JESSICA
                    (inner voice)
               The calming exercise.

                   HARKONNEN GUARD #1
               The little one!
                    (they laugh)

     Suddenly, Guard #1 reaches around and puts his hand
     up Jessica's skirt.  He starts breathing hard.  Paul
     clears his throat.

                          PAUL
                    (using The Voice)
               Remove her gag!

                         JESSICA
                    (inner voice)
               Excellent!

     Guard #1 finds himself removing Jessica's gag.
     Guard #2 turns away from his controls but seems
     powerless to stop him.  Once, it's off Jessica
     smiles seductively and writhes on the `thopter
     floor.

                    JESSICA (CONT'D)
                    (The Voice)
               There's no need to fight over me.

     The two men stare at one another a moment.  Then
     Guard #1's hand, glinting silver, flashes into Guard
     #2's chest, killing him.  Guard #1 pulls the knife
     out, smiling.  The ornithopter begins to veer off
     into a dangerous nose dive.

                   HARKONNEN GUARD #1
               Now?

                         JESSICA
                    (The Voice)
               First cut my son's bonds.
--
     Guard #1 slowly cuts Paul's big straps, never taking
     his eyes off Jessica.  The ornithopter gets closer
     and closer to the top jagged surface of the Shield
     Wall.

                    JESSICA (CONT'D)
                    (The Voice)
               That's it.

     The blade cuts through the strap holding Paul's
     legs.  Paul kicks upwards extremely powerfully and
     his foot breaks through the man's chest cavity and
     drives his heart up into his head, spewing blood out
     the man's mouth.  Paul grabs the controls but it's
     too late.  The ship falls into the rock.

130A.     EXT. HARKONNEN ORNITHOPTER - DESERT - NIGHT

     The `thopter slides across the rock, shearing off a
     wing.  Suddenly they are beyond the rock three miles
     above the great desert and plummeting fast toward
     the dunes below.

130. BACK TO SCENE

     Paul pulls desperately on the controls and manages
     to keep the ship aloft and flying into the deep
     desert.

                         JESSICA
               Oh, my God!

     CU violently burning palm.

133. BACK TO SCENE

     Nefud exits - TWO HARKONNENS wheel in the stretcher,
     and swing it round - one of the GUARDS hands Piter
     his knife back - the Guards exit and the door closes
     - Piter moves up to Duke Leto and leans over him
     moving his knife across the Duke's face.

     The Baron flies down to the stretcher.

                          BARON
               Duke Leto Atreides.  Someone's torn the
               insignia off your uniform.  Such
               carelessness.

     Leto shows no sign that he has heard.
--
                          PITER
               It was Feyd.

     Leto's POV:  The Baron and his Mentat are only DIM
     FARAWAY SHAPES.  Their voices reach Leto as if
     travelling across a greater distance.  The Baron
     looks to Leto and then moves to him, looking him
     over.

                          BARON
               It was Feyd?
                    (laughing)
               It was Feyd!  Where is the ducal signet
               ring?  I must have his ring.

                          PITER
               The ring?... he was brought to us as is,
               Baron.  I...

                          BARON
               You killed the doctor too soon, you fool!

                        DUKE LETO
                    (inner voice)
               Yueh... Yueh... dead... Paul and Jessica
               safe... the tooth!

                          PITER
               He's coming round, my Lord.

     The Baron moves from behind a table stacked with
     dirty dishes and foodstuffs and goes to Leto.

                        DUKE LETO
                    (inner voice)
               Wait... he must be near...

                          BARON
               Where is your ring?

     The Baron's face is now very close to Duke Leto's.

                     BARON (CONT'D)
               You do not answer!

                        DUKE LETO
                    (very faint)
               A... little... closer....  The... water...
               of my life... for Paul.

     The Baron briefly wonders at these words and then
     turns to Piter.
--
                          BARON
               He's crying!
                    (he hits Duke Leto)
               He's crying!  He's crying, Piter.  What
               does he mean?

     Piter moves forward.  The Baron sees a suculent
     piece of chicken skin on the table.  He picks up the
     plate, then the chicken skin.

     Leto's POV:  It's grown HAZY again.  The Baron is
     beginning to move away, reaching for the small piece
     of chicken skin.  Piter leans close to Leto.

                        DUKE LETO
               Now!

     We hear a CRUNCH, hear a tumultuous RUSHING SOUND as
     Piter's face is pushed forcibly away.  The Baron is
     turning, a dumbfounded look on his face.  He drops
     the plate, and backs away.

     There is a tremendous ROARING.  Bits of visions of
     Caladan rush through Leto's ever-darkening
     consciousness --

135. INT. HARKONNEN ORNITHOPTER - NIGHT

     As they fly deeper into the desert with the ship
     shuddering and straining, Jessica suddenly cries out
     with tremendous premonition and fear.

                         JESSICA
               Leto!  Leto!

     Tears course down her cheeks as Paul turns to her.

                    JESSICA (CONT'D)

               I can't maintain any altitude... we'll
               never reach the safety of rock.  Maybe
               that small rock.

                         JESSICA
               Where are we do you think?

                          PAUL
               The South Polar regions... the forbidden
               area.  We must make it to that rock...

137C.     EXT. HARKONNEN `THOPTER - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     The `thopter violently hits the sands and flips up -
     - almost turning over.  It falls slowly back,  then
     slides down the side of a dune.

137D.     EXT. HARKONNEN ORNITHOPTER - DESERT - NIGHT

                          PAUL
               Hurry!

     He jumps out of his seat.

                         JESSICA
               Bring these satchels!

     She hands him one.

                          PAUL
                    (at doorway)
               Hurry -- This crashing may bring a worm.

     As Paul puts the satchel over his shoulder, he feels
     something.  He looks at his father's ring.  He
     stares at it silently, then closes his hand around
     it.  They jump outside.

                         JESSICA
                    (starting to cry)
               A million deaths are not enough for

               one...

138. EXT. ROCK - DESERT - NIGHT

     Paul and Jessica running.  Paul pulls Jessica to a
     place in the wall where a small overhang offers
     shelter.  Jessica falls to the ground.  She CRIES,
     pouring out her grief, but soon the sound of it is
     carried away by the building rush of WIND.  Paul
     turns and looks out to the open desert, this portion
     of which is a dust ocean.

138A.     PAUL'S POV:

     The Mouse Moon has risen.

     Ripples of dust undulate tide-like in the light of
     the moon.  The WHISPERING grains billow up like the
     foam of waves as they hit the rock.

138. BACK TO SCENE

     Paul turns, his face illuminated by the two moons
     above.  His eyes lock on the moon which has the
     image of the mouse.

138B.     INT. PAUL'S EYE - NIGHT

     We move into Paul's eye, where the mouse moon appear
     and revolves slowly.  The moon begins to explode.
     The pieces of the moon soar toward us burning with
     white-hot flames.  Within the flames we see...

139A.     EXT. ARRAKEEN PALACE - NIGHT

     ... the burning Palace of Arrakeen.  We move closer
     to it.

189B.     INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - ARRAKEEN PALACE - NIGHT

     We then see Duke Leto's face.  The Baron leans over
     the Duke and clutches the skin on the Duke's face.
     He begins pulling it.  The skin on the Duke's race
     slowly rips open -- making a hideous tearing SOUND.
     Black SMOKE issues forth from the hole which teats
     larger.

                       PAUL (V.O.)
                    (distorted)
               House Atreides is ruined.

               This moon holds my past.

139C.     INT. VESTIBULE - OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

     Inside and through the SMOKE Paul sees Feyd tear the
     Red Duke insignia off his father's uniform.  He sees
     Feyd laughing.  The moving, now-brilliant red hawk
     insignia becomes...

139D.     EXT. CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

     ... a burning meteor ROARING over the castle on
     Caladan.  The meteor crashes in the black sea.

               This moon holds my future.

139E.     INT. WATER - NIGHT

     Foaming confusion turning into a small, twisting
     fetus under the sea.  Its eyes closed.  Moving close
     to it, its eyes snap open.  Through the eyes is the
     pale white face of JESSICA.

139F.     EXT. SHIELD WALL - DESERT - NIGHT

     There is a huge soaring WIND sound and beyond
     JESSICA the dunes roll like ocean waves.

139G.     EXT. MOUSE MOON - NIGHT

     The moon continues to spew out pieces of moving
     images which are seen then disappear as fast as
     sparks.  The broken, burning pieces float eerily
     toward us over the undulating dunes below.  One
     image floats closer.  It is a hand folded into a
     fist.

                       PAUL (V.O.)
               I am only a seed...

     The fist begins to open.

                    DUKE LETO (V.O.)
               The seed must grow.

     The hand opens fully with slow blue fluid pulsating
     out the very center of the palm.  The hand floats
     eerily forward.

                    DUKE LETO (V.O.)
               The sleeper must awaken.

139H.     EXT. WATER - NIGHT

     The last image which passes is foaming and spitting
     dark blue water.  As the image passes, the black
     smoke trailing behind it obscures the picture to
     blackness.

140. EXT. ROCK - DESERT - NIGHT

     Through the darkness we move to Paul's clenched
     hand.  It opens, revealing the signet ring in the
     very center of his palm.  Paul looks upward to the
     moons of Arrakis.  He looks back to the ring, then
     to his mother.

                          PAUL
               Listen to me!... you wanted to know about
               my dreams... and I've just had a waking

     His thick head sweats and sweat runs down his thick
     neck.  He goes inside and the doors swing closed.

146. INT. HARKONNEN SHIP - NIGHT

     He enters the ship and moves down within to the
     Baron's headquarters, passing two dwarves cooking a
     dead legless cow which hangs from chains.  Rabban
     tears out the cow's tongue and eats it.  Then he
     exits through a door which closes behind him.

147. INT. BARON'S QUARTERS - HARKONNEN SHIP - NIGHT

     The Baron is flying wildly, circling the outside of
     a large steel shower, while Nefud and a DWARF play a
     strange instrument producing maniacal, perverse,
     screaming MUSIC.  The Baron SEES Rabban enter, but
     continues to fly around the shower.

                          BARON
                    (very excited)
               Rabban!!... we're knee deep in Atreides
               blood!  We've gutted them.  We've gutted
               them!
                    (laughs)

     The Baron floats to Rabban and begins lovingly
     massaging Rabban's massive neck as he speaks to him.

                          BARON
               Rabban, Rabban...  I place you in charge
               of Arrakis.  It's yours to squeeze, as I
               promised.  I want you to squeeze and
               squeeze and squeeze.
                    (massaging in rhythm)
               Give me spice!  Drive them into utter
               submission.  You must not show the
               slightest pity or mercy... as only you
               can...  Never stop!
                    (releasing him)
               Go....  Show no mercy!

                         RABBAN
               Yes, my lord Baron.

     Rabban leaves just as Feyd steps out of the shower.
     The Baron turns to him lovingly.
--
                          BARON
                    (to Feyd)
               And when we've crushed these people enough
               I'll send in you Feyd... they'll cheer you
               as a rescuer... lovely Feyd... really a
               lovely boy.
                    (suddenly he smiles and screams)
               Where's my doctor?

148. INT. HARKONNEN SHIP - NIGHT

     As Rabban leaves, he looks into one room of the
     ship.  Behind the glass porthole sits Thufir Hawat
     bound head and foot, his eyes darting this way and
     that.

148A.     EXT. ROCK - DESERT - NIGHT

     Paul and Jessica are in stillsuits.  Paul is looking
     through a Fremkit.  He finds a paper with Dr. Yueh's
     mark on it.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               Yueh's left the plans for the weirding
               modules.

148B.     EXT. MOONS - ARRAKEEN - DESERT - NIGHT

     The moons have moved further across the sky.

148A.     BACK TO SCENE

     Suddenly Paul turns and studies his mother.  A
     stronger WIND comes up.

                          PAUL
               We have to get to that mountain of rock.
               We have entered the time when all will
               turn against us and seek our lives...

     Jessica gets up.  They make their way up the crest
     of a dune by a small rock.

                      PAUL (CONT'D)
               It's further than I thought... a worm is
               sure to come....  I'll plant a thumper,
               that should divert it.
--
     Paul moves off into the shadows.  Suddenly, Jessica
     SEES a burst of LIGHTNING illuminate the mountain of
     rock in the distant and the vast dunes before them.

                    JESSICA (CONT'D)
                    (inner voice)(as Paul leaves to light
                    the thumper)
               ...the night is a tunnel... a hole into
               tomorrow... if we're to have a tomorrow...

149. through 151.   (Deleted)

151A.     EXT. DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     Paul plants the thumper which begins a powerful
     rhythmic noise.  He turns to Jessica.

                          PAUL
                    (returning)
               Remember... walk without rhythm and we
               won't attract a worm... it'll go to the
               thumper.

                         JESSICA
                    (puts in her noseplug)
               I'm ready.

     Paul and Jessica move into camera and exit right.

151B.     EXT. DEEP DESERT AND ROCKS - NIGHT

     Another burst of LIGHTNING.  The distant rock seems
     to have grown no larger.  Their muscles begin to
     ache.  Suddenly they HEAR the thumper start behind
     them.

                          PAUL
               Keep going...

152. EXT. DEEP DESERT AND ROCKS - NIGHT (LATER)

     Their breathing becomes very labored.  The sand
     moves like slow water, forever rolling down and up.
     Then they hear the worm, the low thundering HISS
     shaking the tonnage of sand.  The thumper stops.
     Paul turns.

                          PAUL
               Faster!!
--
                         JESSICA
                    (screaming)
               It's deafening!

     Their bodies ache and they feel like dropping, yet
     the cliff is still a good distance away.  The worm
     SOUND grows louder and Paul turns to look.

153. EXT. WORM - DESERT - NIGHT

     A flash of LIGHTNING.  The worm is now coming toward
     them.  The mound of sand over the worm is enormous
     and is approaching at a terrifyingly fast speed.
     The power of this worm is awesome.

153A.     EXT. DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

                          PAUL
                    (screaming)
               Run!

                         JESSICA
               I can't... I can't.

     She turns to see.  Then she runs.

153B.     EXT. DRUM SAND - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     All at once their feet tromp down on firmer sand.
     The SOUND is very loud.

                          PAUL
               Drum sand!

     The DRUMMING sound ECHOES deep within the ground.
     Jessica falls.  Paul stops and drags her up.  They
     run again.  The worm SOUND becomes unbearably loud.
     Static electricity SPARKS giant bolts of pure white
     LIGHTNING and the air turns to ozone.  Finally they
     find rock.  Behind them the SOUND of the worm
     changes.  They turn.

154. EXT. WORM - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     The gigantic head of the worm is just breaking
     through the sand.  The mouth begins to open in an
     eighty-foot circle of teeth and darkness.  The mouth
     arches forward searching for them.

155. EXT. BASE OF THE CLIFF - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     Paul and Jessica climb up and up inside a narrow
     slit of rock.
--
155A.     INT. ROCK CLIFF - DESERT - NIGHT

     The worm's mouth climbs higher also but it cannot
     penetrate the narrow opening in the rock.

156. EXT. ROCK CLIFF - NIGHT

     Paul and Jessica have scrambled upwards a couple of
     hundred feet.

156A.     EXT. WORM AND ROCK - NIGHT

     Still the worm stretches up to them.  Suddenly the
     worm begins BANGING on the rock.  Huge SHUDDERS
     drive through the black stone.  Over and over again
     the worm mindlessly hits at the rock.

156B.     EXT. ROCK CLIFF - NIGHT

     Paul and Jessica crouch further back in the tiny
     passageway of safety, but a solid back wall of rock
     prevents them from moving back any more.

156C.     INT. ROCK CLIFF - NIGHT

     The breath from the worm is like a hurricane of
     WIND.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               Cinnamon... the spice!
                    (out loud)
               Do you smell it?

                         JESSICA
               Yes...

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               I know the secret.  The worm is the
               spice... the spice is the worm.

157. (Deleted)

157A.     EXT. ROCK CLIFF - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     Suddenly a colossal section of the rock wall cracks
     and topples off into the worm's mouth.  Instantly
     the worm pulls back.  A huge FIRE roars deep within
     the worm consuming the rock.
--
158. INT. ROCK CLIFF - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     The worm now can get even closer to Paul and
     Jessica.  It looms up again and crushes its mouth up
     against the rock.

158A.     EXT. ROCK CLIFF - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     Another fissure opens, and suddenly half the rock
     wall protecting them splits off entirely and
     falls... taking Paul with it.

158B.     EXT. WORM AND ROCK - NIGHT

     ...against the worm.

159. EXT. ROCK CLIFF - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     Paul is knocked off the cliff and falls straight
     down two hundred feet.  His feet skid along the face
     of rock.  He bounces and brakes.  He hits and jumps.
     He careens from one boulder, flies upside down,
     rights himself then tumbles and skids into the sand.
     Unhurt, he jumps up and scrambles up another part of
     the rock to safety.

160. EXT. ROCK CLIFF - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

                         JESSICA
               Paul!

     She presses against the narrow ledge that is left
     after the worm assault.

161. EXT. BASE OF THE CLIFF - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     The worm is just coming up again when distant
     THUMPING is heard.  The worm, as if charmed by the
     sound, turns and moves off towards it.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               A thumper.

161A.     (Deleted)

162. EXT. ROCK CLIFF - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     Jessica climbs further up and manages to get over to
     a place where she can meet up with Paul, who is now
     climbing back.
--
                         JESSICA
                    (crying)
               What's happened?...  Why did it leave?

                          PAUL
                    (breathing heavily)
               Someone started another thumper....  We're
               not alone.

     They climb upwards until the ledge ends at the mouth
     of a dark crevice.  Paul and Jessica try to see into
     the inky black hole.

163. EXT. CREVICE - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     Slowly Paul and Jessica enter, inching forward.  A
     low moan of WIND comes up.  Paul can see nothing,
     then suddenly he SEES stars above and SEES the hint
     of stairs cut into the rock.

                         JESSICA
                    (whispering)
               Man-carved steps.

                          PAUL
                    (whispering)
               Yes...

     They climb the steps and enter an extremely narrow
     dark channel of stone.  As they make their way
     through the rock, suddenly there is a burst of
     lightning which illuminates a whole troop of Fremen
     standing silently in front of them.

164. EXT. FREMEN PLACE - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

                         STILGAR
               Perhaps these are the ones Mapes told us
               of.

                         STILGAR
                    (to Jessica)
               Are you trained in the ways of the desert?

                         JESSICA
               No, but many consider my training
               valuable.

                         STILGAR
               I will take the boy-man... he shall have
               sanctuary in my tribe...
--
     A LOW NOTE on a dip stick is blown by one of the
     Fremen tribe.  Jessica shifts, Paul sees it, and
     just as Stilgar begins a reach for his weapon,
     Jessica turns, slashes out, utters a SOUND, whirls
     again and with rock behind her holds Stilgar
     helpless in front of her -- her hand at his throat.
     Paul moves on her first move.  He races up a rocky
     incline.

165. EXT. CLIFF - FREMEN PLACE - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     He then jumps higher up and presses himself between
     two rocks on a low cliff overlooking the rest of the
     Fremen troop.

166. EXT. FREMEN PLACE - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     The troop starts shooting projectile weapons in
     Paul's direction.

                         STILGAR
               Stop!  Get back!!  She has the weirding
               way.  Why didn't you tell us!  Great
               gods... if you can do this to the
               strongest of us you're worth ten times
               your weight of water.  As a leader of my
               people I give you my bond: teach us this
               weirding way and you both shall have
               sanctuary.  Your water shall mingle with
               our water.

                         JESSICA
               Then I will teach you our way of
               battle....  you have the word bond of a
               Bene Gesserit.

                        A FREMEN
               It is the legend.

167. EXT. CLIFF - FREMEN PLACE - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     Up on the rock, Paul turns.  He takes a step, then
     notices a small figure standing in front of him.  It
     is a girl.

                          CHANI
               I am Chani, daughter of Liet....  I would
               not have permitted you to harm my tribe.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               From my dream... so beautiful.  Liet....
               is this Kynes' daughter?

     Paul stares at her in wonder.
--
                          CHANI
               Come with me.  I'll show you an easier way
               down.

     They exit.

168. EXT. FREMEN PLACE - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

                         STILGAR
                    (to Paul, as they meet)
               You have strength... real strength... You
               shall be known as Usul, which is the
               strength of the base of the pillar.  This
               is your secret name in our troop.  But you
               must choose the name of manhood which we
               will call you openly.

                          PAUL
                    (thinking)
               What do you call the mouse shadow in the
               second moon?

                         STILGAR
               We call that one Muad'dib.

                          PAUL
               Could I be known as Paul Muad'dib?

                         STILGAR
               You are Paul Muad'dib, and your mother
               shall be a Sayyadina among us....  We
               welcome you.

     Wind blows a cloud of dust through the rock.  High
     above the moon with the mouse shadow glows
     brilliantly.  It dissolves into the sun.

168A.     EXT. DEEP DESERT - DAY

     Paul, Jessica and the Fremen march through the
     dunes.

171. through 171B.  (Deleted)

172. EXT. DEEP DESERT - DUSK/SUNSET

     HEAT WAVES and sand dunes.  Mysterious SOUNDS echo
     in the distance as the giant sun is setting.

     Chani takes Paul to the top of a dune.  They stare
     at the sunset and a huge rock outcropping in the
     distance.
--
                          CHANI
               Seitch Tabr.

     Paul looks at the rock, then turns to her.

                     CHANI (CONT'D)
               Tell me of your homeworld, Usul.

     These words rend Paul's soul.  He cannot speak.  He
     reaches out and touches her hand - her cheek.

173. (Deleted)

174. INT. ENTRANCE - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT

     The Fremen troop enters into a large square room
     with slot passageways going off in various
     directions.

175. INT. PASSAGEWAY - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT

     They all move down one of the passageways which are
     beautifully but very plainly cut with lasguns.  They
     are like passages in the pyramids, dark with sharp
     turns and inclines upwards or downwards, some very
     steep and long, and others descending hundreds of
     feet.  There is a strong, moaning WIND.

176. through 177.   (Deleted)

178. INT. PASSAGEWAY/STAIRS - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT

     A quiet WIND can be heard -- deep and moaning.

                         JESSICA
               Moisture...

     She looks at Paul.  He, too, notices.

                          PAUL
               Wind traps... huge ones.

     Down a long, sloping, narrow passageway they go
     until they reach a stairway cut into the stone.  It
     is very dark and gets increasingly darker as they
     descend.  The WIND sound grows.  The air grows
     colder and damper.  Paul and Jessica share another
     questioning look.  At the bottom of the stairs they
     pass through a narrow slot doorway which suddenly
     opens out on something so totally unexpected it
     shocks Paul.
--
179. INT. RESERVOIR  -SIETCH TABR - NIGHT

     It is enormous, deep reservoir of black water
     sitting silently in the depths of this sietch and
     stretching out into the darkness.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               Water on Arrakis!!!
               I have seen this place in a dream.
                    (out loud)
               A treasure.

                         STILGAR
               Greater than treasure, Usul.  We have
               thousands of such caches.  Only a few of
               us know them all.  When we have enough...
               we shall change the face of Arrakis.
               Listen!...

     There is the sound of water dripping.  The lights
     are extinguished - reflections play on Paul's face.

                    STILGAR (CONT'D)
               The Rocks of Arrakis hold many secrets.

179A. through 180   (Deleted)

180A.     REVISED SCENE - HALL OF RITES

     Thousands of Fremen wait below.  Paul enters a rock
     ledge, guided by two monks, which is crowded with
     Fremen and old Fremen Monks.  Below the crowds
     continue to watch and wait while a giant wind organ
     moans.  A Monk steps up to Paul.

                          MONK
               We sense that you may be the "voice from
               the outer world".  Both moons told us of
               you.  You must pass tests before we will
               know... you must conquer the beast of the
               desert, both his outer and his deadly
               inner powers.
                    (moves back)
               Speak to us... from the outer world.

     Paul turns and gathers courage to address the
     multitude below.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               I am only a seed.

               The legend.

               many.
                    (out loud)
               Our shared enemy the Harkonnens, are once
               again in control of Arrakis.  Stilgar,
               your leader, has asked me and my mother to
               crush the Harkonnens.  We must do more
               than this.  We must totally destroy all
               spice production on Arrakis.  The Guild
               and the entire universe depends on spice.

               "He who can destroy a thing, controls a
               thing".

               I will take one hundred of your warriors
               and train them.  This one hundred will
               train the thousands that remain.  When the
               spice flow stops, all eyes will turn to
               Arrakis.  The Baron and the Emperor
               himself will be forced to deal with us.
               Arrakis will become the center of the
               Universe.

182. INT. TRAINING ROOM - SIETCH TABR - DAY

     Large room with a low ceiling.  A drummer playing
     makes a low ECHOING MUSICAL HIT.  A big block of
     stone is moved across coarse sand -- back and forth
     -- fast.  A rhythm is started -- powerful.  Paul
     enters, pauses and looks to Jessica - he stands in
     front of over 100 Fremen men.  Jessica sits behind
     him alongside Stilgar.

     A large rock obelisk has been placed near Paul for
     this demonstration.

                          PAUL
               The weirding way has long been a Bene
               Gesserit secret.  With my mother's help,
               my father isolated an element of the
               weirding way and externalised it.
--
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
               Because of the Harkonnen treachery, my
               father's armies were never able to fully
               develop this new form.  This is what I
               will teach you.  You will be the fiercest
               and most feared fighters in the Universe.

               Our way of battle is built on rhythm.  You
               understand rhythm like this but you do not
               yet understand the rhythm of the higher
               sounds, sounds that heal and build...
               sounds that destroy.  Motion is the base.
               You understand the motion... but you do
               not yet understand the motion that heals
               and builds... motions that destroy...

               Orato!
                    (he moves forward)
               This obelisk is of your hardest stone.
               Kick it...
                    (he does -- the rock doesn't move)
               Hit it...
                    (he does -- the rock doesn't move)
               Yell at it...

                          ORATO
               Break!

     The Fremen laugh -- the rock doesn't move.

     A Fremen with a lasgun tries to cut it.  Paul
     motions him back, slightly.

                          PAUL
               Move back!

     Paul also moves back.  He switches on his weirding
     module.  He opens his mouth and makes a small SOUND,
     which the module amplifies.

                          PAUL
               Chuksa!

     The sound shatters the obelisk to pieces.  The one
     hundred Fremen YELL with surprise and awe.

                       100 FREMEN
               Achiii!

                          PAUL
               This is part of the weirding way that we
               will teach you.  Some thoughts have a
               certain sound... that being the equivalent
               to a form.  Through sound and motion you
               will be able to paralyze nerves, shatter
               bones, set fires, suffocate an enemy or
               burst his organs....  We will kill until
               no Harkonnen breathes Arrakeen air.

                       100 FREMEN
               Muad'dib!

               killing machines.

     Stilgar turns to Jessica.

               Sayyadina.  Our Reverend Mother tells me
               she is too old... She has been calling
               through space and time for you to come and
               let her rest.  She asks that you pass
               within.

               secure our place among these Fremen.
                    (out loud)
               I will try to pass within.

188. INT. ROCK LEDGE - HALL OF RITES - SIETCH TABR -
NIGHT

     Fremen carry the Fremen REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO in
     on a litter.  The old Reverend Mother is old a frail
     yet extremely beautiful and mysterious.  She turns
     to Paul and Jessica with a strange look.

                 REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO
                    (to Jessica, in an ancient voice)
               So you are the ones.

     She turns away towards the monks who are very busy
     blowing horns and waving pots of burning spice,
     purifying the area of the rite.  Several Fremen blow
     on dip sticks and a FEMALE CHOIR begins a haunting
     chorale as the giant pipe organ blows beautiful low
     notes below.

     Paul looks to his mother.

     He then sees Chani.

     CU Chani.

     CU Paul -- he cannot stop looking at her.

     Stilgar motions to Paul.

                         STILGAR
                    (whispering to Paul)
               Do you know the Water of Life?... Come...
               ...Watch... the mystery of mysteries...
               the end and the beginning.

     He shows Paul through a narrow passageway -- almost
     a slot through the stone to a small room.  Through
     an opening in the stone wall, Paul is shown a very
     strange and somewhat horrifying scene.

189. INT. BABY WORM - MAKER ROOM - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT

     A thirty-foot baby worm is being lowered into a
     stone chamber.  The chamber is then covered with a
     wire top.  Valves are turned and water rushes into
     the chamber.  The worm begins to writhe violently
     and leap and bang against the bars above.  The worm
     begins to turn inside out from the mouth back and it
     begins to gag.  Some monks and watermasters quickly
     drain the stone chamber and wrench the worm out
     using large steel hooks.  They hold the worm above a
     large tub.  A watermaster-reed man runs a long reed
     in to the worm, causing it to spasm and gag up a
     beautiful deep blue bile as it dies.

189A.     INT. MAKER ROOM - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT

     The bile and worm water are combined in ceremonial
     containers.  Paul turns to Stilgar.

                         STILGAR
               The Water of Life.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               The most lethal poison in the Universe.

     Then we HEAR from Paul's memory his conversation
     with the Reverend Mother:

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               ... Many men have tried.

                          PAUL
               Did they try and fail?

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               They tried and died.

190. INT. ROCK LEDGE - HALL OF RITES - SIETCH TABR -
NIGHT

     Stilgar and Paul return to the ledge above the Hall
     of Rites.  A MONK PRIEST steps forward, addresses
     the crowd, silencing them.  The other monks move
     back carrying their smoking cleansing bags.

                         MONK #1
               One among us has consented to enter the
               rite.  She will attempt to pass within
               that we not lose the strength of our
               Reverend Mother.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)(turning to his mother)
               What if she should fail?

     He brings the jug close to Jessica.

                         MONK #1
               Drink!

     Jessica drinks.

                         JESSICA
                    (inner voice)
               The ultimate awareness spectrum narcotic.
               I must transform the poison configuration
               within my body... the blue must be made
               clean.

     She swallows.  Her body contorts and spasms
     violently.  She screams.  The Reverend Mother
     screams with her.

     The old Reverend Mother slowly extends a hand toward
     Jessica's shoulder.

195. JESSICA - MENTAL IMAGE

     Inside Jessica, we see the Reverend Mother Ramallo's
     hand descend through the dark void.  Shimmering
     water starts to ripple, lightly stirring an image of
     Jessica.

     As the hand penetrates, something deep within her
     starts to GLOW.  It is a fetus, a female.  The
     Reverend Mother Ramallo's hand flinches as it
     touches the fetus.  The fetus sparks to life -
     screaming and rapidly spasming upwards on its
     umbilical cord.

               You should have told us.

               have we done?
--
197A.     INT. THE TUNNEL - NIGHT

     Jessica and the fetus rush mentally through a dark
     strangely worm-like tunnel until suddenly, a gaping
     black hole appears.  A horrible WIND, SPARKS and
     circles of expanding light issues from it.

                      JESSICA (V.O)
                    (inner voice)(fearful)
               No!  This is the place where we cannot
               look.  The place only for the eyes of the
               Kwisatz Haderach.

197B.     THE FETUS - NIGHT

     The fetus twists down the tunnel to join Jessica,
     her umbilical cord trailing behind.  She SCREAMS as
     she looks into the hole.

197C.     THE NAVIGATOR - NIGHT

     She and Jessica see a shape moving deep within the
     windy hole.  It is a Third Stage Navigator, ROARING.

                         JESSICA
               What is this?...  Is this what kills the
               men who enter here?

     She quickly takes the fetus back up the tunnel.  As
     they move:

                 JESSICA (V.O.)(CONT'D)
                    (inner voice)
               Now my daughter and I are both Reverend

                    (distant)
               I've been a long time waiting for you.
               Here is my life.

198. INT. ROCK LEDGE - HALL OF RITES - SIETCH TABR -
NIGHT

     The old Reverend Mother Ramallo slumps forward onto
     the stone, dead.  The crowd waits.  The corpse is
     tenderly removed.  Jessica very slowly opens her
     eyes and looks about her.  The monk holds the jug to
     her lips.

                          MONK
               Change it that we may all drink of it.

     Jessica spews water into the spout.  The monk swirls
     the jug, sniffs at the spout and then drinks.

                      MONK (CONT'D)
               It is changed!

     They whisper "It is the prophecy!"  They soon begin

     The Baron and Feyd descend several steps into a
     darker area of Geidi Prime.  Feyd is carrying a
     strange creature in a small wire cage.  The Baron is
     floating as he descends.

                    (takes a drink)
               Feyd, even though he's aging, Thufir is

                          BARON
               Oh Thufir, I see they've installed your
               heart plug already....  Don't be angry.
               Everyone gets one here.  But this is not
               why we're here.  We've brought you a
               little cat, Thufir.  You must care for it
               if you wish to live.  A poison has been
               introduced into you, Thufir Hawat.  By
               milking this smooth little cat body each
               day you receive your antidote... it must
               be done each day....  Also, you must do
               something for me if you wish to live.  You
               know I lost Piter, my dear Mentat...

     Thufir gives the Baron a weak, wide-eyed stare.

                          FEYD
               All I can see is an Atreides that I want
               to kill.

                          BARON
               Feyd, no, no!  Thufir's a Harkonnen now,
               aren't you Thufir?

     Paul walks down the steps into the training room -
     followed by Harah's two sons.  He pauses at the foot
     of the steps.

                          PAUL
               Activate your weirding modules...

     Paul activates his, and the Fremens follow suit.

                          PAUL
               Set the range for two meters.

     Paul walks down the line of Fremen.

                          PAUL
               Korba...
                    (points to robot)
               The arm...

                          KORBA
                    (aiming the module)
               Chuuk-sa...

                          PAUL
               Motion... Chuuk-sa...

                          KORBA
               Chuuuk-sa...

     He fires the module and the arm of the robot is shot
     off.  Paul smiles and hits him on the shoulder -
     Paul walks on.
--
                          PAUL
               Stilgar...

     One of the FREMEN calls out to Paul.

                        A FREMEN
               Muad'dib!...

     The word `Muad'dib' causes a tremendous power to
     build.  The module shakes violently in his hand - it
     suddenly fires upwards, and the wall explodes.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               My own name is a killing word.  Will it be
               a healing word as well?

211A.     NEW SCENE

                         STILGAR
                    (to Paul as he applies red colour to
                    the shoulders of several large Fremen
                    men)
               Usul... these are fifteen of our fiercest
               fighters to serve you as your guard... the
               Fedaykin.

     He pauses, then holds up his brilliantly red hand.

213. EXT. DESERT - DAY

     An EXPLOSION.  Paul turns and his eyes are totally
     blue.  He lifts binoculars to them and looks.  He
     sees the Fremen fighters below charging at the
     Harkonnens.  As the Fremen run they make powerful
     SOUNDS with their weirding modules, exploding
     everything in their path and catching things on
     fire.

213A.     EXT. CARRYALL - DESERT - DAY

     In the distance, a huge spice carryall is shot down
     and it falls to the ground EXPLODING more violently
     on impact.

                          PAUL
               Now!

     Stilgar signals, and Fremen run behind them.

                      PAIL (CONT'D)
                    (to Stilgar)
               They're even better on the battlefield
               than in the training rooms!!
                    (inner voice)
               Sound... as a weapon.  If only you could
               see them, father.

     Paul smiles as he looks at the battle in the
     distance.

                      PAUL (CONT'D)
                    (his V.O. from the past)
               When the spice flow stops, the entire
               Universe will turn to Arrakis.  The Baron
               and the Emperor himself will be forced to
               deal with us.

214. INT. PASSAGEWAYS - ARRAKEEN - DAY

     Rabban stares dumbfounded as many Harkonnen wounded
     and dead are brought through the passageway beyond.
     Rabban grabs a Harkonnen and asks:

                         RABBAN
               What happened?  What happened to you?
               What is he saying?

                    WOUNDED HARKONNEN
               Muad'dib!...  Muad'dib!... Muad'dib!...
               Muad'dib!

     Rabban pushes him away.

                   A HARKONNEN SOLDIER
               He's been repeating that name ever since
               we found him.

                         RABBAN
               Who is this Muad'dib?

215. EXT. DEEP DESERT - DAY

     HEAT WAVES; dunes.  A big thumper is forced into the
     sands.  A RHYTHM is heard pounding on Fremen hand
     drums and rhythm instruments.  Feet scramble.  Black
     stillsuited Fedaykin warrior bodyguards gather.
     Stilgar turns.
--
                         STILGAR
                    (to Paul)
               Usul... It is time you become a
               sandrider... and travel as a Fremen.  Take
               the kiswa maker hook of our sietch and
               ride as a leader of men.

217. EXT. DEEP DESERT - DAY

     As Paul leaves the troop to plant the second
     thumper:

                     STILGAR (V.O.)
               Two thumpers are planted.  The worm may
               not surface for the first - he will rise
               for the second.  Remember, when the worm
               approaches, you must be utterly still...
               and close enough to plant the hook firmly
               under a ring segment....  The worm will
               turn to lift this exposed area as far from
               the abrasive sand as possible and it will
               take you with it -- to the top.  Do not
               get too close as he approaches... the sand
               will engulf you....  Wait till the head of
               the worm passes -- then go... quickly.

                    STILGAR & FREMEN
               Shai-Hulud... Shai-Hulud.

     In the distance the telltale SOUND of the worm's
     approach begins.  This worm is deep underground and
     the sound is low and the ground trembles violently.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               Only the very strong ones travel this
               deep....

     The SOUND and VIBRATIONS continue to build.  In the
     distance, the Fedaykin and Stilgar watch.

                         STILGAR
                    (to the others)
               Usul has called a big one.  Again... it is
               the legend.

219. EXT. DEEP DESERT - DAY

     HEAT WAVES... dunes RHYTHM.  THUNDEROUS approach of
     the worm.  Paul still cannot see the worm, but the
     sound begins to drown out the Fremen rhythm
     instruments and the sand begins to VIBRATE.
     Suddenly, Paul SEES...

219A.     EXT. WORM - DEEP DESERT - DAY

     ...a mountain of sands rise up, towering, thundering
     -- lightning SPARKS fissuring throughout the air
     above the worm.

     The mountain approaches at a terrifying speed.
     Then, the worm appears -- rushing.  The mouth, at
     first a small opening, begins to widen -- exposing a
     thousand glistening teeth.

219B.     EXT. DESERT - DAY

     Paul freezes.  He lets the worm get closer and
     closer.  The HEAT WAVES distort the gigantic form,
     making it more hideous -- more foreign.  He moves
     forward.  The others watch anxiously.  This worm is
     big.  It is so much larger than imaged.  Its top
     towers 125 feet in the air.  The segments are each
     ten feet wide.

219C.     EXT. VERTICAL SECTION OF WORM - DESERT - DAY

     Paul gets close and running alongside, he plants the
     hook under a segment and pulls back.  The SOUND is
     excruciatingly loud.  The sand is so deep and more
     is being thrown out beneath the body of the worm.
     Paul gets caught in it and falls. He narrowly
     escapes being sucked under the beast.  He gets up --
     runs again and plants the hook once more.  He runs
     faster, bending the segment open to expose the
     tender flesh.

219D.     EXT. FULL-SIZE SECTION OF WORM - DESERT - DAY

     Suddenly the worm begins to turn.  Paul pulls
     himself up the body as it turns -- holding onto the
     hook.  Soon he is fifty -- sixty -- seventy feet off
     the ground -- going higher.  The giant worm gets the
     second thumper and Paul at that moment climbs to the
     top.  He plants the second hook.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               A sandrider!...

     Paul works the hooks into the breathing holes along
     the body...
--
219E.     EXT. DESERT - DAY

     ...causing the great beast to make a slow turn
     toward Stilgar and the bodyguard.  They set
     themselves and as the worm passes...

219F.     EXT. FULL-SIZE SECTION OF WORM - DESERT - DAY

     ...they all clamber on, climbing up the sides to the
     top.

                          PAUL
                    (yelling)
               Long live the fighters!

     They return the traditional CALL and Paul steers the
     maker in a giant circle.  They head out across the
     dunes.

     Fighting is going on between Fremen and some

     Stilgar followed by Fremen and Fedaykin.

                          PAUL
               We surprised a band of smugglers.

                         STILGAR
                    (racing into thick smoke)
               Too bad... thought they were Harkonnen.

     Paul and Stilgar move through the smoke.  A man runs
     up with a maula pistol aimed at Paul but Paul spins
     and punctures the man's chest with a sound from his
     weirding module.  Paul turns and a large figure
     comes through the smoke.  They surprise each other.
     The figure holds a gun.

                          PAUL
               Gurney!...

     The figure stops -- stunned.

               They said you were dead.  They said...

     Paul shows him the signet ring on his fingers.
     Gurney moves forward, his eyes tearing, and the two
     embrace each other and pound each other on the back.

     The Emperor sits on his throne.  Behind him are his
     Sardaukar officers.  In front of him are several
     Guildsmen.  One holds a large electrical apparatus
     up to the face plate of another which translates his
     strange voice into English.

     the darkness of their sleeping chamber.  Paul's eyes
     snap open and he sees Chani looking down at him (the
     last image of the future in the desert).

     In the hollow of a huge dune, Paul stops with Chani.
     They share a look into each other's eyes.  Paul
     turns towards the Fedaykin and nods.  They move in
     quickly to tie and wrap Paul in Fremen rope.  They
     move back and wait quietly.  Chani moves in very
     close to Paul.  She holds a glass vial of the blue
     water of life.

                          PAUL
               Hurry!  All I see is darkness.

     She pours the blue liquid into Paul's mouth.  Slow
     move into Paul's face as:

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               Now... the test of the water of life...
               what is it that waits for me in this
               darkness?

233A.     INT. PAUL'S MIND

     Fade to black then dissolves to dark blue fluid.  A
     blue drop falls into the blue fluid - a huge low
     thud - then quiet.

233B.     EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

     Cut to Paul screaming horribly in the desert.

235. INT. JESSICA'S ROOM - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT

     Alia walks forward in the very dark room.  Blood
     rushes from her nose.  She forces herself to walk to
     Jessica's bed.  She finds that Jessica's nose is
     bleeding also.  Jessica wakes in pain.  They stare
     at each other in the darkness.

                         JESSICA
               ALIA!

                          ALIA
               Mother - help me!

                         JESSICA
                    (struggling)
               Alia!  What is it?
--
                          ALIA
               It's Paul.  He's taken the Water of Life.

233C.     INT. PAUL'S MIND

     Cut to quiet black - dissolve again to blue -
     another drop - low thud - quietness - fade to black.

245A.     EXT. EMPEROR'S SPACESHIP - SPACE

     The Emperor's space ship soars towards us.

246. INT. EMPEROR'S SPACE SHIP - SPACE

     The Reverend Mother Helen Mohiam is on the floor,
     bleeding from the nose and weak from pain.  The
     Emperor looks on in horror.

233D.     INT. PAUL'S MIND

     Suddenly screaming towards us is white rings, stars
     and a huge Guild Navigator.

233E.     EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

     Cut to Paul's eyes - tightly closed, oozing fresh
     blood.

233F.     EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

     SCREAMING SOUND.  Paul's mouth opens and a giant
     wind is stirred on the desert.

234. (Deleted)

235A.     INT. PAUL'S MIND

     Navigator chewing giant eye and spewing blood and
     light and sounds.  Paul's mouth double exposes over
     Navigator and eye.  The sound from Paul's mouth
     destroys the Navigator and opens the Alam.
     Navigator bursts into a huge light ring and we
     quickly travel through ring after ring and masses of
     liquid stars.  The light increases until it is
     blinding and then in the light...

235B.     EXT. FLOWER BLOSSOMING

     A golden flower blossoms and glows brilliantly -
     suddenly the powerful sound of an approaching worm.

236. through 239.   (Deleted)

240. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

     Chani and the Fedaykin freeze and watch in horror as
     seven giant worms converge on them.  The worms break
     the desert surface and rise, towering over them.
     The worms hover and wait.

                                        DISSOLVE TO:

241. through 245.   (Deleted)

240A.     EXT. DESERT - DAY

     Chani looks to the Fedaykin, then they look at Paul
     who lies motionless.  She cuts the rope bonds with
     her crysknife.  Her fingers tremble as does the
     whole of the desert.

     Paul's eyes snap open.  He sits up slowly.  Chani
     stares at him in awe.

                          CHANI
               Paul... Paul.
240B.     EXT. WAVE CRASHING

     A huge wave crashes and Paul sees the image of his
     father.  Paul slowly gets to his knees, then stands.

240C.     EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

                          PAUL
               Father!...  Father!  THE SLEEPER HAS
               AWAKENED.

     Giant echoes of this phrase reverberate across the
     vast desert.  The worms bend back into the sand and
     leave with thundering power.

     MUSIC FULL.

251. EXT. ROCK LEDGE - HALL OF RITES - SIETCH TABR -
NIGHT

     The Rock Ledge of Sietch Tabr is filled with
     Fedaykin and monks; Chani, Jessica, Gurney and
     Stilgar stand together near the back.  Paul moves
     out on the Rock Ledge overlooking the Hall of Rites
     which is crowded with Fremen warriors who chant
     "Maud'Dib" along with the powerful sounds of the
     WIND ORGAN and FREMEN war DRUMS.

     Paul raises his open hand.  SILENCE.  Only the organ
     continues with a soft low NOTE.  The Fremen wait.

                          PAUL
               Arrakis... Dune... Desert Planet.

     A quiet, haunting MOAN of recognition of a master
     rises from the Fremen.

                      PAUL (CONT'D)
                    (loud)
               Your time has come.
                    (inner voice)
               Father... our time has come.
                    (out loud again)
               A storm is coming -- our storm... and when
               it comes it will shake the Universe.
               Emperor... we come for you.

     A thunderous ROAR arises.  War DRUMS pound.  The
     ORGAN blows hurricaine of power through the sietch.

                          PAUL
                    (he raises crysknife)
               Long live the fighters!

                         STILGAR
               Long live the fighters!

     Fremen carrying weapons begin moving out in long
     lines from the Hall as the war DRUMS pound.

                          PAUL
               Gurney, when the storm hits... set off the
               atomics.  I want an opening through the
               entire Shield Wall.  Stilgar?  Do we have
               wormsign?

     Stilgar and Gurney laugh.

                         STILGAR
               Usul... We have wormsign, the likes of
               which even God has never seen.

     Paul smiles.

261. EXT. DEEP DESERT - DAY

     Looking down over the huge desert it looks like a
     living sea of wormsign.  Everywhere ripples appear
     and worms are surfacing.
--
261A.     EXT. DEEP DESERT - DAY

     Thousands of Fremen are running, positioning
     themselves to mount and ride.

262. EXT. DESERT - DAY

     Dust clouds grow faster and the speed of the WIND
     increases.  Sand particles hit at a rock outcropping
     and up close they sound like giant warrior drummers
     pounding before battle.

263. EXT. HARKONNEN SHIPS - DESERT - NIGHT

     Suddenly above come hundreds of SCREAMING space
     ships zooming down across the desert floor and

                         EMPEROR
               Bring in that floating fat man... the
               Baron.

     The Baron is brought in.  Distant warning SIGNALS
     begin.  The Baron is fighting to contain his fear
     because RABBAN'S HEAD SITS ALL BLOODY ON THE FLOOR
     in front of him.  Finally the Emperor speaks.

                         EMPEROR
               Why have you brought me here?

                          BARON
               Your Highness... There must be some
               mistake... I never requested your
               presence.

                         EMPEROR
               Ah?  But your lack of action demanded it.
               Your dreadful mismanagement, your bad
               judgement in assigning to Rabban --
                    (he gestures toward the head)
               -- the governorship....  You forced me to
               come here and set things straight...
               personally.
--
                         A VOICE
               Bring in the messenger.

     Alia is brought in by the Sardaukar soldiers.  She
     is smiling.

                          ALIA
               I am the messenger from Muad'dib.  Poor
               Emperor, I'm afraid my brother won't be
               very pleased with you.

                         EMPEROR
               Silence!...  I do not court your brother's
               pleasure.

     Suddenly the Reverend Mother looks horrified and
     grabs her throat.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
                    (struggling, speaking)
               Kill this child!!  She's an abomination!!
               Kill her.
                    (points to Alia, who is smiling at
                    her)
               Get out of my mind!!!

                          ALIA
               Not until you tell them both who I really
               am.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
                    (strained speech void of emotion)
               Sister of Paul Muad'dib.

     The Reverend Mother slumps.  The Baron's mouth flies
     open.  The Emperor's face goes pale, his lips
     tremble.

                         EMPEROR
               Paul's sister... Paul is Muad'dib?!

     He turns quickly and looks at the two Guild agents
     present in the room.  They stare at him icily.  Alia
     is smiles happily.

268. INT. COMMUNICATION ROOM - ARRAKEEN - DAY

     Paul smiles.

                          PAUL
                    (laughs)(to Gurney and Stilgar)
               Alia keeps pace with the storm.
--
     Gurney and Stilgar don't understand.  Suddenly
     enormous dust clouds and LIGHTNING sweep up over the
     Shield Wall.

                          PAUL
               Gurney, now!

     Gurney gives a hand signal and...

                         GURNEY
                    (they put on their hoods)
               Atomics!

269. EXT. SHIELD WALL - ARRAKEEN - DAY

     ...TWENTY EXPLOSIONS of hydrogen bomb intensity go
     off in a row, cutting a huge gorge through the width
     of the massive Shield Wall.  As the EXPLOSIONS go
     off, a WIND howls, destroying much of Arrakeen and
     covering the rest with tons of sand.  Sand rips at
     the Palace and the Emperor's ship.

270. INT. STEEL TENT - EMPEROR'S SPACE SHIP - DAY

     Alia smiles as they HEAR the tremendous roaring,
     atomic screams of the explosions.  The Emperor's
     ship's warning SIGNALS are now close and loud.

                          ALIA
               My brother is coming... with many Fremen
               warriors.

     A Sardaukar rushes in.

                  SARDAUKAR OFFICER #2
               The Shield Wall is gone.

                         EMPEROR
               Impossible!

                          ALIA
               Not impossible.  I told you... He is here
               now.

                  SARDAUKAR OFFICER #2
               Majesty, into the ship!

                         EMPEROR
                    (to his officers)(rising)
               Release the Sardaukar.  Baron... give this
               little abomination to the storm.

     They all leave the room, including the Sardaukars.

                          BARON
               I have her, Majesty!

     The Baron floats down to her.  Alia turns to him --
     still smiling.  With a flash of her hand she reaches
     out and swipes at the Baron's face.  He CRIES OUT in
     pain.  She pulls his suspensor plugs and pushes him
     back, then slowly shows him the tiny needle she
     holds in her hand.  He spins crazily as he screams
     from the poison.

273. EXT. SHIELD WALL - ARRAKEEN - DAY

     Worms, each with hundreds of Fremen on them, come
     slithering through the newly-formed canyon in the
     Shield Wall.

273A.     EXT. WORMS - SHIELD WALL - ARRAKEEN - DAY

     Paul rides the lead worm with Gurney and Stilgar by
     his side.  The storm is howling and blowing with
     horrifying intensity.

273B.     INT. EMPEROR'S SPACE SHIP - CONTROL ROOM - DAY

     The Emperor and his Sardaukar officers in a darkened
     room where they are horrified to see on the screens
     the hundreds of worms which are coming into the
     Arrakeen valley.  All their faces show fear.

272. BACK TO SCENE
     INT. EMPEROR'S SPACE SHIP - GREEN THRONE ROOM - DAY

     Suddenly the wall behind Alia and the spinning Baron
     is completely blown away by a BLAST.

     The Baron floats and spins out into the storm.

274. EXT. ARRAKEEN - DAY

     As the worms enter the Arrakeen basin they meet the
     Sardaukar.  The Sardaukar don't have a chance -- the
     worms suck them up by the hundreds.  The Fremen on
     the worm's backs fire weapons, killing the few
     Sardaukar the worms leave behind.

275. EXT. LANDING FIELD - ARRAKEEN - DAY

     The space ships which were recently airborne are now

272A.     NEW SCENE

     The Baron floats and spins high in the dust clouds
     of the storm over the Arrakeen Valley.

274A.     NEW SCENE

     The worm, that Paul, Gurney and Stilgar are riding,
     suddenly rears up.  Its mouth opens.  The Baron
     appears as a tiny spinning shape.  He flies directly
     into the mouth of this collosal worm and is
     devoured.

277. EXT. STEEL TENT - LANDING FIELD - ARRAKEEN - DAY

     A thousand Fremen battle Sardaukar outside the
     Emperor's tent.  They soon overpower them and rush
     into the giant steel structure.

278. EXT. LANDING FIELD - ARRAKEEN - DAY

     The entire airfield is now filled with wild worms,
     Fremen, and dead or dying Sardaukar.

     Alia moves dreamily among the dying Sardaukar.

281. INT. GREAT HALL - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY

     Paul enters the Palace hall and the first thing he
     sees is the giant bull's head.  The horns have been
     blown off and the Atreides banner has been stuffed
     and wired into the mouth.

     A WIND moans through the Palace.

     Paul turns.  Gurney and several guards bring in the
     Emperor, Irulan, the Reverend Mother, Sardaukar
     generals, Guildsmen, Feyd and Thufir.  The Fedaykin
     and Fremen troops line the walls.

     Paul's eyes meet Feyd's -- Feyd gives him an evil
     smile.

     Paul turns and looks at the Emperor, who stares back
     defiantly.  Paul moves his gaze to Irulan, who
     lowers her eyes.  He then sees his old teacher,
     Thufir Hawat, whose tired eyes wander helplessly.
--
                          PAUL
               Gurney... I see Thufir Hawat among the
               captives.  Let him stand free.

                         GURNEY
               My Lord?

                          PAUL
               Let him stand free!

     The Emperor turns nervously to Feyd, who passes a
     golden dagger to Thufir.

                          FEYD
                    (to Thufir)
               The antidote...

                         GURNEY
                    (gestures to Thufir)
               Thufir.  Come.

     Thufir approaches Paul, concealing the knife.  They
     come face to face.  The Emperor seems strangely
     tense at this moment.  Paul notices this.  He looks
     Thufir over.

                      PAUL (CONT'D)
                    (inner voice)
               A knife....
                    (out loud)
               In payment of the many years of service to
               my family, you may know ask of me anything
               you wish.  Anything at all.
                    (quietly)
               Do you need my life, old friend?

     He turns his back on him.

                      PAUL (CONT'D)
                    (quiet)
               It is yours.

     Thufir's eyes grow sad and wide.

                          PAUL
               I mean this, Thufir.  If you are to
               strike, do it now.

     Thufir's hand rises, as Jessica gasps, but the old
     Mentat pulls his heart plug out with a quick tearing
     motion.  Paul turns and catches him as he sags.

     His head lolls back and he looks up to Paul
     urgently.
--
                     THUFIR (CONT'D)
               Three... generations... of you...

     His breath escapes him and he is dead.

                          PAUL
                    (to the guards)
               Carry this noble Atreides warrior away.
               Do him all honor.

     The guards do as they are instructed.

                          PAUL
               Emperor Shadam the IV... there are Guild
               Heighliners above us containing many Great
               Houses of the Lansraad....  SEND THEM

                      GUILDSMAN #2
                    (speaking into electric microphone)
               Stop your speaking!!

                          PAUL
                    (to the Guildsmen)
               Good.  You have some idea of what I would
               do but I will tell it to one who has never
               been seen... one who hides deep in the
               Heighliner control rooms.  He will hear it
               first.

                      GUILDSMEN #3
                    (fear)
               No!

     Paul smiles as we move closer and closer to him.

282. INT. CONTROL ROOM - HEIGHLINER - SPACE

     Suddenly we are in the Heighliner control room, near
     the floor in the chemical spills.  We move up into
     the orange gas.  THUNDERING begins to shake the
     Heighliner.

                       PAUL (V.O.)
               Where are you....  Let me see you or there
               will be no spice.
--
     We move into very thick gas and there is a ROARING.
     Suddenly Paul sees the Third Stage Navigator.

                   PAUL (V.O.)(CONT'D)
               You know what I'm about to say is true....
               I have the power to destroy the spice
               forever.

     The Guild Navigator's mouth stretches back in a
     horrible MOAN.  The moan becomes more pained and
     grows louder and louder.

283. INT. GREAT HALL - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY

     The Guildsmen in the room are MOANING and SCREAMING
     and swarming out towards the doorway -- the Fremen
     stop them.  The Emperor and all are amazed and
     frightened.  There is a long hush.  The old Reverend
     Mother then turns and glares at Paul.

                      PAUL (CONT'D)
               Don't try your powers on me.  Try looking
               into that place where you dare not look.
               You'll find me there staring back at you!!
               You Bene Gesserit have waited ninety
               generations to produce the one person your
               schemes required.  Here I stand.  But... I
               will never be yours.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               Stop him, Jessica!

                         JESSICA
               Stop him yourself.

                          PAUL
               You saw a part of what the race needs in
               the beginning.  In time you perverted the
               truth.  You sought to control human
               breeding and intermix a select few
               according to a selfish master plan.  How
               little you understand.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               You mustn't speak of...

                          PAUL
                    (using The Voice)
               SILENCE!

     The old woman is shot backwards by the power of his
     shout.  Her breath is knocked out of her.

                      PAUL (CONT'D)
               I remember your gom jabbar, now you
               remember mine.  I can kill with a word.
--
     A Fedaykin stand forward and recites from the
     prophecy.

                       FEDAYKIN #1
               ...and his word shall carry death eternal
               to those who stand against the righteous.

     Feyd hears this and is angered.

                          FEYD
               The righteous!

                          PAUL
                    (to Emperor)
               There is a Harkonnen among you.  Give the
               Harkonnen a blade and let him stand forth.

                         EMPEROR
               If Feyd wishes, he can meet you with my
               blade in his hand.

                          FEYD
               I wish it.
                    (steps forward)

                         GURNEY
               This is a Harkonnen animal.  Let me,
               please, my Lord.

                          PAUL
               The Emperor's blade.

     Feyd takes up the Emperor's blade with a smile.
     Paul takes out his crysknife.  They begin to circle
     each other.

     Paul smiles, circling still.  Suddenly, Feyd leaps,
     his blade jabbing savagely outward, but Paul easily
     evades it, moving away.  They begin to circle again.

     He makes another pass at Paul that comes dangerously
     close, but again, Paul is away, a frozen smile on
     his face.

                          FEYD
               Why prolong the inevitable?  I will kill
               you!  I will kill him!

     Feyd smiles.  He lashes out biting Paul's hand.
     Feyd LAUGHS in triumph.

     Feyd leaps forward jabbing, his right hip also
     forward.  Yet Paul, although a little slowly, again
     reels away.  Again, Feyd thrusts.
--
     This time Paul jabs with his crysknife, but Feyd
     moves away effortlessly.  Feyd counters and kicks
     Paul to the ground.

                          CHANI
               Paul!

     Paul is up instantly and he circles with Feyd.

                          FEYD
                    (smiling)
               Who is the little one?  A pet, perhaps?
               Will she deserve my special attentions?

     Paul jabs out, his crysknife slashing.  Feyd grabs
     his arm, and Paul his, the two men locked in a
     straining clinch.  Feyd presses his right hip closer
     and closer to Paul's body.  Paul strains to keep it
     away.  Suddenly, the gom jabbar flips out of Feyd's
     girdle, but on the left side, and he lunges
     powerfully with it at Paul, who just barely misses
     taking it in his skin.  He throws Feyd back, but not
     before Feyd's feet strike out, sending Paul to the
     floor.  Feyd leaps onto him.

                          FEYD
                    (whispering)
               You see... your death... my blade will
               finish you.

     Suddenly, Paul, with lightning swiftness, pushes
     Feyd up and over.  He is on top of him in a flash.

     Paul's crysknife flashes up, thrusting upward
     through Feyd's jaw.  Feyd's mouth opens as the knife
     continues up through his tongue and through to his
     brain.  Feyd's eyes go wild, then glaze over as he
     jerks dead on the floor.  Paul slowly gets to his
     feet, breathing heavily.  Anger still seething in
     him, Paul issues a SOUND -- a loud, horrible,
     powerful sound, and Feyd's internal organs rupture
     and the stone floor under him cracks open.  The
     Fedaykin smile.

                       FEDAYKIN #2
               Usul no longer needs the weirding module.

     Everyone stares in disbelief.  Paul looks to the
     Emperor.

                          PAUL
               Now, I will tell you how it will be.
               Irulan shall be my wife, opening the way
               for an Atreides to take the throne.

                         EMPEROR
               I sit on the throne!!
--
                          PAUL
               You will sit on a throne on Selusa
               Secundus, your prison planet.  Either that
               or you will die.

     The Emperor is still.  Paul moves to Chani.

                      PAUL (CONT'D)
                    (to Chani)
               The Princess shall have no more of me than
               my name... no child of mine or touch the
               softness of glance... nor instant of
               desire....  This is my promise to you...
                    (whispering)
               ...my love.

     Paul turns back to the others.

     Jessica turns to Chani and whispers to her.

                         JESSICA
               Think on it Chani... We who carry the name
               of concubine... history will call us
               wives.

     Alia enters with two monks.  She signals and one of
     them places a cloak over Paul's shoulders.

                          PAUL
               The Fremen have the word of Muad'dib.
               They will have their Holy War to cleanse
               the Universe... they will have Arrakis...
               Dune... their planet.  There will be
               flowing water here open to the sky and
               rich green oases.  For the spice there
               will always be some desert.  There will be
               fierce winds and trials to toughen men.
               We Fremen have a saying...
                    (he stares at the Reverend Mother)
               "God created Arrakis to train the
               faithful."
               One cannot go against the word of God.

     Everyone in the room stares at him soundlessly.

                          ALIA
               And how can this be?

     There are three powerful drum hits.

                      ALIA (CONT'D)
               For... he is the Kwisatz Haderach!
--
284. EXT. ARRAKEEN PALACE - DUSK

     Paul opens his mouth and issues an ever increasing
     wind.  Lightning and thunder begin.  Clouds begin to
     form over the Palace.  In the half-light of dusk,
     thousands of Fremen watch the sky.  Giant golden
     lights are illuminated and their rays shoot far into
     the sky illuminating the growing clouds.  Five
     tremendous bolts of lightning suddenly unleash a
     downpour of RAIN ON ARRAKIS.  The Fremen stand
     awestruck as they are drenched with water falling
     from the sky.

285. INT. GREAT HALL - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY

     WE MOVE through Paul's glowing blue eyes into
     beautiful blue luminescent light.

     A gigantic WIND arises, and suddenly appearing in
     the blue light is an ocean of light rolling like
     gold glass off into infinite.  The blue becomes
     darker and a golden lotus flower blooms in the
     night.

                         THE END

Commentary by Richard Michaels



TITLES: "E.T. - THE EXTRA-TERRESTIAL"

[The letters are in soft-purple against a black background. Purple is
traditionally the color of that which is sacred.]

EXT: NIGHT SKY: NIGHT

The black screen becomes a night sky. The camera angles lowers to show a
forest against the night sky.

EXT: LANDING SITE: NIGHT

In an opening in the forest stands a spacecraft. The view of the craft is
obscured by tree branches. The atmosphere is misty, with blue lights coming
from the spacecraft.

[The opening scene is misty and diffused. This forces the audience to pay
close attention to the images on the screen. The characters are not clearly
seen. This engages the audience, as they attempt to see what the aliens
really look like.]

One creature walks up the gang blank and into the ship.

INSERT: ALIEN HAND

A strange hand, with two long and slender fingers protruding, move aside a
branch that obstructs the view.

[This concentrates the audience's attention. The creature going into the
ship is being observed by another creature. Who are they? What's going on?
This is another technique that forces the audience to focus on the action.]

INT: SPACECRAFT'S GREENHOUSE: NIGHT

The inside of the ship appears to be a greenhouse. There are sounds of
water dripping. Cone shaped objects (possibly alien plants) sit among earth
plants. Vapors flow up from the plants.

[These images all appear non-threatening. The aliens are inferred to be
collecting vegetation, and are thereby inferred to be harmless.]

[Like many of Spielberg's other films, the opening sequences contain almost
no dialogue. The story is told without verbal exposition. He forces the
audience to become engaged in the storytelling process by giving them just
bits of information that they have to piece together into the story. He
doesn't insult their intelligence.]

EXT: SPACECRAFT: NIGHT

A group of the aliens work in front of the spacecraft. Suddenly, they hear
a dog howl, and they all stop working. Red lights begin to glow in their
chests. It appears as if their hearts have lit up at the sign of danger, as
the red glow seeps through their translucent skin. After a moment the red
lights dim and they return to their work.

[This sets up the prop of the red-lights signifying danger. These small
creatures are endearing and non-threatening. They are like children, which
is immediate grounds for audience empathy. The thought that they may be in
danger from wild creatures in the forest, also creates empathy for them.]

EXT: FOREST: NIGHT

A small fern grows on the forest floor. An alien hand, with two fingers
protruding, reaches out for the fern. The alien groans. A rabbit turns and
listens. The fingers dig up the plant as the rabbit watches. The alien then
carefully uproots the plant. A small wayward alien walks alone among the
gigantic redwood trees. He's dwarfed by the huge trees.

[The awesome towering trees psychologically creates audience empathy for
the creature. The audience identifies with him because they too feel small
when confronted by these trees.]

EXT: HILLTOP: NIGHT

The creature stands alone on a hilltop as he stares down at the city lights
below. Suddenly he lets out a moan of fright. A truck, with headlights
glaring, pulls up next to him.

[The quiet, peaceful alien is now in jeopardy.]

The creature runs from the lights. Several other trucks with head- lights
glaring drive up. Smoke flows from their exhaust pipes. Men's legs are seen
as they walk among the trucks. They step into a mud puddle as E.T. watches
from behind a shrub. A man with keys jangling from his waist walks past a
headlight. He carries a flashlight in his hands.

[Keys have now become a prop which identifies the antagonist of the story:
the faceless government agent. Like the antagonist of many other fantasy
films, his face is not initially revealed in order to hold the audiences
attention.]

The man with keys walks to a truck where he and two other men review a map
that's placed on the hood of the truck. The man with keys holds the
flashlight up and points it at the hood. E.T watches them from the bushes.

[The fact that E.T. is observing the actions of the men also creates a
psychological bond between the audience and him, since they are also
observing these characters.]

[While the audience doesn't actually see a map, they presume its existence
given the actions of the characters. This style of story telling engages
the audience, and gets them guessing about the characters' actions. They
then create expectations, which are later often proved to be wrong. This
makes the story both unpredictable and exciting.]

EXT: SPACESHIP: NIGHT

An alien stands in front of a round light and transmits a homing signal,
presumably to call the other aliens back to the ship.

[These characters are all in jeopardy.]

EXT: FOREST: NIGHT

When E.T hears the sound, his red heart lights up. The homing signal
reverberates in his chest.

[This establishes that his heart is used as a communication device, i.e.,
these aliens communicate with their hearts.]

"Keys" hears this sound and quickly turns around. He points his flashlight
towards the sounds. The other men join him as they walk towards the sound.
E.T. screams and runs away, which is indicated by the shaking bushes. The
men with flashlights chase after him.

[So, like Dorothy in the WIZARD OF OZ, the opening scene has the
protagonist being pursued by an unknown antagonist.]

EXT: SPACECRAFT: NIGHT

The lights dim on the footings of the spacecraft, presumably because the
spacecraft is preparing to takeoff.

[The protagonist has the added jeopardy of being abandoned.]

EXT: FOREST: NIGHT

E.T. screams as he races for the spacecraft. The glow from his red-heart
reflects off the bushes as he runs towards the white light of the
spacecraft.

[The audience still hasn't seen the face of the protagonist.]

EXT: SPACECRAFT: NIGHT

A lone alien stands before a large round white light, as he signals for the
other aliens to return to the ship.

EXT: FOREST: NIGHT

Men with flashlights run through the forest, as they pursue the red glowing
light racing towards the spacecraft. One of the pursuers is the man wearing
the keys on his waist.

EXT: SPACECRAFT: NIGHT

The grated gangplank lifts up, blocking the entrance to the ship. Behind
the grate stands the alien against the large round white light. The red
light of the aliens heart lights up as he stands behind the barrier.

[This image exhibits an obstacle to E.T. returning to his ship.]

EXT: FOREST: NIGHT

The men reach the edge of the clearing and stop as they watch the
spacecraft lift off.

One red lighted heart races along an old country fence towards the
departing spacecraft. Men with flashlights are still in pursuit. They stop
at a wooden gate as they watch the spacecraft fly away.

E.T., with face obstructed by a branch, and with red-heart aglow, watches
the spacecraft fly away into the night. He utters a sorrowful moan.

[He has been abandoned in a hostile alien world. This situation is
guaranteed to generate audience empathy.]

The men with flashlights pointed up towards the sky watch the space- craft
fly away. They hear E.T.'s groan, and in unison point their flashlights in
his direction.

[Not only is the small childlike creature abandoned, but he is still in
jeopardy of being captured by those who pursue him.]

[This is the inciting event in E.T.'s story: his spacecraft has deserted
him.]

EXT: HILLTOP: NIGHT

Below lies the city, lit up against the dark night sky. E.T slowly makes
his way down the slope.

Men with flashlights follow. They reach the hilltop, search the underbrush
for the alien, then start down the slope after him.

[This concludes the prelude to the story. Both the protagonist and
antagonist have been introduced, and audience empathy has been established
for the protagonist. The protagonist's primary objective is to survive and
find a way home, while the antagonist's primary objective is to capture the
alien.]

EXT: SUBURBAN HOUSE: NIGHT

[This is an establishing shot.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: NIGHT

A group of boys are sitting around a table playing a DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS
game. One boy is on the telephone ordering a pizza. They throw wads of
paper at each other as they play.

Elliott, the youngest boy, sits behind the counter. He's separated from the
other boys. After a few moments he yells that he's ready to play the game.

[The character's positions are structured to emphasize Elliott's separation
from the others.]

One of the boys tells Elliott that he can't join when they are in the
middle of the game.

[Audience empathy is generated for the young child who is being excluded
from the game.]

Elliott walks up to the table and yells at his brother, Mike. Michael says
that Elliott has to ask Steve, who is the Game Master, and who has absolute
power.

[The notion of "absolute power" is set up here, for a "payoff" later when
Elliott uses it to keep Michael silent about E.T.]

[Elliott's objective here is to play the game, but also to be accepted by
the group and gain the respect of the older boys.]

Steve tells Elliott that first he has to wait for the pizza, then when he
brings it back he can play. Steve gives him money for the pizza. Elliott
picks up his baseball and glove, then leaves the room.

[The ball and glove are props that will be used in the story.]

[Elliott's sub-objective is to get the pizza. Once this is accomplished,
he'll be able to play the game.]

EXT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: NIGHT

It's a rainy, misty night. Elliott, with ball and glove in hand wait at the
bottom of the driveway for the pizza. A car pulls up and parks in the
driveway. Elliott pays the driver, then takes the pizza box from him as the
car pulls out of the driveway.

Elliott walks up the driveway and into the garage. He hears a noise in the
backyard, then calls out the name "HARVEY," presumably his dogs name.

INT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: NIGHT

Elliott's mother wears an orange outfit as she works in the kitchen. She
bends over to put dishes into the dishwasher. When she does this one of the
young boys reaches out to put his finger on her rear. Mike yells for him to
stop. He pulls his finger away.

INT: PATIO: NIGHT

Elliot walks past the ping pong table when he hears more noises in the
backyard. Again he calls out the name "Harvey."

[This generates tension and suspense in the audience.]

With the pizza box in hand, Elliot walks past the patio table and towards
the shed in the backyard. A bright crescent moon hangs in the night sky.

[This adds enchantment to the scene.]

There is a mist in the air, and a bright light shines in the shed. Elliott
places the pizza box on the ground as he approaches the shed. He's still
carrying the baseball and glove as he stands in front of the shed's
entrance. He tosses the ball into the shed. After a few seconds the ball is
tossed back out at him and hits him on the foot.

[This is the payoff to the setup of the baseball prop. This event surprises
both Elliott and the audience.]

Elliott becomes frightened, turns and steps on the pizza box as he runs
towards the house.

[This is the inciting event in Elliott's story: there is some creature
hiding out in his shed that will change his whole life.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: NIGHT

Elliott's mother is talking to the boys when Elliott runs into the house
screaming that there's something in the tool shed. He tells them that it
threw a ball at him, but they continue to ignore him until he screams
"QUIET!" "Nobody go out there," says Elliott. The boys immediately jump up
from the table. Two boys grab kitchen knives as Michael tells his mother to
stay inside. He and his friends will check it out. She yells at them to put
the knives back as she follows them outside.

EXT: SHED: NIGHT

The light is still on in the shed.

EXT: PATIO: NIGHT

Elliott's mother walks into the yard with a flashlight in her hand. She is
surrounded by the boys as they approach the shed. The mother says that
there's nothing in there as Michael walks through the entrance. Michael
bends down and finds tracks on the dirt floor. "The coyote's come back
again, Ma." he says. His mother becomes frightened and orders them all back
into the house.

[Jeopardy is introduced into the situation. Even though the audience knows
that it is probably the alien in the shed, the scene increases the
tension.]

On his way back to the house, Michael sees the pizza box. He bends down,
opens the box, then takes out a piece. He's angry at Elliott. Elliott tries
to explain that it was just an accident, but his brother is still angry.
When the mother asks who ordered the pizza, Elliott points to one of Mike's
friends. This makes the friend mad at Elliott. Elliot tries to persuade his
mother that there is a creature in the shed, but she doesn't believe him.
They walk into the house.

[Empathy is generated for Elliott because the two boys are unfairly angry
at him and his mother doesn't believe him.]

INT: SHED: NIGHT

The alien's fingers point out into the shed entrance, then wrap around the
side of the door. The sound of his heavy breathing is heard.

[This establishes for the audience that he really is in the shed. They feel
sorry for Elliott because he was telling the truth and no one believed
him.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S BEDROOM: NIGHT

The clock on the end table indicates 2:00. Next to the clock is a picture
of a dog, presumably Harvey. This same dog lies asleep in the bed. He hears
a noise and picks up his head. He is in the lower half of a bunk bed. On
the top bunk sits Elliott. He is awake as he listens to the noise outside.

[Elliott's objective is to prove there's a creature in the shed.]

EXT: BACKYARD: NIGHT

Elliott opens a gate and walks into the backyard. He carries a flashlight
in his hand and shines it into the cornfield next to his house. He walks
into the field.

EXT: CORNFIELD: NIGHT

Elliott walks into the cornfield. He whistles, and gets entangled in the
cornstalks as he walks. He sees tracks in the dirt with his baseball
nearby. He continues to walk through the field.

[The stalks are obstacles that obstruct both his path and his vision. It
also clutters the visuals and forces the audience to pay closer attention.
The suspense increases because they aren't sure whether he'll meet up with
the alien or the coyote.]

Elliott pushes aside some stalks and shines the light into the face of E.T.
Together, in unison, the scream. Elliot drops his light, then continues to
scream as he looks around the field. E.T. cries out and runs away through
the cornfield.

[Their reactions upon seeing each other were identical. This is the first
instance of a series of situations which will "merge" their characters to
such an extent that whatever empathy the audience has for one they will
also have for the other.]

EXT: BACKYARD: NIGHT

Elliott runs into his backyard. His play swings sway back and forth in the
air, as if someone had just bumped into them. Two garbage pails fall over
near an open metal gate at the top of a stone stairway. The garbage rolls
out of the cans and down the stone stairs. A red light by the gate lights
the stone stairway.

[The audience psychologically associates this red light with E.T.'s red
lighted heart, and makes the inference that he had run up the staircase and
out the gate.]

Elliott has an expression of wonderment and gratification on his face as he
looks up the staircase, for he has just established the existence of the
creature in the shed.]

EXT: GARAGE: DAY

Elliott rides down the driveway on his bicycle. He next rides down a dirt
road that overlooks the suburban community.

[Elliott's new objective is to locate the creature.]

EXT: FOREST ROAD: DAY

Elliott holds a bag of candy in one hand as he pours some into the other
hand. He tosses candy onto the round as he walks through the woods calling
out for the creature.

In another part of the woods Elliott lays his bike down, then continues to
toss candy and yell out "hello!" He sees a man on the road below and
quickly hides behind a tree.

["Keys," the faceless antagonist, is still pursuing the alien.]

Elliott runs back to his bike, then rides down the forest road past a wire
fence. The alien's fingers side down the side to the tree. He was watching
Elliott.

[Elliott is in jeopardy both from the faceless man and the faceless alien.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: DAY

Elliott's mother sits at the tale with the dog, Harvey, at her side.
Elliott, Michael and Gertie are eating supper.

[This is a home without a father, which creates more empathy for the
protagonist.]

Gertie asks Elliott what he's going as for Halloween. He's depressed, and
replies that he's not going. Mike mocks him by suggesting that he go as a
goblin. Elliott snaps back, telling Mike to shut up. The mother tries to
explain that it's not that they don't believe him, but Elliott cries out
that the creature was real.

[The audience also knows that the creature is real. This generates more
empathy for the protagonist, because he is mocked and not believed when he
is expressing the truth.]

Mike offers other suggestions: perhaps it was an iguana, a deformed child,
or maybe an Elf or a Leprechaun. Elliott gets angry and shouts "It was
nothing like that, penis breath." Mary, his mother shouts at him to sit
down. Elliott responds with "Dad would believe me." Mary replies "Maybe you
ought to call your father and tell him about it." "I can't. He's in Mexico
with Sally" says Elliott. Both Mary and Mike are upset, while Gertie asks
"Where's Mexico?" Mary excuses herself and leaves the table. She walks to
the window as Mike tells Elliott that he's going to kill him. "If you ever
see it again, don't touch it. Just call me and we'll have someone come and
take it away," says Mary. "Like the dog catcher?" says Gertie. "But they'll
give it a lobotomy, or do experiments on it or something," says Elliott.

[This sets up the audience's expectations about the harm that will befall
the alien when he is captured.]

After a bit of dialogue concerning who should be doing the dishes, Mary
leaves the room saying "He hates Mexico."

[This scene explores the emotional relationships between the family members
in greater detail. Empathy is also generated for Mary who was abandoned by
her husband. She is left with the responsibility of raising the children
while he's traveling with his new girlfriend to Mexico, a country which he
hates.]

Elliott takes some dishes to the sink, turns on the faucet and gazes out
the kitchen window as water steams up from the sink.

EXT: BACKYARD: NIGHT

A crescent moon floats in the sky. A bright light is on in the shed. In
front of the shed Elliott lies inside a sleeping bag on a folding chair
with a flashlight in his hand. He hears the sound of feet walking in the
underbrush.

Elliott sits up to see the alien standing in front of the shed. The alien
groans as Elliott freezes from fear in his chair. He tries to call out for
his mother, but can't get the words out of his mouth. He next tries to call
Mike, but fear makes him choke on his words.

The alien approaches Elliott. The bright light from the shed makes it
impossible to see his face: only the outline of his form is visible. The
alien walks right up to the edge of the lawn chair.

[The scene is filled with suspense because Elliott may be in jeopardy from
the creature.]

The alien slowly moves its hand over the chair, then drops candies onto the
blanket. Elliott relaxes.

[This non-verbal gesture by E.T. demonstrates that he is harmless. The
tension in the scene is thereby released. Elliott has achieved his
objective: he established contact with the alien.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: NIGHT

Elliott places candy on the carpet, then walks backwards down the hallway
towards his room. E.T. walks up the stairs and reaches out for the candy,
which he then takes into his hand and eats.

[Elliott's new objective is to get the alien into his room. His main
obstacles are to somehow persuade the alien to come into the house, while
not waking his family.]

[This scene also is a good example of how to structure a scene's beginning.
In real life, the scene would have started in the backyard, tracked through
the kitchen, the living room and then up the stairs. But since all of that
information would have been redundant, picking the action up from the top
of the stairs was sufficient.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM: NIGHT

Elliott places candy on the floor by the entrance to his room. A sign on
his door contains the word "ENTER." E.T picks up the candy.

Elliott has run out of candy. He goes to his desk in search for more. He
opens some drawers, but doesn't find any. When he returns to the doorway,
E.T. has already entered the room. E.T. pulls a box down from the table,
then knocks a can filled with pens onto the floor. This makes a loud noise,
and forces Elliott to quickly close the door to his room.

[The audience still does not have a clear view of E.T.'s face nor body.
This holds their attention during the scene. They are waiting for that
wonderful moment.]

Elliott throws a blanket over E.T. as they stare at each other. E.T. is
finally revealed to the audience.

Elliott moves his hand in front of his face, a gesture indicating
bewilderment. E.T. mimics this action.

[This is the beginning of their efforts to communicate, but also the start
of the audience emotionally identifying the two characters as one object of
empathy.]

Elliott places his fingers to his lips to see if E.T. will respond in the
same manner, which he does. Elliott then places one finger to his ear,
which E.T. also mimics. Elliott smiles, then holds his left hand up with
all five fingers spread apart. E.T. raises his left hand with three fingers
spread apart. Elliott closes his fingers until there is only one remaining
up. E.T. does the same. They both wiggle this one finger. A poster on the
wall between Elliott and E.T. has the word "SUPERSTAR" printed on it.

[These actions help the audience to conceive of these two characters as
"mirror images" of one another, worthy of equal empathy. It also bonds the
young children in the audience to them, because the characters are speaking
in a language they too can understand. All the children in the audience
have just been through the experience of learning a language. They can
easily identify with the problems that that two characters in the story are
having in communicating with each other. This forges a bond between the
children and both Elliott and E.T. This also forms the basis for the repeat
viewing of this film which was essential for its phenomenal box-office
success.]

Suddenly, Elliott becomes tired and yawns, then sways as if in a trance. He
slowly walks backwards and sits down in a chair. Elliott seems asleep as
the camera moves up for a closeup of Elliott's face.

[Presumably, E.T. has used his telepathic powers to place Elliott into a
trance in order to merge their minds and feelings.]

[This is the end of the first act. Elliott has succeeded in gaining
possession of the dramatic objective E.T.), and has him in his room. But
E.T. has also taken possession of Elliott by merging their feelings, so
that they both become one protagonist. The second act will end when they
are both captured by the antagonist.]

EXT: FOREST: DAY

Mist envelops the fence and gate in the section of the forest where E.T
originally landed. Men with flashlights and floodlights search throughout
the area. "Keys" walks into the forefront, holding a flashlight in his
hand. He bends to the ground and finds some candy.

[The objective of the faceless antagonist is to capture the alien. The
candy is a prop that will lead them to Elliott's house just as Elliott used
them to lead E.T. into his room. This scene shows that the protagonist is
in jeopardy, because he is still being pursued.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM: DAY

Elliott lies in bed with a thermometer in his mouth. His head rests on an
orange pillow (same color as his mother's dress in the first scene) while
his mother sits besides him. She takes out the thermometer, reads it, then
says "Okay, you're hot." She then leaves the room. Elliott quickly swings a
lamp back over his head and heats the thermometer. He also places a blue
heating pad over his face, to heat himself. He then places the thermometer
back into his mouth, swings the lamp away, and places the heating pad under
the covers as his mother enters the room. She opens his closet and
separates the hanging clothes as she walks into the closet. Elliott sits up
in bed and intensely watches her.

[Elliott's objective is to stay home from school in order to be with E.T.
His obstacle is his mother, who wants him to go to school. To overcome this
obstacle he must persuade her that he's sick. A crisis occurs when she
enters the closet in which E.T. is hiding. This creates jeopardy for the
protagonist.]

EXT: DRIVEWAY: DAY

Mike backs the car down the driveway.

INTERCUT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM

Mary walks out of the closet carrying a blue sleeping bag. Elliott is
tense, then relieved, once he realizes that she didn't find E.T. He falls
back into bed.

INTERCUT: DRIVEWAY

Mike backs the car over part of the lawn.

[This scene functions not only as comic relief, but also as a set up for
the scene here Mike has to drive the van during E.T.'s escape sequence.
This demonstrates both his incompetence, and that he is only allowed to
drive the car backwards down the driveway.]

INTERCUT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM

Mary covers Elliott with the blue sleeping bag as Elliott puts the
thermometer back into his mouth (first backwards, then he corrects it).

[Humor is generated because the audience knows that he is fooling his
mother.]

INTERCUT: DRIVEWAY

Mike continues to back the car down the driveway. He overshoots the edge
and goes out into the street. He then pulls forward across the sidewalk.

INTERCUT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM

"You were outside waiting for that thing?" says Mary. Elliott nods.

[Elliott is covered in blue-white colors, which traditionally signify
innocence, and which generates audience empathy for him.]

She tells him not to watch TV, kisses him, then leaves the room. Elliott
quickly closes the blinds.

EXT: DRIVEWAY: DAY

Mary runs down the driveway towards the car. Gertie points out the patches
of lawn that Mike pulled onto the driveway as he was driving the car. Mary
pulls her into the car.

INT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM: DAY

Elliott gestures for E.T. to walk out of the closet, which he does. He is
wearing Elliott's robe. Elliott asks him if he talks.

[Elliott's objective is to communicate with E.T., his obstacle is that E.T.
does not speak the English language.]

"Me Human. Boy. Elliott, Elliott, Elliott" says Elliott.

E.T. turns away and walks towards the work table. Elliott picks up objects,
such as a can of coke and toy soldiers, from the table then names them for
E.T. Elliott points to the fish and explains how the fish eat the fish
food. He places a wooden toy shark into the fishbowl, then states that the
shark eats the fish but nobody eats the shark.

[In his effort to communicate with E.T., Elliott tries to teach him the
language by showing him objects that are used in everyday life. This
process is similar to that experienced by the children and parents in the
audience everyday as they also learn and attempt to communicate with each
other. This type of scene solidifies the audience's emotional bonding with
Elliott and E.T.]

E.T. takes a toy car into his mouth on chews on it.

[Like many a child would.]

Elliott takes this to mean that E.T. is hungry. Elliott tells E.T. to stay
where he is.

[Elliott's new objective is to get food for E.T. and himself.]

Elliott opens the door and Harvey tries to run into the room. E.T. groans
with fear and backs into a corner as Elliott pulls Harvey out of the room.

[This introduces jeopardy into the scene, for Harvey could harm E.T.]

INT: KITCHEN: DAY

Elliott, dressed only in white underwear, opens the refrigerator door and
takes out some food.

INTERCUT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM

E.T. walks around the room.

INTERCUT: KITCHEN

Elliott opens up a jar of peanut butter.

INTERCUT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM

E.T. touches a tennis racket.

INTERCUT: KITCHEN

Elliott picks up cheese and tomatoes.

INTERCUT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM

E.T. picks up an umbrella.

INTERCUT: KITCHEN

Elliott takes a carton of milk out of the refrigerator.

INTERCUT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM

E.T. accidentally opens up the umbrella.

INTERCUT: KITCHEN

Elliott screams with fright and drops the milk carton onto the floor.

INTERCUT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM

E.T. screams with fright, drops the umbrella, then runs into the closet.

[This further establishes the merging of E.T. and Elliott into one being.
Elliott shares E.T.'s feelings and simultaneously experiences what he
experiences. The audience also experiences this surprise with them, which
further tightens the bonds.]

Milk flows from the open carton onto the floor, as Elliott leans into the
open refrigerator. He clutches his chest and looks up towards the ceiling
as he ponders his experience.

INT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM: DAY

Elliott carries a plate of food into the room. He walks past the open
umbrella and looks into the closet. Stuffed animals line the back of the
closet wall. E.T. pushes the animals forward. He was hiding behind them. He
is still shaking from the fright experience. "Are you okay? Too much
excitement, huh? You want a coke?"

[This is the resolution of the last scene sequence. We see both characters'
reactions to the events that have occurred.]

EXT: DRIVEWAY: DAY

Michael runs up the driveway towards his house. He's wearing a red football
blazer.

INT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: DAY

Michael opens the front door and runs into the house. He takes off his red
shirt to reveal the blue shirt he's wearing underneath. He picks up a
magazine then opens the refrigerator. "Nothing but health shit," he says,
as he takes out a can and shakes it.

[The audience tenses up because jeopardy has just been introduced into the
story. They wonder what will happen when Mike discovers E.T. in Elliott's
bedroom.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM: DAY

Elliott walks away from his closet and opens the door to his room. He tells
Mike to come in. Both boys are dressed in blue and white colors. Mike calls
Elliott a faker, then starts to tell him about scores on an asteroid game,
when Elliott interrupts, to tell him about the goblin. Michael makes fun of
Elliott and his belief that the goblin has returned. But Elliott persists,
and makes Mike promise to give Elliott "absolute power."

[This is the payoff to the "absolute power" concept as set up during the
DUNGEON AND DRAGONS scene.]

[Elliott's objective is to vindicate himself to his brother and sister by
proving that "the Goblin-E.T." really does exist.]

Ellott makes Mike close his eyes, then he retrieves E.T. from the closet
and leads him to the center of the room. Mike has a silly grin on his face
as he opens his eyes and turns around to look at E.T. A sickening look of
terror comes over his face.

Suddenly Gertie opens the door and walks into the room with her doll under
her arm, saying "Elliott, look what I made for you." E.T. sees her then
stretches his neck to raise his head high. Gertie walks right up to him and
screams. E.T. screams back at her. Elliott screams for both of them to
stop. Mike falls back against the wall and knocks down the bookcase. They
all scream together. Elliott grabs Gertie's mouth and pushes her back to
Mike.

"Kids, I'm home," shouts Mary from downstairs.

[Jeopardy! The mother, an adult, is about to discover E.T. Even though they
are terrified, the children all band together against the threat. They'd
rather sit in the closet with the "monster" than have their mother discover
him.]

Mike quickly shuts the door, then they all run to the closet. Gertie
screams again. Mike grabs her by the mouth and pulls her away as E.T. runs
across the room with his arms raised. Elliott shuts the closet door just as
his mother walks into his room. Mary notices the fallen bookcase. She looks
around and then comments, "This is no room, this is an accident." Elliot
tries to cover by saying he was "reorganizing."

INT: CLOSET: DAY

E.T.'s head appears among the stuffed animals. Mike has his hand over
Gertie's mouth as she tries to scream. Mary walks past the closet door.

[This creates suspense in the audience: will E.T. be discovered by Mary?]

Mary asks Elliot to keep an eye on Gertie while she takes a shower. She
kisses him on the head then leaves the room. Elliott opens the closet door.
Michael, in awe with mouth open wide, watches as Elliott approaches E.T.

"Elliott," whispers Mike. "I'm keeping him," says Elliott.

E.T. sits behind the stuffed animals as if he was one of them.

[The use of stuffed animals as props around E.T helps to transfer positive
feelings that the audience has for them to E.T.]

Gertie asks what it is as she and Michael approach E.T. Elliott tells her
that it won't hurt her. When asked if it's a boy or girl, Elliott replies
that it's a boy. He then tells her that she can't tell Mom about the
creature. When asked why not, he explains that "grownups can't see him.
Only little kids can see him." Gertie snaps back, "Give me a break."

[The charm in Gertie's character lies in the contradictory attributes of
being a sophisticated child. Humor is generated by this incongruity.]

Elliott then goes into his Dracula voice: "Then do you know what will
happen if you do tell?" He grabs Gertie's doll, tosses it to Mike and tells
him to "Do it!." Mike "tortures" the doll by twisting its arm. Gertie cries
as she runs to it. E.T. watches the scene with wonderment in his eyes.
Gertie finally promises not to tell about E.T. They all watch him as he
stretches his neck and lifts up his head.

EXT: COMMUNITY: DAY

On the hilltop overlooking the neighborhood stands a man with a camera as
he takes photos of the houses below. The man with keys on his waist walks
into the area, as other men comb the ground with electronic equipment.

[Jeopardy is introduced in the scene in order to maintain tension in the
audience. The antagonist is getting closer to the home of the protagonist.]

EXT: ELLIOTT`S HOUSE: NIGHT

[This is an establishing shot.]

INT: ELLIOTT`S HOUSE: NIGHT

Mary, carrying a yellow watering pail, walks across the room and waters a
large plant. Gertie pulls a little red wagon into the hallway. When asked
by Mary what she's doing, Gertie replies that she's going to play in
Elliott's room. "Okay, don't let them torture you," says the mother. "I
won't, Mary," replies Gertie.

[This generates humor because the child deals with the mother as if they
are equals.]

Gertie picks up a pot containing a sickly geranium plant and places it into
the wagon. The phone rings and Mary answers it off screen.

[The plant becomes an important prop because in the story it will represent
the health and well-being of E.T.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM: NIGHT

Gertie knocks on the door. Mike lets her and Harvey into the room. They
walk to the table where E.T. and Elliott are sitting. Gertie puts the
sickly plant n the table. E.T. puts his finger into the plant. Elliott
opens up an encyclopedia and points to California on a map of the United
States. "We are here," Elliott says as E.T. munches on celery. Michael
hands Elliott a globe and tells him to use this instead of the map. Elliott
points to the globe, then asks E.T. where he's from. E.T. points out the
window.

[Elliott's objective is to discover more about the alien.]

Elliott opens the book to a page that has the map of a galaxy. He points to
the planet earth, touches the globe, then says "HOME, HOME." E.T. makes a
soft noise that sounds similar to the word "home." Gertie watches him as he
picks up round objects and places them on the map: three small pieces of
fruit and two eggs. E.T.'s eyes concentrate on the table, which then starts
to shake. The two eggs and three small pieces of fruit then lift off the
table and float in the air. The children watch with awe.

[This introduction of "magical" powers that E.T. possesses was unexpected
and thereby helps to make the story unpredictable.]

Elliott screams with fright and the floating objects drop to the floor. He
walks to a lamp and stares into it. Mike asks what is wrong. "I don't know.
Something scary," says Elliott as E.T. places his finger on Elliott's
shoulder.

[Jeopardy is introduced into the scene with this comment. Yet it is not
E.T. who is to be feared, as indicated by his comforting gesture of placing
his finger on Elliott's shoulder.]

EXT: BACKYARD: NIGHT

Elliott runs by the shed, past a swaying swing, up the stairs to the red
lamppost and to the wire gate. He strains to hear the sounds of men
talking.

[The antagonist is getting closer to the home of the protagonist.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM: NIGHT

E.T. sits next to a lamp as he reads a child's ABC book. He sits next to a
Raggedy Ann doll.]

[Another image of E.T. learning the language which helps to forge a bond
between him and children in the audience. Good feelings for the doll are
also transferred to the alien.]

On the floor next to E.T. is the pot containing the sickly flowers. He
looks at the flowers, makes a moaning sound, and suddenly they become
healthy and transform into full bloom.

[This establishes the magical healing powers of E.T.]

EXT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: DAY

Elliott and Mike walk down the driveway. They are on their way to school.
They discuss E.T., arguing about how smart he is.

[This is just a transition scene.]

EXT: STREET: DAY

Mike and Elliot walk towards a bus stop where a group of children are
waiting. Mike's friends torment Elliott about his "goblin."

[This generates more audience empathy for Elliott, who is unfairly mocked
by the ignorant boys. Elliott still has not earned the respect of Mike's
friends, which is one of his dreams.]

They finally get on the bus as Elliott walks away, followed by a pretty
blonde girl who seems to have a crush on him. Michael appears worried as he
sits on the bus among the other children who are throw- ing objects at each
other.

INT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: DAY

Gertie stands on the stairway looking up, presumably thinking about E.T. in
Elliott's room. Mary comes running downstairs and tells Gertie that they
have to get into the car, otherwise they'll be late. Suddenly, Mary hears a
noise upstairs. She goes up to see what caused the sound.

[Jeopardy: E.T. is in danger of being discovered by an adult. The
audience's expectations were shaped in the earlier dinner scene, where Mary
told the children she would call to have the creature taken away if he came
around the house again. This is what the audience expects her to do if she
finds E.T.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S BEDROOM: DAY

Mary walks into the closet and looks around. The camera pans across the
large faces of all the stuffed dolls: Raggedy Ann, a Bear, a Monkey, E.T.'s
Face, a Lion, etc. Mary doesn't notice E.T., then closes the closet door
and leaves.

[Humor is generated because of the incongruity of a living creature among
the dolls, and the inability of Mary to distinguish between them. The
laughter releases the tension that was created in the previous scene. This
also reinforces the audience's emotional ties to E.T., since he is so
"doll-like."]

INT: SCHOOL: DAY

A teacher walks down the aisle and announces to the class that today they
will perform the frog dissection for which they have been preparing. As he
passes Elliott's desk, he starts to say "frogs similar to," then he notices
the drawing of E.T. The teacher picks it up. Elliott turns to see the
pretty blonde girl staring at him. Realizing she's been caught, she quickly
turns and looks away.

[This attraction to Elliott is set up in order to payoff before the end of
the school sequence.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM: DAY

E.T. opens the door to Elliott's room and walks out into the hallway.
Harvey sees and quickly approaches.

[Jeopardy: will the dog attack E.T.? At there last encounter E.T. was
frightened by Harvey.]

INTERCUT: CLASSROOM

The teacher continues his instructions, telling the students that the
scalpel is very sharp, and that they should use discretion when cutting.
There should be very little blood, and maybe a little body fluids.

[This exposition of the plans sets up the audience's expectations, which
later will not be fulfilled. This is a standard structure used to generated
excitement and unpredictability in a story.]

INT: KITCHEN: DAY

E.T., wearing a blue-flannel shirt, walks into the kitchen with Harvey at
his side. He opens the refrigerator. Harvey licks his lips as he watches in
anticipation of getting something to eat. E.T. takes out a plastic
container of potato salad, opens it, then sticks his tongue into the salad.
He hates the taste and throws it onto the floor. Harvey licks it up. E.T.
then picks up a can of beer and drinks it as Harvey barks.

INTERCUT: SCHOOL

Elliott sits at his desk as he listens to the teacher speak. Elliott burps.
All the children in the classroom stare at him.

[This again shows the merging of Elliott and E.T.]

INTERCUT: KITCHEN

E.T., drunk, wobbles across the kitchen floor and walks into a counter.

INTERCUT: SCHOOL

Elliott places his fingers to his head. He is also becoming drunk. The
teacher tells the class that in this bisection they should locate the heart
and notice that it is still beating.

[The red-lit heart is the most prominent feature of E.T. Having the teacher
focus on the frog's heart starts the identification in the audience's mind
of the frogs and E.T.]

INTERCUT: KITCHEN

E.T. turns and walks into another wall as Harvey continues to eat the
potato salad on the floor.

INTERCUT: SCHOOL

Elliott, now drunk, slides down in his chair.

INTERCUT: KITCHEN

E.T. turns, walks, then collapses head first onto the floor.

INTERCUT: SCHOOL

Elliott slides under his desk and falls onto the floor. The teacher doesn't
hear this because at that moment he pulls down a wall hanging which
contains pictures of a frog's anatomy.

INTERCUT: KITCHEN

E.T. opens another can of beer.

INTERCUT: SCHOOL

Elliott pulls himself up off the floor with a drunken smile on his face.

INTERCUT: KITCHEN

E.T. gulps down another can of beer.

INTERCUT: SCHOOL

Elliott, drunk, sits at his desk. He turns and smiles at the pretty blonde
girl across the aisle. She turns away from him with disgust.

INTERCUT: LIVING ROOM

E.T. plays on the keys of a voice generating language game. He next presses
a button on a remote control which activates the TV set. A cartoon appears
with a cat getting its tail caught on fire. The cat screams and E.T reacts
with horror. He throws the beer can at the TV set.

[Laughter is generated, for while this under normal circumstances would be
inappropriate behavior, he makes sense given E.T.'s point of view.]

He then presses another button on the remote, and the image of a flying
plane appears on the screen. A spaceship next appears, and pulls the plane
up towards it.

INTERCUT: SCHOOL

The teacher carries a jar of cotton balls soaked in chloroform, which he
drops into the jars containing frogs. He tells the children to immediately
put the lids on the jars. After telling the children that this won't hurt
the frogs, he places a cotton ball into the last two jars, one of which
belongs to Elliott. Elliott doesn't place the cover on his jar, but instead
sadly watches as the frog tries to escape. Slowly he places to lid on it,
as he gazes at the frog.

"Say hi. Can you talk? Can you talk? Can you say hi?" says Elliott.

[Elliott is making an emotional identification of the frog with E.T. by
attempting the same process of communication. The situation also creates
expectations in the audience that similar things will happen to E.T. once
he is captured.]

CLOSEUP: FROG'S FACE

CLOSEUP: E.T.'S FACE

[A cinematic technique which reinforces the identification of the frog with
E.T. This sets up the audience for E.T.'s operation. They expect the frog
to die, and they project these expectations to E.T. later in the story.]

INTERCUT: LIVING ROOM

E.T. has a hangover as he hiccups and puts his hand on his head. He then
picks up the cartoon section of a newspaper. One cartoon strip has a
picture of a communication device with a caption stating "HELP, HELP."

On the TV monitor a woman is talking long distance n her telephone to her
Uncle Ralph in California. E.T. hears the sounds coming from the TV, then
turns to look at the monitor, where he sees a man talking into a phone in
his hand. The camera pans to a phone near E.T. A child in the TV program
picks up the phone, says hello to his uncle, then hangs up.

[This generates laughter because it's inappropriate behavior to just say
hello, then hang up.]

E.T. looks closer at the Buck Rogers cartoon. One cell has an image of a
man in a spacesuit setting up a transmitter. The next cell has him saying
"It works" as the communication device transmits "help, help!" E.T. lifts
up his head from the newspaper.

INTERCUT: SCHOOL

"Save him" shouts Elliott. Elliott picks up his jar, unscrews the top, then
lets out his frog, screaming "Run for your life. Back to the forest! Run!"

[Another merging of E.T. and Elliott's feelings and thoughts. E.T.
presumably had the feeling of wanting to be saved by his friends, and this
feeling prompted Elliott to cry out.]

He next opens the jar of the girl besides him. Elliott struggles with one
student, then proceeds to turn over many of the other jars as he frees the
frogs. Some of the other children also free their frogs.

INTERCUT: LIVINGROOM

E.T. studies the electronic circuitry of the language game. Suddenly John
Wayne comes on the screen. E.T. is fascinated with his image. It's a scene
from the movie "QUIET MAN." Maureen O'Sullivan huddles in a corner of the
room.

INTERCUT: SCHOOL

A pile of frogs gather at the feet of a terrified little girl with blonde
braids. Elliott, drunk, staggers by her.

INTERCUT: LIVINGROOM

E.T. continues to watch the TV monitor as the woman in the movie screams.

INTERCUT: SCHOOL

A blonde girl who has a crush on Elliott screams when a frog is placed on
her shoes.

INTERCUT: LIVINGROOM

The woman in the movie runs out the door. John Wayne grabs hold of her arm.

INTERCUT: SCHOOL

Elliott grabs hold of the blonde girl as she runs out the door.

INTERCUT: LIVINGROOM

John Wayne pulls the woman back.

INTERCUT: SCHOOL

Elliott pulls the blonde girl back.

INTERCUT: LIVINGROOM

John Wayne takes the woman into his arms.

INTERCUT: SCHOOL

Elliott takes the blonde girl into his arms.

INTERCUT: LIVINGROOM

John Wayne kisses the woman.

INTERCUT: SCHOOL

Elliott, too short to kiss her, stands on the back of a student who was
crawling on the floor after a frog. Elliott kisses the girl.

INTERCUT: LIVINGROOM

E.T., filled with fascination, watches the TV monitor.

INTERCUT: SCHOOL

The children's hands poke through the windows and free the frogs by
throwing them out onto the grass.

[Elliott was able to accomplish his objective of freeing the frogs. This
sequence was structured to run in parallel in order to emphasize the
merging of Elliott and E.T.]

INT: LIVING ROOM: DAY

A blanket containing aluminum foil, electrical toys and appliances is
pulled across the floor.Mary opens the door and yells hello. Harvey runs to
the front door. E.T walks out from behind the TV and kicks beer cans across
the floor.

[The alien quickly learns the appropriate behavior for drinking at home.]

Mary, with her arms filled with grocery bags and clothes from the cleaners,
walks into the kitchen. She is followed by Gertie, who sees E.T standing
near the refrigerator. Mary opens the refrigerator door, and knocks E.T. in
the head. He falls backwards onto the floor. Gertie helps E.T. up off the
floor. He walks past Mary as he goes back to the refrigerator. Mary still
doesn't see him.

[This increases the audience's tension. They are expecting E.T. to be
discovered by Mary, and they are expecting her to scream.]

Gertie keeps telling her that she wants Mary to meet somebody, but Mary
ignores her as she talks about how much the price of food has gone up in
one week. E.T. grabs a can of coffee from the kitchen table, then again
walks past Mary as she goes in the opposite direction. He goes back into
the TV room.

[The laughter's produced by Mary's failure to see the reality of the alien
who's right under her nose.]

Gertie is watching a language teaching program for children on the TV. The
program is teaching words that begin with the letter "B". The phone rings
as Mary accidentally kicks a can of beer across the floor. She answers the
phone with the beer can in her hand. The person on the phone tells Mary
that Elliott is intoxicated.

Gertie, watching the TV monitor, responds to the program by practicing the
"B" words. E.T. pokes his head up from behind the monitor and says
"BBBBBBB." Gertie stares at him as he repeats the "B" sound, then lowers
his head back down below the TV.

"You said 'B'," says Gertie. "B," repeats E.T. "You said 'B,' good," says
Gertie. "B...GOOD," repeats E.T.

[This is a set up for the closing communication between E.T. and Gertie
before he flies away in the spacecraft. This is also the first moment that
he spoke an English word. Many children and parents in the audience can
identify with this moment, and the first moral precept usually taught to a
child: be good.]

Mary hangs up the phone and tells Gertie that she has to pick up Elliott.
She asks Gertie to be a good girl. "Mommy, he can talk," says Gertie. "Of
course he can talk," says Mary, referring to the TV program.

[The humor is generated from Mary's misunderstanding of Gertie's
statement.]

As Mary leaves, E.T. walks out from behind the TV. He walks to a phone and
stares. "Phone," says Mary. "Phone," says E.T. E.T. presses the numbers of
the phone. "You want to call somebody?" asks Gertie.

[This establishes E.T.'s objective: to communicate with his fellow
creatures so that he can return home.]

INT: HOUSE: DAY

Elliott walks up the stairs to his room. Mary's voice can be heard from
below saying she refuses to pay for frogs.

[This is a fine example of the point of attack for a scene: Instead of
showing what would happen in real life (Mary's discussions with the teacher
about Elliott's behavior in the classroom), the scene picks up with what is
important for the audience: Elliott's discovery that E.T. can now talk. A
scene showing Mary in school would be redundant and dramatically
irrelevant.]

Elliott is walking towards his room when he hears Gertie talking to E.T. in
her room. He drops his bags on the floor, and quickly enters her room.

"Be good, be good," says Gertie as she closes the doors to her closet.
Elliott pushes Gertie away from the closet and opens it. Inside is E.T.
dressed up in girl clothes with a blonde wig on his head. He has a rabbit
fur around his neck and wears a black hat with flowers.

[This is completely inappropriate attire for an alien, whether male or
female. The visual incongruity of E.T. in girl's clothes generates the
laughter.]

"Oh God!" says Elliott. "Elliott," says E.T. "What?" says Elliott, not yet
realizing that it was E.T. who spoke. "Elliott, Elliott," repeats E.T. "I
taught him how to talk. He can talk now," says Gertie.

[Elliott, with the help of Gertie and the TV program, has completed one of
Elliott's objectives: communicating with E.T.]

Gertie points out the things that E.T. has brought upstairs: electrical
toys and the plant. She wonders what he needs this for. E.T. holds the
cartoon page of the newspaper out to Elliott. "E.T., can you say that? Can
you say E.T.?" asks Elliott. "E.T.," repeats E.T. Elliott laughs with joy.
E.T keeps repeating his name as he turns and walks through the closet into
Elliott's room.

"E.T., be good," says E.T. "Be good," I taught him that too," says Gertie.

["Be good" is a fundamental value taught children, as basic as the
principle "There's no place like home," taught in the WIZARD OF OZ.]

"You should give him his dignity. This is the most ridiculous thing I've
ever seen," says Elliott.

E.T. hands Elliott the newspaper, and points to the Buck Rodgers comic
strip. He then says "PHONE". Elliott is amazed at this. E.T. walks into the
closet and says "HOME." Elliott confirms that this is E.T.'s home. E.T.
then turns, walks to the window, points to the sky, and says "E.T. HOME
PHONE."

"E.T. PHONE HOME" says Gertie. "E.T. PHONE HOME" says Elliott.

"He wants to call somebody," says Gertie.

[This reconfirms E.T.'s objective.]

Mike walks into the room and laughs at E.T.'s attire.

"E.T. Phone Home," says E.T.

"Oh my God, he's talking now," says Mike.

E.T. once again points out the window and repeats that he wants to call
home.
"And they'll come?, says Elliott.
"Come?" responds E.T. "Home, home" he repeats.

EXT: STREET: NIGHT

A truck drives down the street. Inside a man with earphones listens to the
conversations in the neighborhood homes, as he fine tunes his electronic
eavesdropping equipment. He focuses in on Elliott's voice.

[Jeopardy: the forces of the antagonist are getting closer and closer. They
are now inside the privacy of the protagonist's home, listening to their
most intimate conversations.]

INT: GARAGE: NIGHT

Elliott, Mike and Harvey are in the garage searching for objects that E.T.
could use in building his communications device. Elliott restates that he
has "absolute power" and that E.T. belongs to him.

[Elliott's objective is to possess E.T., not set him free. Freeing the one
he loves is the lesson he will have to learn in this story.]

EXT: STREET: NIGHT

The van containing electronic eavesdropping equipment drives past Elliott's
house.

[They are still in jeopardy: their actions and words are being monitored.]

INT: GARAGE: DAY

Mike tells Elliott that E.T. doesn't look too good anymore.
"Don't say that, we're fine!" says Elliott.
"What's all this we stuff. You say we all the time now. Look Elliott,
I think he might be getting sick," replies Michael.

[This confirms Elliott's belief that he considers himself and E.T. to be
one being. It also introduces further jeopardy for E.T. Besides being
tracked by the antagonist, he is also becoming sick.]

INT: VAN: NIGHT

The man with the earphones is listening to Elliott and Michael's
conversation as they discuss E.T.'s sickness.

INT: GARAGE: DAY

Mike tells Elliott to grab the fuzzbuster. Elliott pulls his father's blue
shirt out from the shelf. They reminisce about the days when he used to
take them to baseball games and the movies, where they would have baseball
fights. Mike says that they'll do that again, but Elliott doesn't really
believe him. They each smell their father's shirt.
"Old Spice," says Mike.
"Sea Breeze," says Elliott.

[Here a prop (their father's shirt) is used to reveal the emotional
relationships between the two boys and their father. Audience empathy is
generated for them because they have been abandoned by their father. The
audience's anger is transferred from the father to the antagonist who is
eavesdropping on this private intimate moment.]

INT: VAN: NIGHT

The man in the van continues to listen to Elliott and Michael's
conversation. Only the listener's eye is clearly visible.

[This is a cinematic technique to signify the "ever-watching eye" of the
faceless antagonist.]

INT: GERTIE'S ROOM: NIGHT

Mary lies in bed next to Gertie as she reads her the Peter Pan story. Mary
reads that Peter has defeated the Indians, but Wendy and the boys have been
captured by the pirates. He vows to rescue her. E.T. watches them from the
closet.

[Here the notion of "a rescue" is introduced, and visually associated with
E.T. as he watches them from the closet. This is an emotional set up for
the audience, so that they will later be supportive of Elliott and the
boy's efforts to rescue E.T.]

Mary reads the section of the Peter Pan story where Tinker Bell becomes
poisoned. Elliott comes into the closet, stands next to E.T., then closes
the door behind them.

"Tinkerbell swallows the draft as Peter's hand reaches for it," reads Mary.
"Why T, you have drunk my medicine."

Elliott pulls E.T. away from the door, then shifts through a box of items
that he brought up from the garage. He cuts his finger on the blade of a
power saw, then says "OUCH," as he holds his bleeding finger up into the
air. E.T. points his own finger towards Elliott. E.T.'s finger glows like a
laser light as he says "ouch." He then presses this lit finger on Elliott's
cut and heals it.

[This establishes the fundamental goodness and healing power of E.T.]

E.T. opens the slit in the closet door and continues to watch Mary read to
Gertie the part where Tinker Bell is dying.

"She says she thinks she can get well again if children believe in fairies.
Do you believe in fairies? Say quick that you believe."
"I DO! I DO! I DO!" says Gertie.
"If you believe, clap your hands."
Both Gertie and Mary clap their hands. Elliott places a blanket around
E.T.'s shoulders and a scarf around his neck, as they listen to the rest of
the story.
"Thank you, thank you. And now to rescue Wendy," reads Mary. Elliott places
his arm around E.T.

[The Peter Pan story is used to set up the audience's emotional reactions
to a fairy tale concerning near death and rescue. This emotional empathy
will then be transferred to E.T., another "fairy-like creature" when he
becomes sick and is rescued. Just as the audience felt like clapping for
Tinker Bell, they will applaud the children's efforts to save E.T.]

EXT: HOUSE: NIGHT

Exhaust flows from the tailpipe of a van. This is the same type of
poisonous exhaust image that the audience saw when vans drove into the
forest at the beginning of the movie.

[Jeopardy: the forces of the antagonist are still nearby.]

INT: BEDROOM: NIGHT

Elliott, dressed in white long-johns, sits on his bunkbed as he watches
E.T. Michael stands next to him. Elliott comments that E.T. is putting
together his instrument, while Mike fears that it might blow up the house.
He also comments on the irregularity of E.T.'s breathing.

[More jeopardy, both in Mike's fears of his family and home being
destroyed, and in E.T.'s illness becoming progressively worse.]

E.T places his communication device over the Buck Rodgers comic strip.

[This movement establishes a mental association between the device and the
spaceman's communication efforts in the comic strip.]

Petals drop off the flower in the pot.

[This represents E.T.'s failing health.]

E.T. lifts up his head (which indicates he's using his telekinetic powers),
then lifts part of his communication device into the air. He next lifts up
the umbrella and opens it. Both objects float in the air in front of him.

[E.T's primary objective is to go home. To accomplish this he must create a
communication device. This is his sub-objective, which appears to be
completed. He next must activate this device from the landing site and call
home. The obstacles he has to overcome are Mary, the community, and the
distance to the forest. These obstacles will be confronted in the next
scenes.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM: DAY

Preparing for Halloween, Elliott paints his lips with makeup. He talks to
Gertie about her going out that night as a ghost. They review the evening
plans. She will meet them at the lookout.

[This is an example of incomplete exposition which engages the audience.
They only talk about part of the plan: the meeting at the lookout. They
don't discuss anymore details, such as deceiving Mary into thinking that
Gertie is with them instead of E.T. The partial information forces the
audience to stay involved with the action and to create their own
conjectures about what will happen.]

INT: CLOSET: DAY

Mike helps Elliot put on his knapsack. Elliott then places a sheet over
E.T.

INT: STAIRCASE: DAY

E.T., covered with a sheet and clown shoes, walks down the staircase. The
clown shoes cover his three-toed feet.

INT: HOUSE: DAY

Mary walks through the house dressed in a tight fitting leopard skin dress
with facial makeup that makes her look like a cat. Mike tells his mother to
wait and not peek, as he and Elliott lead E.T. into the room. Finally, Mary
turns and shrieks with glee. She runs to get a camera.

[The tension in the situation is caused by their fear that E.T. will be
discovered by Mary. Mike and Elliott's objective is to get him out of the
house undiscovered.]

E.T. looks through holes cut out for his eyes and sees Michael with a fake
butcher knife through his head. He lights up his finger in an attempt to
heal Mike's wound. Mike grab's E.T.'s hand and puts it back under the
sheet. "Ouch, ouch" says E.T, as he tries once again to heal Mike. "It's a
fake knife, it's fake," says Mike.

[Laughter is generated because while E.T.'s behavior would be appropriate
if Mike was really wounded, it is inappropriate in this situation since the
knife is fake.]

Mary comes back with a camera and prepares to photograph them.

"You look great," says Mary.
"Thank you," says Mike.
"Thank you," says Elliott.
"Thank you," says E.T.
Mary doesn't notice that E.T. has spoken.

[Laughter is generated by the "rule of three" humor structure and Mary's
ignorance.]

When Mary takes the photo, the flash shocks E.T. and knocks him onto the
floor. Mike and Elliott quickly pull him up before Mary notices and lead
him out of the house.

[They succeed in their objective with the help of their "not so smart"
mother.]

EXT: STREET: DAY

Mary walks down the driveway as she orders them to be home no later than
one-hour after sundown. E.T., dressed in the sheet, turns and looks at
Mary, then continues down the driveway with Mike and Elliott.

[This creates a "timelock", a sense of urgency, and the expectation of an
upset mother if they haven't returned by the assigned time.]

EXT: COMMUNITY: DAY

Establishing shot of the neighborhood. On a hilltop by a fence stands
another person in a white sheet (presumably Gertie). She kicks dirt at the
bicycle near the fence.

[This is the end objective of Mike, Elliot and E.T.: to connect up with
Gertie at the lookout. Their obstacle is to get E.T past all the children
on the streets.]

EXT: STREET: DAY

The sun is setting. Children in Halloween costumes walk through the
streets. E.T. walks between Mike and Elliott, as he watches the other
children parade by. One child dressed as YODA from RETURN OF THE JEDI walks
by. E.T. turns and walks after him saying "HOME,HOME."

[The laughter is obviously the result of E.T. misinterpreting the situation
by believing that the child is another alien.]

They walk towards the setting sun as Mike reminds Elliott that he must be
back by one hour after sunset. Elliott promises to try, but he wants Mike
to cover for him.

[This creates jeopardy for the characters, because if they don't complete
their mission within the time frame, they will have trouble with Mary.]

EXT: HILLTOP: DAY

The sun is setting as Mike, Elliott, and two small characters covered with
sheets stand on the hilltop overlooking the city. Elliott asks Mike to help
him lift E.T. onto the bike. Mike does and then tells Elliott that they
will be waiting for him.

[They have reached this objective. The next objective for Elliott and E.T
is to get to the landing site in the forest.]

EXT: FOREST: DAY

Elliott, with E.T sitting in the front basket, rides his bicycle through
the forest. The road becomes very bumpy. Elliott tells E.T. that they will
have to walk from there. Suddenly, E.T. takes control of the bike through
the use of his telekinetic powers and speeds it forward. Eliott becomes
frightened as E.T. speeds the bike towards a cliff and then drives it over
the edge. E.T. then makes the bike up through the air.

[The audience gulps from suspense and then goes into elation by this
surprising and magical turn of events.]

They continue to fly over the tree tops. Elliott yells "Not so high, not so
high."

[E.T and Elliott both have white hoods over their heads, which further
visually reinforces their identification.]

They ride across the front of the moon, the guiding light of magic. Elliott
laughs with glee. When they start their descent he begs E.T. not to crash.
They hit the ground. The bike turns over, and both E.T. and Elliott are
thrown to the ground.

INT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: NIGHT

The grandfather clock indicates 9:45. Mary watches the clock as she sits in
front of lighted candles. The time has long passed when Elliott was
supposed to be home. The lighted candles give a church like effect as if
Mary was praying for the safety of her children. She is upset that they
haven't returned. She blows out the candles, then taps out another candle
with her wand.

[There is jeopardy for the children as Mary and the audience wonder if they
are okay. Empathy is generated for Mary who is truly concerned for the
safety of her children.]

EXT: FOREST: NIGHT

The sun has set. It's nighttime in the forest. E.T opens a box which
contains the saw blade brought to him by Elliott. Elliott ties a rope up to
a tree branch. He then opens the umbrella which is lined with aluminum foil
and points it towards the star-filled sky. It will function as a
transmitter. E.T. places a coat hanger with nails above the saw blade,
plugs a cable into a battery, then activates the toy language teaching
device.

[They succeeded in completing their objective to reach the landing site.
Their new objective is to communicate with E.T.'s fellow aliens in order to
accomplish E.T.'s primary objective, which is to return home.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: NIGHT

Mary, still dressed in her leopard outfit, leaves the house. She is very
upset that her children have not yet returned home. She mumbles to herself,
sticks the wand in her mouth, and shakes the car keys. She gets into the
car and mumbles that their father is going to hear about this one.
"Mexico!" she says. She drives down the driveway and into the street to
search for her children.

[This creates more empathy for Mary, who is very upset that her small
children are out this late. The parents in the audience can easily identify
with her. But the real function of this scene is to get her out of the
house so that the antagonist can invade their home. She could have stayed
inside, we never see her in the car searching for the children, and the
next time we do see her is by the refrigerator in the kitchen.]

Men get out of a parked car as Mary drives away. They take suitcases out of
a second car, then walk up the driveway to Elliott's house.

EXT: FOREST: NIGHT

Elliott watches the treetops sway. He scratches his face, as does E.T.
Together they stare at the stars. The wind causes the branch to sway, which
then pulls the rope, which, in turn, pulls a fork across the saw blade.
This drags the nails in the hanger across the flat surface of the blade,
and sends signals out into space. Elliott is overjoyed and shouts that it
works, while E.T. repeats the word "Home." Together they gaze up to the
stars.

[They have accomplished their objective of sending a message into space.
Now, they wait to receive a signal back.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: NIGHT

The light from a flashlight crosses in front of a pumpkin's face. More
light floods through the slits of Gertie's door. A hand holding a
flashlight opens Gertie's door, and shines the light into the face of a
black doll.

[This has an irritating and frightening effect on anyone in the audience
who has ever had the experience of having a light shined into their face.]

Light from the flashlight searches around Gertie's room.

INT: HALLWAY: NIGHT

A pile of yellow electrical cord is stacked on the floor near a chair. It
slowly unwinds as it is pulled by someone in Elliott's room. The door to
Elliott's room is shut, with a poster sign hanging on it saying "DO NOT
ENTER." The silhouette of a man passes behind the door, as sounds of a
Geiger counter filter into the air. Muffled voices are heard as the cord is
pulled to its fullest extent. It forces a chair to slam against the wall.

[This last action has a jarring effect on the audience. Emotionally, the
audience is outraged at the invasion of the children's rooms, and this
creates hatred for the antagonist and his cohorts. They are still faceless
so the audience can project the face of the persons they most hate onto
these characters. This personalizes the story for them and gets them more
intensely involved on an emotional basis. They also become intellectually
involved, because the sounds of the Geiger counter and the extension of the
cord to its maximum length forces them to infer that the antagonist has
found E.T.'s "home" in the closet. This involves the audience in the story
much more than if the filmmaker had shown the antagonist poking around in
the closet.]

EXT: FOREST: NIGHT

"We have to go now E.T. It's so late already," Elliott says as both he and
E.T. sadly gaze into the sky.

[Their objective of receiving a return signal has not been achieved. Their
sadness at failure creates empathy for them in the audience.]

Elliott coughs from being out in the cold, damp air.

[This is a setup for the later scenes when both Elliott and E.T. are
deathly ill.]

Elliott repeats that they really have to go home, but E.T. ignores him and
has a sad expression on his face as he stares up to the sky. Elliott tells
them that he has to give them some time. E.T. responds by saying "ouch,"
signifying that he feels pain. A small fawn watches them from a distance.

[The jeopardy in the scene is due to their being so late. Mary will be very
angry and they face the obstacle of getting E.T. back into the house
without being discovered. The fawn generates feelings of sympathy in the
audience which is transferred to E.T. The audience also empathizes with the
sadness they feel at failing to make contact. For now, supposedly, E.T.
won't be able to go home.]

"You could be happy here. I could take care of you," says Elliott
tearfully. I wouldn't let anybody hurt you. We could grow up together,
E.T."

[Elliott states his primary objective: to always have E.T. with him.]

"Home, Home," says E.T.

[E.T. states his primary objective: to go home.]

Elliott sits down and cries. E.T. touches one of his tears.

[The audience empathizes with the sadness of both characters.]

EXT: FOREST: NIGHT

It's morning. Elliott is asleep as he leans against a large rock. He is
covered with a blanket as the wet forest mist surrounds him. Next to him
lies E.T.'s communication device.

Elliott coughs, gets up, tugs on the rope which activates the device, then
looks around for E.T. but can't find him.

[The new objective: where is E.T. and what has happened to him? This is
also the new question that will maintain the audience's interest.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: DAY

Mary opens the refrigerator door and puts back a carton of milk. Mike and
Gertie sit besides her. A policeman asks Mary how Elliott was dressed when
she last saw him. Mary tells him that he was dressed as a hunchback. The
policeman, whose face is not shown (I suppose so that the audience will
associate him as "one of them"), asks Mary if there is any indication that
he might have run away? Were there any family problems or recent arguments?
Mary explains that she and her husband had just separated and that this has
not been easy on the kids.

"My father is in Mexico," says Gertie.

[This scene generates empathy for the whole family.]

Mary slams the refrigerator door shut, thereby revealing Elliott standing
behind it. White light floods onto him making him look ghastly. Mary hugs
him as Mike and Gertie join them.

[The audience is relieved and overjoyed with Elliott's safe return.]

"Oh Elliott," she says as she hugs him. "Don't ever do this again, Elliott.
You're so hot."

Elliott is feverish from spending the night outside. Mary tells Gertie to
go upstairs and draw him a bath. Mary walks over to the policeman (whose
face is still unseen) and thanks him for his concern.

Elliott asks Mike if E.T. is in the house. Mike shakes his head, indicating
no. Elliot pleads with Mike to find him. He's somewhere in the forest near
the bald spot.

[This is the new objective: find E.T. and bring him back.]

EXT: STREET: DAY

Mike rides the bicycle with the basket in front down the driveway and into
the street, past a car filled with waiting men. The car starts and follows
Mike. He looks behind and realizes that he is being pursued.

[This is a standard chase scene, with a friend who is trying to save the
life of the protagonist being pursued. Both he and the protagonist are in
jeopardy. Mike's new sub-objective is to lose those who are following him.]

Mike cuts through a backyard and into an alley behind some houses. The car
follows him. Mike then rides up an embankment and drives off in the
opposite direction, leaving the car stranded behind.

[He successfully accomplished his subobjective.]

EXT: FOREST: DAY

Mike rides through the forest as he calls out E.T.'s name. He stops and
searches for E.T. Mike finds the abandoned communication device, then runs
up a path and discovers E.T.'s white sheet hanging from the open gate.

[The blue-orange colors of E.T.'s communication device are the same colors
that Spielberg chose the logo of his production company, AMBLIN
ENTERTAINMENT.]

[This is the same gate near the landing site that the characters ran past
in the opening sequence.]

In another part of the forest, Mike rides his bike on a ridge above a
stream. E.T lies in the water below, is skin discolored to that of sickly
white. Mike sees him, grabs the sheet, then runs down the embankment. A
raccoon wanders near E.T. Mike shouts him away, then covers E.T. Mike hears
the sounds of a helicopter above him and looks up at the sky.

[Mike has achieved his objective: he has found E.T. But, danger hovers
above him in the unseen presence of the ever observing antagonist.]

EXT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: DAY

The shadow of a man falls on the driveway. The sound of keys jangling is
heard.

[High jeopardy: the antagonist is about to invade the home of the
protagonist.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: DAY

Mike is in the hallway as Mary walks up the stairs. She has a cup of coffee
in her hand.

[The cup is a prop which will be used to reveal Mary's emotions.]

He wants her to come with him. He asks her if she remembers the goblin. He
tries to get her to make a promise, but she is annoyed with him.

INT: BATHROOM: DAY

Michael then opens the door to the bathroom. Elliott is sitting on the
floor as Gertie sits on the counter. They are both looking into the
bathtub. Mary smiles as she walks into the bathroom with the cup of coffee
in her hand. Then she sees E.T. on the floor. He is a sickly white. He
extends his arms out towards her. Mary is stunned, as she turns the cup
over and coffee pours out onto the floor.

[Here a character's non-verbal action with a prop reveals her true
emotional state. She has lost it.]

"He's sick. I think we're dying," says Elliott. Mary covers her mouth. Mike
tries to tell her that E.T. won't harm them, but she orders him to take
Gertie downstairs. Gertie cries that he's the man from the moon as Mike
picks her up and carries her downstairs.

[Elliott, clothed only in white long-john underwear, is visually almost
identical to the ghastly white-colored E.T.]

Mary picks up Elliott and carries him out of the room as E.T. groans and
reaches out for them.

[Mary's objective is to save her family from the alien in her home.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: DAY

Mary carries Elliott down the stairs. He protests that she can't leave E.T.
alone. Michael runs down the stairs with Gertie on his back. He opens the
door, freezes, then backs away. Mary, with Elliott in her arms, approaches
the door and is confronted by a man in a spacesuit.

Mary backs into the living room as the spaceman enters and reaches out for
her. She goes in the opposite direction, only to run into another man in a
spacesuit. She runs into the kitchen, followed by Mike carrying Gertie. The
are blocked by still another spaceman with outstretched arms. Mary and her
children are backed into a corner. Another man in a spacesuit opens up the
window blinds from the outside. Mary shouts "THIS IS MY HOME."

EXT: STREET: DAY

Dawn. The sun rises as a line of men wearing helmets and uniforms march up
the street.

INT: BATHROOM: DAY

E.T., his skin discolored to a grey-white hue, lies on the floor as a man
in a space suit enters the room. "Home," says E.T.

[This is the end of act two. The antagonist and his forces have invaded the
home of the protagonist and taken them into possession. This terrifying
invasion of the privacy of their home generates more empathy for Mary and
her children.]

EXT: STREET: DAY

Men in helmets walk up a street as they push a large plastic tunnel. Police
cars slowly drive up the street, as faceless men march to a drumbeat.

[This is the beginning of the third act with the forces of the antagonist
in complete control.]

EXT: STREET: NIGHT

Men with welding torches work on a truck. The plastic tunnel leads up the
driveway to Elliott's house. The faces of the men are still not shown. They
are either wearing helmets or are silhouettes.

CLOSEUP

The man with keys jangling on his side is putting on a pair of light-blue
pants.

INTERCUT: STREET

Men are working outside. Large bright lights flood the area.

INTERCUT: "KEYS"

The man in the blue suit puts on a white pair of plastic gloves. Red and
black colors on his cuff are associated with his keys as ominous music
fills the soundtrack.

[This is the only instance in this film where the traditional colors of the
antagonist (red and black) are associated with the antagonist ("keys").
Putting on a light-blue outfit starts the transformation of the antagonist
into a character worthy of audience empathy, for blue-white is the
traditional production design colors signifying "innocence."]

The man in the light-blue suit gets up walks through the plastic tunnel
towards Elliott's house. He exits the tunnel and walks into the house which
has been completely enclosed by plastic.

Finally, the antagonist's face is shown. His head is covered by a blue hood
while a light under his face mask accentuates his white shirt.

Mary stands in the middle of the room with Gertie at her side. A doctor
asks her questions about E.T., but Mary is more concerned with Elliott's
state. A nurse cuts a lock from Gertie's hair (presumably for analysis),
while both Elliott and E.T. can be seen on a video monitor. This nurse
walks to Mike and cuts a piece of his hair while a doctor asks him
questions about E.T. A video monitor shows Elliott and E.T. "Elliott thinks
his thoughts," asks the doctor. "No, Elliott feels his feelings," answers
Michael.

[This is the first time in the film that the merging of Elliott and E.T.
has been explicitly stated. Yet, this condition has been revealed to the
audience non-verbally throughout the story. The verbalization seems
redundant and not necessary, but does make sense as an explanatory comment
to a character new to the story.]

INT: CHAMBER: DAY

A man stands in what appears to be a decontamination chamber.

INTERCUT: MEDICAL INSTRUMENTS

Hands push buttons on electronic equipment used to gather medical
information about Elliott and E.T. Graphs representing E.T. and Elliott run
in exact parallel.

[This is another representation of the fact that E.T. and Elliott have
merged and are to be considered as one being.]

INT: MEDICAL ROOM: DAY

Two people in white suits zip open a plastic covering and enter the room
where Elliot and E.T. are being examined.

[The color white traditionally signifying purity. A transition in the
audience's emotional alliances is being manipulated at this stage of the
story. Their hatred will be transferred from "keys" who will become much
more sympathetic to "death itself" which threatens the life of E.T. It
would be too much to ask of the adult audience to remain sympathetic to the
emotional pleadings of a child when space scientists are trying to save the
life of a sick alien.]

"You're scaring him," cries Elliott, as the doctors examine both Elliott
and E.T. as they lie on adjacent tables. E.T's head rests on a blue piece
of cloth.

"Leave him alone, leave him alone. I can take care of him," moans Elliott.

[Which, of course, he can't. But this is something that both he, and
probably most of the children in the audience, really believe.]

Elliott looks up into the face of "Keys," who says that he's been to the
forest. He wants to know what the machine does. Elliott says that it's a
communication machine, and asks if it's still working. He then states that
"He came to me. He came to me." "Keys" explains that he's been wishing for
this too, ever since he was ten years old. He doesn't want the alien to
die. He asks what more can they do that they are not already doing.

Elliott's image reflects in "Keys" face gear. Elliott tells him that E.T.
was calling his people because he needs to go home.

["Keys" is no longer the threat. He has been transformed into a friend who
also wants to help the alien. A new antagonist must now be created in order
to maintain conflict in the story. In this scene DEATH will serve that
function. For the rest of the film the forces of the United States
Government, who attempt to block E.T.'s escape, will function as the
antagonist.]

Another Doctor dressed in white enters the room and announces that E.T. has
DNA. Suddenly, a display screen shows a drop in E.T. and Elliott's graphs.
One doctor says there's a drop in the creature's blood temperature, while
another states that Elliott's condition is stabilizing: his blood pressure
is coming back up.

E.T. calls Elliott's name, and the medical personnel become aware that he
can talk. Elliott pleads with him to stay. E.T. repeats the words "stay,
stay," then slowly turns his head away.

Their graphs separate. One doctor announces that the boy is coming back,
but they are losing E.T.

INT: CLOSET: NIGHT

Michael enters the closet space where E.T. stayed. He looks at the objects,
including the cartoon page from the newspaper, then huddles down among
E.T.'s possessions.

[These actions create more empathy for Michael who suffers at the thought
of losing E.T.]

The is a time transition, for Michael is asleep in E.T.'s space when the
morning sun shines on his face. Michael wakes up, then watches the plant
(which represents E.T.'s life force) wilt. He screams.

INT: MEDICAL ROOM: DAY

"E.T., don't go" screams Elliott.

Doctors state that he has no blood pressure and there is no pulse or
respiration. A bell rings, which signifies a life and death situation.
Doctors run into the room and tear down the plastic coverings surrounding
E.T.

"Leave him alone. You're killing him," says Elliott. They wheel Elliott out
of the room as he continues to scream. The medical staff frantically tries
to revive E.T. They try electrical shocks, but that fails. Gertie holds her
doll as she watches. She reacts by jumping when the electrical shocks are
applied to E.T.

[Showing one character's reactions to a situation help to create the
intended reaction in the audience.]

The doctors are losing him. Elliott watches and cries. Mary goes to him and
they hug each other. Gertie cries as she holds her doll. Mike walks into
the room, as "Keys" watches, then turns away.

[This provides the audience with each character's reaction to the death of
E.T. This is a surprising event for the audience: the protagonist has died.
Emotionally, it was designed to sadden the audience so that they will
become overjoyed when he is brought back to life.]

EXT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: DAY

A white van awaits at the bottom of the driveway.

[Previously, the vans and cars associated with the antagonist were of dark
colors. The color changes allows the filmmaker to use culturally determined
color associations to manipulate the audience's emotional responses.]

Police and other officials walk past a white van, white truck, police cars
and other white vehicles towards a tan colored car. Mike's friends sit on
their bikes behind police barriers. They make comments that something has
just happened inside the house.

[This establishes the existence of Mike's friends who will play a crucial
role in the last chase scene.]

INT: MEDICAL ROOM: DAY

The medical staff gives up on E.T. and decide to pack him in ice. Mike
watches as the staff of E.T. slowly walks away. "Keys" removes his headgear
and walks to Elliott who is standing vigil over E.T.'s body. "Keys" then
approaches E.T. Mike watches and cries as a man behind him removes his
headgear. The faces of several medical attendants are shown.

[This humanizes the forces of the antagonist and makes them much less
threatening. That's why they had to be faceless for so long throughout the
story.]

"Keys" kneels besides E.T. and with gloved hand closes his eyes. Mary holds
Gertie. When Gerite asks if he's dead, Mary replies that she thinks so.
Gertie then says she wishes him back.

[The interchange between Gertie and Mary reminds the audience of the Tinker
Bell situation when Mary read to her from Peter Pan. Those same feelings
are reintroduced here: the clapping of hands to save the fairy and then the
desire to rescue the children. This is the payoff to the emotional
reactions set up in that earlier scene.]

"Keys" looks up to see two attendants roll in a metal casing filled with
ice into which they will place E.T.'s body.

Mary picks up Gertie and carries her out of the room. Medical technicians
prepare the casing as Elliott watches. Keys approaches Elliot and tells him
that they will be taking E.T. away. "They are just going to cut him all
up," replies Elliott.

[This is the payoff to the frog sequence. The audience believes that
Elliott is correct, given the scientific mind as demonstrated by the
teacher. They also now remember the joy they felt when Elliott freed the
frogs, and wish they could experience that again now.]

"Do you want to spend some time alone with him?" asks "Keys," as he puts
his arm around Elliott and walks him to the casing. He tells the medical
attendants to leave the room.

[This generates empathy for "Keys" who is shown to be concerned for
Elliott's feelings.]

The attendants walk out of the room past Michael who is watching Elliott.
"Keys" leaves Elliott alone with the body of E.T., which is covered in a
plastic bag as it lies on dry ice. Elliott stares down at E.T.

"Look at what they've done to you. I'm so sorry. You must be dead. I... I
didn't know how to feel. I can't feel anything anymore. You've gone
someplace else now. E.T., I love you."

[Elliott wears a partially open white-jacket. He is framed within an oval
shaped glass.]

Elliott places the cover down over E.T. and walks away from the oval glass.
A red-light flashes from inside the casing, but Elliott doesn't notice this
as he walks away. He passes the pot of wilted flowers. The flowers slowly
start to regain strength. Elliott notices this, then quickly returns the
casing.

[This is the payoff for the pot-of-wilted-flowers prop.]

He opens the casing, sees the red-light flashing from E.T.'s heart, then
zips open the plastic bag. The alien looks up and says "E.T. phone home."
Elliott screams with joy.
"Home, home, home, home," says E.T.
"Does this mean they are coming?" asks Elliott.
"Yes," answers E.T.

[E.T. has finally succeeded in his objective of communicating home.]

Elliott tells him to stay and shut up, as he places his hand over E.T.'s
mouth. Elliott zips him back up, then places a cloth over his flashing
red-heart, as "KEYS" re-enters the room. Elliott slams down the cover.
"KEYS" pulls Elliott away from the case as two attendants prepare for its
removal. Elliott cries out with feigned sorrow to conceal his glee when he
sees the wilted flowers regain their health. The attendants lock the case.

INT: DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER: DAY

Elliott tells Mike that E.T. is alive. Mike's also overjoyed. Mike and
Elliott rejoice as the wilted flowers continue to bloom.

INT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: DAY

Mary is talking to "KEYS" as Gertie runs up with the pot of flowers in her
hands. He asks Mary if the boys have gone because she's sup- posed to give
her a note when they have gone. Mary takes the note from Gertie and reads
it.

[This note provides the crisis to which Mary must react, yet the audience
is kept in suspense.]

EXT: PLASTIC TUNNEL: DAY

Elliott runs down the tunnel past two men dressed in blue, then enters the
back of the van. Elliott then pulls aside the white curtains that separate
the drivers compartment from the back of the van to reveal Michael in the
driver's seat. He to is wearing a blue jacket. Elliott yells at Mike for
not wearing his mask. Suddenly, a black official walks by the van, spots
Mike in the driver's seat, and knocks on the window. He holds a
walkie-talkie in his hand as he asks Mike who he is. Mike responds that
he's driving. The official tells Mike to open the door. When Mike looks to
Elliott for advice, Elliott tells him to drive away.

[Elliott and Mike's objective is to escape with E.T.]

A group of men approach the van. Mike screams that he's never driven
forward before, shifts into first gear, and drives away.

[This is the payoff to the scene of Mike incompetently backing the car down
the driveway.]

As Mike drives away he drags along the plastic tunnel with the two men
still inside. Mike briefly stops by his friends and tells them to meet him
at the playground at the top of he hill. He then drives away, pursued by a
group of men. Mike's friends put on their hats and sun- glasses, and join
the fray.

[The chase is on. Suspense is created because the audience wonders whether
they will get E.T. back to the forest before the are stopped. They face
impossible odds, yet Mike's friends display loyalty as they join the fight.
Mike and Elliott's first objective is to reach the park. Their major
obstacle is the men trying to capture them.]

Mike drives the van down the street. The two men still in the plastic
tunnel try to climb back towards the van. Elliott starts to disconnect the
tunnel by pulling out metal braces.

[Jeopardy: If these men get into the van, they will overpower Elliott and
Mike, and prevent E.T. from getting home.]

EXT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: DAY

Mary backs her car out of the garage. Gertie is sitting next to her in the
front seat holding onto the flower pot. "Keys" runs up to Mary and asks
where she's going. Gertie blunts out "to the spaceship."

["Keys" now realizes that the aliens are returning for E.T. This is his
"crisis" information, that spurns him into action.]

EXT: STREET: DAY

The van continues down the road, still pulling the plastic tunnel behind
it. The two men have almost made it to the back of the van as Elliott pulls
out the final stake. He tosses it to one of the men. When Mike turns a
sharp corner the plastic tunnel disconnects, leaving the two men behind.

[They have overcome their immediate obstacle. Humor is generated when
Elliott tosses the nail to one of the men, because it is the reversal of a
life saving situation. Instead of catching something (like a rope) that
will save him, he catches the object that is his undoing.]

EXT: STREET: DAY

A convoy of police cars drive up a street.

[The chase is still on. Even though one obstacle has been overcome, the
antagonist brings more formidable forces into the fight. The protagonist is
still in jeopardy.]

EXT: PARK: DAY

The white van drives up over the sidewalk and into the park. It swerves
between the children's rides, then finally stops. Smoke pours out of the
van, whose back two doors are still open.

[They have reached their sub-objective: the park where they are to meet up
with Mike's friends and continue on their bikes.]

Mike's friends wait on their bikes. Between them they also have bikes for
Elliott and Mike. E.T. is revealed to the boys. He stands among the smoke
from the dry-ice with his red-heart light flashing. "Okay, he's a man from
outer space and we're taking him to his spaceship," says Elliott, now
dressed in blue pants, white shirt, and red jacket.
"Why can't he just beam up?" asks Greg.
"This is reality, Greg," says Elliott.

[Of course, the joke is that it isn't reality. It is a fantasy movie with a
realistic response to a fantastic situation. Right?]

[Elliott finally wins the respect and admiration of Mike's friends,
something he's desired from his introduction scene when they wouldn't allow
him to play DUNGEONS & DRAGONS with them.]

EXT: PARK: DAY

Mary, along with a crowd of plain clothes police, run towards the van.
"Don't shoot, they're only children," screams Mary.

[This introduces a life and death jeopardy into the scene. It also
characterizes the forces of the antagonist as characters who would shoot
children.]

They reach the back of the van only to find it empty.

EXT: STREET: DAY

Elliott and friends ride down the street. E.T., covered with a white
blanket, rides in Elliott's basket. Elliott, with the red hood over his
head, shouts that they are to ride to the forest.

[To cloth a character in red is effective in chase scenes. This helps the
audience to visually pick out the scenes important character when the pace
is fast and the action intense. Spielberg used this technique for Elliot in
this scene and for Marion in RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK when she runs through
the market chased by Arabs.]

Cars chase them. Elliott rides up the alley and tells the others to follow
him. Police cars encircle them and try to cut them off. The bikers turn off
the main road and ride into a dirt field. A tan car with "UNITED STATES
GOVERNMENT" written on the driver's door rides parallel to the bikers.

Two men ride inside the tan car. One speaks into the car radio saying that
they'll get them at the bottom of the hill. The tan car pulls into the base
of the hill and stops. One man gets out and starts to climb up the
embankment. The bikers almost run him over. They ride over the hood of the
car, then continue down the street, now pursued by a blue police car.

The bikers cycle down a dirt road of a section of the community that is
still under development. E.T., with the white blanket covering his head,
sits in the basket of Elliott's bike. A blue car trails them. The bikers
decide to split up. Two ride down an embankment. They are followed by
another police car. The bikers then escape from their pursuers by riding
down steep embankments. The cars cannot follow and must stop on different
levels. The bikers unite and ride away.

[It seems that the chase is over and they have eluded the antagonist.]

The biker's are overjoyed by their victory. One takes off his hat, waves it
in the air, and shouts "We've made it!" Suddenly, he quickly ducks to avoid
being grabbed by a man. A group of men continue the chase. Several cars
pull up ahead and form a blockade in the road.

Elliott and E.T. ride forward. Horror grows on Elliott's face as he stares
at the enemy in front of him.

[This final confrontation between the protagonist (Elliott and E.T.) and
the antagonist.]

The antagonist is explicitly revealed at this moment. On the side panel of
a car is a sign stating:

                           FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
                              U.S. GOVERNMENT
                           INTERAGENCY MOTOR POOL
                                    GSA

The shadow of a shotgun covers the sign. Next, two shotguns are raised
against E.T. and Elliott.

Elliott shuts his eyes with fear. There is a closeup of E.T.'s face. With
shotguns drawn, government agents gesture for them to stop.

[This is the life and death final moment before the climax. The audience
has been set up to expect that the government agents would shoot at the
protagonist by Mary's comments in the park scene.]

Suddenly, E.T. saves the day with his telekinetic powers. He lifts all of
the bikers up into the air as they fly above the blockade.

[The climax is over E.T. has saved himself and his friends]

E.T. then flies the bikers over the housetops, and across the setting sun.
Finally they float down onto a path in the forest.

EXT: FOREST: DAY

Elliott has reached the landing site. He brushes the leaves away from the
turntable of the communication device. A blue-light floods Elliott's face.
He looks up into the, along with the other bikers. E.T., with red-heart
happily flashing, also gazes into the sky as his spaceship descends.
"Home," says E.T.
The spaceship continues its descent as E.T.'s red-heart flutters. The
spaceship finally lands in a golden glowing light.

A car pulls into the forest, and Gertie's voice can be heard pointing out
the location of the boys. The ramp to the spaceship lowers. Gertie runs up
to Mike and E.T. She gives E.T. the plant and says that she just wanted to
say goodbye. Michael responds that E.T. doesn't know goodbye.
"Be good," says E.T.
"Yes," says Gertie, as she kisses him on the nose.
Mike places his hand on E.T.'s head.

[This is a basic gesture of trust. The fact that E.T. allows Mike to do
this indicates that he considers him a friend.]

E.T. puts the plant on the ground, as Mary and "Keys" run up to the edge of
the site. Mike picks up Gertie and carries her away as Elliott approaches
E.T.

"Come," says E.T
"Stay," says Elliott.

[The two characters that had merged into one protagonist must split apart
because they now have different primary objectives. E.T. want's to return
home, and Elliott wants him to remain.]

E.T. lifts his finger to his lips and says "ouch."

[Of course, this indicates the pain he feels in their separation.]

Elliott tearfully lifts his finger to his lips and says "ouch."

[The symmetry of his movements indicate that in some sense, they still are
one.]

E.T. and Elliott hug each other as the are visually surrounded by blue and
white lights. Then Elliott and Mary exchange glances as Mike and Gertie
stand by and watch. E.T. lifts his finger to Elliott's forehead. It lights
up, then he says: "I'll be right here."

[The resolution of the dilemma. Though E.T. leaves, he will still remain,
perhaps telepathically, or perhaps only within Elliott's thoughts.]

"Bye," says Elliott..

E.T. picks up the potted plant and carries it up the gangplank. Elliott
watches from below as Harvey starts up the plank, then returns to Elliott's
side.

[E.T. leaves with what he really came for, a sample of the earth's
vegetative life form. But now he has much more in the flowers that will
serve as a memorial of all that he has experienced with his new friends.]

The gangplank lifts up and separates E.T. from Elliott. The ships circular
entrance closes. The spaceship lifts off. Elliott watches it float up into
the sky. It then speeds away, leaving an orange-blue rainbow behind against
the blue-morning sky.

[Orange and blue were also the colors of E.T.'s makeshift communication
device as found by Mike in the forest.]

Mary watches and laughs with happiness. The other boys also watch, as Mike
holds Gertie in his arms. The film ends with a shot of Elliott gazing up
into the sky.

               Suddenly we are hit by the loudest, booming, rolling concussion

               A TORCH-LIT LANDSCAPE - NIGHT
               
               The ruins of L.A. Rubble, smoke, a lethal wasteland. An army of

               An unrecognizable L.A. After the big one. Surrounded by water,

               A red line tracks along the mountainous areas surrounding the

               A Salesman with a chin-mike speaks non-stop, unintelligible
               Chinese. A frenzied crowd gathers around him, waving money,
               placing bets.
               
               Two men sit at either end of a long table. They are in deep
               shadows, facing each other. We only get glimpses of them: One fat.
               Mirrored sunglasses. Chinese. His fingers tap on the table. A
               cockroach scurries past. Ammo belts. A sheathed combat knife the
               size of your arm. .45 automatics in holsters.
               
               The other, dressed in black. An eye-patch. Dangerous. A flash of
               two six-guns in holsters. A futuristic gunfighter. The cockroach
               dashes past his fingers. WHAP! He squashes it.
               
               The crowd goes nuts, placing bets, yelling and screaming in a
               dozen languages.
               
               The salesman places three different shaped, clear shot glasses in
               front of the two men. Then he leans over to...
               
               A VAT OF POISONOUS SNAKES. He reaches in, grabs a cobra, pulls it
               out. The cobra hisses and squirms. Deftly, the salesman continues
               to talk non-stop into his chin-mike as he milks the cobra venom
               into the first glass.
               
               He pulls out an ice-pick, jabs it into the snake's throat, and
               bleeds a thick green-white liquid into the second glass. Finally,
               he slits open the cobra with a large knife, and cuts out the heart
               and liver. Tossing aside the dead snake, the salesman squeezes the
               heart and liver with his fingers. The juice drips into the third
               glass.
               
               Now the salesman stirs the glasses. The poison is clear. The blood
               is milky-green. The heart and liver are red. He places the glasses
               on the table between the two men.
               
               The two men stare at each other, motionless. The crowd continues
               placing bets at a fevered pitch. A titanium white tube floats
               above the center of the table. A laser beam of light shines from
               one end.
               
               The salesman leans over and flicks on side with his finger,
               sending the tube spinning on its axis like a bottle, the light
               circling the room before stopping on the fat man's forehead.
               
               The fat man reaches slowly toward the glasses. His hand shakes
               slightly. He hesitates. Finally he takes the glass with the red
               liquid (the heart and liver), lifts it to his lips, pauses, then
               gulps it down.
               
               The crowd explodes. More bets.
               
               The salesman leans over and spins the light tube again, this time
               it lands on something black, an eye-patch. Pull back to reveal a
               man with an eye-patch.
               
               The man with the eye-patch reaches forward, his hand paused
               between the remaining two glasses. He takes the one filled with
               milky-green blood and downs it fast. The crowd roars.
               
               One glass left. The two men stare at it intently.
               
               The salesman spins the light tube with more force than before. It
               circles again and again, slowing down, speeding up, finally
               stopping on the fat man.
               
               The salesman begins yelling over the din of the crowd, shouting at
               the fat man. The fat man reaches for the glass of clear poison.
               His trembling fingers hover above it. Then he quickly withdraws
               his hand.
               
               The crowd reacts, boos, as...
               
               The man with the eye-patch smiles. A slightly, cynical smile. And
               without hesitation, he reaches out, grabs the glass of poison, and
               drinks it down. The crowd surges forward, but the salesman stops
               them with a sweep of his arm. All bets are off.
               
               The two men stand from the table. Take several steps away toward
               the end of the alley. Stand facing each other. Two gunfighters.
               
               Flashes of the two men. A piece of a black military boot. A hand
               positioned over a six-shooter. Mirrored sunglasses. A sweaty,
               trembling lip. And the eye-patched man's one good eye, blue and
               clear, staring - hard and calm as a sunny day...
               
               The draw. It happens in an instant. The alley thunders with
               gunfire. The guns buck and flash. Then silence. The two men stand
               there for a beat, until one of them, the fat man, slumps, falls
               face first into the alley, dead.
               
               The crowd goes completely ape shit as SNAKE PLISSKEN emerges from
               the shadows of the alley, holsters his guns, grabs his take of the
               money...
               
               SNAKE PLISSKEN. Long hair. A black eye-patch. A tight-lipped
               grimace. The impression of coiled aggression and intense cynicism.
               The toughest, most dangerous man on planet earth. A legend.
               
               PLISSKEN strolls out of the alley into the crowd. He counts his
               money, pockets it, as a cigarette girl approaches him. PLISSKEN
               stops her, pays for a pack of cigs. As she eyes him...
               
               CLOSEUP OF PLISSKEN'S ARM
               
               ... the cigarette girl touches him, pricks his skin with her
               fingernail. A drop of blood appears.
               
               PLISSKEN turns, stares after her, as the sound of helicopters
               rises from above in the night sky. The crowd suddenly starts to
               disperse.
               
               Helicopter searchlights blast down on the street. PLISSKEN is
               suddenly caught in the glare. He starts to move away...
               
               KACLANG!
               
               Out of the blackness above a huge steel net drops out of nowhere.
               The net slams down on top of PLISSKEN, trapping him, driving him
               down to the pavement with its weight... PLISSKEN struggles inside
               the net as black figures - United States Police Force Officers -
               rush toward him, grab the net, tightening it. More cops move for
               him as we SLOWLY FADE TO BLACK...

               Camera reaches the top of the wall. Armed police troops stand on
               the battlements. Across what looks like an ocean is L.A. The view

               Hidden by the Santa Monica Mountains, L.A. glows in the distance

               Water stretches into blackness. This was once the San Fernando
               Valley, but now it's all underwater. Pieces of debris - tops of
               buildings, the tail of an airplane, a radio tower - stick up above

               Firebase Seven is a fortified base camp in the San Gabriel
               Mountains. It is a sprawling police complex with low concrete
               bunkers, gun emplacements, satellite communications, vehicles,
               troops, the works. ON A LARGE ASPHALT FIELD, opposite the main

               totally evil police battle helicopters parked like giant bugs on
               the ground.
               
               A throng of policemen gather at the edge of Rotor City yelling and
               cheering, their fists in the air. Cops with camcorders videotape

               A mammoth room filled with high-tech instrumentation. A glowing

               all showing the Police Channel: a view of the helicopter transport
               sitting on the asphalt and the cheering crowds at the edge of

               Hold one! The door is opening!
               
               The door of the helicopter transport slowly lowers like a
               drawbridge. Out of its black belly comes...
               
               SNAKE PLISSKEN. A steel collar is clamped around his neck. Eight
               lengths of chain stretch to eight armed guards who escort Plissken
               down the ramp. Plissken is bruised, badly beaten and tortured, his
               face a mess, but he doesn't seem to care. A line of battle-ready
               cops stand with their guns aimed right at Plissken's head as he is
               marched into camp. An army of camcorders move ahead of the Police
               Anchor as he scampers along in front of PLISSKEN, interviewing
               him.

               A SIGN ABOVE A CONCRETE BUNKER - DEPORTATION CENTER
               
               The bunker has one large opening, into which hundreds of deportees
               march. Guards in towers monitor the condemned as they trudge out
               of fenced-in containment areas, down walled corridors to the
               bunker entrance.
               
               The deportees are minorities, the poor, prostitutes, pimps,
               thieves, adulterers, atheists - the Morally Guilty, outcasts of
               society. Single mothers carry babies. Teenage runaways huddle
               together. There are abortion doctors, drug dealers, pornographers,
               the prisoners of a massive cultural war.
               
               As Plissken is marched toward the entrance, a loudspeaker blares
               out:
               
               POLICE VOICE (V.O.)

               President.
               
               Plissken's face remains so impassive as to be almost blank.
               

               INT. SODIUM VAPOR CORRIDOR - DEPORTATION CENTER - NIGHT
               
               A glowing, vaporous-orange corridor. More cops gather to watch
               Plissken as he is escorted into the bowels of the Deportation
               Center.
               
               POLICE ANCHOR
               You've been convicted of 27 moral crimes,
               Plissken. The murder of an Internal
               Revenue agent. The kidnapping of a bank
               president. Gun fighting for profit. The
               list goes on and on...
               

               INT. CONCRETE HALLWAY - DEPORTATION CENTER - NIGHT
               
               Deeper into the Deportation Center. Camera tracks along the
               deportees, some bleeding, some wrapped in rags. Plissken, the
               Police Anchor, camcorders and the armed escort move through the
               dark, low concrete passageway.
               
               POLICE ANCHOR
               You used to respect the law. Served your
               country like no man before you. Role model
               to a generation.
               
               The Police Anchor leans in as close as he dares to Plissken's
               face.
               
               POLICE ANCHOR
               What happened to you, war hero? You were
               the best we had.
               
               STEEL-WALLED HALLWAY - DEPORTATION CENTER - NIGHT
               
               Steel walls. Deeper into the Deportation Center. The deportees
               here are in worse shape. Some appear to be dead. Plissken and his
               entourage continue along, as the speaker echoes a pre-recorded
               message...
               
               POLICE VOICE (V.O.)
               You are sentenced to permanent expulsion
               beyond the borders of the U.S. You now
               have the option to repent of your sins and
               be electrocuted on the premises. If you
               elect this option, notify the Cleric
               Sergeant in your Processing Area.
               
               Plissken and his entourage pass deportees kneeling and praying in
               front of cloaked cleric cops, government holy men. Beyond, through
               opened doorways, see Death Row deportees being strapped into
               futuristic electric chairs.
               
               POLICE ANCHOR
               The whole world's watching. Every good and
               decent person who works and hard and
               follows the rules. What would say to them?
               
               Plissken's expression is blank.
               
               POLICE ANCHOR
               What would you say to all of us who
               believed in you, who looked up to you, who
               thought you stood for right over wrong,
               good over evil? Be my guest. What do you
               have to say, Plissken?
               
               PLISSKEN
               (beat)
               Call me Snake.
               
               The guards move Plissken through a doorway, and the huge steel
               doors slam shut on the Police Anchor and the camcorders.
               

               INT. CORRIDOR - PROCESSING AREA - NIGHT
               
               Malloy, Brazen, and a 3rd man, tall, charismatic, grim, move
               urgently along a corridor.
               
               BRAZEN
               ComStat did a psychosearch on him. Used a
               database of 5 million sociopathic
               personalities. He hit the bottom of the
               curve.
               
               MALLOY
               Perfect for the mission. Nobody else can
               pull it off - not an army, not a man.
               
               BRAZEN
               Zero emotional developments. Total lack of
               compassion. A highly developed
               psychopathic instinct to survive.
               
               3RD MAN
               Let's get this over with.
               

               INT. CONCRETE CELL - NIGHT
               
               The cell door slams shut. Plissken turns around. Writ and leg
               irons. He looks around.
               
               In the concrete cell he sees a simple table with an overhead light
               above it. A watch lies on the table. Plissken shuffles over, picks
               up the watch, examines it.
               
               The cell door opens. Malloy, Brazen, and the 3rd Man enter the
               room unarmed. The door closes.
               
               Malloy and Brazen move forward, to the edge of the light. The 3rd
               Man stays back in the shadows by the door.
               
               MALLOY
               How you doin' Plissken?
               (no reply)
               You like the watch?
               
               PLISSKEN
               You assholes didn't bring me here to give
               me this for 20 years of dedicated service.
               What'ya want?
               
               Malloy looks back to the 3rd Man in the shadows...
               
               3RD MAN
               Get to it.
               
               Malloy raises a control unit, pushes the button. The lights go
               down and a computer-enhanced image appears on the wall...
               
               

               INT. PROTOTYPE DEFENSE LAB - SURVEILLANCE CAMERA
               
               From the point of view of a surveillance camera. The lab is huge.
               Banks of processors, disk drives, test bays, prototype assembly
               areas. High tech. A group of government officials is being given a
               tour. Utopia, 17, the President's daughter is among them. Pretty,
               virginal, she wears a "True Love Waits" button on her flowered
               dress.
               
               MALLOY
               At 1030 hours Wednesday, a group of
               government officials began a tour of the
               Livermore Defense Lab. The President's
               daughter, Utopia, was among them.
               
               Plissken continues to watch the image on the wall...
               
               MALLOY
               An hour later, she boarded Air Force 3 to
               Washington.
               
               The 3rd Man reacts as the image in front of Plissken changes...
               

               INT. MAIN CABIN OF 747 - CAMCORDER
               
               From the point of view of a camcorder. Utopia stands inside the
               main cabin of a plush, government 747. In one hand she holds a
               black anodized box the size of a transistor radio with a button on
               top. In the other, a machine gun.
               
               UTOPIA
               (to the camcorder)
               To the American people - it is time to
               rise up and demand the surrender of the
               President and his corrupt theocracy of
               lies and terror.
               
               MALLOY
               At 1140 hours, she hijacked the plane. We
               scanned the videotape on VR. Check it out.
               
               Inside the surveillance room the President stares grimly as Malloy
               presses a button. Suddenly the image in front of Plissken spreads
               out all around him. He is in a virtual reality re-creation.
               

               INT. MAIN CABIN OF 747 - VIRTUAL REALITY
               
               Plissken stands manacled in the main cabin. A group of secret
               service men and congressmen watch as a flight attendance operates
               a camcorder. He's videotaping Utopia as she rants into the camera.
               She's pent up with such anxiety she's like a panther in a cage.
               
               UTOPIA
               Today is Day One of a brand new world. The
               days of the empire are finished.
               (beat)
               To the President - my father, you know
               what this is.
               
               She holds up the anodized box with the red button and thrusts it
               at the camcorder.
               
               UTOPIA
               You know what it will do. Unless you
               abdicate your throne by tomorrow night, I
               will use it - on you.
               
               CONGRESSMAN
               Utopia, please. Give us the prototype. If
               something should happen -
               
               UTOPIA
               It will be in my hands - and the hands of
               my lover.
               
               She says "lover" with all the drama a 17-year-old virgin can
               muster. The others are shocked.
               
               UTOPIA
               Yes, my lover. My man. The only real man
               I've ever known. I'm on my way to his
               arms.
               
               She moves to the rear of the main cabin, bends down, opens a small
               hatch in the floor, scrambles down...
               
               WHAM! The VR image suddenly disappears and Plissken is again
               standing inside the concrete cell. Malloy and Brazen stand in
               front of him.
               
               MALLOY
               Somehow during the tour, she came into
               possession of a prototype transmitting
               device. We don't know how.
               
               BRAZEN
               Utopia became depressed after her mother's
               suicide, began to withdraw into her
               virtual reality simulator. She'd punch up
               her own little world in cyberspace and
               stay in it for days at a time.
               (hits a button)
               Somebody else was in there with her.
               
               AN IMAGE APPEARS
               
               In front of Plissken: A computer-rendered VR picture of clouds and
               sunshine, green grass and happy animals frolicking. A Garden of
               Eden. There, coming toward us, is CUERVO JONES. South American
               terrorist. Fiercest warrior of the Third World. He wears a
               gleaming ancient Aztec battle helmet. Bandoliers strapped around
               him.
               
               MALLOY
               Cuervo Jones. Shining Path. Peruvian
               terrorist. Runs the biggest baddest gang
               in L.A.
               
               Cuervo Jones takes off the helmet He is blindingly handsome,
               charismatic. He smiles, reaches out his arms to camera as if to
               embrace it. The image suddenly pops back to the beginning - it's
               on a loop. The image disappears.
               
               The lights in the cell come up.
               
               BRAZEN
               Utopia made tapes of her VR experiences,
               then tried to erase them. She missed this
               fragment on the end of her last tape.
               Cuervo Jones must have tapped into the VR
               master data bank - and then went prowling
               around for innocent blood, someone
               vulnerable to corrupt. Utopia was lonely,
               looking for something to believe in.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Sad story. You got a cigarette?
               
               MALLOY
               Shut up, Plissken.
               
               PLISSKEN
               What's the little black box do?
               
               MALLOY
               Top secret. Only on a need to know.
               
               PLISSKEN
               And I don't need to know. So fuck you, I'm
               goin' to Hollywood.
               
               MALLOY
               That's right, big shot. Unless you do what
               we want you're not coming back.
               
               PLISSKEN
               So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A.,
               find the President's daughter, secure the
               box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm
               free?
               
               MALLOY
               That's the deal.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Tell the President to adopt. I think I'll
               like L.A.
               
               After a couple of beats, the 3rd Man appears next to Malloy and
               Brazen. He stares at Plissken for a moment, holds up some papers.
               
               3RD MAN
               If you bring out the prototype, you'll
               receive a full pardon for every immoral
               act you have ever committed in the United
               States. Just like in '97. Remember New
               York, Plissken?
               
               PLISSKEN
               (looks at him)
               Who are you?
               
               MALLOY
               It's the President, for Christ's sake!
               
               PRESIDENT
               I give you my word. Put the prototype into
               my hands, and you're a free man.
               
               PLISSKEN
               I can see you're real concerned about your
               daughter.
               
               PRESIDENT
               Utopia is lost to me. My daughter is gone.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Well, I'll think it over.
               
               PRESIDENT
               You're running out of time.
               
               PLISSKEN
               I've been doin' that all my life. Might as
               well do it in L.A. Everybody else there
               is.
               
               MALLOY
               Well, enjoy it, war hero, cause you got 10
               hours to live.
               
               Malloy, Brazen, and the President turn to leave...
               
               PLISSKEN
               Wait a minute, what are you talkin' about?
               
               MALLOY
               Having second thoughts?
               
               PLISSKEN
               Maybe. But you're not putting any shit in
               me this time.
               
               MALLOY
               You don't understand. It's already in you.
               
               PLISSKEN'S FACE
               
               As an image of the cigarette girl in New Las Vegas flashes
               suddenly. Her fingernail scratches his arm. He tightens.
               
               MALLOY
               The cigarette girl in New Vegas was an
               undercover cop. She injected you with
               incentive toxin. Right now it's swimming
               in your bloodstream. It'll start to take
               effect in 9 hours.
               
               BRAZEN
               It's a strain of the Plutoxin 7 virus.
               Genetically engineered. 100% pure death.
               Complete nervous system shutdown. You
               crash and bleed out like a stuck pig. Not
               a pretty sight.
               
               Plissken takes a step toward him. Malloy holds up a large
               hypodermic.
               
               MALLOY
               Of course there's an anti-toxin.
               Neutralizes the virus immediately upon
               injection.
               (beat)
               We'll give it to you, but you have to do
               us this little favor.
               
               TWO BEATS...
               
               ...and then Plissken attacks the President, hurls himself across
               the room, throwing the chain around the President's neck...
               
               Plissken passes right through the President, causing his image to
               waver slightly, then falls on his ass.
               
               PRESIDENT
               Didn't think we were that stupid, did you?
               

               INT. SURVEILLANCE ROOM
               
               The real Malloy, Brazen, and President stand in front of a laser
               camera in a small room offering a view of the cell through a
               transparent portion of the wall.
               
               MALLOY
               We're holographs.
               
               INSIDE THE CELL
               
               Plissken stares at the three images in front of him, then at the
               camera lens on the wall...
               
               PLISSKEN
               Get this crap out of me.
               
               MALLOY
               I guess we have a deal. Nice to be working
               with you, Plissken.
               
               PLISSKEN
               (beat)
               Call me Snake.
               

               INT. BRIEFING ROOM - COMMAND HQ - NIGHT
               
               Plissken checks through various tactical survival items and
               weapons laid out on a table. Brazen watches as Malloy show shim a
               high tech submachine gun.
               
               BRAZEN
               Very sweet little weapon. Core burner.
               Magnesium ammo. 500 extra rounds.
               (moves on)
               Two 9mm handguns.
               (holds up a silver pill)
               Oral projectile. Mouth dart. Hold it in
               your mouth for ten seconds, the coating
               dissolves, it becomes a weapon.
               
               Malloy breaks open the silver pill. Inside is s small, lethal
               looking dart.
               
               BRAZEN
               Urolite. It'll stun the enemy for several
               seconds.
               
               Plissken picks up a small, computerized compass.
               
               MALLOY
               Tracer. Utopia has a kidnap chip implanted
               in her arm. You can locate her with this.
               
               Brazen hands Plissken a large black clip.
               
               BRAZEN
               This clips right onto your 9mm. Ammo
               enhancers. Like miniaturized grenades.
               Blows through anything.
               
               Plissken snaps the clip onto his pistol, then unsnaps it.
               

               EXT. POLICE COMPLEX - NIGHT
               
               Plissken suits up. Submachine gun, handguns, six-guns. He, Brazen
               and Malloy walk quickly across the complex.
               
               MALLOY
               L.A. is in a constant state of warfare.
               Gangs fighting for the right to rule.
               
               BRAZEN
               Heavy Third World connections. They get
               weapons, drugs, fuel, choppers -
               everything is pumped into the island from
               the south.
               
               MALLOY
               Some areas have power - they're on line to
               San Onofre.
               

               EXT. ROTOR CITY - NIGHT
               
               As Brazen's command helicopter takes off...
               

               INT. COMMAND HELICOPTER - NIGHT
               
               Plissken stares at a photo of the anodized prototype.
               
               PLISSKEN
               I'll need to know more about this thing.
               
               MALLOY
               Only a handful of people are aware of its
               existence. Let's just say it's the
               ultimate defensive weapon.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Defense against what?
               
               MALLOY
               There's a war about to be declared, or
               didn't you know?
               
               Plissken shrugs.
               
               MALLOY
               Third World wants to live like we do - and
               they plan on taking what they want. The
               Cubans and Brazilians are ready to invade
               Miami. If the Africans and Colombians make
               a run at the border, we got a full scale
               attack on the United States.
               
               PLISSKEN
               So what does this thing do?
               
               MALLOY
               All you need to know is get it back here
               by 5 a.m.
               

               EXT. WALL - ACCESS TUNNEL - NIGHT
               
               The Command helicopter lands near a large access tunnel inside the
               containment wall.
               

               INT. ACCESS TUNNEL - NIGHT
               
               Plissken, Brazen and Malloy walk through the dark, dank tunnel.
               Armed guards stand at the ready. A hatch in the tunnel floor
               stands open. A ladder disappears down into the darkness.
               
               MALLOY
               (points to the open hatch)
               You're going over by submarine. One-man
               submersible. Nuclear powered.
               
               Plissken arranges his gear, climbs into the hatch opening.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Where do I put ashore?
               
               MALLOY
               Cahuenga Pass. Make your way up through
               the mountains toward the Hollywood Bowl.
               You should be able to pick up Utopia's
               tracer there.
               (beat)
               Once you go inside, you're on your own.
               (beat)
               You know what you have to do with the
               girl, don't you?
               (beat)
               We have to spare this nation her trial -
               for treason.
               
               PLISSKEN
               So you want me to take her out?
               (Malloy nods)
               Is that an order from the President?
               
               MALLOY
               Let's just say it's what's best for the
               country.
               
               PLISSKEN
               By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
               
               MALLOY
               A medical team will be standing by.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Not you?
               
               MALLOY
               No.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Good.
               
               KABLAMM! He fires, ripping hellish blasts at Malloy. There's no
               damage. Malloy laughs.
               
               MALLOY
               Thought you might try that. First clip is
               filled with blanks. Goodbye, Plissken.
               
               Malloy kicks the hatch and it slams down on top of Plissken.
               Brazen pushes a control button, sealing it shut.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE BAY - NIGHT
               
               Plissken climbs down the ladder into a small submarine bay. Below
               him on a launching rig is a sleek, black one-man submarine shaped
               like a dart. The submarine's hatch is open. Plissken climbs
               inside.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE - NIGHT
               
               Plissken seals the hatch behind him. He has to lie flat on his
               stomach to operate the sub. He quickly hits various switches and
               buttons, powering up the cockpit.
               

               INT. COMMAND HQ - MAIN CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
               
               Malloy and Brazen move to a surveillance-command post.
               
               PLISSKEN (V.O. RADIO)
               Com check.
               
               Malloy picks up the microphone.
               
               MALLOY
               I'm here, Plissken.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE - NIGHT
               
               Plissken looks at the wrist watch. It ticks down ominously. Eight
               hours and counting down...
               
               MALLOY (V.O.)
               Stand by for launch. Ignitor.
               (Plissken pushes a button)
               Fuel rod injection.
               
               Plissken pulls a lever, watches his dials. A deep humming sound
               grows louder inside the sub.
               
               PLISSKEN
               She's in the green.
               
               MALLOY (V.O.)
               Lock fuel rods.
               
               PLISSKEN

               Locked.

               Plissken turns a throttle-like control with his left hand.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE BAY - NIGHT
               
               Out of the rear tubes of Plissken's sub comes a roaring blue glow.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE
               
               PLISSKEN

               MALLOY (V.O.)
               Hands on switches and counting.
               5...4...3...2...1. Launch.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE BAY
               
               The rear tubes roar. Suddenly the sub is shot forward through a
               long, circular tunnel.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE
               
               Plissken braces himself as the cabin lurches, vibrates with the
               force.
               

               EXT. THE WALL - NEWHALL PASS - NIGHT
               
               A door in the wall opens, revealing the circulator tunnel. In a
               roaring explosion, the sub rockets out of the tunnel, shot from
               the wall like a cannonball. The submarine is airborne for several
               seconds, then drops down, and slams into the San Fernando Sea.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE
               
               Plissken is rocked with the impact. He guides the sub with hand
               controls. In front of him on a screen is a schematic diagram of
               the underwater landscape of the San Fernando Valley.
               

               EXT. UNDERWATER - 405 FREEWAY - NIGHT
               
               In the underwater darkness, see the broken remains of the 405
               Freeway, as the subs creams past, its nuclear wake churning in the
               water.
               

               INT. COMMAND HQ - MAIN CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
               
               Malloy, Brazen and other cops follow Plissken's course on a
               gigantic computer screen.
               
               MALLOY
               Plissken, watch your speed. Lots of
               obstructions down there.
               

               EXT. UNDERWATER - VAN NUYS CITY HALL - NIGHT
               
               As the sub rockets past the ruins of the Van Nuys City Hall,
               barely missing it.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE
               
               MALLOY (V.O.)
               Plissken...
               
               Plissken ignores him, carefully maneuvering the sub with his
               controls.
               
               MALLOY (V.O.)
               Plissken... do you copy?
               

               EXT. UNDERWATER - THE VENTURA FREEWAY - NIGHT
               
               Camera follows the sub as it streaks along just above the
               submerged ruins of the Ventura Freeway. See the ghostly shapes of
               cars, trucks, busses below, smashed and overturned.
               

               INT. COMMAND HQ - MAIN CONTROL ROOM
               
               They watch the sub, a red blip on the screen, move along the
               freeway.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE
               
               Plissken twists his hand throttle, pouring on the power to 90%.
               

               EXT. VENTURA & HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY INTERCHANGE - UNDERWATER - NIGHT
               
               The sub rips through the water, faster and faster, goes into a
               hard bank to the right as the Ventura Freeway turns into the
               Hollywood. A sign at the edge of the Hollywood Freeway reads:
               "SPEED LIMIT 55". The sub screams past.
               

               INT. COMMAND HQ - MAIN CONTROL ROOM
               
               Brazen points to a readout showing the submarine's engine status.

               Plissken, slow down the sub. You're
               overloading the power plant.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE
               
               Plissken glances at the gauge. His nuclear turbine readout: green,
               moving to yellow, into red. He pushes it up to 102%.
               
               MALLOY (V.O.)
               Plissken...?
               
               Plissken's eye turns back to the computer map in front of him. One
               the screen: the red blip representing the sub is headed right
               toward a building. Plissken pulls hard on the controls.
               

               EXT. UNDERWATER - UNIVERSAL CITY - THE BLACK TOWER - NIGHT
               
               The sub smacks into the side of the Black Tower, powers through
               it, blasts out the other side through a window, tilting and
               wobbling. The sub rights itself momentarily but is slammed
               downward out of frame by a huge, dark, slimy object.
               
               KING KONG looms overhead - his fist rising and falling with the
               currents. Plissken has maneuvered himself into the wreckage of the
               Universal Studios Tour.
               
               The sub zips through the King Kong ride into Back To The Future,
               passing 1950's signage from that film, dodging a rusting Delorean.
               It slams into the open mouth of JAWS, shattering the model into a
               million pieces.
               
               The sub continues on, bouncing through the narrow openings of the
               Earthquake Ride - broken pipes, cracked sidewalks, split walls -
               hard to tell what was the ride and what was The Big One.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE
               
               Plissken hangs on, as small jets of water spray into the cockpit
               through tiny cracks in the hull.
               

               EXT. UNDERWATER - MOVING WITH THE SUBMARINE - NIGHT
               
               The sub suddenly tips upward, rising for the surface.
               

               EXT. SHORELINE - CAHUENGA PASS - NIGHT
               
               The sub explodes out of the water, lands belly first on a hillside
               with a hard thump.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE
               
               Plissken presses the hatch controls. The sub begins to slide
               backwards down toward the water.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE
               
               Plissken struggles, then rips open the hatch, scrambles out. The
               sub slowly slips backwards, down into the water. As the rear
               exhaust tubes hit the surface, a blast of steam. Plissken leaps
               out of the hatch. The sub sinks faster and faster. He scampers up
               the side, leaps for ground... and lands on the hillside, as the
               sub sinks into the sea, bubbling, churning, hissing.
               
               A bleeping sound. He takes out his pocket walkie, raises the
               antenna.
               
               MALLOY (V.O.)
               Plissken...?
               
               PLISSKEN
               I'm here.
               
               MALLOY (V.O.)
               Where's the submarine? It's disappeared
               off our screens.
               
               PLISSKEN
               It's history. I gotta go.
               
               Plissken clicks off the walkie, pockets it, turns to climb up the
               hillside when...
               
               WHAM! Standing above him is a dark figure. Hooded. Carrying
               something huge and rounded at the ends.
               
               Plissken raises his submachine gun...
               
               ... as PIPELINE steps closer. He's a surfer in a black wetsuit.
               Carries a surfboard. A rifle is slung across his shoulder.
               Pipeline's face is raw, burned - too many hours surfing in the UV.
               
               PIPELINE
               Too bad about your boat, man.
               (Plissken doesn't move)
               Supposed to be some swells out here
               tonight. Big ones.
               (beat)
               You like to surf?
               
               Realizing Pipeline is no danger, Plissken moves past him up the
               hillside.
               
               PIPELINE
               You look kinda familiar.
               (beat)
               You hang out around here much?
               
               But Plissken's moved off into the darkness.
               

               EXT. MULHOLLAND DRIVE - NIGHT - RAIN
               
               Plissken reaches old Mulholland Drive, now dark and desolate.
               Shells of houses stand nearby, black and empty. It has begun to
               rain.
               
               The sound of gunfire. Plissken ducks behind a tree...
               
               Two old cars come zooming up Mulholland, side by side. Windows
               down. Guns blazing at each other. They pass Plissken, continue
               down Mulholland, ripping each other apart with gunfire. Plissken
               darts across Mulholland, down the mountainside.
               

               EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - NIGHT - RAIN
               
               The rain pours down as Plissken makes his way down a steep
               incline.
               
               CRACK! A dark figure steps out from behind a tree. Plissken spins,
               submachine gun ready. It's Pipeline.
               
               PIPELINE
               Hey, man. I know who you are. You're Snake
               Plissken. Man, I can't believe you're
               really here.
               
               More gunfire from above on Mulholland...
               
               PIPELINE
               Kind of a bad neighborhood, Snake.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?
               
               PIPELINE
               (points)
               Down that way.
               
               Plissken starts down.
               
               PIPELINE
               Be careful. Some real strange dudes
               hangin' out there these days.
               
               Plissken continues moving, now just a blurry figure in the rain.
               
               PIPELINE
               Hey Snake - what're you doin' around here,
               man?
               (as Plissken disappears)
               I heard they busted you up real good in
               Cleveland...
               

               EXT. HILLS ABOVE THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL - NIGHT - RAIN
               
               The rain is coming down in a torrent as Plissken makes his way
               down the hillside. Then, all at once, the rain lets up, then
               stops. The trees drip with moisture. Suddenly, a huge KATHUMP from
               above him. Plissken looks back. A huge mudslide is roaring its way
               down the hill toward him.
               
               Plissken races down the hill, but the mudslide cascades downward
               like a freight train, catches up with him, sweeps him off his
               feet... and Plissken goes riding down the hill, rumbling and
               sliding in the mud.
               

               EXT. STAND OF TREES - NIGHT
               
               The mudslide hits a flat area near a stand of trees, spreads out,
               slows. A completely mud-covered, black Plissken climbs out of the
               goo. He's dripping with it. His one good eye shines in the
               moonlight. He takes a couple steps toward the edge of the treeline
               when...
               
               A VOICE (SPINAL) (V.O.)
               Shut-up, fuck! Stop makin' noise!
               
               Plissken spins. He's standing right next to SPINAL, the leader of
               the Black Cowboy Gang. Dressed in black, boots with spurs, black
               duster, black cowboy hat, he carries an automatic rifle. He looks
               just like Charles Barkley.
               
               Plissken looks around, realizes he's in the middle of a small army
               of Black Cowboys, crouched behind the trees, waiting in ambush.
               Covered with mud, Plissken blends right in.
               
               SPINAL
               Take cover, fool.
               
               Plissken jumps behind a tree, looks down the hillside.
               
               PLISSKEN'S POV - THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL
               
               Below his position is the Hollywood Bowl. A huge cross is on
               stage, and the cross is on fire.
               
               CLOSER - HOLLYWOOD BOWL
               
               A group of white hooded men, the K.K.K., stand in front of the
               burning cross holding a ceremony. Next to the cross on stage, a
               hooded K.K.K. string quartet begins playing a Hayden concerto.
               
               Plissken reacts.
               
               SPINAL
               Let's take him.
               
               A Black Cowboy raises his M79 grenade launcher, as the others
               quickly race down the hillside. He fires.
               
               THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL
               
               A 40mm armor-piercing grenade leaves a blazing fire trail as it
               rockets toward the burning cross and - KABLAMMO! A fireball blows
               pieces of the cross into the air. The K.K.K. spin around...
               
               A blast of lightning illuminates the Black Cowboys attacking from
               the hills. They open fire. A K.K.K. Grand Dragon is picked off his
               feet, buffeted in mid-air, flesh and robe shredded by gunfire. A
               hail of bullets hits the K.K.K. They return fire, but are
               overwhelmed. They are hit, jerking and twisting. Fire from the
               Black Cowboys is withering, racking the hooded figures like bolts
               of lightning. The Black Cowboys keep advancing, firing, as it
               starts to rain again.
               
               Through the cloudy wash of dribbling rain water, the firefight
               continues. Four K.K.K. leap out from behind a row of seats and
               jump Plissken, knocking his gun to the ground. In a blinding
               flash, using hands, feet, and head, Plissken sends them flying. As
               he reaches down to pick up his submachine gun, he sees that the
               rain is washing the mud off his body...
               
               AND SO DOES SPINAL, who stands nearby, watching as Plissken is
               washed clean by the rain. Spinal raises his weapon, then stops.
               
               SPINAL
               Hey. I know you. Snake Plissken.
               
               Plissken slowly stands, his submachine gun in his hand. Behind
               them, the firefight is almost over. The K.K.K. scatter into the
               rain...
               
               SPINAL
               Hey, what's going down, Snake?
               
               PLISSKEN
               I'm looking for somebody.
               
               SPINAL
               Who ain't?
               
               Plissken pulls out his tracer. It is blipping red, just south of
               the Bowl.
               
               SPINAL
               Say, is it true what they say about
               Cleveland, man?
               
               Plissken doesn't answer. He moves on through the rain...
               
               SPINAL
               Later, Snake. Thanks for the help. You can
               always shift down and mojo with us
               anytime.
               

               EXT. VINE AVENUE - NIGHT
               
               The ruins of the Capital Records building. The rain has stopped
               again. Plissken is a lone figure walking along the street. In the
               distance, the sound of thumping music.
               

               EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD AT HIGHLAND - NIGHT
               
               Pandemonium! Music blares. It's the old Supremes hit, "Love is
               Like An Itchin' In My Heart." Crowds dance in the street. It's
               like a block party. Black, Latino and Native American gangs
               celebrate. Plus the usual Hollywood Boulevard street traffic.
               Plissken moves through the carnival. Gorgeous hookers stand under
               the marquee of the ruined Chinese Theater. The marquee now reads:
               "SAFE SEX", "NO CONDOMS NEEDED", "POLYPROPYLENE ORIFICES",
               "SATISFACTION GUARANTEED"
               
               One of the hookers struts in front of Plissken.
               
               CLOSEUP - THE HOOKER
               
               Opening her mouth, she gives a sensuous puff. A polypropylene
               orifice attached to the inside of her lips expands outward like a
               small, pink balloon. She sucks it back in and puckers, kissing the
               air. Plissken turns, as the sounds of car engines rises.
               
               HIS POV - COMING DOWN HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD
               
               ... is a caravan of vehicles. The crowd parts to let them through,
               cheering insanely. Plissken ducks into an alley, watches...
               
               The caravan passes Plissken's position. Two men on horseback lead
               a convoy of rumbling, fuming old cars, buses, motorcycles - all
               scarred and ripped and jerry-rigged - bumps down the Boulevard.
               
               Plissken watches from his spot in the alley, as a blonde-haired
               hooker joins him, rubs his arm. She has no polypropylene, at least
               none that we can see.
               
               BLONDE HOOKER
               It's winnin' time, baby. How about you and
               I do some celebrating?
               
               PLISSKEN
               What's going on?
               
               BLONDE HOOKER
               You must be new around here.
               (beat)
               You look familiar. Have I done you before?
               
               Plissken grabs the hooker.
               
               PLISSKEN
               What's happening?
               
               BLONDE HOOKER
               Easy, man, easy. It's Cuervo Jones' gang.
               Mescalito Justice. He's the big boss man
               'round here tonight.
               (whispers)
               He's gonna take down the police and make
               'em kiss his fine ass.
               
               Plissken lets her go, stares...
               
               HIS POV - A CADILLAC
               
               ... is perched ten feet off the ground on monster truck wheels.
               Severed doll heads are glued all over the hood, and a large
               glittering disco ball spins atop the roof, catching shards of
               light and flicking them back into the night...
               
               Behind the disco ball stands the real Cuervo Jones, at least. And
               there next to him is Utopia. She's dressed in black lace underwear
               and bra, garters and stockings. A Playboy fantasy. She holds the
               prototype. Delgado, Cuervo Jones' second-in-command, stands behind
               her. He is huge and evil. Dressed like Pancho Villa.
               
               Plissken stares as the Cadillac passes. The hooker cheers along
               with the rest of the crowd, and doesn't notice that Plissken's
               moved off...
               
               Several motorcycles bring up the rear of the caravan. Mescalitos
               ride with their women slung behind them. As the last bike passes,
               Plissken darts out of the alley, yanks the woman off the back of
               the cycle, jumps on.
               
               ON THE MOTORCYCLE
               
               The Mescalito biker turns to react...
               
               WHACK! Plissken takes him out with a head-butt, shoves him off the
               bike, hops up on the seat.
               
               KAVROOM! Plissken guns the motorcycle and it roars off, around the
               other bikers, toward the head of the caravan. Plissken zooms
               along, makes the turn onto La Brea Avenue with the caravan...
               

               EXT. LA BREA AND SUNSET BOULEVARDS - NIGHT
               
               As the caravan turns west onto Sunset, Plissken blasts around the
               corner.
               
               ON PLISSKEN
               
               Coming right behind him are four Mescalitos on Harleys - chains,
               iron bars, and swords in their hands. Plissken stares up ahead.
               
               HIS POV - THE CADILLAC
               
               ... is just a few feet away. Cuervo Jones and Utopia.
               
               Plissken guns it when suddenly two Mescalitos pull up on either
               side of him. One of them swings a chain. Plissken grabs it with
               one hand, and with his other hand, aims his submachine gun and
               fires! The Mescalito and bike go flying, and Plissken holds on to
               the chain.
               
               Atop the Cadillac, Cuervo Jones reacts to the sound of gunfire. He
               turns to see...
               
               PLISSKEN
               
               As the other Mescalito riding behind him swings a chain. Plissken
               swings his. The two chains snap together, intertwining. Then
               Plissken squeezes his hand-brake. He screeches to a stop. The
               Mescalito keeps going, and is yanked over backward by his own
               chain, off the Harley. Finally the Harley flops over, skids,
               explodes. Plissken guns it again, takes off after the Cadillac.
               
               Two more Mescalitos pull up on either side of Plissken. They take
               aim at him with their automatic rifles. Plissken pulls a sudden
               wheelie, lifts the front of his bike up into the air, rides on the
               back wheel. The two Mescalitos fire - directly into each other.
               They fall and their bikes go crashing to the pavement.
               
               Plissken surges the bike forward, coming up on a Mescalito on
               horseback who turns and fires. Plissken ducks and the bullet rips
               through the rear tire. The tire blows and the bike swerves out of
               control. Plissken leaps from the bike and grabs the back of the
               saddle.
               
               THE HORSE
               
               Plissken pulls himself up behind the Mescalito and wrestles for
               control of the mount. Plissken grabs the reins and wraps them
               around the Mescalito's neck, squeezing until his eyes burst.
               Plissken slams his arm against the Mescalito, throwing him off the
               saddle, bouncing onto the pavement.
               
               Plissken gallops ahead, circling a lasso high above his head,
               pounding down on a biker. The lasso takes flight and finds it
               mark, the biker's neck. Plissken pulls the lasso taut, ties the
               end to the saddle horn, rides his mount parallel to the biker.
               
               THE BIKE
               
               With one quick yank to the lasso, Plissken pulls the biker off,
               jumps on the bike and smacks the hell out of the horse's rump.
               
               THE HORSE
               
               Takes off down the street, dragging the biker by the neck.
               
               THE CADILLAC
               
               Speeds up as Plissken moves up to the Mustang five cars behind. He
               swings off the bike and jumps onto the trunk. Plissken climbs up
               to the roof, leaps on the hood, then jumps to the trunk of the car
               in front - leapfrogging, jumping to the next car, the next car...
               
               MESCALITOS
               
               Lean out their car windows, firing at him, but Plissken keeps
               moving toward the Cadillac...
               
               SUDDENLY A HAND
               
               Reaches out a car window and grabs Plissken's submachine gun.
               Plissken turns to snatch it back -
               
               WHEN CUERVO JONES
               
               Leaps from the Cadillac and takes Plissken down to the roof.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Snake Plissken.
               
               They struggle. Cuervo raises his machete. Plissken grabs his
               wrist, flips him over, knocks the machete off into the street,
               smacks Cuervo in the face.
               
               A BOLAS-SWINGING MESCALITO
               
               Comes roaring up on his bike, throws the bolas...
               
               PLISSKEN
               
               As the bolas hit him, wrap around his neck, the balls thunking him
               in the face, sending him flying...
               
               KAWHAP! Plissken hits the pavement hard. He skids, rolls, and at
               last slams into the edge of the sidewalk. The caravan rumbles away
               down Sunset. The hand in the car window still holds Plissken's
               submachine gun.
               
               Cuervo crouches on the roof, hissing at Plissken.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Later, Snake. We finish it later.
               
               PLISSKEN
               
               Lies there for several beats, then climbs to his feet.
               
               HIS POV - THE CARAVAN
               
               ... disappears up Sunset.
               
               PLISSKEN
               
               Stands alone in the deserted street. The ruins of a supermarket,
               cheap motels, liquor stores - all empty, desolate.
               
               He looks over to see the broken remains of his pocket walkie.
               After a beat, he starts moving up Sunset, checking his two 9mm
               handguns, slipping them into their holsters.
               

               EXT. SUNSET AND DOHENY - NIGHT
               
               On the border of Beverly Hills, Sunset stretches off into the
               darkness beyond the intersection. A slight wind blows litter
               aimlessly along. There are occasional sounds: Creaks, distant
               clangs.
               
               Plissken approaches the intersection. He carries Utopia's compass
               homing device. It is silent. The small screen's blank. Then
               Plissken glances at his wrist watch.
               
               CLOSE - WRIST WATCH
               
               Three hours gone.
               
               Plissken stands for a moment, staring off down Sunset...
               
               VOICE (V.O.)
               Snake Plissken, right?
               
               He spins around.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               
               Sits in an old beach chair on the sidewalk, a map to the stars
               sign in front of him. In his late 50's, he's a petty thief, con
               man. He's been hustling tourists and everybody else all his life.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Wow! Snake Plissken!
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie listens to WAYWARD WIND by Gogi Grant on a
               small, metal-plated portable radio. He clicks off the radio,
               rises, walks over to Plissken.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               You're a star in your own right, you know
               that? Hey, I'm Map To The Stars Eddie. How
               you doin'?
               
               PLISSKEN
               Where'd they go?
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Man, I'd love to have your autograph,
               Snake.
               
               He searches around in his pockets, comes up with pen and paper.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               I've been hearing about you ever since
               that New York deal back in the 90's.
               You're one smooth operator.
               (offers pen and paper)
               Could you sign one to Wolf, one to Death's
               Head, one to Slasher Smith...?
               
               Plissken grabs him by the throat.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Where are they?
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Who? You mean Cuervo Jones? He's the man
               with the juice, Snake. Got the President's
               daughter. Setting up a citywide truce. Big
               doings.
               
               Plissken draws a 9mm and points it at Map To The Stars Eddie's
               forehead.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Location.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Cuervo's got a place near Venice, where
               the big birds fly. Nice digs, too. I've
               been there, y'know.
               
               Plissken releases him, as suddenly the tracer beeps. On the device
               Plissken sees a small red pulsing dot. West.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Nice little gizmo you got there.
               (whispers conspiratorially)
               Look, Snake. I've got connections in this
               town. You need something, I'm your man.
               
               Without a word Plissken turns, walks away down Sunset Boulevard
               toward Beverly Hills.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Hey - you can't go there, Snake. You can't
               walk through Beverly Hills.
               
               Plissken's figure disappears...
               

               EXT. SUNSET - SIGN - NIGHT
               
               The old Beverly Hills sign. It's been painted over in dripping red
               letters: "QUIET - SURGICAL ZONE - STAY OUT"
               
               Plissken ignores the sign, keeps walking down a completely dark
               Sunset Boulevard.
               
               

               EXT. SUNSET BOULEVARD - BEVERLY HILLS - NIGHT
               
               Plissken walks past the once-beautiful mansions along Sunset. Now
               they are dark, ruined.
               
               CLOSER - BEVERLY HILLS MANSION
               
               As a twisted, mechanical hand sewn awkwardly to the flesh of the
               wrist pulls aside a window curtain. The face behind the window is
               in shadows, but we can just make out its pale, discolored
               features. The other hand brings up a walkie-talkie...
               
               SENTRY
               (into walkie)
               Specimen moving west on Sunset.
               

               EXT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - SUNSET AND BEVERLY DRIVE - NIGHT
               
               Plissken moves into the intersection of Sunset and Beverly Drive.
               The ruins of the old Beverly Hills Hotel are ahead and to his
               right. He stops, stares down Sunset...
               
               HIS POV - A FIGURE
               
               Emerges from the shadows. This is the gatekeeper. Strange,
               mismatched body parts. A black-skinned arm attached to a pale
               white body. His face is unnaturally smooth - too many face lifts.
               He carries a torch.
               
               GATEKEEPER
               Halt!
               (beat)
               Where are you going?
               (no reply)
               Are you here for the auction?
               
               BEHIND PLISSKEN
               
               Figures have suddenly moved out into the street, all with
               mismatched body parts - heads too large for their torsos, female
               body parts mixed with male heads, all sewn together with large,
               uneven stitches. Plissken is surrounded.
               
               GATEKEEPER
               Welcome to Beverly Hills.
               
               Plissken raises his gun, starts to move, when suddenly a figure
               rises behind him out of the shadows...
               
               A MULTI-COLORED FLESH HAND
               
               Raises a lead pipe, brings it down hard...
               
               ON PLISSKEN'S HEAD
               
               THUNK! He goes out like a light.
               
               As Plissken slumps unconscious to the street, the figures move for
               him. Their arms lock around him, drag him away with amazing speed
               - a pack of wolves on a deer.
               
               CLOSEUP - PLISSKEN - NIGHT
               
               Plissken bolts awake, to find himself tied to a cross. It's
               lurching back and forth as though the ground is moving.
               

               EXT. RODEO DRIVE - BEVERLY HILLS - NIGHT
               
               Plissken is being carried down Rodeo Driveon the cross by a throng
               of surgical failures. They carry torches. Dressed in tatters.
               Their faces look only partially human sewn together raggedly.
               
               Rodeo Drive is a bizarre marketplace of body parts. The once
               beautiful storefronts of famous designers are now in shambles.
               Human body parts are on display like filets of fish on ice.
               
               Gucci now offers body pieces fashioned from spare car parts and
               Armani displays more eclectic, high priced pieces sewn together
               like sculptures in their windowfronts. A giant rift runs down the
               street's center. Acrid smoke rises.
               
               The throng stops at an intersection, and Plissken's cross is
               anchored in the middle of the street. Surrounding the intersection
               are patients of every size, age, sex.
               
               Plissken looks over, sees another cross being carried up and
               planted right next to his. A beautiful girl is tied to this cross.
               This is TASLIMA, 20's, Iranian, the face of a Persian princess.
               She's dressed in black leather, and basically has an IQ of around
               50.
               
               TASLIMA
               Hi, Snake. It's so great to meet you. My
               name's Taslima. I'm a fan of yours.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Are you crazy?
               
               TASLIMA
               A little bit. But pretty soon I'm gonna be
               dead. So are you, Snake.
               
               Plissken looks across the street. Our of the ruins of the once
               famous red door of Elizabeth Arden come an arm of women facialists
               with acid-burned faces from one-too-many skin peelings wielding
               knives, saws, horrible-looking carving instruments...
               
               TASLIMA
               I can't believe I got caught.
               (sighs)
               I run with Midnight Jihad. Iranian gang.
               Only they kicked me out, cause I screw up
               sometimes. I forget stuff.
               
               Plissken struggles with his bonds.
               
               TASLIMA
               I left my boyfriend's place tonight, took
               a wrong turn...
               (sighs again)
               Oh, Snake, I'm really kind of out of it
               sometimes.
               
               OUT OF THE RED DOOR come more interns and nurses carrying surgical
               pans and pushing gurneys to collect dismembered body parts.
               
               The throng of facialists, patients, interns and nurses surround
               Plissken and Taslima on the crosses. They move back to the
               sidewalks as the auction for body parts cut freshly from Plissken
               and Taslima is about to begin. The gurneys are wheeled into place
               and set up as large cutting tables. The facialists take their
               positions behind the tables waiting to carve fresh meat.
               
               PLISSKEN
               What are they?
               
               TASLIMA
               They live here, used to be like us. But
               after too many silicon implants, their
               muscles turned to jelly. The only way they
               survive is to have body parts transplanted
               over and over again.
               (whispers)
               Snake, nobody who comes into Beverly Hills
               gets out alive.
               
               PLISSKEN
               No screamin' shit.
               
               TASLIMA
               Oh no, it's the Doctor.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Who?
               
               TASLIMA
               The Surgeon General of Beverly Hills.
               
               THE DOCTOR, THE SURGEON GENERAL OF BEVERLY HILLS
               
               Steps out into the street. He appears incredibly gorgeous, a hunk
               of a man, put together by the finest body parts available in
               Beverly Hills - a millennium Fabio - but upon closer examination,
               he's got no lower jaw. Instead, there is a rusting metal grid-work
               attached beneath each ear. It never moves. He can actually speak
               through a metal box attached to his windpipe.
               
               THE DOCTOR
               
               Stands in front of them. He raises his hands to quiet the crowd.
               He walks around the cross, admiring the beautiful bodies before
               him. He tickles the fine flesh with his right hand, which is made
               up of 10 gleaming scalpels which form a 360 degree cutting edge.
               
               THE DOCTOR
               I've never seen more beautiful specimens.
               There will be no auction tonight. These
               body parts will go to those who need them
               the most.
               
               The crowd gumbles.
               
               PLISSKEN
               
               Turns his head sideways, to a small hidden pocket near his neck.
               With his teeth, he pulls out the silver mouth dart, slips it onto
               his tongue, closes his mouth.
               
               The doctor raises his gleaming scalpel hand and steps toward
               Plissken.
               
               THE DOCTOR
               What a beautiful blue eye. It's a shame
               you only have one.
               
               A nurse brings over a small step-ladder. The doctor positions it
               in front of Plissken, slowly climbs up the rungs until he is face
               to face with him. The doctor looks ready to pluck Plissken's good
               eye from its socket with his scalpel tips.
               
               FFFTTT! Plissken spits the mouth dart!
               
               WHACK! The dark hits the doctor squarely in the forehead. He
               freezes, his scalpel hand raised, his eyes clouding. He falls
               forward.
               
               The scalpel hand swings, misses its mark, and instead hits the
               rope tied around Plissken's wrist. WHATCK! The rope's cut!
               
               Plissken grabs the scalpel hand with his free hand, cuts his other
               hand and legs loose in a flash and pushes the doctor backward off
               the step-ladder.
               
               WHUMP! Plissken falls to the intersection, almost at the same time
               as the doctor hits the pavement.
               
               The patients are stunned. Motionless. They stare at their doctor
               lying in the street, moaning, moving slightly.
               
               Snake starts to run...
               
               TASLIMA
               Snake, help me.
               
               SNAKE
               Why?
               
               TASLIMA
               I don't know.
               
               Almost on a whim, Plissken cuts her free. Then he runs. Taslima
               follows him.
               
               Plissken heads toward a side street, looks over his shoulder, sees
               Taslima following...
               
               PLISSKEN
               Don't follow me.
               
               TASLIMA
               You need help.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Like hell I do.
               
               Then Plissken comes to a dead stop.
               
               HIS POV - DOWN THE STREET
               
               Comes a mass of patients right at him. Taslima grabs Plissken,
               pulls him with her. They take off down a dark cobblestone
               street...
               

               EXT. DARK ALLEY - NIGHT
               
               Plissken and Taslima run as behind them the patient horde gives
               chase. They stop at another small alley between two large
               buildings.
               
               TASLIMA
               Down this way.
               
               They disappear into the small alley.
               

               EXT. SMALL ALLEY - CUL DE SAC - NIGHT
               
               It's long and narrow and completely enclosed by the buildings on
               either side. Suddenly Plissken and Taslima come to the end - a 75
               foot high four-story building blocking the passageway to Wilshire.
               
               PLISSKEN
               This is a dead end.
               (looks at her)
               You took us into a dead end!
               
               TASLIMA
               I just thought you wanted to get away. I
               didn't know you wanted to go someplace.
               
               KACLANK! They turn...
               
               The doctor staggers down the alley, the dart still sticking from
               his forehead. Behind him, the patients follow...
               
               Plissken shoves Taslima toward a broken window.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Go!
               
               He follows Taslima through the window.
               

               INT. SECOND FLOOR BALCONY - NIGHT
               
               Plissken and Taslima climb dilapidated stairs, move along the
               balcony railing. A torn and tattered Roy Lichtenstein painting
               hangs crooked on a wall. Twenty foot high bright red letters -
               "CAA" - lie strewn across the marble floor. Various offices are
               wrecked and dark, scripts lay all over the place.
               
               They stop at a dark hallway. Taslima moves cautiously ahead.
               
               TASLIMA
               Be careful of the bald cats. They live in
               these buildings.
               
               PLISSKEN
               The what?
               
               Plissken reaches for his other 9mm in its holder, but his hands
               are trapped by the doctor's body. Closer and closer moves the claw
               dagger toward Plissken's good eye.
               
               Taslima scrambles, picks up Plissken's 9mm, then stares at the two
               men.
               
               PLISSKEN
               (yelling)
               Are you gonna stand there? Give me the
               gun!
               
               Taslima starts to hand it to him. Both Plissken and the doctor
               fight to reach it. Finally, it's in Plissken's grasp. He blasts
               three times - each one hitting. The doctor shudders, rolls away.
               
               Plissken gets to his feet. He blasts one more time for good
               measure, then follows Taslima down the hallway...
               

               INT. FIRST FLOOR - REAR EXIT - NIGHT
               
               They come down a flight of stairs, stop at the rear door.
               
               PLISSKEN
               How do we get out of here?
               
               TASLIMA
               Sewers. Come on.
               
               She pushes open the door...
               

               EXT. BEVERLY HILLS STREET - NIGHT
               
               Plissken and Taslima run from the building, as a chorus of wails
               rises. Patients swarm around the building in pursuit.
               
               Taslima stops at a sewer grate in the street.
               
               TASLIMA
               Down there.
               
               Plissken lifts the grating. Taslima jumps in, followed by
               Plissken...
               

               INT. SEWER TUNNEL - NIGHT
               
               Dim, greenish light. Plissken and Taslima begin running down the
               sewer tunnel. Through the hole behind them drop patients, giving
               chase. Plissken and Taslima race through a half-filled storm drain
               seeping with slime. They turn a corner into another tunnel, and
               run smack into a horde of patients. Instantly, the patients
               overpower them. Hands reach out and drag them down...
               
               Suddenly, from down the tunnel comes an unearthly sound, a weird
               whispery screech like a demon unleashed from the underworld. It
               gets louder and louder. The patients freeze, then begin screaming
               and, as the sound gets louder still, they all disappear, escaping
               back down the tunnel.
               
               FROM DOWN THE TUNNEL
               
               An eerie light appears, coming nearer and nearer every moment.
               
               TASLIMA
               Snake - what is it?
               
               PLISSKEN
               How the hell am I supposed to know? This
               is your damn city.
               
               Slowly, the light takes form. It is a single, gigantic eye -
               floating in pitch-black darkness. It continues coming - growing
               larger and larger. Suddenly the sewer begins to echo with a
               blasting, ringing sound. Music!
               
               It's incredibly LOUD SALSA MUSIC!
               
               From out of the tunnel drives an ancient golf cart.
               
               On a metal pole in front is a huge, lighted eye such as an
               optometrist might use to advertise his services. Salsa music
               blares at top volume from loudspeakers strapped to the sides of
               the cart. At the wheel of the vehicle is a large man dressed in
               jeans, cowboy boots and a flak vest, wearing a gas mask. A lariat
               is hooked to his belt.
               
               He pulls up near Plissken and Taslima, shuts off the motor and the
               music, lifts a shotgun from the seat beside him, climbs down. He
               holds the gun on them.
               
               Removing his head gear, his face becomes visible. He is PENDEJO
               BOB, a Mexican wearing sunglasses under the gas mask. He takes off
               the sunglasses, and his apparently blind in one eye. He looks like
               Los Lobos' lead guitarist.
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               What're you doing in here?
               
               PLISSKEN
               Looking to get out.
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               Good. I want you out. This is my sewer.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Which way?
               
               With a grunt of curiosity, Pendejo Bob moves up to Plissken.
               Suddenly his blind eye flashes on like a tiny, built-in spotlight.
               With it, he examines Plissken's face.
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               You're Snake Plissken.
               
               TASLIMA
               Yes. Isn't he cool?
               
               There is a clicking sound and the lighted eye is extinguished.
               Pendejo Bob extends his hand.
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               An honor, Snake. Amigo. They call me
               Pendejo Bob.
               
               Plissken doesn't shake. From down the tunnel the shouts and
               footfalls of the patients gets closer...
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               Those damn patients are coming back. You'd
               better climb aboard.
               
               Plissken and Taslima climb into the rear of the golf cart. Pendejo
               Bob spins the cart, takes off in the other direction.
               

               INT. UNDERGROUND PASSAGE - NIGHT
               
               The golf cart streaks along through a dark sewer passage. The only
               light comes from the eye on the front of the vehicle.
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               I use the eye and the music to scare em
               off. They're so whacked out, man, it works
               great. Chased a whole bunch of em right
               off the edge there a few months ago.
               
               He points to a sheer, pitch-black drop-off on one side of the
               passage.
               
               TASLIMA
               (she peers over the side)
               How far down does it go?
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               Don't know - never do hear em land.
               Earthquake opened it up.
               
               The golf cart creaks into a narrow tunnel...
               
               INSIDE THE TUNNEL
               
               Guards, Hispanics in biker denims, fatigues, with rifles and
               sunglasses, line the walls. They watch as the golf cart passes. Up
               ahead is a door marked: "SEWAGE RECLAMATION CONTROL"
               

               INT. SEWER RECLAMATION CENTER - CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
               
               The cart pulls into the remains of a mammoth underground control
               center. It's lined with ladders, catwalks, machines full of gauges
               and levers. A few are still working - most are broken and covered
               with dust and grime.
               
               Filling the room is an underground enclave: Men, women, children,
               all Hispanic, living in tents and lean-to's, cooking over open
               fires next to old rusted cars on blocks, lots of weapons, lots of
               sunglasses. Also, high-tech, futuristic rifles, cannons, grenade
               launchers - an amazing arsenal. Crates of explosives are stacked
               everywhere.
               
               The golf cart comes to a stop and they get off.
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               I own this whole place. Used to work here
               in the old days. I was right in this room
               when the big one hit. What a mess. We were
               waist high in shit.
               (turns proudly to them)
               Everybody else ran, but not me. I stayed
               at my post. Now it's all mine. I brought
               my whole family, my amigos, down here to
               live with me.
               
               TASLIMA
               Gun runners.
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               Hey, it's a living, baby.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Why don't you get out of L.A.? Take a boat
               to China, take an airplane to Brazil?
               (looks at Taslima)
               Earthquakes, death, shit. Why do you stay?
               
               TASLIMA
               I don't know. Somehow, I just can't leave.
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               Y'know, L.A.'s not such a bad place,
               Snake. We got our problems, sure - but
               this is paradise, man.
               
               Pendejo Bob leans in close and whispers conspiratorially to
               Plissken.
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               Say, you need anything, Snake? Guns?
               Explosives? I can get you a crate of
               hellfire grenades, no problem - five
               hours.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Yeah. So how do I get to Venice?
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               All the sewers are collapsed under Venice.
               You have to go topside. Right up there.
               
               He leads Plissken and Taslima to a ladder that goes up into the
               darkness. A line of men steadily climb up, one after the other,
               carrying crates of weapons.
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               Comes out near the Santa Monica Freeway.
               Just follow the signs. Get off at the
               Lincoln Exit, turn left.
               
               Pendejo Bob interrupts the line of men. Plissken starts up the
               ladder, followed by Taslima...
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               Nice to meet you, Snake. You too, Miss.
               You're welcome down here anytime. Anytime
               at all.
               

               EXT. STREET UNDER SANTA MONICA FREEWAY OVERPASS - NIGHT
               
               Plissken, gun in hand, sticks his head out of the open grate.
               Taslima follows. The Hispanic men who have climbed up out of the
               sewers load their weapons crates into various low-rider cars in
               heavily-armed groups. They rumble off into the night.
               
               Taslima points to a freeway on-ramp.
               
               TASLIMA
               The freeway's over there. But, Snake - I
               don't think it's such a good idea.
               
               Plissken starts toward the on-ramp. Taslima doesn't move.
               
               TASLIMA
               The freeways are dangerous.
               
               He keeps walking.
               
               TASLIMA
               Goodbye, Snake.
               
               Plissken stops, turns back, looks at her - a half-smile. It's as
               close to 'thank you' as he gets.
               
               TASLIMA
               Sun's coming up in a few hours.
               
               She walks up to him.
               
               TASLIMA
               UV's gonna be bad today. I have a friend
               who's got a place near here. We can crash
               there if you want, Snake.
               (she moves close to him)
               I'd love to take care of you. Make you
               feel good.
               
               Without an answer Plissken turns and walks away...
               

               EXT. SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - NIGHT
               
               As far as the eye can see there are lines of rusting cars and
               trucks, bumper to bumper like a giant junkyard rush hour.
               
               Plissken walks up the on-ramp, onto the freeway. He strides past
               rows of junked cars. A few of them have people inside...
               
               There is a Mercedes rusted to its frame, its driver an 80-year-old
               in sunglasses, drinking from a bottle. A pickup truck full of old
               illegal aliens packed in like sardines. Someone cooks from a
               barbecue grill. An RV. An old man sits in the opened doorway,
               staring at Plissken as he passes. Two old ladies in housecoats
               stare at him through the windows.
               
               CLICK, CLICK! A sound behind Plissken. He spins, 9mm ready...
               
               It's Taslima, running to catch up with him.
               
               TASLIMA
               I changed my mind. I'm going with you,
               wherever you're going.
               
               PLISSKEN
               (gestures to the cars)
               What the hell is this?
               
               TASLIMA
               The freeway.
               
               PLISSKEN
               I know that. There are people in some of
               these cars.
               
               TASLIMA
               It's where they live. I guess after
               everything happened, they just needed to
               do what they'd always done before. During
               the daytime, they just pull down the
               shades on their windows and sleep.
               
               Plissken continues walking. Taslima catches up...
               
               TASLIMA
               What are you gonna do in Venice?
               
               PLISSKEN
               Find Cuervo Jones.
               
               TASLIMA
               No! Stay away, Snake. He's mucho muerte.
               
               Suddenly a shot rings out. Taslima is struck and falls. Plissken
               drops between the cars and crawls over to her.
               
               TASLIMA
               Run, Snake...They're coming.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Who?
               
               She touches his hand and looks at him softly.
               
               TASLIMA
               I don't know.
               
               Taslima dies. Plissken stares at her for a moment.
               
               More shots ring out - landing very close to him.
               
               FREEWAY EMBANKMENTS
               
               From out of the heavy bushes along the freeway storm a dozen
               Mescalitos moving quickly - firing as they go. Behind them grinds
               an ancient garbage truck mounted with a 50-caliber machine gun.
               Atop the truck is Delgado. He wears a flame thrower on his back.
               
               PLISSKEN
               
               Returns fire, rolls under a car and begins crawling. All around
               him people jump out of their cars, begin firing back at the
               Mescalitos.
               
               THE GARBAGE TRUCK
               
               Smashes through a rusting Volkswagen, heading straight toward him.
               
               PLISSKEN
               
               Reaches the edge of the freeway, dives for the bushes.
               
               AS THE GARBAGE TRUCK
               
               Roars past, firing into the vehicles on the freeway, the people
               running, screaming...
               

               EXT. SIDE STREET - NIGHT
               
               Clawing his way through the undergrowth, Plissken bursts onto a
               side street. Behind him come the Mescalitos on foot. Plissken
               runs, firing back every step of the way...
               
               AHEAD ON THE STREET
               
               Suddenly, in the blowing mist in front of him, a car screeches
               into view. It's a perfectly restored, 1966 Cadillac convertible.
               Candy-apple red. The stereo blasts "Last Night" by the Satellites.
               
               And behind the wheel is Map To The Stars Eddie.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Hop in, Snake!
               
               THE UNDERGROWTH
               
               As the garbage truck bursts through. Delgado is behind the machine
               gun, blasting away, burning up the street. Bullets are flying
               everywhere as Plissken runs to the Cadillac and dives into the
               back seat. He's still not fully inside when Map To The Stars Eddie
               roars away in a blaze of rubber and smoke.
               
               DELGADO
               
               Takes aim with his flame thrower... KAWHOOSH!
               
               A GIANT TONGUE OF FLAME
               
               Shoots out from the nozzle like a flaming spear. It streaks down
               the street, just missing the tail of the Cadillac as it swerves
               around a corner...
               

               INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie races along a dark street. Plissken climbs
               into the front seat.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Hey, Snake - that was great. They almost
               burned your ass off!
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie drives like Satan himself. Plissken is
               almost thrown out as they spin around curves, up onto sidewalks.
               Delgado and the garbage truck can't keep up with them. Finally,
               the Mescalitos are left far behind as Map To The Stars Eddie slows
               down to a cruise of 70.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Too many people know where you're going,
               Snake. That's not good. Delgado and his
               men were back there waiting for you.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Delgado?
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Cuervo Jones' right-hand man. One tough
               hombre. You don't understand, Snake.
               Cuervo Jones wants to unify the island.
               We're on the move, man. Big time.
               

               EXT. DARK INTERSECTION - NIGHT
               
               The Cadillac smashes through an intersection, knocking two old
               junked cars out of the way.
               

               INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT
               
               Plissken jams his 9mm into Map To The Stars Eddie's ear.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Stop the damn car.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               No way.
               
               PLISSKEN
               I said pull over.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               All right. Anything for you, Snake.
               (beat)
               Although I was going to take you to Cuervo
               Jones' place.
               
               Plissken lowers the gun.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Where is it?
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Right over there.
               
               He points. Plissken looks off, as Map To The Stars Eddie hits a
               button on the steering wheel with his finger.
               
               ON THE DASHBOARD
               
               A small panel in front of Plissken flips down, revealing a two-
               inch machine gun barrel. Before he can do anything, four rounds
               rip straight into his chest, blasting him into the seat.
               
               PLISSKEN
               
               Grits his teeth and gasps. His gun drops. Blood runs from four
               holes in his shirt. His face grows red as he fights for air.
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie pushes the button again and the panel
               closes up over the barrel.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Pretty neat, huh? This is Cuervo's car. He
               lets me use it sometimes.
               (looks at Plissken)
               Not to worry, Snake. You were just shot
               with a fun-gun. You feel it?
               
               Plissken gulps for air.

               Plissken slumps back, collapses in the seat.

               Like Cuervo says, when the hit pulls you
               down to one inch from death, that is
               living, man.
               
               PLISSKEN'S POV - THE DRUG
               
               Kicks in hard. Surreal colors float through the dark, devastated
               streets of Venice.
               
               Plissken fights desperately against the drug, but he can't move.

               You should've talked to me first, Snake. I
               could've set this whole thing up. I'm
               actually Cuervo's agent, you know.
               
               As Plissken sags, losing consciousness, Map To The Stars Eddie's
               voice begins to fade...
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               And I'd love to represent you, too. We
               could make a bundle together. I know I
               could really help your career...I mean,
               you're a legend and all - but the last
               couple years, man, it's like you've fallen
               off the face of the earth.
               
               ON PLISSKEN'S FACE
               
               As the world crashes to black!
               
               FADE IN:
               

               EXT. INTERNATIONAL TERMINAL LAX - NIGHT
               
               Like a giant, scorched daddy-long-legs, the architectural identity
               of the LA airport rises above the empty parking lot littered with
               the skeletal remains of burned-out cars and airport shuttles. The
               wrecks of old 747s lie twisted and bent across the tarmac.
               
               BEHIND IT
               
               Surrounded by Mescalitos with torches and guns, sits the former
               Bradley Terminal defaced with graffiti, the sign now reading:
               "MESCALITO JUSTICE HALL"
               
               PLISSKEN'S GOOD EYE
               
               Opens. Looks around fuzzily.
               

               INT. MESCALITO JUSTICE HALL - NIGHT
               
               He is in Cuervo Jones lair. Huge. Torch-lit. Plissken lies in the
               center of the room, chained to a treadmill. He is surrounded by
               Mescalitos.
               
               In one corner of the room is lots of high-tech equipment.
               Computers. A VR simulator. Most of the Mescalitos are gathered
               around a big screen TV. They watch the 207th Annual Academy Awards
               from Carefree, Arizona.
               
               Cuervo Jones strides toward Plissken. Map To The Stars Eddie
               scurries along at his side.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Come on, Cuervo. I delivered him, didn't
               I? All I'm asking for is what you
               promised.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               We'll see.
               
               Cuervo Jones stops in front of Plissken. Sees that he's awake.
               Holds out a glass filled with red liquid.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Carrot juice?
               (no response)
               Laced with tequila, Snake. Good for you.
               No?
               (no response)
               Your health.
               
               Cuervo Jones downs the carrot juice. Plissken lifts his head,
               grimaces. Sweat pours down his face. He gasps for air.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               You're coming out of it, Snake. It hurts
               real bad.
               (beat)
               That's good.
               
               He kneels down next to Plissken.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Dying isn't good enough for you. You need
               pain. You'll never make it to where you
               want to go without a little pain.
               
               He stands, considers Plissken for a moment.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Snake Plissken. American outlaw. So
               typical of American idealism. The old
               west, Snake.
               
               Cuervo Jones tosses the glass to Map To The Stars Eddie. He's
               beginning to enjoy the moment, performing for Plissken.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Man against the sky. The individual.
               Freedom. No wonder they hate you so much
               in America, Snake. You remind them of what
               they used to be.
               
               Cuervo Jones walks to a door, opens it. Beyond is a huge courtyard
               filled with people - families, teenage runaways, the elderly,
               illegal aliens, orphans - people with nowhere to go. They are
               being fed and cared for by Mescalitos.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Here is the real L.A., Snake.
               
               Plissken lifts his head to see.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               The poor. The old. The lost. People
               without hope.
               
               He crosses back to Plissken...
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Do you know what they want? One word.
               Liberation.
               (beat)
               They want a chance to live - before it's
               all gone. They've been hated for too long
               -
               (smiles)
               Now it's their turn.
               
               He gestures to his men, who move to Plissken and begin carefully
               unlocking him from the treadmill.
               
               Still wobbly, Plissken crawls to his feet...
               
               As Utopia comes bounding up from the big screen TV. Still dressed
               in her racy underwear, she gives Cuervo Jones a kiss. She still
               carries the prototype with her.
               
               UTOPIA
               Cuervo! LaToya Jackson just won Best
               Actress.
               
               Cuervo Jones reaches out to take the prototype from her. She holds
               on to it.
               
               UTOPIA
               You said I could hold it.
               
               He yanks it out of her hands, more violently than she expected.
               Recovering, she casts a contemptuous glance at Plissken.
               
               UTOPIA
               Who's that?
               
               CUERVO JONES
               You never heard of Snake Plissken?
               
               Utopia takes a couple steps closer, squints.
               
               UTOPIA
               He doesn't look like his picture.
               (frown)
               I bet he's fake.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Now go get dressed. We have things to do.
               
               UTOPIA
               Are we going to eat soon? I'm starved.
               
               Cuervo Jones gives her a slap on the butt, which startles Utopia.
               
               UTOPIA
               Ooww!
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Go on now. Do as I say.
               
               Plissken watches as Utopia walks away, out of the terminal.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               I'm going to show her what it means to be
               a woman - for the first time in her
               pathetic little life.
               (smiles)
               Given her love, Snake. Everybody needs
               love.
               
               He moves slightly closer to Plissken - though not too close.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               You want to hook up with us? Join the
               revolution? We're all getting out of here
               tomorrow night.
               (holds up the prototype)
               We're gonna rule the world. Come with us,
               Snake.
               
               Plissken says nothing. His good eye glares.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               No? Too bad. Well, I told you we'd finish
               it later. So guess what? It's later.
               
               He motions to his men, who grab Plissken and drag him away...
               

               INT. BAGGAGE CLAIM AREA - NIGHT
               
               The baggage claim area is an industrial wasteland filled with
               machinery and hanging cables and wires. A door opens and Plissken
               is hurled in. The door slams shut.
               
               Plissken stands a moment, trying to get his balance, when a man
               steps out of the shadows. It is Delgado.
               
               DELGADO
               You're mine now, Snake. All mine.
               
               Delgado slowly moves towards Plissken, swinging two huge gleaming
               machetes around his head. Plissken steps back, glances at his
               wrist watch. 4 hours and 20 minutes gone.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Shit.
               
               Plissken looks up as Delgado flings a machete at him. He just
               barely dives out of the way, rolls on the floor...
               
               Delgado charges toward him, machete poised like a bayonet.
               Plissken rips off an edge guard from the baggage carousel and
               wings it at Delgado. The machete is blocked with a direct hit. KA-
               CLANG!
               
               Delgado is thrown sideways. Plissken runs, launches himself
               through the air, twisting his body sideways, and lands a hard kick
               right in Delgado's face. Delgado goes sprawling. One of the
               machetes CLANKS to the floor...
               
               Plissken grabs the machete, just as Delgado rises...
               
               WHOOSH! Plissken's arm is a blur as he throws...
               
               THUMP! The machete sticks out of Delgado's chest. He looks down at
               it in horror, then crumbles to the floor.
               

               EXT. MESCALITO JUSTICE HALL - NIGHT
               
               The caravan is starting up again. Wearing hot pants, a tank top
               and full-length mink coat, Utopia is escorted up a ladder by
               Cuervo Jones to the opened door of the Cadillac perched up on
               those monster truck wheels. The other Mescalitos mount up in their
               cars and motorcycles, and roar away from the terminal.
               
               Above, on top of the terminal, see a figure move.
               
               TOP OF MESCALITO JUSTICE HALL
               
               It's Plissken. He grabs an electrical wire and throws it over the
               side...
               
               PARKING LOT - A MESCALITO GUARD
               
               Stands watching the caravan pull away. He doesn't see the wire
               dangling behind him, and Plissken shinnying down it.
               
               Beat. Beat.
               
               WHACK! Plissken takes him out with one blow, lowers himself to the
               ground, takes his rifle.
               
               Plissken quickly moves down the dark street after the caravan.
               

               EXT. THE FORUM - NIGHT
               
               Cuervo Jones' caravan comes rolling down Manchester, into a vast
               parking lot toward the Forum. Portions of the gigantic sports
               arena have been damaged in the earthquake, but crowds still pour
               into the entrances.
               
               The caravan pulls up at the Forum Club entrance. Cuervo Jones,
               Utopia, Map To The Stars Eddie and the others enter.
               
               AS PLISSKEN
               
               Approaches, ducks behind an old junked car.
               
               THE FORUM - DAMAGED WALL
               
               Plissken sneaks up to a crumbled, broken wall of the Forum, crawls
               inside through a large crack...
               

               INT. LOCKER ROOM - THE FORUM - NIGHT
               
               Plissken's in the backstage area, near the locker rooms. Hear
               cheering from the main arena. Slowly Plissken moves to a door,
               opens it, steps out...
               

               INT. FORUM HALLWAY - NIGHT
               
               The cheering is louder is Plissken makes his way along the dingy
               hallway.
               
               Now the sound of gunfire from someplace up ahead. Plissken tenses.
               
               Suddenly from down the hallway come two Black Muslims carrying a
               body on a stretcher. As they pass, Plissken notices the body is
               wearing a bloody basketball uniform full of bullet holes.
               
               He moves forward...
               

               INT. FORUM ARENA - NIGHT
               
               Plissken peers into the main arena. A basketball game is underway.
               The Korean Dragons sit on one side, the Black Muslims on the
               other. They cheer wildly for their respective teams. Pipeline is
               in the crowd, enjoying the game...
               
               Plissken moves closer, among the crowd along the baseline. The
               whole place is lit by torches and clumsily-wired lighting. Above
               his head is the shot clock, slowly ticking down.
               
               There's blood everywhere on the floor. The referees wear bullet-
               proof body suits and helmets. Trainers with stretchers stand by.
               
               THE SHOT CLOCK
               
               Ticks down: 5 - 4...
               
               A BLACK MUSLIM
               
               Dribbles the ball towards the basket.
               
               THE SHOT CLOCK
               
               Ticks down: 3 - 2...
               
               A whole row of Korean Dragons with rifles stand and take aim.
               
               
               THE BLACK MUSLIM
               
               Pulls up into a jump shot, releases the ball into the air. It
               sails through the basket just as the horn goes off, beating the
               24-second violation.
               
               The Black Muslim crowd cheers. The Korean Dragons sit down.
               Plissken watches...
               
               CUERVO JONES, UTOPIA AND THE OTHERS
               
               Moving through the seats on the Korean Dragon side of the court.
               Map To The Stars Eddie stands near the baseline, listening to the
               game on his silver portable radio...
               
               THE REFEREE
               
               Hands the ball to a Korean Dragon guard. The Korean Dragon
               dribbles the ball down court, into the corner and passes it off.
               The Korean Dragons can't get a shot off...
               
               THE SHOT CLOCK
               
               Above Plissken's head ticks down: 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1... HONK!
               
               THE KOREAN DRAGON
               
               Guard still has the ball - the shot clock horn has gone off - 24
               second violation.
               
               A whole row of Black Muslims with rifles stand up, take aim, and
               fire!
               
               BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!
               
               The Korean Dragon guard is riddled with bullets. He falls dead on
               the floor. The Trainers with stretchers quickly collect his body
               and hurry off the court.
               
               Ball boys quickly wipe up the blood with mops.
               
               ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
               (sound of effect of breaking
               glass)
               Shot clock!
               
               The Black Muslim crowd is cheering and screaming! "I Love L.A."
               begins playing on the loudspeaker.
               
               The players wear do-rags and black uniforms that look a whole lot
               like the black leather that Plissken wears. One of the players,
               JAMAAL, notices Plissken.
               
               JAMAAL
               Hey - Snake Plissken, you knew my brother
               Abdul. He was with you in Cleveland.
               
               The other players react, greet Plissken, slapping his hand,
               thumping chests, high-fiving each other.
               
               JAMAAL
               Welcome aboard, Snake.
               
               But Plissken pays no attention. He sees:
               
               CUERVO JONES AND UTOPIA
               
               Sitting in the Korean Dragon section near the other end of the
               court.
               
               CLOSER - CUERVO JONES AND UTOPIA
               
               Sit next to Xi-Ping, the leader of the Korean Dragons, a fierce
               man with green and brown psychedelic camouflage on his face.
               Utopia watches the game while the two men confer. Cuervo Jones has
               a firm grip on the prototype.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               The time is now. We are the strongest. If
               we go together, the others will come.
               (beat)
               We go for everything, Xi-Ping. But we go
               together. What do you say?
               
               Xi-Ping nodes. They clasp hands...
               
               PLISSKEN
               
               Realizes he's got to get to the other side of the court. He jumps
               into the huddle with Jamaal, peering at him with his one good,
               cold eye.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Your brother died owing me, so I'm taking
               it out in trade. I need a favor...
               
               JAMAAL
               Sure, Snake. Anything.
               
               PLISSKEN
               I need to get across the court now...
               without drawing attention to myself.
               
               JAMAAL
               Like you ain't gonna stick out like a sore
               thumb. But we'll do what we can, Snake.
               Use the clock. Screen and roll. Now let's
               kick some butt!
               
               The players knock fists. Plissken puts on a do-rag. Yelling, they
               move onto the court, creating a shield for Plissken.
               
               JAMAAL
               (whispers)
               You play much pick-up ball, Snake?
               
               Plissken's watching Cuervo Jones and Utopia at the other end.
               
               JAMAAL
               Whatever happens, watch the shot clock,
               man.
               
               The referee blows his whistle. A Black Muslim guard inbounds the
               ball. The game is underway.
               
               Plissken ducks down the court using the rest of his team as cover.
               They go into a set play.
               
               The game is a cross between basketball and kung-fu. Players use
               slashing fists, spin-kicks, elbows and hard back-hands. It's full
               combat.
               
               The Korean Dragon guarding Plissken chops him. Plissken knocks him
               flat. No foul.
               
               Utopia sees Plissken, nudges Cuervo Jones.
               
               UTOPIA
               It's that weird guy again.
               
               Cuervo Jones grabs her and heads for the exit...
               
               Plissken sees this, stops playing, moves after them... when
               suddenly the basketball lands right in his hands!
               
               JAMAAL
               Snake! Shot clock!
               
               THE SHOT CLOCK
               
               Ticks down: 4 - 3 - 2...
               
               A whole row of Korean Dragons with rifles stand up, take aim at
               Plissken. Cuervo Jones watches expectantly...
               
               Plissken spins, executes a beautiful-looking jump shot. The horn
               sounds just as it leaves his hand...
               
               THE BASKET
               
               Swish. Nothing but net.
               
               The Korean Dragons sit back down, put away their rifles,
               disappointed. Cuervo Jones, Utopia, Xi-Ping and their henchmen
               quickly leave. The Black Muslims go crazy, and Plissken dashes
               toward one of the exits. He stops, sees...
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               
               With his portable radio, trying to get out of the arena, hiding
               behind a crowd of Dragons. Plissken races through the crowd, grabs
               Map To The Stars Eddie.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Hey, Snake, man... Great shot!
               
               Without hesitation, Snake whacks him across the jaw. Map To The
               Stars Eddie goes down like a sack of laundry. Plissken grabs him
               by the collar, drags him off toward an exit...
               

               EXT. FORUM PARKING LOT - NIGHT
               
               Cuervo Jones, Utopia, Xi-Ping and their men rush out to the
               caravan of waiting vehicles. Xi-Ping has his own armada of
               vehicles and an army of evil-looking guards. Cuervo Jones pulls
               Xi-Ping aside.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               That man in black. He's very dangerous.
               
               XI-PING
               One eye?
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Yes. We gotta dump him.
               
               XI-PING
               What does he want?
               
               CUERVO JONES
               (glances at the prototype)
               I'm betting the cops sent him in. Man, I
               do not need this. I got a war to win.
               
               ANOTHER EXIT - THE FORUM
               
               As Plissken drags Map To The Stars Eddie out into the night,
               crouches behind a row of cars, watches Cuervo Jones' caravan start
               their engines.
               
               Plissken shakes Map To The Stars Eddie, waking him...
               
               PLISSKEN
               Where are they going?
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               (groggy)
               Oh, man... You didn't have to hit me,
               Snake. I can help you.
               
               Plissken shoves the barrel of his pistol up against Map To The
               Stars Eddie's temple.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Bankrupt City. The Happy Kingdom.
               (beat)
               Snake, Cuervo's hooked up with Xi-Ping. He
               is primetime, man - Mister Bad News. The
               rest of the city's joining up with 'em.
               (beat)
               You're shit outta luck, Snake.
               
               Plissken reaches into a pocket, comes out with the large black
               clip, slips it on his 9mm pistol.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Not yet.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               I could've helped you. We coulda made a
               deal with Cuervo. If you'd listen...
               
               Without looking, Plissken slams his elbow into Map To The Stars
               Eddie's jaw with a WHACK! He flops unconscious on the pavement...
               
               Cuervo Jones' caravan led by that huge Cadillac on monster wheels,
               moves away from the Forum toward an exit. Plissken moves after
               them, ducking behind the row of cars...
               
               FORUM EXIST
               
               The caravan picks up speed as it approaches the exit...
               
               Plissken appears behind an old truck, just as the Cadillac moves
               past him. He crouches on the balls of his feet, and as the rear of
               the Caddy drifts closer, he springs...
               
               And grabs on to the rear bumper. The monster wheels spin like
               huge, black scythes on either side of him. Plissken reaches under
               the Caddy, finds a purchase on the undercarriage, and swings under
               the Cadillac. He hangs dangling above the street by one hand as
               the caravan pulls out onto Manchester. With the other he raises
               his 9mm and aims it at the undercarriage, right about where the
               front seat should be...
               
               BLAM, BLAM, BLAM, BLAM!
               

               INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT
               
               The front seat explodes, bullets screaming upward through the
               leather seats, tearing and shredding fabric and flesh, killing the
               driver and Xi-Ping instantly!
               
               In the back seat sit Cuervo Jones and Utopia. The Caddy begins to
               swerve, the wheel spinning. Cuervo Jones lunges forward across the
               seat and grabs it.
               
               Under the Cadillac, Plissken continues to fire: BLAM, BLAM, BLAM,
               BLAM!
               
               The front seat disintegrates. Metal, leather, padding fly
               everywhere. Cuervo Jones ducks against the door, covering his face
               with one hand, still grasping the wheel with the other.
               
               KAWHUMP!
               
               The entire front seat and floor underneath it fall down out of the
               Cadillac and hit the street below. The bodies of the driver and X-
               Ping flop under the monster wheels.
               
               Plissken swings over to the hole and pulls himself up into the
               opening that used to be the front seat. Cuervo Jones stares at him
               in total shock, but before he can speak...
               
               Plissken rips the prototype out of his hands! Then jumps into the
               back seat next to Utopia. Then grabs her and turns to the side
               door. Cuervo Jones releases the wheel for a moment, turns to grab
               Plissken...
               
               But Plissken opens the side door, kicks it wide, and with Utopia
               under his arm, slides across the seat...
               
               ... and sails out of the Cadillac...
               
               CUERVO JONES
               No!
               
               Plissken and Utopia fly through the air, and land with a thud on
               top of a Mescalito car as the Cadillac begins to swerve wildly.
               Cuervo Jones grabs the wheel, desperately tries to control the
               Caddy... but fails. The Cadillac careens off the street, slams
               into the palm tree, spins around and crashes into the remains of a
               hot dog stand.
               
               ON THE ROOF OF THE MESCALITO CAR
               
               Plissken and Utopia roll and tumble. He still has a hold of her,
               and she fights him tooth and nail...
               
               UTOPIA
               Lemme go...!
               
               INSIDE THE MESCALITO CAR
               
               The driver swerves, hits the brakes... and the car hops the curb,
               slides along the sidewalk, burning rubber.
               
               PLISSKEN AND UTOPIA
               
               Are thrown forward. They tumble off the roof... across the hood...
               and land on the sidewalk in front of the car. They roll to a stop,
               as the car screeches to a stop, inches from their heads, as the
               caravan suddenly puts on its brakes.
               
               Screaming tires. Cars jackknifing, spinning in a massive traffic
               collision...
               
               Cuervo Jones emerges from the remains of the Cadillac.
               
               Plissken drags Utopia into the street, grabs the lid of a manhole
               in the street, pries it up...
               
               Mescalitos pour out of their vehicles, as Cuervo Jones charges
               into the street, pointing at Plissken...
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Kill him, kill him...!
               
               Plissken lifts Utopia to her feel, hauls her over to the manhole
               opening, and dives inside... just as the Mescalitos open fire! The
               street around the manhole opening explodes with screaming hot
               lead...
               

               INT. SEWER TUNNEL - NIGHT
               
               Plissken and Utopia land in the half-filled storm drain. He gets
               to his feet, pulls her with him, and heads off sloshing through
               the water. The sound of gunfire echoes above them...
               

               EXT. MANCHESTER AVENUE
               
               Cuervo Jones and the Mescalitos charge the open manhole as Map To
               The Stars Eddie appears groggily shuffling up the street from the

               (grins to himself)
               Good thinkin', Snake.
               
               He heads off down the street...
               

               INT. SEWER TUNNEL
               
               Plissken and Utopia race along through the water. He literally has
               to drag her with him. They turn a corner, go down another slimy
               drain away from the main tunnel...
               

               INT. UNDERGROUND PASSAGE - NIGHT
               
               The black belly of the sewer system. Plissken and Utopia move
               along, slow as they come to...
               
               THE SHEER, PITCH-BLACK DROP OFF
               
               One side of the passage, the same one we saw earlier on our
               journey with Pendejo Bob.
               
               Plissken spins Utopia around, pushes her backward toward the drop-
               off, his eye burning into her...
               
               Her feet reach the very edge.
               
               Plissken holds her there. Utopia's face is a mask of sheer terror.
               She gulps air in staccato bursts...
               
               Beat. Beat.
               
               Plissken can't do it. He can't push her off.
               
               He releases her, backs up, looks at the prototype, then pulls one
               of his revolvers from its holster, cocks the hammer, aims...
               
               UTOPIA
               My... father sent you... didn't he?
               (beat)
               He sent you to kill me...
               
               Plissken raises the pistol. She's dead in his sights.
               
               UTOPIA
               Didn't he?
               (begins to cry)
               
               But Plissken can't. He can't kill her. The toughest man on planet
               Earth can't kill this 17-year-old runaway.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Shit.
               
               Plissken sags, clicks the hammer back, holsters the gun. He stares
               at her.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Get out of here.
               
               Utopia wipes her eyes, confused, afraid.
               
               PLISSKEN
               I said go!
               
               Slowly Utopia moves from the edge of the drop off, starts away
               down the tunnel, then stops, looks back at Plissken. She stares at
               the prototype in Plissken's hand...
               
               UTOPIA
               Don't take it back. Don't give it to him.
               Please. Let me have it.
               
               Plissken glances at the prototype, then at her.
               
               PLISSKEN
               What does this thing do?
               
               UTOPIA
               (her eyes grow wide)
               No!
               
               KABLAM!
               
               Plissken's shoulder explodes as a bullet tears through his flesh!
               He spins, drops the prototype...
               
               ... as Map To The Stars Eddie emerges from the darkness of the
               sewer tunnel. He holds a gun in one hand, aims...
               
               KABLAM!
               
               He fires again, hits Plissken's leg.
               
               Plissken staggers backward toward the edge of the drop off, as Map
               To The Stars Eddie moves quickly forward...
               
               ... and snatches the prototype from the wet floor.
               
               Plissken's gun hand is useless, numb from the shoulder wound. He
               slowly, painfully transfers the pistol to the other hand, tries to
               raise it...
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               So long, Snake.
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie takes aim - a head shot ...
               
               Plissken spins, and dives off the edge...
               
               ... down into the drop off...
               
               PLISSKEN'S BODY
               
               Airborne. Falling through black space. Down, down, down, straight
               to hell below, until we can't see him anymore as the darkness
               swallows him up...
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie steps to the ledge, looks down, as Cuervo
               Jones and his Mescalitos slog up through the tunnel.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Where is he?
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               He jumped. Down there.
               (beat)
               He's dead, Cuervo. I did it. I killed
               Plissken.
               
               Cuervo Jones looks over the edge, at the silent blackness below.
               Then he turns to Map To The Stars Eddie.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Give it to me.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               You said I could be Vice-President,
               Cuervo. Your right-hand man.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               (extends his hand)
               Give it.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Sure, Cuervo, but look here. I've done it
               all, man. I killed Plissken, I got your
               girl back, I got it all. Just for you,
               Cuervo. Just for you.
               
               Dead silence. Cuervo Jones stands with his hand extended. Finally
               Map To The Stars Eddie gives up, starts to hand Cuervo the
               prototype...
               
               ... but slips on the wet floor...
               
               ... and drops the prototype with a CLANK!
               
               CLOSE - PROTOTYPE
               
               A red light comes on, blinks urgently.
               
               PROTOTYPE VOICE
               (tiny, filtered)
               I am now armed and ready for use. Use
               extreme caution. The location of the
               effected blast area can only be determined
               by the orbital position of the SatStar
               Ring.
               
               Everyone in the tunnel is frozen, unable to move. Slowly Cuervo
               Jones picks up the prototype, stares at it, then breaks into a
               smile...
               
               CUERVO JONES
               This is turning out to be my lucky day.
               (stares coldly at Map To The
               Stars Eddie)
               Get this asshole outta here.
               
               Several Mescalitos grab Map To The Stars Eddie, pull him back
               along the tunnel.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Cuervo, wait. Please...
               
               Cuervo Jones turns to Utopia, who stands numbly staring off at the
               drop-off. He walks over to her, then slaps her hard, viciously,
               across the face.
               
               Utopia reacts to the stinging slap.
               
               UTOPIA
               Cuervo...?
               
               CUERVO JONES
               You're my woman, you understand? You don't
               let anybody take you away from me without
               a fight.
               
               UTOPIA
               I tried...
               
               CUERVO JONES
               (in her face)
               Nobody leaves Cuervo Jones. Not unless you
               give your life. You fight till you're
               dead. Then I forgive you.
               (screams)
               Understand?
               (shakes her)
               Understand?
               
               UTOPIA
               Yes...
               
               He shoves her down the tunnel...
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Let's go.
               
               The others follow them...
               

               EXT. MANCHESTER AVENUE - NIGHT
               
               As Cuervo Jones and Utopia emerge from the manhole cover, hear the
               sound of hundreds of helicopters rise.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               (looks up)
               Look, baby. They're all mine.
               
               POV - THE SKY
               
               Above Manchester and the Forum is filled with helicopters. All
               models, all makes, mostly the older, discarded military Blood
               Phoenix 14-bladed attack choppers that scream through the
               blackness like scythe-slashing robot bugs. They are on their way
               southeast, toward Orange County.
               

               EXT. SKY VIEW OF L.A. BY NIGHT
               
               Looking out at L.A. from above Mount Lee, see the Hollywood Sign,
               and wave after wave of helicopters thundering across the city.
               
               ANGLE ON THE TWIN TOWERS OF CENTURY CITY
               
               They're like buck teeth, sheered off and crumbling, stuck up in to
               the sky. Chopper roar overhead. A group of vagrants cluster around
               a camp fire on the top floor of one of the towers. They're
               watching a futuristic big-spin lotto on a large screen TV. The
               sound of the choppers brings them to the edge of the building -
               the walls of the floors beneath have been torn away. Desk,
               furniture, rugs, everything hangs out over the empty space.
               

               EXT. FIREBASE SEVEN - NIGHT
               
               Pandemonium. Troops, vehicles, helicopters, everything is in
               urgent motion. A loudspeaker voice blares:
               
               POLICE VOICE (V.O.)
               Full stage battle alert. All personnel to
               battle stations.
               

               INT. HALLWAY INTO COMMAND HQ - MAIN CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
               
               Malloy, the President and Brazen charge down a hallway into
               Command HQ. The place is jumping. Full scramble alert.
               
               MALLOY
               A sky full of enemy choppers on radar.
               Moving over the city to the southeast.
               
               A COM Officer rushes up to Malloy...
               
               COM OFFICER
               Commander - massive vehicle and troop
               movement on the ground. All major streets
               leading to the southeast.
               
               PRESIDENT
               What're they doing?
               
               Malloy looks at the President grimly.
               
               MALLOY
               Getting ready to invade.
               
               PRESIDENT
               (beat)
               So where's Plissken?
               
               DARKNESS
               
               Creaking. The WHOOSH of something swinging through the air...
               
               A huge blue eye opens. Looks around.
               
               DARKNESS
               
               Plissken's boot is hooked in a twisted wire mesh...
               
               DARKNESS
               
               And then Plissken swings like a pendulum, hanging from a long
               strand of wire mesh attached somewhere above in the blackness.
               
               Plissken's eye blinks.
               
               THE DARKNESS
               
               Begins to reveal details: slimy walls. Below, a black pit of hell.
               Wind gushing.
               
               And then a light stabs across the void...
               
               CLOSE - PLISSKEN
               
               ... The light hits Plissken's good eye...
               
               The light is from inside the eye of Pendejo Bob. He stands on a
               small ledge, at the mouth of a cave leading into the howling pit.
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               Hey, Snake. You okay?
               (unhooks the lariat)
               I heard gunfire down here...
               (begins to swing the rope)
               Never been down this far before...
               (swings the rope in a huge
               arc)
               Grab this.
               
               Pendejo Bob tosses the lariat. The noose flies across the pit, and
               Plissken grabs it with his good hand.
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               Now hang on.
               
               Plissken wraps his good hand and arm in the noose, as Pendejo Bob
               jerks the line hard. Plissken is in mid-swing, and the rope
               jerking pulls him abruptly in the opposite direction...
               
               Plissken's boot slips out of the wire mesh...
               
               And Plissken falls like a brick, stops abruptly as the line
               catches, and swings against the side of the pit. He dangles with
               only his one good arm holding on to the rope.
               
               Pendejo Bob pulls the line upward, straining against Plissken's
               weight. Slowly Plissken rises, a tug at a time, hauled up the edge
               of the pit toward the cave above...
               
               ... when suddenly he passes another opening, a storm drain below
               Pendejo Bob. He swings into the drain, grasps the side with his
               hand, and pulls himself in...
               
               Pendejo Bob stares down at his rope disappearing into the side of
               the pit.
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               Hey, Snake...where are you?
               
               Plissken crawls into the slimy drain, pulls the rope off of him.
               Ahead in the darkness is the rushing of water. He turns on weak
               legs, back toward the pit behind him. Bleeding. Numb in one hand.
               His leg on fire.
               
               PLISSKEN
               (yells)
               I'm in another opening... Storm drain...
               There may be another way up to you...
               
               Plissken crawls along the drain. The sound of rushing water gets
               louder.
               
               He comes to the edge of the drain. Right below him is another
               drain filled with water rushing through it like a river.
               
               Plissken is stuck. He turns, in great pain, and starts back toward
               the pit... when suddenly everything starts shaking. Booming. It's
               a small earthquake, a pre-shock.
               
               SNAP!
               
               Suddenly the concrete bottom on which he stands gives way, cracks,
               disintegrates...
               
               And Plissken falls backward into the rushing water, and is pulled
               suddenly downstream into the drain, disappearing from sight...
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               
               Stands silently above, listening...
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               Snake...
               (no reply)
               Snake!
               
               Booming. The whole pit shudders, shaking. Another earthquake.
               Pendejo Bob drops the rope, turns and dashes away down the
               vibrating storm drain...
               

               EXT. STORM DRAIN - WILSHIRE CANYON - NIGHT
               
               Black oil-slicked water rushes in the moonlight, out of a huge
               opening in what appears to be a canyon wall.
               
               CLOSE ON THE EDGE OF THE DRAIN
               
               As an arm shoots out, clutching the edges of the drain.
               
               PLISSKEN
               
               Emerges from the hole, slides out, tumbles down to a water-filled
               canyon bottom. He lies there for a moment, trying to focus his
               eye. Stabbing pain in his shoulder and leg. Finally he rises
               unsteadily to his feet, looks around, trying to get his bearings.
               He finds himself at the bottom of...
               
               THE WILSHIRE CANYON
               
               Straight down Wilshire Boulevard is an enormous canyon, a river
               bottom gouged out of concrete in the big earthquake. At least 30
               feet deep, it is a vast trough leading past skyscrapers and
               buildings above, off into the distance.
               
               Plissken warily glances at his watch: 1 hour 10 minutes to go.
               
               Suddenly Plissken is struck by a pair of headlights. Pipeline's
               dune buggy comes bumping along the canyon bottom, sloshing through
               water, pulling up next to Plissken.
               
               PIPELINE
               Snake. Saw you at the game tonight. Great
               shot.
               (stares at him)
               You look like shit.
               
               Plissken hobbles over to the dune buggy as Pipeline gets out.
               
               PIPELINE
               You feel those pre-shocks, Snake?
               
               Pipeline unties the various surfboards he has lashed to the rear
               of the buggy. He lifts one down and slings it under his arm.
               
               PIPELINE
               Could be a big one comin' any minute
               now...

               Where's... Cuervo Jones...?
               
               PIPELINE
               Long gone. You'll never catch up with him
               now, Snake.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Where?
               
               PIPELINE
               Anaheim. Headquarters for everything. The
               whole town's gonna be there. Things
               changin' fast around here, Snake. It's not
               the same as the old days, man.
               
               A thumping sound skyward. More choppers thunder over them, on
               their way southeast. Plissken grabs Pipeline with his good hand...
               
               PLISSKEN
               Take me there...
               
               But he's too weak. His hand slides off. Plissken sinks to his
               knees. Pipeline stares at him.
               
               PIPELINE
               You ain't doin' so good, Snake. You need
               help.
               (bends down, helps Plissken
               to his feet)
               You should talk to Hershe. She hates
               Cuervo. They used to be partners, but they
               split up.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Who?
               
               PIPELINE
               Hershe. She lives downtown with Mojo
               Dellasandro in the big boat. Down that
               way.
               
               Pipeline points down the canyon to the east.
               
               PIPELINE
               She's connected with the Black Cowboys,
               and they don't take shit from nobody...
               
               Suddenly that booming, shuddering rumble begins. The canyon starts
               to shake. The water in the canyon floor sloshes wildly.
               
               PIPELINE
               Yo', man. It's a big one.
               
               And the earthquake hits like a roaring sledgehammer. The walls of
               the canyon crack. Plissken and Pipeline are thrown to the ground.
               
               Skyscrapers above them on Wilshire rock and tremble in the quake.
               Pieces of the building sheer off, fall. A parking garage caves in.
               
               Thunder shakes the earth around Plissken and Pipeline. The canyon
               floor splits open. Water pours into the cracks. Huge boulder-sized
               chunks of concrete tumble down the canyon walls.
               
               And then suddenly it all stops.
               
               The booming subsides. The earth stops shaking. Plissken and
               Pipeline get to their feet, look around. The water around them
               continues to slosh about violently.

               Tsunami, Snake.
               
               His eyes wide, a smile on his face, Pipeline hurries over to the
               dune buggy, grabs another surfboard from the back, hands it to
               Plissken.

               Surf's up big time.
               
               Now there is another deep sound rising, coming from the west
               behind them: A bass roar that slowly climbs from the very bottom
               of the register upward, as if some massive wall of doom were on
               its way...
               
               Pipeline kneels, positions his surfboard in his hands.
               
               PIPELINE
               Get ready, Snake. It's gonna be some kinda
               ride.
               
               Plissken looks behind him...
               
               POV - THE FRONT EDGE OF THE TSUNAMI
               
               Is blasting down the Wilshire Canyon, coming right for them. It is
               a 25-foot wall of ocean water, moving fast, bellowing like a
               thunderclap.
               
               Plissken sees he can't climb out of the canyon in time, moves over
               to Pipeline, kneels down...
               
               PIPELINE
               Let the front edge pick you up. Don't get
               on your board till it peaks.
               
               Behind them, the tsunami slams along the canyon, coming right for
               them.
               
               PIPELINE
               Don't lose it, man. You slip off your
               board and it's the Big Wipeout, you know
               what I mean?
               
               The roaring is so loud it's like being on the inside of a cannon
               barrel. The tsunami is 100 feet away... 75 feet... 50 feet... 25
               feet... It rolls up right behind them...
               
               PIPELINE
               Hang on, Snake!

               YAAAAAAA!!!!
               
               THE FRONT EDGE
               
               Of the tsunami sweeps under them. Pipeline and Plissken push off
               from the canyon floor just as the water shovels them upward like a
               cow catcher on a train. The water sweeps them up until they
               disappear under the blackness...
               
               Until suddenly Pipeline pops up on top of the tsunami, riding on
               his surfboard, arms outstretched, feet braced.
               
               And then Plissken pops up beside him, surfing clumsily on top of
               the tsunami wave, kneeling on his surfboard.
               
               They blast down Wilshire Canyon at 80 miles an hour. Plissken is
               wobbly on the surfboard, but he manages to stay on top of the
               wave. Finally, he gets the hang of it, glances over at Pipeline,
               who grins from ear to ear.
               
               PIPELINE
               Awesome, Snake. AWESOME, man!
               
               Plissken looks up ahead...
               
               HIS POV - MOVING THROUGH WILSHIRE CANYON
               
               Five feet from street level. An old van speeds along what's left
               of Wilshire Boulevard, right on the canyon's edge. It veers around
               debris in the street, changes lanes suddenly, hell bent for
               leather.
               
               Plissken and Pipeline move closer and closer to the van as the
               tsunami sweeps them along.
               
               Now they move alongside the van and Plissken stares over...
               
               CLOSER - THE VAN
               
               Behind the wheel is Map To The Stars Eddie, driving like a
               lunatic, his teeth bared and set, madder than shit.
               
               Plissken's eye widens, burns.

               See you later.
               
               And suddenly Plissken shifts his weight, and the surfboard tips
               and slides sideways, across the surface of the tsunami all the way
               over to the edge, right next to the van. Map To The Stars Eddie
               glances to his left...
               
               HIS POV - PLISSKEN
               
               Is surfing the tsunami not 10 feet away from him.
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie stares in absolute horror. Plissken tips
               the board again, and slides another 5 feet closer...
               
               AS MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               
               Jams the pedal, and the van screams forward...
               
               AS PLISSKEN
               
               Stands up and leaps from the surfboard...
               
               For a moment he is airborne, leaping across the gap to the van...
               and slams into the side of the van. He grabs on to the roof, hangs
               on with one hand, his body whipping against the rocking, bucking
               side. Map To The Stars Eddie starts swerving, trying to throw
               Plissken off.
               

               EXT. VAN - WILSHIRE BOULEVARD
               
               The van shoots back and forth across Wilshire, Plissken dangling
               inches from the tsunami-filled canyon. Plissken pulls himself up
               and crawls onto the roof...
               
               INSIDE THE VAN
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie pulls his gun, cocks it...
               
               When suddenly Plissken's hand snakes down from the roof, reaches
               in the driver's window, grabs his hair, and slams his forehead
               into the steering wheel with a THOCK!
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie goes out like a light. He slumps over in
               the seat... but his foot is stuck on the accelerator.
               
               Plissken grabs the wheel with his left hand, and manages to steer
               the van from the roof. The van lurches wildly, hits a chunk of
               concrete in the street, skids, fishtailing violently from the
               impact. It smashes against the curb, screeches and bumps along
               concrete.
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie's foot is bumped right off the accelerator,
               and the van slows to a wobbling, grinding stop.
               
               Plissken slowly climbs down from the roof, opens the driver's
               door, shoves Map To The Stars Eddie out of the way, and jumps in.
               

               INT. VAN - NIGHT
               
               Plissken pulls out into the street and speeds off down Wilshire.
               Map To The Stars Eddie starts to come around.
               
               Plissken grabs his gun, cocks it, puts the barrel up against Map
               To The Stars Eddie's temple just as he comes to.
               
               PLISSKEN

               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               I couldn't help it, Snake. I had to shoot

               It's a brand new day comin' up this
               morning, and I'm just so proud to be
               leading the parade. See you soon, putos.
               
               SSSZZZ. The image blinks off into static.
               
               A grim silence.
               
               MALLOY
               The prototype appears to be armed, Mr.
               President.
               (the President nods grimly)
               Shall I begin evacuation?
               
               PRESIDENT
               Does he know how to activate it?
               
               MALLOY
               Well, yeah. All you have to do is push the
               button.
               
               BRAZEN
               What about Plissken? He could still be -
               
               PRESIDENT
               Forget him. He's dead.
               
               MALLOY
               That may not be true, Mr. President.
               (beat)
               He's one tough case. Plissken's been dead
               so many times I can't count. But he never
               stays down.
               
               A long beat.
               
               MALLOY
               There are two choices, Mr. President. Wait
               for Plissken, or surrender. It's your
               decision.
               
               The President sighs heavily.
               

               EXT. DOWNTOWN L.A. - NIGHT
               
               Jammed next to the remains of the Bonaventure Hotel is the Queen
               Mary, permanently dry-docked between the broken skyscrapers by the
               Big One.
               
               The van stops next to a huge hole in the side of the ship.
               

               INT. QUEEN MARY - NIGHT
               
               The glow of Map To The Stars Eddie's flashlight takes him and
               Plissken deeper and deeper into the hulking remains of the ship.
               

               INT. DECK OF SHOPS - NIGHT
               
               They walk through a dimly lighted area lined with shops. Their
               glass display windows are covered with layers of impenetrable
               dirt.
               

               INT. LONG CORRIDOR - NIGHT
               
               They enter a long, narrow corridor. At the end is a doorway. There
               is light in the room beyond.
               

               INT. VICTORIAN SWIMMING POOL - NIGHT
               
               Plissken and Map To The Stars Eddie enter a long room lit by gas
               jets on the walls. In it is a crumbling, Victorian swimming pool.
               A heavy mist rises from the pool's surface and hangs over
               everything.
               
               At the far end is a group of people. Spinal and the Black Cowboy
               Gang. Boots, spurs, dusters, and guns.
               
               Mojo Dellasandro. Jamaican Voodoo witch doctor. A brutal, scowling
               face. And a beautiful woman in a bathing suit, her back facing us.
               
               Plissken and Map To The Stars Eddie approach.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Hey, Hershe. How're you doin'?
               
               The woman turns and faces them. This is HERSHE, an absolutely
               drop-dead, gorgeous transvestite who looks completely convincing
               as a woman but talks in Isaac Hayes' voice.
               
               SPINAL
               (eyes brightening)
               Hershe - it's Snake Plissken.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Yeah, Hershe. I brought him to see you.
               
               Plissken walks right up to Hershe, has no reaction at all to the
               transvestite.
               
               PLISSKEN
               I need a favor.
               
               HERSHE
               What's in it for me?
               
               Plissken stares, a glimmer of recognition on his face.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Wait a minute. I know that voice.
               (beat)
               You're Carjack Malone.
               
               HERSHE
               Not anymore.
               
               SPINAL
               You two know each other?
               
               Plissken is seething. Hershe remains calm, glacial.
               
               PLISSKEN
               You owe me. You left me holdin' everything
               back there in Cleveland.
               
               SPINAL
               (astounded)
               Hershe, you were in Cleveland?
               
               PLISSKEN
               Yeah. With me and Texas Mike O'Shay.
               
               HERSHE
               I was called away on urgent business,
               Snake.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Don't lie to me.
               
               HERSHE
               All right, so I made another deal.
               
               PLISSKEN
               I got a new deal for you.
               
               Plissken raises Map To The Stars Eddie's gun, aims it right
               between Hershe's eyes.
               
               PLISSKEN
               You help me, you live.
               
               The others tense, hands on guns.
               
               SPINAL
               I wouldn't be doin' that, Snake.
               
               HERSHE
               We have a little arrangement. Anything
               happens to me, you're dead.
               
               PLISSKEN
               I'm already dead.
               
               HERSHE
               (long beat)
               I see your point. What's the favor?
               
               PLISSKEN
               (looks at his watch)
               Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the
               Kingdom. I got one hour.
               
               HERSHE
               Dream on, blue eye.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Say goodnight, Carjack.
               
               Plissken cocks his gun, starts to squeeze the trigger...
               
               HERSHE
               Wait a minute. All right. Hold on.
               
               SPINAL
               Cuervo Jones has more firepower than two
               armies. No one gets near him.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               And he's got the prototype. And the girl.
               He holds all the cards.
               
               HERSHE
               Exactly what is this prototype? What does
               it do?
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               You push the button, it sends a signal to
               a ring of space defense satellites.
               They're orbiting bombs. Nukes. They
               explode. Huge space burst.
               (beat)
               EMP. Electromagnetic Pulse. It happens
               instantly when a nuke is airburst. EMP
               shuts down every power source below the
               satellites - instantly. All electrical
               devices, computers, cars, airplanes,
               cities. It's the dark ages again.
               
               HERSHE
               So whoever has it runs the show.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               They were gonna use it on South America,
               Africa, Asia - any country hostile to the
               United States.
               
               SPINAL
               Only Cuervo's got it now.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               And that ring of satellites will be in
               position over the U.S. at 5:00 a.m. this
               morning.
               
               PLISSKEN
               How do you know all this?
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               I used to represent the guy who invented
               it. I swear to God, Snake. No bullshit.
               
               A long silence.
               
               HERSHE
               So what's the deal, gorgeous?
               
               PLISSKEN
               We get the girl and the prototype. And we
               get out.
               
               SPINAL
               All of us?
               
               PLISSKEN
               Yeah.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Me too?
               
               PLISSKEN
               (stares at him hard)
               We'll see.
               
               HERSHE
               Why should we leave? I love L.A. Where we
               gonna go? What's the payoff?
               
               SPINAL
               I'd like to get out but I don't have
               enough money.
               
               PLISSKEN
               The President's promised to give whoever
               helps me 1 million dollars.
               
               SPINAL
               Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of
               them.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Uh-uh. Bluebacks.
               
               This gets everyone's attention.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Aw, come on, Snake.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Bluebacks. I'm not bullshittin'. I swear
               to God.
               
               HERSHE
               I don't know, sounds thin to me.
               
               PLISSKEN
               You want to stay here, while Cuervo Jones
               rules the world?
               
               HERSHE
               (grim)
               No, that sucks.
               (beat)
               How are we getting out?
               
               PLISSKEN
               I don't know yet.
               
               SPINAL
               Shit.
               
               HERSHE
               You always were a loser, Plissken. Makin'
               things up as you go along. That's why I
               cut out on you in Cleveland. You're just a
               bum like the rest of us.
               
               Smoke has begun to drift into the pool area.
               
               MOJO DELLASANDRO
               (a soft voice)
               Use the air.
               
               They look at him.
               
               MOJO DELLASANDRO
               They're burning. Santa Anas. The night
               wind.
               
               SPINAL
               What're you talking about, Mojo?
               
               MOJO DELLASANDRO
               Death from above...
               

               EXT. QUEEN MARY - NIGHT
               
               Plissken, Hershe, Map To The Stars Eddie, Spinal and the Black
               Cowboy Gang stand on the top deck of the Queen Mary. Mojo
               Dellasandro straps each man into his own hang glider rig. The wind
               whips around them. The hillsides in the distance are on fire.
               
               They look like strange oversized moths lined up on the edge of the
               deck. The wind picks up Map To The Stars Eddie's rig. He bumps up
               and down, side to side, buffeted wildly until Mojo Dellasandro
               brings him back down to the decking.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               I don't know about this thing.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Don't like it, don't come.
               
               SPINAL
               Where'd you get these rigs, Carjack?
               
               HERSHE
               My name is Hershe Hernandez, do you
               understand, cowboy?
               
               As Mojo Dellasandro passes out various weapons to the men, Map To
               The Stars Eddie leans over to Plissken, their hang glider rigs
               thumping clumsily into each other. Eddie holds up that small,
               metal-plated portable radio he was carrying when we first met him.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               I got an idea, Snake.
               (shows Plissken the radio)
               This looks like the prototype, right?
               
               PLISSKEN
               Yeah, kinda.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               So maybe we can pull off a Texas switch on
               Cuervo.
               
               PLISSKEN
               If he lets you get close enough.
               
               HERSHE
               The wind's up. Let's go.
               
               The men brace themselves. Map To The Stars Eddie looks like he
               wants to die.
               
               Hershe looks over at Plissken and grins.
               
               HERSHE
               See you in hell, Snake.
               
               PLISSKEN
               If I'm late, Carjack, don't start without
               me.
               
               With that Plissken launches himself off the deck, sailing out over
               open space, then down toward the street...
               
               PLISSKEN
               
               Gliding through the air, as the wind picks him upward. He arcs
               away from the street level, up toward the remains of the downtown
               skyscrapers. Behind him, one after another, the group takes off
               into the wind, diving, rising with the wind.
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie makes a rapid suicidal dive right down
               toward the pavement below. He screams like a madman until the wind
               lifts him at the last possible second.
               

               EXT. TOPS OF SKYSCRAPERS - NIGHT
               
               The group of hang gliders sweep past the buildings. A bracero
               family is having dinner by candlelight two feet from the edge of a
               sheer precipice, as the side of the skyscraper they live in has
               been torn off. They wave to Plissken as he passes.
               
               Two floors down, someone has hooked up huge speakers and a
               croaking male voice is singing a Barbra Streisand hit to a
               background track.
               
               A beautiful girl in a sheer diaphanous gown dances far out on a
               narrow girder, waving a scarf at the moon.
               
               Plissken and the others now fly in formation, like avenging bats
               through the night, except for Map To The Stars Eddie who keeps
               rising and plunging violently, barely in control.
               

               EXT. DISNEYLAND - NIGHT
               
               An army of vehicles and people pour into Disneyland - but it's a
               Disneyland gone to hell. A huge sign reads: "THE HAPPY KINGDOM"
               
               The gates no longer exist. The overhead tram lies broken on the
               ground. Slowly vehicles drive straight inside...
               
               A battered old limousine carries Cuervo Jones and a grim-looking
               Utopia past the ruins of the train and around the ghost-town
               square of Main Street. Ahead is the fairy castle, broken and
               crumbling, like some relic from a nightmare. Around it are the
               thrill rides, tossed in to a jumbled mass by the force of the
               original earthquake.
               
               Crowds are waiting. Gangs of every conceivable description. Ethic
               gangs. Female gangs. Gangs of children. Also families with
               hangers-on. As soon as the limousine appears, the crowds begin
               cheering.
               

               INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT
               
               Cuervo Jones stares out at the masses.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               They're simple people. They love a party.
               (turns to Utopia)
               We're gonna throw them one hell of a party
               when we get to America. Right?
               
               Utopia is silent, sullen. Cuervo raises his hand to her and she
               jumps, cowering.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Put a smile on your face.
               
               A terrified smile spreads across Utopia's face.
               

               EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT
               
               As the limousine inches down Main Street, suddenly a wall of
               headlights pop on. 100 or so battered old vintage Chevys rev their
               engines, begin bouncing up and down wildly on hydraulic lifts.
               Gangs begin cheering, firing their weapons into the air like New
               Year's Eve.
               
               At the end of Main Street is a huge open area - almost an arena,
               beyond which are parked a literal army of helicopters.
               
               As the limousine stops, and Cuervo Jones emerges, Utopia on his
               arm, the cheering begins, a wall of sound through the park. Three
               Black Muslims step out to greet Cuervo, dressed in turban-like
               headgear and sunglasses, wearing black capes and carrying old
               Thompson machine guns. They stop, give the right-handed power
               salute. One of them, BIVOUAC, speaks to Cuervo.
               
               BIVOUAC
               Cuervo Jones. Welcome, my Brother.
               
               Cuervo Jones turns to the crowd, extends his arms.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Are you ready for the New World?
               
               And the loudest, longest cheer you've ever heard goes up.
               

               EXT. SKIES ABOVE DISNEYLAND - NIGHT
               
               Plissken and the group sail through the sky like silent avenging
               angels toward Disneyland below them and several miles away.
               
               PLISSKEN
               
               Glances at his wrist watch. Only 20 minutes left. Map To The Stars
               Eddie swings wildly over in his direction, manages to stabilize
               his glider for a few moments.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Is that what I think it is?
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Yeah. The place kept changing owners.
               Finally went bankrupt. That thing in Paris
               killed 'em.
               
               Hershe and Spinal sweep over next to Plissken and fly in close
               formation.
               
               HERSHE
               Snake. We need some kind of diversion.
               
               A beat later all of them look over at Map To The Stars Eddie.
               

               EXT. MAIN STREET - THE ARENA - NIGHT
               
               Cuervo Jones leads Utopia toward a large attack helicopter out in
               front of all the others. The choppers are all starting up,
               roaring, blades turning.
               
               Suddenly shooting down out of the sky is a screaming, yelling, Map
               To The Stars Eddie diving out of control, eyes wide as he passes
               Cuervo Jones and Utopia.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Cuervo. Hey, man, I made it! I made it!
               Wait for me...
               
               KAWHUMP!
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie crash lands into the ruins of a fast food
               restaurant - KACRUNCH!
               
               A beat or so later he staggers out of the rig, dizzy and confused.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Hey Cuervo...
               
               Cuervo Jones turns to Bivouac.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Would you please kill him for me?
               
               BIVOUAC
               My pleasure.
               
               Bivouac raises his machine gun...
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Cuervo, wait! I got news. There's about to
               be an attack.
               
               Cuervo holds up his hand, stopping Bivouac. Everyone tenses. Map
               To The Stars Eddie races over...
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               You're about to get hit, Cuervo. It's
               Plissken.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               You told me he was dead.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               I thought he was, but he came back.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Where?
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie moves close to Cuervo, out of breath,
               looking like he may faint...
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Oh Cuervo...
               
               CUERVO JONES
               (long beat)
               What?
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               (stalling)
               It's so good to see you again.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Where's Plissken?
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               He's... near.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               You're stalling, Eddie.
               (grabs him)
               Talk, you little gringo!
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               (eyes wide)
               Cuervo, look out behind you!
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie suddenly grabs Cuervo as if to protect him,
               and manages to wrap himself around the prototype in Cuervo's hand.
               At the same moment Bivouac and the Black Muslim open fire on an
               old storefront behind Cuervo Jones. The place is shredded.
               
               Cuervo Jones pulls Map To The Stars Eddie up off the ground, and
               grabs what looks like the prototype out of his clutches.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               You've lied to me for the very last time.
               
               Cuervo Jones pulls out a pistol, cocks it, aims at Map To The
               Stars Eddie's face...
               
               KABLOOM! No, not the pistol. A huge explosion rocks Main Street.
               
               WHOOSH! Suddenly out of the night sky Spinal and the Black Cowboys
               dive right down across Main Street.
               
               KABLAM! Another explosion sends everyone scurrying for cover.
               
               Spinal pulls the pin on a grenade, throws it...
               
               BLAMM! BLOOM! Explosions erupt everywhere!
               
               Cuervo Jones grabs Utopia, turns to run toward to the lead
               helicopter when...
               
               Plissken roars down out of the sky and his him full force. Cuervo,
               Plissken and the hang glider go tumbling and crashing in a heap.
               
               SERIES OF FAST CUTS:
               
               Chaos and pandemonium. Hershe dives down over the gangs, ripping
               hellfire from his automatic rifle.
               
               People running. Explosions.
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie grabs Utopia.
               
               Plissken and Cuervo Jones get to their feet and have at it!
               
               Through flames and running people Plissken and Cuervo battle.
               
               In Cuervo's hand is a long black knife. Just as he's plunging it,
               Plissken steps aside and grabs him. Locked together, they battle
               savagely.
               
               The knife cuts Plissken's chest.
               
               Cuervo moves for Plissken's throat.
               
               Plissken smashes him in the face.
               
               They both grip the knife in a deadlock.
               
               From above, Spinal dives down and hurls a grenade. Cuervo and
               Plissken disappear in a huge flash of fire and smoke as the
               grenade erupts out of the pavement nearby.
               
               When the smoke clears, three things are on the ground. Plissken.
               Cuervo Jones. The prototype.
               
               Instantly Plissken and Cuervo dive for the prototype. Plissken has
               it, kicks Cuervo in the face, drags himself to his feet and takes
               off running (as fast as a man can run with one bullet in his leg)
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie drags Utopia toward the lead helicopter, as
               Hershe comes in for a landing.
               
               Spinal comes in for a landing, continues to throw grenades. The
               other Black Cowboys land, provide covering fire.
               
               Plissken races for the chopper. Behind him, Cuervo Jones is on his
               feet and in pursuit.
               
               Hershe opens fire at Cuervo. Cuervo dives behind a smoking,
               burning Chevy.
               

               INT. HELICOPTER COCKPIT
               
               As everyone scrambles in. A Black Cowboy is hit by gunfire, slides
               down the bulkhead and out the door.
               
               Plissken jumps in the left seat, takes the controls. Utopia and
               Map To The Stars Eddie both climb in the right seat together. The
               others are in the back, firing back at the gangs. Plissken pulls
               in power.
               
               CLOSE - ROTOR R.P.M. GAUGE

               EXT. LEAD HELICOPTER
               
               The lead chopper shudders, trying to get off the ground. Gunfire
               continues.
               

               INT. HELICOPTER
               
               The ship shakes violently.
               
               PLISSKEN
               She's overloaded! We're too heavy.
               
               HERSHE
               (screams from the rear
               compartment)
               Somebody get off!
               
               SPINAL
               (glares at him)
               Who?
               
               All eyes quickly move to Map To The Stars Eddie...
               
               KABLAM!
               
               Bullets rip through the windscreen.
               
               POV - AN ARMY OF GANGS
               
               Is moving, through the smoke, charging the ship!
               

               INT. LEAD HELICOPTER
               
               The ship trembles. Plissken moves his feet, jams in the left tail-
               rotor pedal all the way.
               

               EXT. THE LEAD HELICOPTER
               
               Rotates, turns around 180 degrees on the ground, pushed by the
               tail rotor force.
               
               THE CYCLIC CONTROL
               
               As Plissken inches it forward...
               
               THE HELICOPTER
               
               Begins sliding across the ground, skids grinding along the
               pavement, sparks flying - slowly at first, now picking up speed...
               
               In the cockpit, the ship lurches and jumps and slams! Everyone is
               bounced around.
               
               The helicopter moves fast now - faster -
               
               LOW ANGLE ON THE SKIDS
               
               As they rise up, an inch off the ground - then two inches - then a
               foot -
               
               Cuervo Jones emerges from the smoke, running ahead of the other
               gangs, barreling toward the ever-so-slowly rising chopper...
               
               THE LEAD HELICOPTER
               
               As it lifts - five feet - climbing...
               
               The helicopter pulls away from the charging gangs and Cuervo's
               sprinting figure.
               
               POV THROUGH WINDSCREEN
               
               See the Matterhorn ahead, coming closer and closer. Hershe leans
               out the door.
               
               HERSHE
               We're not gonna make it over the fuckin'
               mountain!
               
               The helicopter moves right toward the edge of the Matterhorn, 15
               feet... 10... Plissken tries to maneuver out of the way... 8
               feet... 5...
               
               The helicopter wobbles over the top of the mountain, the right
               skid catching on the Matterhorn's edge! A horrible cracking sound,
               and the right skid is ripped off from its front mounting, hanging
               half off the ship!
               
               On the ground, Cuervo Jones jumps into one of the waiting
               helicopters as now the gangs race into ships and begin lifting off
               into the sky. Finally Cuervo's chopper lifts off...
               

               EXT. FIREBASE SEVEN - NIGHT
               
               An alarm horn sounds. Everyone is on the move.
               

               INT. MAIN CONTROL ROOM - COMMAND HQ - NIGHT
               
               A crowd surrounds a computer screen with a small green blip moving
               over a grid of L.A.
               
               COM OFFICER
               Aircraft leaving the island, sir. It's
               passed into restricted space, heading this
               way.
               
               Malloy, the President, and Brazen exchange glances.
               
               PRESIDENT
               Is it Plissken?
               
               Nobody knows.
               
               COM OFFICER
               Commander, I'm getting radio contact with
               the aircraft.
               
               MALLOY
               Boost it.
               
               The COM Officer flips a switch, and we hear Plissken's voice
               booming through HQ.
               
               PLISSKEN (V.O.)
               Get ready, shitheads. We're comin' in.
               
               PRESIDENT
               Thank God.
               
               MALLOY
               (grabs a radio mike)
               Plissken - this is Malloy. Do you have the
               prototype?
               

               INT. LEAD HELICOPTER - NIGHT
               
               PLISSKEN
               (into his radio)
               Yeah, I got it.
               
               Plissken glances at the transistor radio in his hand, shoves it in
               his boot, reaches his hand out to Map To The Stars Eddie.
               
               PLISSKE
               (to Map To The Stars Eddie)
               Now give me the real one.
               
               Utopia stares into Plissken's eye.
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie shrugs innocently
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               I couldn't make the switch, Snake. I don't
               have it.
               
               Suddenly Utopia reaches into Map To The Stars Eddie's coat and
               pulls out the real prototype. She hands it to Plissken
               
               UTOPIA
               Now we're even, Snake.
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie makes a lunge for it, but Plissken whacks
               him in the face. His head bobs slowly back and forth for a moment,
               then he slumps in the seat.

               COM OFFICER
               Commander Malloy - he's got lots of
               company.
               
               Malloy and the others look at the computer screen. Plissken's
               green blip is followed by hundreds of other green blips all
               rapidly closing in on him...
               
               MALLOY
               Battle stations...

               PLISSKEN
               I think we've burned off enough fuel. We
               may be lighter enough to hover. Just
               barely.
               
               HERSHE
               Can you land?
               
               PLISSKEN
               No. The right skid's broken. If I try to
               set it down she'll crash. I have to stay
               in a hoverwhile you jump off.
               (beat as Plissken looks at
               Utopia)
               Hey, Carjack. We gotta hide the girl. Give
               her your dress.
               
               HERSHE
               (ice cold)
               My name is no longer Carjack. Will you
               please get that through your fucking head?
               
               SPINAL
               Holy shit.
               
               They look, as suddenly the night sky on either side of them is
               filled with gang helicopters!
               

               EXT. SKY OVER THE SAN FERNANDO SEA - NIGHT
               
               The lead helicopter is surrounded by enemy choppers. Above, below,
               on either side.
               
               Right next to Plissken, Cuervo's chopper pulls up just ten feet
               away. Cuervo grins out at Plissken evilly, unhooks himself from
               his seat...
               
               On the other side, another chopper with Bivouac and the Black
               Muslims pull up. In the rear compartment, a Black Muslim aims what
               looks like a huge harpoon gun mounted to the floor.
               
               KAWHAM!
               
               The line shoots out and a gleaming grappling hook slams into the
               side of Plissken's chopper, the prongs clawing in, holding. In the
               lead helicopter, the Black Cowboys, Spinal and Hershe aim their
               weapons.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Don't shoot! They can drag us down into
               the sea.
               
               Cuervo Jones leaps from the opened door of his chopper, flies
               through space, lands on Plissken's door with a WHUMP! He smashes
               through the side window and grabs Plissken.
               
               KABLAM! KABLAM! Gang choppers open fire, riddling the rear
               compartment with bullets. Spinal and several Black Cowboys are
               hit!
               
               Plissken fights Cuervo through the door.
               
               PLISSKEN
               (to Utopia)
               Take the controls!
               
               Utopia stares at him.
               
               UTOPIA
               What do I do?
               
               But Cuervo wrenches the door open, grabs Plissken, and pulls him
               out of the seat. Utopia grabs the controls.
               
               The lead helicopter goes wild, lurching and swinging and dropping.
               Plissken and Cuervo are locked in a death grip, hanging on to the
               doorway, one foot in, one foot out.
               
               Plissken embraces Cuervo and throws them both over the edge...
               
               They fall through space, locked together, until...
               
               WHAP! They are jolted to a dead stop, swinging in mid-air,
               Plissken's arm wrapped around the dangling right skid.
               
               The lead helicopter bucks and spins and swings, Plissken and
               Cuervo suspended below, struggling to the death, whipped back and
               forth by the helicopter's gyrations.
               
               In the cockpit, Utopia grabs the controls. The ship is shaking,
               swinging like a pendulum. Hershe is hit with gunfire, flops in the
               rear compartment. Map To The Stars Eddie slowly regains
               consciousness, stares in horror at Utopia.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Where's Plissken?
               
               Outside, Cuervo clutches Plissken around the neck, struggling and
               thrashing. Plissken head butts him, dazing him for a second...
               
               KA-CRACK! The dangling skid is breaking loose from its mounting on
               the helicopter above. Plissken and Cuervo Jones stare up, then at
               each other, then both begin pulling themselves up the skid,
               climbing hand over hand, in a desperate race...
               
               Both men reach the bottom of the helicopter and leap across to the
               left skid as the dangling right skid breaks off and falls into the
               San Fernando Sea. Plissken and Cuervo kick at each other. Plissken
               slides away from him, looks up... sees the grappling hook stuck
               into the side of the helicopter...
               
               Plissken swings up, straddling the skid. He reaches up and begins
               prying loose the grappling hook. Cuervo's coming right up behind
               him, reaching for him, a huge knife in his hands. He raises the
               knife - when Map To The Stars Eddie leans out of the cockpit door,
               lowers a gun and aims it right at Cuervo.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Hey, Cuervo.
               
               Cuervo looks at him, starts to say something, eyes bulging...
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               If you get to America - let's do lunch.
               
               KABLAM! KABLAM! The shots hit, and Cuervo buckles, falls backwards
               off the skid, plunging downward toward the surface of the San
               Fernando Sea... KASPLASH!
               
               Plissken rips out the grappling hook...
               
               AS BOOM!
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie is hit with gunfire, dies, falls out of the
               seat, out of the door, out of the helicopter - plunges to the
               water below.
               
               Plissken jumps back inside the cockpit.
               
               UTOPIA
               Snake, look.
               
               POV THROUGH WINDSCREEN
               
               Police battle helicopters thunder toward them. In unison, the
               police helicopters launch their missiles from gun platforms.
               Burning, white-sulfurous napalm shells streak across the darkness
               and hit enemy choppers. The sky around the lead helicopter is
               filled with explosions, waves of rolling fire, falling flaming
               wrecks plunging past, as enemy choppers begin to hit the water.
               
               It is a dreamlike, slow-motion ballet. Huge black police gun ships
               circle lazily around the enemy choppers, their flex-guns and
               rockets spitting blue-white fire. The pound the living hell out of
               the enemy choppers. In f.g. Plissken's helicopter sweeps over the
               wall.
               

               EXT. ROTOR CITY - NIGHT
               
               Malloy, the President, Brazen and the rest the Firebase watch as
               Plissken's helicopter approaches, then zooms right over Rotor City
               and heads for the distant treeline.
               
               PRESIDENT
               Where the hell is he going?
               

               EXT. SMALL CLEARING - NIGHT
               
               Plissken's helicopter comes in, lower and lower, into a hover five
               feet above the ground. Inside, Plissken pulls in all the power
               he's got.
               
               PLISSKEN
               It's taking all the power we've got to
               hover.
               
               CLOSE - ROTOR R.P.M. GAUGE
               
               Shows 100% plus power. The helicopter is in a trembling hover.
               Inside...
               
               PLISSKEN
               Jump out. Head for the treeline and
               disappear.
               
               Utopia stares at him.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Go!
               
               Utopia jumps out of the helicopter... lands on the ground and
               takes off running into the darkness. Inside...
               
               PLISSKEN
               All right, baby. Don't be too rough on me.
               We're gonna land.
               
               Plissken slowly drops the collective control. The left skid sets
               down, and the ship continues to descend, tips, begins to roll.
               Inside, as the chopper rolls over, Plissken braces himself. As the
               blades hit the ground, the chopper goes wild. The fuselage jumps
               and twists in a grinding fury. Smoke and debris fly. The blades
               snap off...
               
               FROM BEHIND PLISSKEN - INSIDE
               
               Looking out the front, the blades smash through the windscreen,
               barely missing the top of Plissken's head. Plissken is splattered
               with glass, a piece of metal debris protrudes from the fleshy part
               of his biceps. Blood pours. The rear compartment explodes into
               flames as the engine grinds into the gas tank. Fire billows into
               the cockpit, engulfing Plissken...
               
               Outside, Plissken pulls himself out of the door. He is on fire.
               Dives away from the copper and rolls across the ground just as the
               flaming mid-section of the ship explodes in a roaring fireball.
               
               Plissken climbs to his feet, smoking, wounded...
               
               ... as Malloy, the President, Brazen, and a squad of police arrive
               in vehicles. They slowly get out...
               
               ... as Plissken limps toward them...
               
               PLISSKEN
               Where's the anti-toxin...?
               
               PRESIDENT
               Give me the prototype.
               
               Plissken reaches into his boot, hands it to the President.
               
               MALLOY
               Hold it, Plissken. Now give us the real
               one.
               
               Plissken reaches down into his other boot, comes out with Map To
               The Stars Eddie's transistor radio. The President hurls the real
               prototype away, walks to Plissken and grabs the phony. Plissken
               glances at it lying on the ground.
               
               Nobody moves. Plissken looks at their faces.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Give me the goddamn shot!
               
               Suddenly everyone begins to smirk. A couple cops laugh.
               
               MALLOY
               It was all a fake, Plissken.
               
               Plissken stares at him. More laughter.
               
               BRAZEN
               You were injected with glucose. There is
               no Plutoxin 7 virus. You were never going
               to die - at least not from anything we
               gave you.
               
               MALLOY
               C'mon, Snake - it's L.A. Everything's
               phony, you know that.
               
               Plissken moves toward the President, stops inches away.
               
               MALLOY
               Relax, war hero. We took you for a ride,
               and you came through. Not bad for a
               dirtbag like you.
               
               PRESIDENT
               You're free, Plissken. But if you even so
               much as break wind on a country road I'll
               crush you like a bug.
               
               The President glares at Plissken, turns, walks away.
               
               COP (O.S.)
               Commander...
               (Malloy looks at him)
               Look what we found.
               
               Across the clearing come two policemen dragging Utopia along with
               them. They bring her up in front of Malloy. Utopia glances at
               Plissken.
               
               MALLOY
               You didn't finish the mission, Plissken.
               We'll have to do that for you.
               
               Plissken, Malloy and Brazen watch as Utopia is taken away. Finally
               Plissken turns to Malloy.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Got a smoke?
               
               MALLOY
               You're gonna have to learn to respect the
               law, Snake. The United States is a no-
               smoking nation. No smoking, no drinking,
               do drugs, no women unless you're married,
               no guns, no foul language. It's a brand
               new day for you, Snake.
               
               PLISSKEN
               The name's Plissken.
               
               Plissken walks away. Follow his feet as they stop next to the
               prototype lying in the grass...
               

               INT. STEEL-WALLED HALLWAY - DEPORTATION CENTER - NIGHT
               
               Utopia is being strapped into an electric chair by her police
               guards. The guards step back from Utopia. One of them walks over
               to a huge switch on the wall.
               

               EXT. FIREBASE SEVEN - DAWN
               
               TRACKING SHOT WITH PLISSKEN
               
               He holds the real prototype, calmly pushes the button.
               

               EXT. SPACE - DAWN
               
               The ring of space satellites hover silently above the Earth. See
               the United States, North America below, as a beautiful sunrise is
               beginning.
               
               Suddenly the satellites explode into white...
               

               EXT. FIREBASE SEVEN - DAWN
               
               As the sky is lit white. Malloy, Brazen, and the cops look up. All
               vehicles stop. Lights out. Sounds of motors running down.
               

               INT. STEEL-WALLED HALLWAY - DEPORTATION CENTER - DAWN
               
               Darkness. No power. Everyone looks around. Utopia smiles.
               

               EXT. FIREBASE SEVEN - DAWN
               
               The daylight is coming as police helicopters fall from the sky,
               crashing. Panic. Policemen run everywhere. A duty sergeant races
               up to Malloy...
               
               DUTY SERGEANT
               We're being attacked, Commander. The north
               wall.
               

               EXT. WALL - DAWN
               
               All of L.A. has arrive at the wall in boats. Gangs lean ladders,
               use ropes and hooks - they scale the wall. Pendejo Bob leads the
               charge. Pipeline is right behind him.
               

               EXT. TOP OF THE WALL - DAWN
               
               Gunfire. A pitched battle as cops try to repel the horde of L.A.
               invaders as they pour over the wall.
               

               EXT. FIREBASE SEVEN - DAWN
               
               The Firebase is overrun by invaders. Hand-to-hand combat. World
               War III has begun. Panicked cops race for the trees, abandoning
               their positions.
               

               INT. STEEL-WALLED HALLWAY - DEPORTATION CENTER
               
               The Third World warriors free Utopia from the electric chair. She
               joins them as they swarm through the halls...
               

               EXT. HILLSIDE - FIREBASE SEVEN - DAWN
               
               Plissken is at the edge of the Firebase, moving out into the
               hillside. Camera tracks with him towards the rising sun.
               
               A smile crosses Plissken's face. He tosses the prototype down a
               ravine, and walks away into the sunrise.
               
               FADE OUT
               
               THE END

FADE OUT 1997

EXT. STATUE OF LIBERTY SECURITY CONTROL -- NIGHT.
A Jeep pulls up outside the base.  It comes to a stop and the driver
pulls out a walkie-talkie.

DRIVER
This is Gotham 4, North Bay, Station 17.  I have an escape in progress.
An object in mid-bay moving toward the wall.

TILT UP -- WALL
EXT. CLOSE UP -- SIGN "New York Maximum Security Penitentiary Manhattan
Island"

CONTINUED TILT UP -- EXT. WALL -- NIGHT
Two guards watch for the escapees in question.

EXT. MANHATTAN ISLAND -- NIGHT
A helicopter flies over the bay towards Manhattan Island.

EXT. BOAT -- NIGHT
The two escapees paddle, trying to get across the bay.

EXT. HELICOPTER -- NIGHT
The search light WHITES OUT THE SCREEN

EXT. BOAT -- NIGHT
The two escapees continue paddling.  THEY'VE BEEN CAUGHT.

HELICOPTER PILOT
You have 10 seconds.  Turn around.  Start back to the island.

INT. HELICOPTER -- NIGHT
The pilot targets the boat on a computer screen in front of him.

EXT. BOAT -- NIGHT
Two shots are fired directly in front of the escapees as a warning.
They ignore them and continue paddling away from the island.

INT. HELICOPTER -- NIGHT
EXT. CLOSE UP -- PILOT'S HAND
The pilot FIRES AGAIN.

EXT. BOAT -- NIGHT
The boat EXPLODES.

EXT. HELICOPTER -- NIGHT
Following the helicopter as it returns to the base.

EXT. BASE -- NIGHT
Rehme walks back to the main base, pulling out his walkie-talkie on the
way.

REHME
Gotham 4, confirm the kill.

HELICOPTER PILOT
Circled the base.  Over.

REHME
Security, this is Rehme.  We have confirmation from Gotham 4.  We have a
kill in midharbor.  South of the battery.  Two in the water dead.

SECURITY
Two confirmed.

REHME
Very well.

EXT. BASE -- NIGHT
Rehme walks into a building labeled "LIBERTY ISLAND SECURITY CONTROL and
picks up a phone.

REHME
Air traffic, this is Rehme . . .

EXT. AIR TRAFFIC -- NIGHT
The helicopter lands.  In the background, a BUS FULL OF PRISONERS comes
up.

EXT. BUS -- NIGHT
S.D. "SNAKE" PLISSKEN gets off the bus, looks around, and is escorted by
three guards into the base.  He looks like the essence of cool.  His
hair is long, wavy, and ratty, he lost his left eye somewhere along the
line, and he's got a two-day beard thing going on.  He's wearing a black
spandex/kevlar type shirt with zippers across the shoulders, and a pair
of camouflage pants with lots of pockets.  His jacket is a brown leather
jacket that has seen far better days, and he's wearing a pair of
handcuffs that have, instead of the links we're used to, a straight
metal bar between them.  He's not resisting anything, but the police are
not taking any chances.

INT. BASE -- NIGHT
Plissken and the guards follow a winding stairway down to the main
floor.

VOICE
Attention.  You are now entering the debarkation area.  No talking.  No
smoking.   The next scheduled departure to the prison is in two hours.
You now have the option to terminate and be cremated on the premises.
If you elect this option, notify the duty sergeant in your processing
area.

INT. BASE -- NIGHT
EXT. CLOSE UP ON SIGN -- "No talking.  No smoking.  Follow the ORANGE
line."
EXT. CLOSE UP ON SNAKE.  He is not impressed.
STEADICAM VIEW OF THE HALL, SNAKE'S P.O.V. Guards, guards, more guards.
Who cares.

As Snake rounds the corner:

O.S. GUARD
Hold it.

Snake stops, turns, directs an impertinent glance at the speaker.  He's
still not impressed by any of this.

FADE OUT.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
FADE IN.
EXT. BASE -- NIGHT
Rehme waits as a limo pulls up.  Out steps BOB HAUK.

REHME
We've got a small jet in trouble, over restricted air space.

HAUK
Where is it?

REHME
Seven miles out and closing.

The two of them walk AWAY.

INT. BASE -- NIGHT
Hauk and Rehme walk down the stairs.  They turn TOWARD US and walk into
the AIR TRAFFIC ROOM.  Dozens of men sit in front of radar transmission
screens, wearing headsets and working.   Following Hauk and Rehme into
the room:

INT. AIR TRAFFIC ROOM -- NIGHT

REHME
We've been on the board for the last twenty minutes.  We haven't been
able to reach them.  There was a transmission ten minutes ago.  He
identified as "David 14."  Then all of a sudden he was cut off.

Hauk and Rehme stand behind a CONTROLLER.

CONTROLLER
David 14, acknowledge.  David 14, we are sending Air Rescue.  Squawk
7700, contact on 121.5.
(to Hauk and Rehme)
There's still no reply.
(to his headset)
Bayonne.  I have a mayday in restricted space.

O.S. CONTROLLER
New York, I have it.

Hauk pulls Rehme aside.

HAUK
Who is it?

REHME
I don't know.

HAUK
You have the code?

REHME
There's no David 14 on the computer.

HAUK
Unlisted?

REHME
Unregistered code.  We telexed Washington.  Still waiting for a reply.

CONTROLLER
I think I've got him, sir.

Hauk and Rehme walk back over to the controller.  He patches a voice-
over through.

REBEL VOICE
It's too late, assholes.  All your imperialist weapons and lies can't
save him now.  We're going down.  We're going to crash.

CONTROLLER
David 14, acknowledge!

CODEMAN
The code's coming in, sir.

Hauk and Rehme dash over to the codeman.  He shows them a display.
"Aircraft Identified.  Code: David14.  Decode: AIR FORCE ONE."

"Air Force One" blinks as Hauk and Rehme look at each other in shock.

EXT. PLANE -- NIGHT
The plane is flying over New York.

INT. COCKPIT -- NIGHT
The REBEL has killed the pilot and copilot and is working on her own.

REBEL
Tell this to the workers when they ask where your leader went . . .

She pulls out a slip of PAPER and proceeds to read.

REBEL
We, the soldiers of the national liberation front of America, in the
name of the workers and all the oppressed of this imperialist country
have struck a fatal blow to the racist police stick!

INT. PLANE -- NIGHT
A secret service AGENT taps on the door with his rifle as the rebel
continues.

REBEL
What better revolutionary example than to let the president perish in
the inhuman dungeon of his own imperialist prison?

The agent runs back down the plane to the President and his advisers.

AGENT
(to 2ND AGENT)
Unlock the pod!

2ND AGENT immediately runs off.

PAN LEFT TO PRESIDENT.

AGENT
She's bolted the door.

PRESIDENT
Can't you shoot off the lock?

AGENT
No, sir, she's pressurized the cabin.

PRESIDENT
How about lifting the door off of the hinges?

AGENT
No, sir.

EXT. CLOSE UP -- The President's wrist as he handcuffs his briefcase to
it.

PRESIDENT
Get me to the pod.

The President and all his advisors stand up and move to the back of the
plane.

INT. POD ROOM -- NIGHT
The pod opens.  An expert attaches a locating device to the President's
wrist.

EXPERT
Sir, this is a locating device to trace you if you become separated from
the pod.  I'm activating it now.

SCREENS on the pod begin to light up as the President gets into the pod.
He pushes a few buttons.

PRESIDENT
God save me and watch over you all.

EXT. BASE -- NIGHT
A guard watches as Air Force One descends into New York.

INT. BASE -- NIGHT
Rehme and Hauk watch a computer simulation of the plane.

VOICE
Computer simulation tracking Air Force One.

EXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT
The plane goes down.

INT. BASE -- NIGHT
EXT. CLOSE UP -- MONITORS
As the plane smashes into a building, a red dot drops through the
building.  It's the pod.

O.S. MAN
It's down!

HAUK
It's the escape pod.

REHME
40 degrees, 50 yards from impact.

HAUK
I'm going in.

EXT. BASE -- NIGHT
Helicopters prepare for, and execute, launch, and fly into New York.  A
guard watches them.

INT. BASE -- NIGHT
Rehme watches monitors as Hauk talks.

HAUK
1-W-Larry.  Over the battery.  We're moving down.  Direct sight ahead.

EXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT
The helicopters land.  A swarm of policemen run out, and Hauk hangs
back.  He follows with a second swarm.  The first swarm assumes a
defensive position near the pod.  Hauk examines the pod.  It's
definitely empty, and the rest of the jet is surrounded in flames.

An odd LAUGH from nowhere.

WEIRDO walks out of the darkness.  He nods his head to Hauk.

WEIRDO
You touch me... he dies.  If you're not in the air in thirty seconds...
he dies.  You come back in... he dies.

Weirdo takes a package out of his shirt and unwraps it to reveal the
President's middle finger, complete with ring.

WEIRDO
Twenty seconds.

HAUK
I'm ready to talk.

WEIRDO
Nineteen.  Eighteen.

HAUK
What do you want?

WEIRDO
Seventeen.  Sixteen.

HAUK
Let's go.  Let's go!

Weirdo grins in triumph as the police force swarms back to the
helicopters and hauls ass out of New York.

INT. BASE -- NIGHT
Rehme stands behind a desk, talking on the phone.  Hauk is in the
foreground, looking pensive.

REHME
Yes, he's right here, Mr. Vice President.

Hauk picks up a phone.

HAUK
This is Bob Hauk.  ...We can't.  If we move in with choppers, they'll
kill him.  We're lucky if he's not dead already... They don't want
anything yet.  By the time they figure out what they want, it'll be too
late.

REHME
Tell him we have to go with your plan now.

Hauk waves him off.

HAUK
We can't wait until tomorrow.  If we have to move in and take the
island, it's a last resort.  It's 8:45.  I want permission to try a
rescue.  Thank you.

INT. HAUK'S OFFICE -- NIGHT
Hauk calmly arms a .45 pistol.  He looks up from his desk.

HAUK
All right.

OVERPROTECTIVE SECURITY GUARD
He's dangerous, sir.

HAUK
(with quiet confidence)
I know.  I'll be OK.

HAUK'S P.O.V.
We see the silhouette of an unmistakable figure.  It's Snake Plissken
all right, live and in the flesh.  The guards leave.  Snake walks into
Hauk's office and sits down in the chair across from Hauk.  He raises
his cuffed hands to Hauk as if to say "Take these off me, asshole," but
he doesn't actually say anything.  Hauk shakes his head.

HAUK
I'm not a fool, Plissken.

SNAKE
(coooooool)
Call me Snake.

Hauk puts on his glasses and proceeds to read a file.

HAUK
S.D. Plissken.  American Lieutenant.  Special Forces Unit, Black Flight.
Two Purple Hearts, Leningrad and Siberia.  Youngest man to be decorated
by the President.  You robbed the federal reserve depository.  Life
sentence, New York Maximum Security Penitentiary. I'm ready to kick your
ass out of the world, War Hero.

Snake could not care less.  He reaches forward with his still-cuffed
right hand, picks up a cigarette, picks up a match with his left hand,
strikes the match and takes a drag from his cigarette.  He lets out a
calm breath and says:

SNAKE
Who are you?

HAUK
Hauk.  Police Commissioner.

SNAKE
Bob Hauk...

HAUK
Special Forces Unit.  Texas Thunder.  We heard of you, too, Plissken.

SNAKE
Why are we talking?

HAUK
I have a deal for you.  You'll receive full pardon for every criminal
act committed in the United States.

Hauk shows Snake the pardon.  Snake's eye lights up.  This is something
he wants.  He's interested now, and can't hide it.

HAUK
(pressing his advantage)
There was an accident about an hour ago.  A small jet went down inside
New York City.  The President was on board.

SNAKE
(re-establishing control over the conversation)
President of what?

HAUK
That's not funny, Plissken.  (beat)  You go in, find the President and
bring him out in 24 hours, and you're a free man.

We sense amusement from Snake.  This is not the first time the
government has asked him for a favor.  But he's not a soldier or a "War
Hero" anymore.  He knows they need him more than he needs their pardon.
He's holding the cards now, and he knows it.

SNAKE
Twenty-four hours, huh?

HAUK
I'm making you an offer.

SNAKE
Bullshit.

HAUK
Straight just like I said.

SNAKE
I'll think about it.

HAUK
No time.  Give me an answer.

Snake turns away.  Hauk is pushing way too hard, and Snake is determined
to be in the driver's seat.

SNAKE
Get a new president.

HAUK
We're still at war, Plissken.  We need him alive.

SNAKE
I don't give a fuck about your war... or your president.

HAUK
Is that your answer?

SNAKE
I'm thinking about it.

HAUK
Think hard.

Snake pauses to take a draw on his cigarette.  Next question:

SNAKE
Why me?

HAUK
You flew the Gullfire over Leningrad.  You know how to get in quiet.
You're all I've got.

SNAKE
I guess I go in one way or the other.  Doesn't mean shit to me.  Give me
the paper.

HAUK
When you come out.

SNAKE
Before.

HAUK
I told you I wasn't a fool, Plissken.

SNAKE
Call me Snake.

INT. WEAPONS ROOM -- NIGHT
Rehme talks as we PAN ACROSS a table full of weapons.  We see two guns,
a belt, grenades, several pouches full of various stuff, a flashlight, a
Uzi, throwing stars, and more.  Snake surveys them with a cool
expression.

REHME
Some of them have cars.  They took old junkers that were left behind and
converted them to steam.  We think they may also have a gasoline source
in there, and power.  Greenhouses, rigged up generators.  Some areas
have streetlights. The crazies.  Live in the subways.  Complete control
of the underground.  They're night raiders.

Snake's not into this.  He'll figure it out when he gets there.  He
picks up a bracelet with an eagle on it.

HAUK
Tracer.  Sends a radio signal for fifteen minutes.  You push it, we can
track you on radar.  Just like Leningrad.  But they added something.  A
safety catch.

Snake pushes the safety catch.  Simple enough.  And yes, there's the
button.  This is familiar.  He smiles.

INT. HALL -- NIGHT
Snake has his jacket slung over his shoulder now.  He walks down the
hall to the medical room with Hauk.  Rehme has disappeared.

SNAKE
Where am I landing?

HAUK
Top of the world trade center.  Only place you can land.  They won't see
it, and you can take off from a free fall.  On the roof there's a
service elevator.  It's still operational.  We use it to infiltrate the
prison.  There's a power box.  It'll activate the elevator down to
fifty.  From there on down
you walk.

Snake shrugs on his jacket.  He knows Hauk is just trying to assert his
authority, and it's not working very well.

HAUK
You can locate the President by his vital signs bracelet, on his wrist.
It sends out a sig pulse.  Use this.

He hands Snake a homing device.

HAUK
Homing device.  Shows directions and distance.

INT. MEDICAL ROOM -- NIGHT
Snake and Hauk walk into the room.  They're met by a young medic.

HAUK
Strong antitoxin.  Stops bacteria and viral-proofs you for 24 hours.

Snake braces himself against a table.  The medic is holding an
injection-type tech gizmo.

MEDIC
Take off the jacket.

SNAKE
I'll be OK.

HAUK
Let's go, Plissken.

Snake shrugs off his jacket, disoriented by the place.  He's nervous.
His hackles are up.

SNAKE
I don't like needles.

Hauk straps a timer gauge onto Snake's left hand.  He activates it and
the time blinks on.  It's counting down as we speak.

HAUK
Twenty-two hours, twenty-nine minutes, fifty-seven seconds...

SNAKE
We talked about twenty-four.

HAUK
In twenty-two hours the Hartford Summit meeting will be over.  China and
the Soviet Union will go back home.  The president was on his way to the
summit when his plane went down.

Snake snorts.

HAUK
He has a briefcase attached to his wrist.  The tape recording inside has
to reach Hartford in 22 hours.

SNAKE
What's on it?

HAUK
You know anything about nuclear fusion?

Snake turns away.  No.  Nuclear fusion is not his area of expertise.

HAUK
It's about the survival of the human race, Plissken.  Something you
don't give a shit about.

Hauk steps aside.  The medic swabs Snake's neck on both sides.

MEDIC
I'm going to inject you.  It'll sting for a second or two...

He raises a couple of hypos and injects Snake with them.  Snake jumps a
little; clearly, this is not one of the world's most pleasant things.

HAUK
That's it, Plissken.

Snake gets off the table.  The medic turns around.

MEDIC
Tell him.

SNAKE
Tell me what?

Hauk thinks he's got him this time.  Snake doesn't like that.

HAUK
That idea you had about turning the Gullfire around 180 degrees and
flying off to Canada.

Hauk shakes his head.  Snake puts his jacket down and turns to the
medic.

SNAKE
What did you do to me, asshole?

HAUK
My idea, Plissken.  Something we've been fooling around with.  Two
microscopic capsules lodged in your arteries.  They're already starting
to dissolve.  In twenty-two hours, the cores will completely dissolve.
Inside the cores are that heat-sensitive charge.  Not a large explosive.
About the size of a pinhead.  Just big enough to --
(he gestures)
open up both your arteries.  I'd say you'd be dead in ten or fifteen
seconds --

Hauk stops talking because Snake has grabbed him by the throat.

SNAKE
TAKE THEM OUT NOW.

MEDIC
They're protected by the cores.  Fifteen minutes before the last hour is
up we can neutralize the charge with X-rays.

Snake lets go of Hauk to look at his watch.  22:57:38.  37.  36.  This
is his life he's watching tick away.

HAUK
We'll burn out the charges IF you have the President.

SNAKE
What if I'm a little late?

HAUK
No more Hartford Summit.  And no more Snake Plissken.

SNAKE
When I get back I'm going to kill you.

HAUK
The Gullfire's waiting.

EXT. RUNWAY -- NIGHT
Snake pulls up in a Jeep.  He walks up to the tiny plane called the
Gullfire.  Two guards stand by to make sure he just gets in the plane
and does his job.  He throws his cigarette out onto the runway and
closes the overhead window.

INT. GULLFIRE -- NIGHT
Snake turns on his monitors.

SNAKE
I'm ready.

HAUK
21 hours.

SNAKE
Suppose he's dead, Hauk.  If I come back without him, you'll burn these
things out?

INT. BASE --- NIGHT
Hauk and Rehme exchange a glance; Hauk's been expecting this question to
come up.

HAUK
Get them both back, Plissken.

INT. GULLFIRE -- NIGHT
Snake doesn't like the response, but figures he can't do anything about
it.

HAUK
Remember, once inside you're on your own.

SNAKE
Oh, you mean I can't count on you?

HAUK
No.

SNAKE
Good.

EXT. RUNWAY -- NIGHT
A larger plane hauls the Gullfire into the air; the Gullfire is
essentially a big hang glider.

INT. BASE -- NIGHT
Hauk checks Snake's life clock, "Master Life Clock".
20:17:43... 42... 41....

INT. GULLFIRE -- NIGHT
Snake's watch reads 20:17:40... 39... 38... 37... 36... 35...
He starts controlling the plane.  He flips the tracer open and hits the
button, testing it.

INT. BASE -- NIGHT
The master life clock shows the test confirmation.

COMPUTER
Tracer test confirmed at 20 hours, 17 minutes, 30 seconds.

Hauk, Rehme and the Vice President nod with relief.

EXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT
Snake takes the plane in.

INT. GULLFIRE -- NIGHT
Snake looks over his monitors.  He sees New York coming up.

INT. BASE -- NIGHT
Hauk waits at his microphone.

HAUK
Are you picking up the target blip?

INT. GULLFIRE -- NIGHT

SNAKE
Right on course.

EXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT
The plane aims for the World Trade Center.

INT. GULLFIRE -- NIGHT

SNAKE
It's been a while . . .

The plane is aiming right at a building.

HAUK
How's your altitude?

Snake calmly angles the plane up.

INT. BASE -- NIGHT

HAUK
Plissken?  Plissken?  Plissken, what are you doing?

INT. GULLFIRE -- NIGHT

SNAKE
Playing with myself.  I'm going in.

Snake targets the World Trade Center.  He checks his instruments.

EXT. WORLD TRADE CENTER -- NIGHT
The plane comes down.  It hits hard.  Snake puts on the brakes, adds a
grappling hook, and finally comes to a stop right at the edge.

INT. BASE -- NIGHT

HAUK
Plissken?  Plissken?

EXT. WORLD TRADE CENTER -- NIGHT
Snake walks over to the elevator.  He uses the power box to get the
elevator started.  He looks around, and the doors open.  He gets in the
elevator.  The doors close.

INT. BASE -- NIGHT
Snake's voice comes through the radio.

SNAKE
I'm inside the World Trade Center on the 50th floor.  Just like
Leningrad, Hauk.

HAUK
Is the glider intact?

INT. WORLD TRADE CENTER -- NIGHT
Snake stands with his walkie-talkie in the middle of the graffiti-
covered building.

SNAKE
Yeah, but taking off is for shit.  I'll work it out.

HAUK
You'll have to use the east stairwell.  It'll take you a little while to
get to ground level.

Snake checks his life clock.  19:22:44. 43. 42.

HAUK
Call me when you get outside.

Snake puts his walkie-talkie away as someone runs past.  He doesn't
notice.  He walks on.

FADE OUT.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
FADE IN.
EXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT
Snake walks along with his tracer.  He goes through alleys and streets.
He draws his gun as he walks by a group of people.  He's armed and ready
to fight.

EXT. PLANE CRASH -- NIGHT
The plane is still burning.  Smoke is coming from everywhere.  The plane
is severed in the middle.  The crash is very impressive.  Snake walks
and notices a few people go by.  He pulls out his walkie-talkie.

SNAKE
I'm at the plane.  Nobody else made it, Hauk.

Something beeps.  His tracer.

SNAKE
Wait a minute.

He looks at his tracer.  A small red dot lights up in the southeast
corner.

SNAKE
I've got his pulse.  Right up ahead, moving northwest.

He puts away his walkie-talkie and checks his life clock.  18:50:18.
17.  16.

DISSOLVE TO:
Images.  Snake holding the tracer.  He gets closer and comes up to a
building, formerly a theater.  He walks in.

INT. THEATER -- NIGHT
The pulse keeps getting stronger.  Snake walks in.  He holds his gun at
the ready.  There's a truly horrible musical going on.

INT. STAGE -- NIGHT

ACTORS
This is hell!  This is hate!  (etc.)

Snake looks around.  No sign of the president, but there is a CABBIE
enjoying the show.  Time to move on.  He enters against his better
judgment, but he's just passing through, so that's OK.

INT. STAIRWELL -- NIGHT
Snake keeps moving, but there's a noise.  He turns around, aiming his
gun.  Cabbie holds up his hands.

CABBIE
Hey!  You're Snake Plissken, ain't you?

SNAKE
What do you want?

CABBIE
Nothin'.

Snake lowers his gun.

CABBIE
I thought you were dead!

Snake moves on.

CABBIE
Hey!  You don't want to walk around down there, Snake!

INT. BASEMENT -- NIGHT
The signal from the tracer keeps getting closer and closer.  Snake walks
past a gang beating up and stripping a semi-conscious girl.  He doesn't
take much notice.  He keeps going.  He sees a BUM sitting by a fire.

BUM
Hi, Chief.  Nice night.  Nice boots.  Niiiiice boots.  Hey.

A guy tries to sneak up behind Snake.  Snake knocks him out and points
his gun at the bum.

BUM
Easy now, chief.  I'm walking.  I'm walking.

The bum walks away.  Snake keeps going.  A man beats up another man at a
sink.  The beatee is wearing the President's life tracer.  Snake kicks
the beater and knocks him out.

SNAKE
Mr. President . . .

The man wearing the life tracer looks up and smiles.  He's a DRUNK.

DRUNK
I'm the President?  Sure, I'm the President.  If I knew where I got this
thing --
(indicates the tracer)
I'd be the President.

SNAKE
Where did you get it?

DRUNK
I woke up, and there it was, just like a miracle . . .

Snake slams the tracer against the sink.

INT. BASE -- NIGHT
The President's life signs all fail.

OFFICIAL
Oh my god . . .

MEDIC
It . . . It may be just an impact on the mechanism itself . . .

INT. BASEMENT -- NIGHT
Snake pulls up his walkie-talkie.

SNAKE
Hauk?!

INT. BASE -- NIGHT

HAUK
I'm right here, Plissken.

SNAKE
I don't know who you assholes are looking at, but it's NOT the
President.

INT. BASEMENT -- NIGHT
Snake holds the walkie-talkie up to the drunk.

DRUNK
(to the tune of Joy to the World)
Hail to the chief . . . La la la la la la . . .

SNAKE
All right, get your machine ready.  I'm coming out.

INT. BASE -- NIGHT

HAUK
18 hours, Plissken.

INT. BASEMENT -- NIGHT

SNAKE
Listen to me, Hauk.  The President is DEAD, you got that?  Somebody's
had him for dinner!

INT. BASE -- NIGHT

HAUK
Plissken, if you get back in that glider I'll shoot you down.  You climb
out, I'll burn you off the wall.  You understand that, Plissken?

INT. BASEMENT -- NIGHT
Snake stares at his walkie-talkie.

SNAKE
A little human compassion . . .

EXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT
Snake walks on.  He's in an area with streetlights.  He keeps going.

EXT. POD -- NIGHT
Snake stares at the pod.  No clues.  He looks around.  Nothing.  As he
comes back up, he sets up a chair and sits down heavily.  He touches his
neck.  It's like he can feel the cores dissolving.

A crazy walks past, bangs on manhole covers.  Snake doesn't know what
he's doing, but he doesn't like it.  Especially not when the manhole
covers start to rise up.  He runs off.

EXT. CHOCK FULL OF NUTS -- NIGHT
Snake finds the restaurant, and runs inside.  No one follows.

INT. CHOCK FULL OF NUTS -- NIGHT
Snake backs into a corner.  The floor is weak and starts to go out from
under him once.  He gets into the shadows.  There's someone there.

GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
You a cop?

Snake levels his gun at her.

SNAKE
No . . .

GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
You've got a gun.  You got a smoke?

Snake tosses her his cigarettes.  She lights one.

SNAKE
Keep your hand over it.

GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
It's all right if we're quiet.  They won't hear us.
(reacting to the cigarette)
Hey, this is a real one.  You just get in?

SNAKE
What's going on out there?

GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
Crazies.  It's the end of the month.  They're out of food.

SNAKE
Do you live here?

GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
Skulls?  You kidding?  I'm with the Turks now.  I just got caught in the
street after dark and now I'm stuck here all night.

SNAKE
A plane crashed seven hours ago.  Did you see it?

GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
No.

SNAKE
Shit.

GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
You're a cop.

SNAKE
I'm an asshole.

GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
Hey, wait a minute.  I know who you are.  Yeah!  But I heard you were
dead.

SNAKE
I am.

GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
Wow, Snake Plissken.  All right!  What you doing in here with a gun,
Snake?

SNAKE
Looking for somebody.

GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
Who?

SNAKE
The President.

GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
Come on!  He really here?

SNAKE
Somewhere.

GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
When you find him, are you gonna take him out?

SNAKE
Mm-hm.

GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
Take me out with you, Snake.

SNAKE
Why?

GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
I can think of lots of reasons why . . .

She makes a move to kiss him, but there's a noise.  They split up, but
she gets sucked through the floor.  Snake tries to save her, but it's
too late.  He gets the hell out of there.

INT. BUILDING -- NIGHT, EXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT, EXT. ALLEYS -- NIGHT
Snake runs through the building, breaks a window, and climbs up a fire
escape to get to a new floor.  He breaks a window to get in, then pulls
a cabinet in front of the window.  He shoots through the cabinet,
causing some crazy to scream.  He busts down a door, shoots open part of
a wall, busts through that, climbs out a window, and climbs down a
telephone pole.  He then climbs up a wall.  On the way he drops his
walkie-talkie.  He runs down an alley, and as he does, Cabbie pulls up.

CABBIE
Where you goin', buddy?

Snake points his gun at Cabbie.  He looks behind him, then gets in the
cab.

INT. CAB -- NIGHT
Snake notices a tape player which is playing the theme from "American
Bandstand."

CABBIE
Bad neighborhood, Snake!  You don't want to be walking from the Bowery
to 42nd street at night!  I've been driving a cab here for 30 years and
I'm telling you, you don't walk around here at night!  Yes, sir!
They'll kill you and strip you in ten seconds flat.  Usually I'm not
down around here myself, but I wanted to catch that show.

Cabbie lights a rag stuffed down the neck of a bottle which is full of
gasoline.

CABBIE
This stuff is like gold around here, you know.

EXT. CAB -- NIGHT
Cabbie throws the bottle into the alley, where it explodes.

INT. CAB -- NIGHT

CABBIE
Hey, Snake, when'd you get in?  I didn't even know they caught you.
(laughs)
Ohhh, Snake Plissken in my cab.  Wait'll I tell Eddie!  Hey, hang on,
Snake.

EXT. CAB -- NIGHT
Cabbie makes a sharp turn.

INT. CAB -- NIGHT

CABBIE
Hey, what were you doing back there, Snake?

SNAKE
Looking for somebody.

CABBIE
Well, why didn't you ask me?  Hell, I know everybody in this town.  Yes,
sir.  I've been driving this cab for thirty years, this very same cab.

Snake points his gun at Cabbie.

SNAKE
I'm GONNA ask you.  Now where's the President?

CABBIE
The Duke's got him!  Everyone knows the Duke's got him!  You don't have
to put a gun to my head.  I'll tell you!

SNAKE
Who's the Duke?

CABBIE
The DUKE!  The Duke of New York!  A-Number-1!  The big man, that's who!

SNAKE
I want to meet this Duke.

CABBIE
You can't meet the Duke, are you crazy?  Nobody wants to meet the Duke!
You meet him once and then you're dead!

Snake points the gun more insistently.  Tough.

EXT. BRAIN'S BUILDING -- NIGHT
Cabbie parks the cab and he and Snake walk up to Brain's building.

CABBIE
I hate to leave her on the street.  Usually I don't leave her alone at
all.  But you're a special case, Snake.

He and Snake walk up to the door.  Cabbie knocks on the door with his
shoe.

CABBIE
It's OK, Snake.  It's a better neighborhood.  You can relax.

Relax?  Snake checks his life clock.  17:40:46. 45. 44.  Relax, my ass.

SNAKE
Thanks.

CABBIE
Boy, they got a great place here.  Like a fortress!

SNAKE
They?

From the inside, someone answers.

MAGGIE
Who is it?

CABBIE
It's me!

MAGGIE
Who's me?

CABBIE
Cabbie!

MAGGIE
What do you want?

CABBIE
Somebody wants to see Brain, it's important --

MAGGIE
No way, Cabbie --

CABBIE
No, it's Snake!  Snake Plissken!

Maggie opens the door.  She stands there and surveys the pair.

MAGGIE
YOU'RE Plissken?

CABBIE
He wants to see Brain.

MAGGIE
Why?

SNAKE
I want to meet the Duke.

Snake and Maggie exchange a glance.  She leads them in.

INT. BRAIN'S -- NIGHT

CABBIE
Hey, what do you think of this place, Snake?  It used to be a public
library.  Oh, that Brain, he's the greatest!  Mr. Fabulous!  Duke loves
him.

SNAKE
(gesturing at Maggie)
Who's that?

CABBIE
That's Maggie.  Brain's squeeze.  The Duke gave him to Brain just to
keep him happy . . . see what I mean?

Snake can tell that Maggie's more than just Brain's squeeze; she's his
bodyguard, too.  She looks like she'd be willing to kill to protect
Brain.

MAGGIE
Heard you were dead.

INT. BRAIN'S ROOM -- NIGHT

CABBIE
Brain?  Brain!  I brought somebody to see you!

Snake looks at Brain.  He knows this guy.

SNAKE
Harold Helman.

Brain puts down his book and stands up.

BRAIN
Snake?

MAGGIE
"Harold"?

SNAKE
Where you been, Harold?  It's been a long time.

MAGGIE
You never told me you knew Snake Plissken, Brain.

CABBIE
Isn't that great?  Hey, Brain, I could use some gas if you can spare
some . . .

No one pays attention.  Snake advances on Brain.  Brain sits down.

SNAKE
I'm glad you remember me.  Yeah.  A man should remember his past.
Kansas City, four years ago.  You ran out on me.  You left me sitting
there.

BRAIN
You were late.

SNAKE
We were buddies, Harold.  You, me, and Fresno Bob.  You know what they
did to Bob?

His face changes.  He suddenly kicks Brain's chair into the wall and
points his gun.

Maggie draws a knife and starts advancing on Snake.

SNAKE
You want to see him sprayed all over that map, baby?
(to Brain)
Where's the President?!

BRAIN
Swear to god, Snake, I don't know --

SNAKE
Don't fuck with me!

BRAIN
Why do you want to know?

SNAKE
I want him.

BRAIN
Working for the man now, huh?

SNAKE
Then I'll just beat it out of your squeeze --

BRAIN
Mm-hm.  Maggie doesn't know EXACTLY where he is and unless you know
EXACTLY PRECISELY where he is you'll never find him.

Snake takes his gun away.  He contemplates Brain.

SNAKE
Listen, I'll take you out of here.  Yeah.  Jet glider just a couple of
blocks down the street.  And all you gotta do is get me to him.

Everyone realizes the importance of this.

CABBIE
No kidding?  On the level?  Will you take me, too?

BRAIN
We've got to deal somewhere else.

SNAKE
No glider.

MAGGIE
We've got the President.  And the Duke's taking everybody out of here.

SNAKE
Never happen.  See, I know something you and the Duke don't know.  We've
only got so long before Mr. President don't mean a whole lot.

BRAIN
You're lying.

MAGGIE
Maybe he's not . . .

BRAIN
I know him!  Look at his face, he's lying!

SNAKE
Right, Harold.  I'm lying.  So I might as well have some fun and keep
looking by myself.

He cocks his gun and points it at Brain again.

MAGGIE
Brain --

SNAKE
Talk to him, baby --

MAGGIE
Brain, he'll kill us both if you don't tell him --

CABBIE
(panicking)
Brain, you've got to tell him!

MAGGIE
(panicking)
Brain, you've got to tell him --

CABBIE
(panicked)
Tell him, tell him, tell him --

BRAIN
ALL RIGHT!!!

Snake lowers the gun.

SNAKE
You always were smart, Harold.

BRAIN
Just one thing right now.  Don't call me "Harold."

EXT. BUILDING -- NIGHT
Snake, Maggie, Cabbie and Brain all walk out.

SNAKE
So you work for this Duke, huh?

BRAIN
Yeah.  Make gas for him.  Figure out things for him.

SNAKE
Like what?

BRAIN
(showing off)
Like how to get across the 69th street bridge -- it's mined, but I know
where they're planted.

MAGGIE
We got a diagram from a guy that got all the way across . . . before
they shot the poor bastard.

BRAIN
We got a crew up there now clearing the way across the first barricade.

CABBIE
What a sight, Snake!  The whole camp rolling right across the bridge and
the President right out front!  Oh, that would have been so fine . . .

MAGGIE
(ironically)
Yeah, it would have been . . .

CABBIE
Yeah, but we're going with Snake now.

The three of them cross into the street.  Cabbie panics.

CABBIE
That's the Duke!  I know the sound of his engines.  Don't cross the Duke
-- everybody knows that.

We get one glimpse of the Duke's car.  Then we realize that Cabbie is
gone and his cab is racing away.

MAGGIE
Cabbie, you slime!

The Duke's car heads right for us.

MAGGIE
No, Brain!

The two of them run off.  After a while, Snake follows.  The three of
them hide.  The Duke's car is an old Chrysler with chandeliers suspended
over the headlights.  It's in a caravan of three, leading the way.  A
fourth car comes up later.  The Duke is sitting in the passenger seat of
a car with Weirdo in the back.  The Duke gets out of the car, Weirdo at
his side.  The Duke is wearing a cowboy hat, sunglasses, a snazzy
jacket, bluejeans, and boots.  He looks TOUGH.  He sends Weirdo to knock
on the door.

MAGGIE
He's looking for you, Brain.

SNAKE
What does he want?

BRAIN
He wants my diagram of the bridge.  When he finds out I'm with you he's
going to want my life!  Shit, Plissken, I knew I shouldn't have listened
to you --

SNAKE
We've got to get to the President NOW, while he's busy.

BRAIN
Forget it, he's on the other side of town and we got no wheels.  The
deal is off --

SNAKE
Just calm down.

EXT. CAR -- NIGHT
A lone man sits, looking bored.  Snake subtly goes up to him, knocks him
out, and gets him out of the car.  He briefly considers shooting the guy
on the hood of the car.  Instead, the guy on the hood of the car walks
around.  Snake knocks him out a second alter and then drives to get
Brain and Maggie.  He knocks the other guy out of the car.

BRAIN
(panicked)
I think they saw us!  Turn left, turn left here!

INT. CAR -- NIGHT

MAGGIE
Brain, this is Broadway.

BRAIN
I know, I know, the Duke'll take Seventh Avenue, Broadway is five
minutes --

MAGGIE
No!!!

BRAIN
Yes!!!  Just keep driving!

SNAKE
What's wrong with Broadway?

EXT. BROADWAY -- NIGHT

SNAKE
(to the car)
Come on sweetheart . . .

People start throwing bricks.  Snake hands his gun to Brain, who passes
it to Maggie, holding it like a dead rat (or like a macho guy would hold
a purse).  Snake drives as fast as he can, gunning off the bystander who
gets on the car.  A bystander grabs Brain.

BRAIN
Maggie!

Maggie protects him.  She shoots the people grabbing at him.  Snake
angles the car through a pile of scrap metal and drives away.  He glares
at Brain.  Everyone seems visibly shaken.

SNAKE
Hold on.

Snake backs the car through a bunch of piled cars.  He takes off, the
car a bit worse for wear but at least they got away from the crowd on
Broadway.

EXT. TRAINS -- NIGHT
Brain points to the cars as Snake watches.

BRAIN
He'll be in the third car from the end, by the last campfire.

Snake looks around.  The Duke's caravan passes.  There are more cars
than there were before.

BRAIN
It's all right.  He's got to go in the front way.  It'll take him five
minutes.  If you're not back to the car in four minutes you're on your
own.

SNAKE
When we get there, Harold, you just keep talking.

They drive off.  Snake gets to the trains.  No one notices.  Maggie and
Brain get out of the car and Snake ducks into the train car.

BRAIN
Hi, guys.  Hi . . . how's it going?  Cooled off a little, huh?

HEAD DUDE
What do you want, Brain?

BRAIN
Duke told us to wait inside.  He's on his way here now.

HEAD DUDE
He didn't say nothing to us about it.

BRAIN
Well, you can't expect him to tell everybody in the joint, now can you?
That's why he's the Duke.

The camera angles back to show Snake walking on top of the railroad
cars.  He hasn't found the President yet. But he doesn't have time to
wonder if Brain double-crossed him.

HEAD DUDE
Why don't we wait outside here for him?

BRAIN
Why don't we wait inside for him?

HEAD DUDE
'Cause I got orders, that's why.

BRAIN
What are your specific orders, by the way?

HEAD DUDE
Specific orders, Brain, was for me not to let no one go inside.

BRAIN
How's the President holding up, by the way?  Any political discussion
you've had with him?

INT. PRESIDENT'S TRAIN CAR -- NIGHT
Two guards sit with the President, talking.  The first guard is by the
President.  The second is looking out the window.

SECOND GUARD
That Brain is a real pain in the ass.  He's always sniffing around like
a dog.

FIRST GUARD
He comes up with the gas.

The second guard looks out the window.  Snake grabs him by the neck, and
breaks it.  The first guard doesn't notice, but the President does, and
that tips off the guard.

FIRST GUARD
What are you looking at?

He turns and Snake throws a star at him.  It lodges right in his brain,
but not fast enough.  Snake is hit in the leg with a crossbow arrow.

Snake limps over to the President and starts uncuffing him.  The
president still has the briefcase.  This is it, this is the big time.
Snake keeps calm.

PRESIDENT
Are you from the outside?

SNAKE
Stop shaking.

PRESIDENT
I can't!  Who are you?

SNAKE
Hauk sent me.  We've got to move fast.

PRESIDENT
Move fast?  You're goddamned right I'll move fast.

SNAKE
Quiet!

Snake limps away, President in the lead.

EXT. TRAIN -- NIGHT
Snake and the President keep moving.  Suddenly, Snake gets jumped.  Ten
guys surround him and the President, and though Snake fights well, it's
not well enough.  Brain comes out with Maggie.

BRAIN
They got him.  Now watch him.

The Duke steps out from the car, followed by Weirdo.

DUKE
Friend of yours, Brain?

BRAIN
He had a gun on me, Duke, there was nothing I could do.

DUKE
(not believing it for a second)
Uh-huh.

Weirdo points accusingly as he and Duke walk away.

BRAIN
Maggie . . .

Duke walks up to Snake.  Snake isn't giving in even though he's pretty
sure he's beat.

DUKE
Who are you?

Snake doesn't answer.  Duke grabs the arrow still lodged in his right
leg and pulls on it.  Snake writhes in agony.

DUKE
I said who are you?

BRAIN
Snake Plissken, Duke.  The Man sent him in here.  Something's going down
. . . we need him.

Duke recognizes the name.  He is impressed.  He lets go of the arrow.
Snake hates him more than ever.

DUKE
Snaaaaaake Plissken.  I've heard of you.

He raises a crowbar over his head and smacks Snake with it, knocking him
out.

DUKE
I heard you were dead.

EXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT
A helicopter flies over the city.

INT. HELICOPTER -- NIGHT
The pilot looks at a grid-view of New York.

SURVEILLANCE 4
This is surveillance 4 to security control.  Nothing on the infrared
body scan.  Nothing in the searchlight. There aren't any fires on the
street.  Nobody moving down here.

INT. BASE -- NIGHT
Hauk, Rehme and the Vice President wait.

SURVEILLANCE 5
Surveillance 5 . . . security control . . . negative on infrared body
scan . . . no movement in the searchlight . . . nothing strange going on
down there.

They look at the Master Life Clock.  12:27:39.  38. Where's Plissken?

INT. ROOM -- DAY
Plissken lies unconscious on a bed, crossbow pointed at his head.  Three
guards are at the ready.

INT. BASE -- DAY

VICE PRESIDENT
We've got to go in now.

HAUK
We hold.

VICE PRESIDENT
You're countermanding my orders, Hauk.

HAUK
This is my prison, I'll give the orders.

VICE PRESIDENT
I override all that!

HAUK
Just try.

EXT. NEW YORK -- DAY
Unbelievable smog.  Helicopters fly.

SURVEILLANCE ?
...still negative on the scan.

SURVEILLANCE 4
This is Surveillance 4 to Security Control.  Nothing on the infrared
body scan.  Negative on the sweep.

EXT. WALL -- DAY
Hauk stands on the wall, listening.

SURVEILLANCE 10
Surveillance 10.  Still negative on the scan.

SURVEILLANCE 5
Surveillance 5 still negative.

SURVEILLANCE 4
This is Surveillance 4 to Security Control.  Nothing on the infrared
body scan.  Negative...

INT. ROOM -- DAY
Snake begins to come to.  We hear gunshots and cheering.  The guards go
to announce Snake's consciousness.

INT. HANGAR -- DAY
Brain and Maggie move to the center of the gunshots and cheering

INT. TARGET PRACTICE -- DAY
The Duke sits firing with Plissken's gun at the President, whose
briefcase is still chained to his arm.

INT. ROOM -- DAY
Snake sits up.  There are LOTS of crossbows aimed at him.

GUARD
Don't move, Snake.

Snake turns to face him.  He stands up.  We see for the first time
exactly why he's called "Snake" Plissken.  There's a snake tattooed on
his stomach.  The snake's tail disappears into his pants, but we have a
good idea of where it leads and what it becomes.  Ah ha.

Snake's life clock is gone.  He has no idea how much time he's got.
Shit.

INT. TARGET PRACTICE -- DAY

DUKE
I want that diagram, Brain.

BRAIN
Oh. It's at my place, Duke.  Duke, that Plissken said something about a
time limit.

DUKE
What time limit?

BRAIN
(gesturing at President)
On him.

DUKE
That's a lot of crap.
(to the President)
What did I teach you?

PRESIDENT
(weakly)
You... You are... the Duke of New... New York... You're... A-Number-One.

DUKE
I can't hear you.

PRESIDENT
YOU ARE... THE DUKE OF NEW YORK... YOU'RE A-NUMBER-ONE!

DUKE
(to Brain)
Get me the diagram.

BRAIN
Duke... Don't kill Plissken.  We need him.

The Duke points the gun at Brain, but doesn't even give him a glance.

DUKE
Get moving, Brain.

Brain moves, and Weirdo laughs that odd laugh.  The Duke fires at the
President's briefcase.  Papers and a tape fall out.  Weirdo looks down
and kicks the tape away.  He picks it up and holds it to his ear, then
puts it in his pocket.  Guards come and unstrap the President.  The Duke
has decided to take Snake a bit more seriously than he had.

Which is not saying much.

EXT. NEW YORK -- LATE AFTERNOON
Helicopters fly above ground.  A group stands with a car, gesturing
wildly.

INT. HELICOPTER -- LATE AFTERNOON

PILOT
People out below in the park.  Can you see them?

INT. BASE -- LATE AFTERNOON

PILOT
Surveillance 2 to Security Control.  We're getting that readout, mostly
in the infrared.

Hauk and Rehme immediately check out the monitor.  At least something's
going on.

PILOT
We have a visual sighting on it.  It's a crowd of prisoners in Central
Park.  They're waving at us.  Signaling us in the food drop area.
They're waving us down.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK -- LATE AFTERNOON
The prisoners wave the helicopters down.  A group of guards lands and
runs over to the station wagon.  They get the briefcase which has been
sawed off the President's handcuffs.

INT. ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON
Snake is awake and surrounded by guards.  The cheers are louder.

INT. BRAIN'S -- LATE AFTERNOON
Maggie walks across the room, loading a gun.  It's one of Snake's.

BRAIN
I still can't figure out whether that son of a bitch Plissken was
telling the truth or not.  God, I hate that guy.

Brain stands in front of his maps.

MAGGIE
He got in somehow.

BRAIN
Yeah, yeah, but how?  You gotta land the glider and take off.
(he gestures at the map)
You can't do it in Central Park, there's too many trees.  Port
Authority's too low to the ground.  Unless it was some...
(he gets it... they don't call him "Brain" for nothing)
Someplace high up.  World Trade Center.  That's it.  There we go.  The
World Trade Center.  And it's gonna be a hell of a lot easier for me to
take off than it was for him to land.

INT. BASE -- LATE AFTERNOON
Hauk reads the note left in the briefcase.

HAUK
"Amnesty for all prisoners in New York City in exchange for President.
69th Street Bridge tomorrow, 12 Noon.  No bullshit or he's dead."

VICE PRESIDENT
Where's the tape?

HAUK
Not here.

He reaches inside and removes a pair of goggles.

REHME
They're Plissken's.

Yeah, they were on the table.  He never did use them, though, and only
half of them is necessary in his case anyway.

VICE PRESIDENT
So much for your man, Hauk?

Hauk hesitates.  This is the last thing he wants.

HAUK
Warm up the choppers.  We're moving in.

EXT. BASE -- SUNSET
Helicopters prepare for takeoff.

INT. BASE -- SUNSET
Hauk sits at the microphone.

HAUK
Plissken?

The master life clock reads 1:56:38. 37. 36,

INT. ROOM -- SUNSET
Snake slowly gets to his feet.  He's still groggy, but it's time for him
to move.

GUARD
Come on, get up!

Snake limps through a hallway and into a stadium.

INT. STADIUM -- SUNSET
Boos greet Snake as he walks in.  In the center of the room is a
fighting ring.  Snake climbs in, not without effort.  A huge and
extremely ugly man climbs into the ring, amid loud cheers.  Snake
notices that the huge ugly dude is wearing his life clock.  In the
balcony above is the Duke.  The Duke stands up and raises his arms, and
everyone gets silent.

DUKE
They sent in their best man.  And when we roll down the 69th street
bridge tomorrow on our way to freedom, we're gonna have their best man
leading the way.  From the neck up.

The crowd cheers.

DUKE
On the hood of my car!

More cheers.

DUKE
Let's do it!

Ugly and Snake take bats.  They circle each other.  Ugly strikes at
Snake.  Snake ricochets off the ring.  He rolls around, fighting for his
life.

INT. BUILDING -- SUNSET
Brain and Maggie walk around.  They knock on a door and Weirdo answers.
He's wearing Cabbie's hat.

WEIRDO
Hello.

BRAIN
Where'd you get the hat?

WEIRDO
Got it from Cabbie.

BRAIN
Yeah?

WEIRDO
Traded him.

BRAIN
For what?

WEIRDO
What are you so nervous about?

BRAIN
I'm here to see the President.

WEIRDO
Who says?

BRAIN
The Duke.

WEIRDO
No he doesn't.

BRAIN
Well... I'll have to tell him you said that.

Weirdo doesn't really believe it.  If it's not true, so what?

But if it IS true, the Duke will have him tortured to death.

WEIRDO
Wait a minute.  Why?

BRAIN
He's got something hidden in his clothing.  The Duke wants it.

WEIRDO
What?

BRAIN
I'll show you.

WEIRDO
You'll tell me.

BRAIN
Cyanide capsules.  The Duke don't want a dead president.

Brain pushes his way in.

INT. ROOM -- SUNSET

BRAIN
Gentlemen.  Mr. President.

Weirdo lets the door slide closed.  Brain starts checking the
President's clothes.  The President has been dressed in a wig and tied
to a chair with an American Flag on it.

WEIRDO
Cyanide?

BRAIN
Yeah.  He might try to take it tomorrow.

Weirdo walks up to Brain.

WEIRDO
That's bullshit.  You're not supposed to be in here, Brain --

Brain stabs Weirdo, who dies with a gasp.  Maggie dispatches of the
three guards.  She smiles.  Brain unties the President's hand.  The
President snatches off the wig in a rage.

INT. TOURNAMENT -- SUNSET
Snake notices a guard wearing the eagle tracer.  A trash can lid and a
bat with spikes on it is handed to him.  The next round begins.

EXT. HOUSE -- EVENING
Brain, the President, and Maggie sneak out.  A guy in a cowboy hat
notices.

INT. TOURNAMENT -- EVENING
Ugly and Snake keep fighting.  Snake is not doing very well.  But he's
catching up.  As Ugly tries to hit him, he nails Ugly in the groin, then
in the back of the head.  The crowd begins cheering "SNAKE!  SNAKE!"
The Duke can't believe it.  Snake runs to the guard with the tracer and
activates it.

INT. BASE -- EVENING
The Master Life Clock begins blinking "Tracer Status: ACTIVATED."

COMPUTER
Tracer activated at one hour, thirty-five minutes, twenty-seven seconds.

Rehme jumps out of his seat.

REHME
Hauk!!

INT. TOURNAMENT -- EVENING
Snake limps around, getting his stuff back together.  He looks at his
life clock.  1:34:54.  53.  He doesn't have much time.

The guy in the cowboy hat runs up to the Duke and yells for attention.
Duke immediately gets up and leaves, as do his hangers-on.

GUY IN COWBOY HAT
LISTEN!!!  LISTEN!!!  LISTEN!!!

The crowd shuts up.

GUY IN COWBOY HAT
THE PRESIDENT'S GONE!  BRAIN TOOK HIM!

The crowd rushes out.  Snake limps out of the ring and runs off as fast
as he can.

EXT. BASE -- EVENING
Rehme catches up to Hauk at the last second.  Hauk has been stalling.

REHME
(shouting over noise)
Hauk!  Plissken's tracer!

Hauk runs up to the head helicopter pilot.

HAUK
Get on the radio!  Keep them down!  Nobody move!

INT. BASE -- EVENING
Two monitors show Snake's tracer.

REHME
He's approaching the World Trade Center.

HAUK
I knew that son of a bitch was alive.

REHME
He's inside.

INT. WORLD TRADE CENTER -- EVENING
Snake limps around.  He notices a cab.  Fifty flights of stairs with
his leg shot to hell.  He hesitates only for a second, then starts up.

INT. BASE -- EVENING
The Vice President, Hauk and Rehme all stand, staring at the monitors.

VICE PRESIDENT
It's gone.

HAUK
The signal only lasts for 15 minutes.  Download the choppers.  We're in
a standby situation.

Rehme runs off.

VICE PRESIDENT
Anybody could have pushed that button.

HAUK
Only Plissken knew there was a safety catch.  Now we'll give him a
little more time, just to make sure.

The master clock shows 59:44. 43.

EXT. WORLD TRADE CENTER -- NIGHT
Snake gets out of the elevator.  Maggie, Brain, and the President all
take cover behind a chimney and try to get a gang to stop chopping down
the glider.  It doesn't work.  The glider floats away.

BRAIN
Goddamned redskins!  They're savages, Mr. President!

Snake runs to get them.  They get in the elevator.

INT. WORLD TRADE CENTER -- NIGHT
Snake has the President by the arm and is leading everyone out.

BRAIN
Listen, Snake, I swear to god, I thought you were dead --

SNAKE
Yeah, you and everybody else.

He grabs Brain by the tie and aims the gun at his head.

SNAKE
That's your car in the lobby?  The keys!  Quick!  Quick!  Diagram of the
bridge!  Hey, hey, hey --

Snake takes all the abovementioned items.

BRAIN
I'm the only one who knows how to read that, Snake --

SNAKE
Stay out of my way, Harold.

BRAIN
Besides, you can't read and drive at the same time.  You need us!

Snake is tired.  He's pissed.  He's got half an hour to live if that.
He doesn't have time for Brain's shit, and he lets him know it.

SNAKE
You shouldn't have double-crossed me again, Brain.  Come on, let's go --

He suddenly notices there's nothing on the end of the President's chain.
He holds it in front of the President's face.

PRESIDENT
They sawed it off...

SNAKE
The tape?

PRESIDENT
Gone... I don't know where...

BRAIN
I do.

Snake shoots him a look.  Bullshit, his eyes say, but maybe Brain is
telling the truth.  Maybe.

BRAIN
Swear to god, Snake, I know where it is.  Just take us to the car and
I'll take you right to it.

SNAKE
Shit...

He tosses the diagram of the bridge to Brain.  They go down the stairs.
Snake's in bad shape, but it's everyone else who's complaining.

MAGGIE
Don't talk.  Breathe.

PRESIDENT
Come on, come on, we're wasting time!

Snake gets into the car.  It won't start.

BRAIN
What's wrong?

SNAKE
Dead, Harold.

BRAIN
What?!

Snake hands the keys to Brain.

SNAKE
Here, take these.

Snake looks under the hood.  There's a man with a crossbow pointed
straight at him.  Shit.  They've been caught.  Again.

DUKE
Car trouble?

Snake looks over the hood.  There's the Duke.  With a dozen guards.
Brain steps out.

BRAIN
Hi, Duke.

DUKE
This whole deal of yours is over, Snake.  You and Brain just say good-
bye to each other.

The Duke turns away and loses aim of his gun for a moment.  At that
moment, Snake pulls a gun and fires at the steam vent.  At the same
time, Maggie slams the hood shut on the guard with the crossbow.  Steam
flies everywhere, enough for cover.  The four of them run for it.  The
Duke runs after them.

EXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT
A cab pulls up.  Its radio is playing "American Bandstand".  Guess who's
driving?  You got it!

The group of four runs up to the cab.  Snake runs around and makes
Cabbie scoot over.  He wants to drive.  Cabbie looks shocked.

PRESIDENT
GO, GO!

The Duke and his followers arrive too late.

INT. CAB -- NIGHT

BRAIN
(trying to explain the map)
...and then there's three more...

Snake waves him off.  Cabbie's trying to make conversation.

MAGGIE
They're behind us --

BRAIN
They come in groups of threes!

Snake pops the American Bandstand tape out of the tape player and puts
it in his pocket.

SNAKE
Where's the tape, Brain?

CABBIE
What tape?

SNAKE
Where is it?

BRAIN
Tape...

PRESIDENT
The tape from the briefcase!

CABBIE
Oh, that tape!

He pulls it out of his pocket.

CABBIE
Here it is!

Cabbie hands it to Snake.  Brain laughs, trying to cover his ass.

BRAIN
You traded away your hat for it!

CABBIE
How'd you know?

BRAIN
See, see!

Snake pops it into the deck.  It begins spewing out information.  It's
the right one.  He slips it into his pocket.

PRESIDENT
Here, give me that tape!

HA!  No way!

SNAKE
Not just yet.

Snake checks his life clock.  23:20. 19. 18. 17.  Didn't that guy say 15
minutes before the last hour was up?  But Hauk said they'd been playing
with this, so the 15 minutes was built in already.  Still, 23 minutes.
That's cutting it pretty fucking close.

EXT. CAB -- NIGHT
Snake races as fast as the cab can go.

INT. CAB -- NIGHT
Snake checks to make sure they're not being followed too closely.
They're not.  The Duke is behind, but he's FAR behind.

CABBIE
Easy... easy!

BRAIN
Go for it, Snake!

EXT. 69TH STREET BRIDGE -- NIGHT
Snake jumps the car over the first obstacle.  Cabbie looks like he's
having a heart attack.

Snake swerves on Brain's direction.  So far so good.  A mine goes off,
but it's behind them.

The Duke goes forward.  He's going by the seat of his pants.  But he
knows the general direction of how Snake went.  A mine goes off behind
him, too.

INT. CAB -- NIGHT
Brain reads the map.  Cabbie continues to freak out.

CABBIE
You've got to slow down a little, Snake...

BRAIN
I think there are three mines ahead, Snake.

MAGGIE
You think?!

EXT. 69TH STREET BRIDGE -- NIGHT
The Duke continues in pursuit.

INT. CAB -- NIGHT

BRAIN
Stay left, stay left, stay left, and then jog right when I tell you.

CABBIE
You're pushing her too hard, Snake.

BRAIN
OK, OK, NOW!

EXT. 69TH STREET BRIDGE -- NIGHT
The cab explodes, being cut right in half.  Everyone makes it except
Cabbie.  Cabbie had been driving that very same cab for thirty years.
He died with it.

The President, Snake, Maggie and Brain all keep going on foot.

BRAIN
I said JOG RIGHT!... you asshole.

Brain leads the way as they keep crossing the bridge.

BRAIN
Stay to the right, stay to the right, now jog left.  Hold it, left...
left... LEFT, DAMMIT!

The other three go right.  Brain goes left and a mine explodes under
him.  Maggie walks up to the body in shock.  Snake limps up to her.

MAGGIE
Brain...

SNAKE
Keep moving...

The Duke's car is coming.  Snake checks his life clock

SNAKE
Maggie... he's dead.  Come on.

Maggie calmly holds out her hand.  Snake smiles and hands her his gun.
His grin grows.  It's one of respect for what she's about to do.  He
runs off after the President.

Maggie walks around to Brain, then steps in front of him.  She points
the gun at the Duke's car.  The first three shots don't connect.  The
fourth nails the headlight, and then the Duke runs her over.  He keeps
going.

INT. BASE -- NIGHT
Rehme runs up to Hauk and the Vice President.

REHME
Station 19!  They spotted two cars on the 69th street bridge.

HAUK
Is it Plissken?

REHME
Taxicab and a Cadillac.  Taxi hit a mine.  There's four people on foot.

VICE PRESIDENT
Fourteen minutes...

HAUK
Get a jeep with a winch over there fast.

He pulls out a phone.

HAUK
Strombaerden!  Get over to Station 19.  They're coming across the
bridge.

EXT. 69TH STREET BRIDGE -- NIGHT
The President and Snake run on.

EXT. WALL -- NIGHT
A jeep pulls up.  Rehme's voice comes up over the loudspeaker.  The
guards on the jeep ready the winch.

REHME
 This is Rehme, Security Control.  We are in a standby situation.
Repeat.  We are in a standby situation.  All helicopters, down.  Wall
guard, do not fire on prisoners.  Repeat, do not fire on prisoners.  All
vehicles, stand by.  Repeat, stand by.

EXT. 69TH STREET BRIDGE -- NIGHT
Snake and the President are close enough to the wall to hear all this.

EXT. WALL -- NIGHT
The wall guards grab the rope and prepare to lower it for the President
and Snake.

EXT. 69TH STREET BRIDGE -- NIGHT
Snake pushes the President up to the wall.  The winch comes down and
Snake helps the President into it first.  The President goes up and
over.  Snake's life clock reads 1:32.  But he doesn't have time to watch
seconds tick away because the Duke is right behind him firing at him.
Snake ducks for cover.  The wall guards die.  The winch comes down
again, and the Duke sees it.  He starts toward it.  Snake tackles him
and beats him up, dazing him but not knocking him out.  He grabs the
winch.

EXT. WALL -- NIGHT
A hand stops the winch from moving.

EXT. 69TH STREET BRIDGE -- NIGHT
Snake comes to a stop.  He panics and starts pulling on the winch line.
The Duke comes to and stands up.  But he can't get anywhere because the
President has found a machine gun and is now firing away.  He is very
accurate.  He nails the Duke right away but keeps firing.

PRESIDENT
(manic voice)
Yeah, hey, Number One!  You're the Duke!  You're the Duke!

The President calms down somewhat.

PRESIDENT
You're... the Duke... You're A-Number-One.

The President starts the winch again.  Snake climbs up and gets over as
fast as he can without injuring himself.

EXT. WALL -- NIGHT
Hauk and the medic pull up with the machine.  Hauk interrupts the medic.

HAUK
The tape, Plissken.

Snake reaches into his pocket, grabs the tape, and hands it to Hauk.  He
is furious.  As soon as Hauk has the tape, he lets the medic come back.
He holds up two medal pads to Snake's neck.  They buzz, they buzz
louder, and then he takes them away.

MEDIC
That's it.

Snake continues to pant and fume.  He stares at them, then lifts his
wrist to look at his life clock.  2 seconds.  One second.

Beep.

Nothing.

Snake lowers his wrist.

EXT. PRESIDENT'S PRESS CONFERENCE SITE -- NIGHT
A jeep pulls Rehme up.  He jogs to the President, who is being shaved
and prepared for broadcast.

REHME
I radioed ahead, Mr. President.  They know the situation.  They're
waiting for your broadcast.

PRESIDENT
Yeah.

Snake approaches.  The President nods.

PRESIDENT
Oh, it's all right.

Snake walks up and looks the President straight in the eye.

PRESIDENT
I, uh... I want to thank you.  Anything you want... you just name it.

SNAKE
Just a moment of your time.

AIDE
Three minutes, sir.

PRESIDENT
Yes?

SNAKE
We did get you out.  A lot of people died in the process.  I just
wondered how you felt about it.

PRESIDENT
I want to thank them.  This nation appreciates their sacrifice.

The President is full of shit after all.  Snake has reason for his
cynicism.  The President is uncomfortable with Snake's glare and it
shows.

PRESIDENT
Look, uh, I'm on the air in...
(questioning his aide)
Two and a half minutes?

AIDE
Yes, sir.

Snake lights a cigarette and walks away.  Rehme watches.

EXT. BASE -- NIGHT
Snake walks away.  Hauk stands nearby.  Snake stops in his tracks.

HAUK
You going to kill me now, Snake?

SNAKE
I'm too tired.  Maybe later.

HAUK
I've got another deal for you.  I want you to think it over while you're
resting.  I want to give you a job.  We'd make one hell of a team,
Snake.

SNAKE
(glaring)
The name's Plissken.

He limps away.

EXT. PRESIDENT'S PRESS CONFERENCE SITE -- NIGHT
The President looks suitably freshened up.  He's even smiling a little.

AIDE
You're on camera, Mr. President.

PRESIDENT
Good evening.  Although I shall not be present at this historic summit
meeting, I present this, in the hope that our great nations may learn to
live in peace.

He pops in the tape and presses the "PLAY" button...

...and out comes "American Bandstand".

The President's face goes slack.  His career's over.

EXT. BASE -- NIGHT
Snake keeps limping.  He pulls a tape out of his pocket, yanks the
magnetic tape out, winds it around his hand, rips it to shreds, and
throws the tape away.

FADE OUT.
