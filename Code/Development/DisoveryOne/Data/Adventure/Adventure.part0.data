          EXT. CROWD SCENES. VARIOUS.


          A massive crowd, it could be a sports stadium, a u2 farewell
          show or new year's eve on copacabana beach, but whatever it
          is there are thousands and thousands of us. A mexican wave
          erupts success, celebration, with so many involved it's
          impossible to pick out anyone individually. Critical mass
          cyclists, easter crowds at st. Peter's basilica, nyc
          marathon, 4,000 flash mobbers doing the silent disco at
          london's victoria station, india's kumbh mela, macy's
          thanksgiving day parade, raves, subway parties, the daytona
          500. . . . Gradually the screen splits into 2, and then 3,
          though at times there appears to be no division at all.

          An overhead shot of a crammed freeway gives way to a single
          vehicle, a 98 Toyota Tacoma, red and white with a topper.

          OPENING TITLES ARE A SERIES OF TRIPTYCHS FEATURING ALL THE

          INTERCUT WITH ADVERTS SOME FROM THE BILLBOARDS ARON'S VAN
          PASSES, SOME FROM TELEVISION AND SOME FROM THE RADIO. AND,
          OF COURSE, ALL THESE INTERCUT WITH ARON AND HIS TRUCK. AND
          THE LANDSCAPE.

                         

          A TITLE CARD READS:
          'Utah. The Canyonlands. The slickrock desert. The red dust
          and the burnt cliffs and the lonely sky-all that which lies
          beyond the end of the roads.'

          INT. ARON'S TRUCK. NIGHT.

          At the southwest edge of Green River, Aron Ralston drives
          under the interstate into a landscape of obscurity. He looks
          to his right and left, not a single light perforates the
          absolute blackness of the San Rafael Desert.

          Slowly, images from the Great Gallery materialise on
          different parts of the Triptych - petroglyphs and
          pictographs; dozens of 8-10 ft high Superhumans hovering over
          groups of indistinct animals, dominating beasts and onlookers
          alike with their long, dark bodies, broad shoulders, and
          haunting eyes.

          Rushing across the desert grooves, pulling, snatching, hard
          left and right, the rear of the truck fishtails madly.
          Curves, swoops and sandy washes kick up dust clouds as
          everything in the truck flies all over the place. Except his
          bike, locked down and braced solid.

          Suddenly a small brown sign flashes past. He kicks down on
          the brakes and reverses back. It's the sign pointing out the
          road spur to Horseshoe and Blue John Canyons.

          He glides to a flat spot near the sign board welcoming
          visitors to the Horseshoe Canyon quadrant of Canyonlands
          National Park.
          He whips into the back of the truck and flings everything out

          It's still like a wild road movie, but now on a bicycle.
          Having parked his motorized transport he ploughs into the
          land like an ad for extreme sports. Past bikers, he vanishes
          temporarily in their dust cloud, he wears a bandana across
          his face as the bikers pass by... a final telephone box, past
          remnants of those who tried to settle or work this
          unforgiving land; Aborigines, frontier settlers, ranchers...
          all driven away from a heartland he ploughs into.......

          Wearing a pair of beat-up running shoes and thick wool-blend
          socks, Lycra biking shorts and a Phish tee shirt he has a
          back pack with equipment but hydrates through a gallon of
          water stored in an insulated three litre CamelBak hydration
          pouch which he sucks on without stopping.

          His bike pummels the canyon landscape and you get a sense of
          the exhilaration this man gets from pitting himself alone
          against what nature can offer. He's clearly a fit and daring
          young man and these are his kicks.

          Even uphill he hammers his way up the sandstone. Gasping for
          oxygen, his legs screaming for rest, he pushes and pushes
          until the crest and then down, down, instant speed and he can
          suck on his water again. Part of a massive clan who define
          themselves not by what they are, but by what they do. In a
          way, he's an action movie personified and the opening should
          be shot and cut to provide adrenaline in spadefuls.

          Suddenly, he hits a sand trap and hurtles forward over the
          handle bars, face first into the sand, his toe clips and
          momentum brings the bike with him. The bike has him trapped
          on the desert floor like a takedown in wrestling. He submits,
          landing nose deep in the sand. He sits up, looks around
          quickly to see if anyone saw. Pulls out his camera from his
          bag and takes a a self-portrait snap of the mess.

          At what seems like the only tree for miles he U-locks his
          bike in the shade, pockets the keys, scoffs a muffin and
          heads off into the desert.

          He approaches the crest of a sand gulley and sees below him,
          just 30 yards down the canyon, 2 fellow hikers. He looks
          around. All of them in the middle of nowhere it seems.

          He can see now it's 2 girls passing a map back and forth
          between them. He rushes towards them, initially above them as
          he walks along side. They're aware of him before he arrives:

                          ARON
           Hey. Are you doing the east pike?
           Can I come along with you for a
           while?
          The girls don't reply, just look at each other.

           Yeah, you surprised us, sneaking up
           like that.

           It's kind of nervy seeing a lone
           guy walking up to you in the middle
           of the desert.

                         

                          ARON
           Yeah, I know, I mean there's no one
           around for 50 miles.

          They all laugh.

                          ARON
           Let me guess... You're here for

           There's thousands of holds but you
           can't see them until you're almost
           upside down and then they just keep
           appearing... it's a bit of a act of

          We've been moving towards him as he rushes towards us, spider
          style. He's stripped to his underwear. He's lithe to say
          the least. We can't see the girls or what's underneath us
          but there's a feeling of the vertiginous, as much from the
          weird echo and the sense of reflected light as from the scale
          of the dome.

                          ARON (CONT'D)
           ... and the thing is, when you get
           to the middle...
          He lets go.

                         

                          ARON (CONT'D)
           ... there aren't any more.
          We spin and watch him fall into the most exquisite emerald
          pool 60 feet below.

          Aron fills the cathedral dome with his version of a Phish
          song at the top of his voice. Kristi strips to her underwear
          and traverses away from Megan.

          heading out arachnid-style to the centre. Before she gets
          there Megan appears too. She's left everything on except her
          shoes.

                         
          They crash into the pool one after the other. They bob
          together in the centre, the light seems to come from beneath
          them and ripple over the heavenly ceiling.

           one foot on each wall then squat
           onto your right heel, now your
           butt's on the wall, so you can move

           your left foot under your butt
           lower down and scootch your butt
           down - watch that black part, it's
           slick, slime, try not to get it on
           your shoes - if you can get to
           these bomber handholds here it's
           like an elevator shaft and just
           think friction to control the

          strong applause at the Phish live concert in Las Vegas, fills
          his head and ours.
          He's heard it many times as he alternatively
          anticipates/answers all the dialogue preamble mixed over the
          applause...

                         

                          CD RECORDING
           Good evening Las Vegas... are you
           having a good time? Are you ready
           for PHISH!
          Whether we are or not, the first song begins on a wave of
          adoration from his fellow Phish fans. He sings along.

          Aron keeps descending, the canyon walls growing taller and
          closer, into the narrowing slot canyon.

          A dry waterfall, many months since it's seen rain. A drop of
          maybe 12/15 ft with no obvious climb down. Way beyond his
          reach and jammed into the walls of the canyon is an enormous
          S-shaped log, sand bleached and wind dried it looks like a
          massive reptile making its way down the canyon. Beyond it,
          Aron can see his route down disappearing into narrowing
          darkness.

          To reduce the drop he scrambles down clinging to the edge,
          pushes away and drops the final 6 feet or so landing in a
          fine cloud of sand. Nothing to it, second nature.

          He spins and continues, seeing the first huge chockstones,
          the size of vans, their noses buried in the floor of the
          canyon like unexploded bombs. He easily scrambles over one
          and around another-tight fit but he's skinny.

          The slot is now just 4ft wide and as he stops to look at
          massive tree logs jammed at strange angles high above him and
          silhouetted against the blue cloudless sky, he drinks deeply
          from his water bottle.

          On we go and so does the concert. He pumps the air unaware
          as we track above him - it's like the canyon in Star Wars and
          he's Anakin feeling the force. One set of chockstones leads
          to another and he rapidly negotiates them like an obstacle
          race - until there's one the size of a big refrigerator which
          has been stopped by the walls 18 inches from the floor.

          Over or under? He drops to his belly and squeezes
          underneath, rucking the sandy floor in front of him. He's
          halfway, his chest rising out the far side when suddenly he
          can't move. The music jams and loops on 2 notes like bad
          techno. He pushes but nothing.

                         
          He reaches back with his hand and releases a part of his
          rucksack strap that's snagged. And the music releases too.
          He squat-jumps out and brushes off the sand.

                         
          No panic -a nothing moment.

          We see a section of the canyon and the tiny figure of Aron
          moving within it. We track in and elide into a graphic view
          of him chimneying his way along the canyon now only 3 ft wide
          at most. It's a chance to see his skill and thirst for
          climbing. And to see how deep he's going.

          He uses his legs, back and natural body weight to body walk
          along and down the towering walls.

          He's moving towards a final chockstone below him jammed in
          the gap. You can see the way he's thinking: it's about the
          size of a bus wheel and used as a platform will help him
          reduce the 10 foot drop and get quickly down into the next
          section.

          Just as he dangles there's a scraping sound, small but close,
          too close and the stone judders towards him, pulled by the
          torque of his weight on his side, rotating.
          Instantly and instinctively he lets go and drops. Like he's
          trying to detach a mine dragging him to the sea floor.

          His arms rise to protect his head but his eyes remain open
          and through his fingers we see the next 3 seconds. The rock's
          face and his.

                         
          It grabs his left hand and flings it against the left wall.
          He pulls it away as the rock ricochets against the canyon and
          careers towards his right arm which he raises, to compensate
          for withdrawing the left, and to protect his head.

                         
          The rock smashes the right hand and wrist against the wall
          and drags it down the remaining distance. Like a cheese
          grater it tears the skin from the back of the hand and the
          forearm, decorating the wall. Aron is powerless to stop its
          force and he lands on his feet allowing the rock to jam in
          front of him with his hand held against the canyon wall by
          the stone.

                         
          All this happens too quickly. We can hardly register what's

          He reverses the fraction and collapses in sweat and blood,
          knees bleeding, good fingers lacerated. But he remains
          upright, attached. Unable to physically collapse.
          Grabs his shirt and wipes sweat away and goes to drink. He
          hula-hoops out of his backpack to get access to the water,
          gulps down 3 full throatfulls - stops mid 4th and backwashes

          He examines the boulder at each point he can reach,
          stretching and contorting to see into his crushed and
          wretched hand where his thumb is visible above and his little
          finger below. No matter how much he touches them, there is
          no feeling. He prods up and down to see what feeling is left
          and where it stops. Comparing left hand to where the right
          hand is trapped to measure the width of his right wrist - now
          smaller than the width of his little finger on his right
          hand. He can barely get the little finger of his left hand in

          him assess the rock and the wall and his hand in between it.
          He picks a point and begins to chip away with the knife.
          He's back - energy, movement, purpose, action makes him
          happy. He occasionally stops to look at his left hand,
          swollen and puffy and constantly in need of flexing. He gets
          into a rhythm of 'tick,tick,tick', flex and back again,
          `tick,tick,tick'

          In a huge close up of this eye he can see in the foreground
          that there's a pile of steel filings from the knife itself,
          almost as big as the dust from the ground -

                          ARON
           Not good.
          He blows the whole lot into our face with a mighty gust.

           When in a hole....
          Alternative; he starts digging away at the wall instead, same
          result.

           Fuck. It's hard as iron.

          Tapping a rock in his hand onto the top of the knife as he
          balances it against the wall or with his mouth. Weird close
          angles as he almost taps the side of his eye socket.
          Suddenly, he hammers down with ten times more force onto the
          handle of the knife, the rock explodes in his hand, showering
          pick dust over everything, and bouncing the knife off the
          rock. Once again, gravity takes over. The knife hits his
          shorts and as he moves to grab it, he misses it and knocks it
          further round the back of his leg. He pivots and turns to try
          and catch it but gravity is quicker than his restricted twist
          and it falls into a hole between the rounded rocks near his
          left foot -

                          ARON

          The knife is visible in the crack below and behind his right
          leg but he can't twist to get anywhere near it. He tries to
          pull the canyon wall off balance to get closer. No chance.

          He pulls off his right sock and shoe and tries to squeeze his
          foot into the hole. Too big. Size 10. He looks upward. He
          can't believe he's done it.

          We're on a level with the knife in the little hole beneath
          his feet. An enormous overhead light switches on (Aron's
          headlamp placed above to let him see). The stick enters from
          top of screen and nudges the knife in a semi circle. It's a
          bit Punch and Judy if it wasn't so fucking serious. Huge
          shadows. No success. The knife remains where it is. Maybe an
          ant races across it.

                         
          Pause.
          The stick withdraws.

          The stick re-enters with the top of it almost broken off,
          acting like a hook, we push in on the knife as the stick
          hooks through the little ring at the end of the knife. It

          holding the stick like a chopstick lift the knife out and up
          tremulously, breathlessly, towards his good arm. He picks it
          off the stick gently. Big smile. First one.

          We pass through the transparent title on our way along the
          canyon. Half dark. We're on a wind blowing dust through the
          canyon walls, to find a miner in the distance digging into
          the rock. It's Aron of course, and his head-lamp is filled
          with the dust swirling through. He's using the shorter file
          from the multi tool and has tied a shoe lace to his wrist and
          looped through the ring at the end of the tool. He pulls his
          cap down, to keep most of the dust out of his eyes. His lips
          are caked but he keeps blowing on his arm, to keep it clear.

          Daylight, a lunar landscape almost, though with patches of
          green and giant boulders, Aron whom we sense only by being
          around his shoulder is out walking with his friend, Mark Von
          Eeckhout through this field of boulders. They come upon one
          the size of a house buried nose deep in the field.

          Chip,chip,chip; stretches his arm, flexes his legs,
          tick,tick,tick. He changes the blade, prising suddenly at a
          section of the rock with his file. It bites and a dime size
          shred chip of rock arcs through the night light. He catches
          it perfectly on his right elbow.

           Cool.
          He picks it off his arm and places it on top of the rock next
          to where he's working. It's a grain of sand on the seashore
          but it's something.

          He's stepped into his harness and is throwing 30ft of rope up
          towards us. There's a tangle of knots and carabiners looking
          for purchase close to camera. Each time it falls back all
          the way. He persists, each time, varying his line of attack
          fractionally.
          Finally it catches.

                         
          He pulls gently at first, then fiercely, it holds and we

          He looks at ithe sunbeam as though it's his prey and it might
          run away. It makes it's way along the canyon walls towards
          him. He's very still. But it shifts across the floor and
          it's going to miss him. He whips off his left shoe and sock
          and pushes it towards the coming light. Slowly it climbs and
          caresses his ankle and lower calf. He pulls the other sock
          off and alternates the feet. He looks like he's doing yoga.
          As it leaves him passing overhead it suddenly bursts into the

           What you're looking at there is my
           arm, going into the rock... and
           there it is, stuck. It's been
           without circulation for 24 hours.

           Yeah, I have about a third of a

                          ARON
           So the way I see it... there's kind
           of four things happening here... I
           tried to move it with some
           rigging... useless... and I tried
           chipping away at the rock... I
           think part of the problem is, is
           that my hand is actually supporting
           the rock. Which means every time I
           chip away the rock moves a bit and
           settles onto my hand again. I
           can't feel it happening but
           microscopically, it seems to be,
           because the little gap over there
           between the rock and the wall seems
           to be getting smaller. And this
           chockstone is the hardest thing
           here.

           So the third thing left was to cut
           my arm off.

           I don't know whether I could do
           that but it's pretty much suicide.
           It's four hours to my vehicle that
           way and with very difficult
           climbing with one hand and the bike
           is like two, two and a half hours,
           that way but the climbing... fourth
           class climbing... which I think
           will be probably impossible with
           one hand... between the blood loss
           and the dehydration I think I would
           die if I cut off my arm.

          He pulls his bag off and pulls his water bottle out of the
          ground where he has half-buried it. It won't open. He can't
          unscrew it. He mutters, cursing himself for tightening the
          lid too much. He puts it between his teeth and levers with
          his head, but nothing. Is his strength vanishing so quickly?

                         
          He looks at his puffy left hand... there's a tremble in it.
          He shakes it to get rid of the tremble and jams the bottle
          between his legs. He uses a bit of cloth to give his hand
          better purchase on the top. We're tight on the neck of the
          bottle as it releases, finally and he lifts it, slowly,
          almost ceremonially. Controlling the tilt, a half-mouthful
          of water slides onto his tongue. He tilts the bottle back
          towards upright but not the whole way. He waits. Circulating
          the splash of water around his mouth.

          He watches them devour him and then he clears them away from
          his hand. Suddenly breaks and he's busy now well before
          sunrise. In the grey-white, soft morning he is involved in
          recycling his overnight insulation gear into a crude lift and
          pulley.
          Obsessive, inventive, analytical, he constantly adjusts and
          adds and subtracts, and cannibalizes. Undoing and tieing
          knots with his teeth and hand. Each time nothing happens to

           I didn't get to hear firsthand how
           your championships went, but I
           heard from Mom that you placed very
           well at the national competitions,
           that you were tenth overall in
           speech and debate in the nation.
           Hot damn, girl. I'm very proud of
           you. Not just for that but for who
           you are.

                          ARON
           I've been thinking about what my
           friend Rob in Aspen says to me
           several... frequently.. Several times
           that, confusingly,
           'It's not what you do but who you
           are'.
           I kind of got hung up on that a
           lot, because I always thought who I
           was, was very much wrapped up with
           what I did. That I was happy
           because of the things that I did
           that made me happy. If things you
           do make you happy, then they can
           also make you unhappy. I think
           that's why I found myself being as
           ambitious and energetic -

          As he loses track of what he's saying and then catches up,
          the canyon has become noticeably darker. He's oblivious.

           I did want to say, on the

          We're many miles away, the dust spits as though hit by silent
          bullet tracer fire. Raindrops gathering and multiplying,
          soaking and bouncing off the desert floor, they skim and slip
          into a groove and then another, the slit instantly fills and
          water drops crash on the new surface. The spillage spreads
          and fills everything near it. We tilt up, the sky is furious
          black, and murderous. Lightning arcs across hundreds of
          miles.

          Aron's sky darkens above him. Instantly plunging him into a
          dark, violet nether-light. He looks up the canyon as he
          pulls at his arm in panic and tries to gather his laid-out
          possessions into his backpack. Simultaneously he opens his
          mouth to gather any drops he can into his parched throat.

          gulleys, looking for something to fill, for somewhere to
          escape to.

          unimaginable tons of water over the lips of the canyon above
          it. The walls glisten with force as the canyon becomes a 6FT
          wall of churning mud, hurtling towards the chockstones. The
          smaller ones are picked up and tossed downstream, smashing
          and breaking on the bigger ones.

          of drink. And melting ice in huge buckets with bottles of
          beer floating around in them. And orange juice, and
          popsicles. And melon, and lemon and lime. And grapefruit

          Aron ducks out of his head-bag and shakes his water bottle.
          Something he always does - to check the sound of real water.
          To make sure he hasn't drunk it all without knowing. He
          opens, tilts and holds as always and then ritualistically
          removes his contact lenses and washes them in his mouth.
          Suddenly a shiver tears across him like an attack dog. He
          coughs a lens out and as he tries to catch it before it goes
          into the sand he tips the bottle in his lap.
          He hasn't put the top on fully. It goes horizontal on his
          shorts and a leak of the sacred fluid darkens his tan shorts.
          He whips it upright.

                          ARON
           (furious at himself)
           Fuck a nut, Aron. Pay fucking
           attention - look what you did?
          He stares at the stain - with all the dirt on his shorts it's
          already paste. He screws the lid on slowly and can barely be
          bothered to lift his lens into his mouth.

          The image shifts with the lens to night, everything short
          focus. Only one thing at a time clear, everything else
          diffuse. No idea where we are. We come over Aron's shoulder
          and he's clearly in the deep background of a vehicle. In
          front of him a half a dozen of his friends (boys and
          girls)... and Rana, excitedly chatting. Though we can hear
          nothing.

          Gradually it becomes clear it's night outside. They are all
          undressing in their seats until all are butt naked. The tone
          (we can't hear) is clearly more infantile than sexual. We're
          beginning to see there's a ferocious blizzard outside. And
          we appear to be badly exposed to it. Up a mountain, on the
          crest of a high road... Snow, hail, swirls savagely around
          all sides of the truck. We remain inside. It's warm, the
          heater blows.
          They prepare themselves for a mutual signal, press their
          window buttons. All the windows open and a BLIZZARD explodes
          inside the vehicle.

          Aron joins the morning chorus.

                          ARON
           Good morning everyone! It's 6:45
           Tuesday morning in BJ Canyon. The
           weather is great! I figure by now
           that Leona, my housemate - Hi
           Leona! - has missed me hopefully
           since I didn't show up last night.
           Another hour and a half they'll
           miss me for not showing up for
           work. Hi Brion at work! Best case
           scenario is they notify the police
           and after a 24 hour hold they file
           a report, a missing persons report.
           Which means noon tomorrow it's
           official that I'm gone. I do still
           have the tiniest bit of water left.
           Well, actually, I've resorted...I've
           had a couple pretty good gulps of
           urine that I saved in my Camelbak.
           I sorta let it distill...it tastes
           like hell. So it's 70 hours since
           I left on my bike from Horseshoe
           Trailhead during which time I have
           consumed 3 liters of water and a
           couple mouthfuls of piss.

                         
          Pause.
           Did I say the weather is great?
           Well, it is. Though flash floods
           potential is still present. There's
           4-prong major canyons upstream from
           me that all converge in this 3 foot
           wide gap where I am. The rock I
           pulled down on top of me, it was
           put there by flood.

                          PAUSE
           Still, I'd get a drink.
          He shudders, it's ridiculous.
          Then composes himself during a long blink and looks straight
          at the camera.

                          ARON (CONT'D)
           Mom, Dad, I really love you guys.
           I wanted to take this time to say
           the times we've spent together have
           been awesome. I haven't appreciated
           you in my own heart the way I know
           I could. Mom, I love you. I wish
           I'd returned all of your calls,
           ever.

           I wish I had learned some lessons
           more astutely, more rapidly, than I
           did. I love you. I'll always be
           with you.

          Switches off the camera.
          He charges into setting up the 6:1 haul system again. Much
          quicker this time. He clears the rope - the rock - of his
          possessions and puts his sunglasses on.

                          ARON
           Ready for lift-off.
          He bounces his full weight in the stirrups and pulls on the
          haul line. It looks a better set up.

                          ARON (CONT'D)
           Come on, move, dammit.

                         
          Nothing. He stops. And stares directly at the knife below
          him. Absolute stillness. Nothing moves. Not him. Not even
          the insects.

          Without warning he suddenly tourniquets his arm again . Twice
          around the fore arm, knotted twice and clipped with a
          carabiner that he twists 6 times. He secures the fix by
          attaching the purple webbing.

          He folds open the knife, grasps it in his fist and picking a
          spot just above the rock's grip on his right wrist, he
          hesitates and then violently plunges the blade into his arm
          up to the hilt.

                         
          He lets go leaving the knife embedded. He swoons and stares
          at it. He slowly grasps the tool more firmly and wriggles it
          slightly, the blade connects with something hard. He taps the
          knife down and feels it knocking on the radius of his upper
          forearm bone.
          He puts his ear close and we can hear the little thocking
          sound.

                         

                          ARON
           Whoa, that's the bone.
          He pulls the knife out opening the wound more. There's barely
          any blood. He pokes at the gash with the tool.

           Ouch!

                         
          He can see the epidermis, thick and leathery rough. Yellow
          fatty tissue under the skin in a membrane layer around the
          muscle. He thocks, thocks again and some blood finally seeps
          out and blocks his view. He pulls the knife out and thinks.
          He's sweating and puts the tool on top of the chockstone.

                         
          He immediately pulls up his water bottle and stares into it.
          With a little shake he opens it and drinks it all gulping
          open throated. He shakes any last drop down and runs his
          tongue up into the neck. He screws the lid back on and
          loosens the tourniquet. There's no discernible increase in
          blood loss.
          He picks up the video again.

           I made an attempt - a short career
           in surgery, as it turned out -
           those knives are just not anywhere
           close to the task. I've got about
           an inch-wide gash in my arm that
           goes about a half inch deep. I cut
           down through the skin and the fatty
           tissue, and through some of the
           muscle. I think I cut a tendon, but
           I'm not sure.
           I'll never saw through the bones
           with this knife. I tried, anyways.
           It really just didn't go well. The
           tourniquet is relaxed at this
           point. Which actually is a little
           bothersome, considering I'm not
           bleeding that bad, barely at all.
           It's so weird. You'd expect to
           definitely see more pulsing and
           bleeding, but oh well.

          Stops the video and rips a section of his t-shirt to make an

          teeth there's a rush of someone else's noise: the swat of
          wings. He grabs the camera just in time to catch the very end
          of the raven's flight 70 ft above his head.

          Things seem to loop and his close-ups almost seem to watch
          the loops happening again and again. This is particularly
          true inside the head bag at night. When his light is switched

          When it's off we establish a night vision, of green, of blue,

          see Aron completing his obit. Scratched on wall of canyon:
          Aron Oct 75 => APR 03 RIP.
          As we reverse back on Aron in the canyon there's a burst of
          light and color beyond him and on the sofa in the canyon a
          little boy sits. He's blond, about 3 and in a red polo shirt.
          He looks like Aron.
          Aron walks towards him, the sunlight hits his face like a
          train and Aron looks up to it but keeps moving towards the
          boy, walking downhill towards the sofa. The boy leaps off the
          sofa and comes running to Aron.

          He scoops the boy up with his left arm and balances him
          around his shoulders with his right handed stump. The boy
          holds Aron's arms in his little hands and they prance around
          the sofa, they giggle and shout playing bulls, giraffes,
          elephants, jousting knights, pretending to walk downhill
          behind the sofa. Like any father in any park. [A PERFECT POP
          SONG, BLONDIE MAYBE, PLAYS IN THE DISTANCE]. Like any father
          in any park.
          Aron watches the image begin to fade. He switches on the
          light but its low and feeble.
          As the images on the inside of the bag fade so too does
          Aron's lamp. He tries to warm it up but it fades to black. He
          holds his breath.

          It's strangely still even by the canyon's standards. He peeks
          out from his head bag; his contacts are cloudy and sore to
          blink.

                         
          You can hear him blink. Eye socket rasping against eyeball.
          The head lolls like he's lost control of the neck muscles.
          His tongue rasps as he flexes his mouth to prevent sealing.

           to do this descent by myself. I
           chose not to tell anyone where I
           was going. I chose to turn away
           from the women who were there to
           keep me from getting in this

          He looks at his 'good' hand. It's swollen and angry red like
          an inflated prosthetic on top and around of his real hand. He
          takes off his shoe and pulls the sock over his hand to
          cushion his palm and picks up the black rounded hammer rock
          again. Ignoring the pain he starts hammering at the rock
          surface. SMASH. MAD NOW.

                          ARON
           I hate this rock.
          The rage blooms purple in his mind.

                          ARON (CONT'D)

          His face swells with anger, nostrils flaring.

           I hate this fucking canyon.

                         
          A small mushroom cloud of pulverized grit and dust erupts
          each time.

                         

                          ARON (CONT'D)

          The sock quickly disintegrates with friction as he hammers
          and hammers.

           I hate this fucking mess.

                         
          Finally he stops but his fingers are paralyzed, fused rigid
          around the rock. He pulls them off with his teeth and the
          stone drops to his feet.

                         
          There's a thick layer of dust across the top of the stone and
          his right arm. He tries to blow it away. He fails. Tired,
          it's too thick and he's too dehydrated. He picks up his knife
          and using this starts sweeping the grit off his thumb. As he
          cleans up he accidentally rips away a thin piece of decayed
          flesh. It peels back a long way like a skin of boiled milk.
          The insects start to gather.

          death. He looks at the gangrene attached to him, poisoning
          him.

           ARON (QUIET, CLEAR) (CONT'D)
           Get rid of it Aron, it's dead, it's
           garbage.
          He drops to his haunches but the webbing stops him at his
          waist. He detaches it and drops down again, almost able to
          squat. His trapped arm is the only thing preventing that.
          His face is suddenly open.

                         
          He pushes and pushes with his left hand under the boulder to
          create maximum downward force on his right arm. Hard, harder,
          HARDER. It looks insane, unnatural and painful, but he says
          nothing.

                         

                         POW
          Like a gunshot in the canyon, the bone breaks. The sound
          ricochets. He rises and sees the bone pushing up violently
          against the skin. He feels it. It's a serrated, but clean,
          successful break.
          Still he says nothing.

                         
          Now he humps his body up and over the chockstone, smearing
          his feet, one with a shoe, one without, against the wall, he
          pushes grabbing further and further round the dark side of
          the chockstone, pulling with a silent, furious intensity.
          Hard, then harder, and HARDER.

                         

                         

                         

                         BANG
          A second gun shot smashes around the canyon. He's sweating
          heavily and yet euphoric, possessed. He checks the underneath
          of the arm. It's broken too. Around the same place.
          He can rotate his forearm like a shaft inside a housing.
          Giving himself no time to wake up he grabs the knife, looks
          at the watch-

           Ok Aron, here we go. You're in it
           now.

                         
          He pushes the knife hard, to the hilt, in between 2 veins on
          his wrist.
          Fuck knows where the sweat is coming from but it's pouring
          out of him.
          Sawing downwards he makes as large a hole as he can without
          tearing any of the noodle like veins. He puts the knife in
          his teeth and pokes his left forefinger and thumb inside his
          right arm.
          Like a mechanic he looks to analyse and then he works by feel
          only.

                         
          His sweat falls on his knife mixing with the blood.
          He pulls muscle nearer the surface allowing his knife to
          slice and pare away at a pinky 'finger-sized' fragment bit by
          bit. It takes a dozen actions, each time the knife goes back
          to his teeth.
          Sort. Pinch. Rotate. Slice.

                         
          There's not a lot of blood. But he keeps working and working.
          Once the blood increases he puts the knife down on top of the
          rock and swiftly ties his tourniquet.

                         
          He's silent, refusing to verbalize the pain.

          He can't cut the tendon, no matter how hard he slices. But
          nothing will stop his addiction to surgery now. He folds in
          and swaps the blade for the pliers. He uses them to bite into
          an edge of the yellowy tendon. Then squeezing and twisting he
          tears away a fragment.

          He puts the knife in and pulls it toward him, an inch, two
          inches, it lengthens like pulling a guitar string.
          Unimaginable pain builds in his whole body, like he's pushing
          his arm into a cauldron of magma...

           68.

                         

                         
          (It's difficult to tell because everything is so tight and
          claustrophobic but maybe the boy is there intermittently
          riding his shoulders slipping across and around him, or
          obstructed by the boulder and stopped from getting to Aron)
          ...until it breaks. He shudders in shock and drops everything
          for minutes. His head lolls forward dripping. His mind
          swarming with trauma.
          And then he's back on the last action stretching the skin of
          his outer wrist tight and sawing the blade into the wall.
          It's a piece of gristle on a cutting board.
          Everything now is forcing us towards the boulder, cramping us
          in with him impossibly close, he's sweating and heaving, his
          vision blurring with tears, his contacts failing, his breath
          impossibly dry and rasping and then, as simply as this all
          began, his shoulders open and he's free......
          He staggers back, one, two, three steps away from his arm...

                         
          His head swarming with colours, swooning, overpowering. He
          stares at his obituary as he's born again. His feet stagger
          under him like a new foal, an involuntary dance, we see
          colours bleeding and blending in his P.O.V.s and the colours
          invade our shots of him.

          then wrapping that with the yellow webbing he wore as a
          chocker to keep his neck warm in the night. He stuffs the
          repackaged arm into the empty Camelbak backpack and throws

          Packs his bag, water reservoir, full bottle of shiny urine,

          And now the motion and energy and life force of the action
          movie returns...
          It's like Ray Liotta's final day in Goodfellas; relentless,
          frustrating, pressure of life again now he's free from his
          tomb. Deeper and deeper, down and down into the swirling
          scoops of the sandstone. Couple of difficult manoeuvres, lots
          of slipping and bumping, despite his best effort occasionally
          his right shoulder takes the brunt and he stops, winces and
          grunts thru the pain.

                         
          But on he goes, 100 ft of the rope trailing behind him. As
          we follow its progress snaking after him we see specs of
          blood on the lower walls.

                         
          The canyon becomes a chute increasingly steep in which he
          ignores the shrinking daylight above because he has another
          target; the twists and turns of the curricles of sedimented
          sandstone lead to a soft glow, red, translucent, growing and
          growing in intensity. He pushes forward, the tail of rope
          whipping faster and faster along the walls and floor.

          Finally, we burst into the dazzling midday sun on a rock
          shelf halfway up a sheer walled amphitheatre, 200ft high. The
          scale of the slated cliff face opposite is breathtaking, the
          dazzling sunlight poaches the air he sucks in and burns his
          dry eyes.
          He sees, for the first time in his new life, green. The deep
          green of a healthy 50ft tree below him and to his left, and
          he knows. He looks for the bolts drilled into the rock, and
          he knows. Now he can look down. Right to the edge of
          vertiginous drop and there below is a puddle of shallow
          turgid water. Life itself. He wanted it to be there and now
          he's mesmerized by it. A pair of swifts leave the tree and
          zig zag up and around him. He wobbles and has to stop himself
          lunging head first over the precipice. Instead he drops to
          the bolts and kisses them like the pope arriving in a foreign
          land.

                         
          Unravelling the rope of its knots, he's baking in blazing

           70.

          between his teeth and his hand. But he'll die if he can't
          have moisture. He tips the saved urine over himself and
          licking and retching simultaneously he suddenly stops and
          listens. He can hear a shuffling, a zip-zip... The rope is
          uncoiling over the ledge. He put it down to drink. Picking up
          speed the more it falls, there's only a few feet left. He
          lunges across the ledge and catches it just in time. That was
          his future disappearing over the ledge.

          Something's not right. It's a difficult overhang and he's
          awkward and vulnerable with only one useful arm. His bad arm
          catches horribly on the lip of the ledge. Suddenly he starts
          coming fast, faster and then hideously, much too fast,
          accelerating out of control and smashing into the water with
          deadly force.

          swimming with dead leaves and insects, 2 inches deep at most.
          He falls on it with his bottles, filling them and dipping his
          mouth into the water, He washes his head, drinks and fills,
          drinks and gargles, and drinks again-insects, leaves,
          tadpoles, everything. Blood splashes in beside him so out

          shouldered figures painted to enormous scale in all shades of
          tan and maroon. They seem to stare back at him. He salutes
          them in his own way and continues.

                         
          He banks left beneath a colossal alcove high up in the cliff
          face and makes to the flattest ground - there's no shade to
          hide in here.

          He goes to shout but his voice catches. Then a feeble effort
          is lost in the vast scale of the canyon. The figures walk on
          bending and disappearing in the light. He digs deep.

          There's a terrible pause of uncertainty on both sides and
          then he pushes out another heartbreaking -

          The figures begin to run towards him. We watch his face in

          the sight of humans. He mutters to himself.

           Hang in there Aron.
          At they get closer he summons a surge of energy from
          somewhere.

                          ARON (CONT'D)
           My name is Aron Ralston. I was
           trapped by a boulder on Saturday
           and I've been without food and
           water for 5 days. I cut my arm off
           this morning to get free and I've
           lost a lot of blood. I need medical
           attention.

                         
          There's a pause as they look at this refugee from a low
          budget horror movie. He hungrily eyes the water bottles
          attached to their waist bands. This gives them a way in to
          his world. The moment is broken by their offering him their
          water. It pours down his throat bypassing the swallow
          mechanism.

                          ERIK
           We are the Mejers from Holland. At
           the start of the trailhead we
           talked to a ranger who told us
           about a car that was parked in the
           area already for several days and
           that the owner might be missing in
           the canyon. We joked that we would
           keep our eyes open and that we
           would try to find him.
           After a hike of 5.3 kilometres to
           the Great Gallery (Indian rock art)
           where we took some pictures, we
           returned and suddenly heard a noise
           behind us, and after that a voice
           that cried "Help, I need help".
           Monique and I immediately realized
           that this had to be the missing
           person.

          Back now live as Aron wolfs down the cookies and organises
          the Mejers in a series of jump cuts pushing us through the
          final stages-he's brutally practical.

                          ERIK
           We are the Mejers from Holland.
           You should stop and rest.

                          ARON
           No, we need to keep hiking.
           We need a helicopter - who can run
           fastest?- You, go now fast. Take
           him.

           The police at the parking lot

                          ARON
           Do you have a phone?

                          ERIK
           There's no signal for miles.
          Nobody for 6 days and then like London buses another couple
          appears. They too are confronted by:

                          ARON
           Do you have a cell phone?

                          WAYNE
           No. I'm Wayne. I have some medical
           training.

                          ARON
           Is it ok for me to drink so much
           water?

           vomit.
          Aron drinks more and more, he overhears...

                          WAYNE (CONT'D)

                          (TO ERIK)
           Make sure he doesn't pass out.

                          ARON
           I gotta stop and empty my shoes.
           You'll have to tie my shoe lace.
          As he sits his head slumps forward. He's absolutely
          motionless. Wayne and Erik try to talk to him but he can
          barely hear them. A pop song spins round and round distantly.

                         
          He strains to pull his head up, and, staring, drops forward
          to his knees. There it is. Filling his vision like a god.
          Whirling screaming in front of him, dust blasting him as he
          kneels. A HELICOPTER.

          A strange slightly formal man pops out of the helicopter. He
          almost looks like he's part of the Matrix.

                          PILOT
           Are you Aron?

          Aron looks at the beautiful white leather seat before he gets
          in the back of the helicopter. Surreal. It's a startling
          contrast to his Frankenstein, and even now it's not lost on
          him.

                          ARON
           I'm gonna make a terrible mess of
           your seat.

                          PILOT
           Just get in buddy. We're all
           looking for you.

                         
          The helicopter sucks upwards into the sky leaving Wayne,
          Monique, Andy and Erik far below.

           what took you so long to cut it off
           and get one of these.

           Charlie but way too young... and I
           didn't know why but I knew he was
           mine and that this was what lay in
           front of me.
          He looks at her.

                         
          Pause.
          She doesn't say anything.

           No Aron, it's not.

           You know, everyone who cares for
           you, a little bit of them dies each
           time you go back.

          EXT. CONCERT. NIGHT.


                         
          The concert explode into life.

          THE POP SONG PLAYS OVER:
          ` A man will rise, A man will fall...

                         

                         

          INT. UNDERWATER. DAY.

          His face pushing for the surface. He surges up and out of the
          water, to cling by his elbows on the side of the pool. No
          prosthetic.

                         

                         

          SONG CONTINUES OVER:
          ...From the sheer face of love

                         
          Like a fly from a wall'

                         

                         

                         

                          CUT TO:

                         

          EXT. POOL. DAY.


                         

                         
          There in front of him on the grass by the pool is the same
          sofa as in the canyon. On it and around it, his friends and
          family, including Rana. There's so many of them they fill the
          screen. Tucked deep into the sofa, is his son giggling away.
          They smile, simple, silent support for him. He looks right
          back at them.

	FADE IN:

	CREDITS AND MUSIC OVER:

	INT.  AUDIENCE ROOM - GRANADA - DAY

	We start on a man's elegant slipper.  He is seated in a
	splendid chair.  Moving up the stocking leg, we pass the
	garter of Castile, coming to rest on a pair of delicate
	hands.  His fore finger impatiently plays with a large
	topaz ring.  Over this, we hear distant footsteps, echoing
	on marble floors.

									CUT TO:

	A Castilian face:  aquilaine profile, olive complexion,
	dark eyebrows and meticulously sculpted beard.  This is
	TREASURER SANCHEZ.

	A door slams somewhere, the footsteps getting closer.  We
	can now here a subdued conversation.

	TREASURER SANCHEZ stands up as:

	The door opens at the far end of the large gilded room.
	A WOMEN, magnificent in somber taffeta, enters.  QUEEN
	ISABEL OF SPAIN moves towards him.

	He bows slightly as she sits at the end of the large
	table.  She is followed by a PRIEST, BROTHER BUYL, and
	three dignitaries of Church and State.

	All sit beside her.  TREASURER SANCHEZ takes a document
	and starts to read aloud.

	On screen the words:  GRANADA - SPAIN - 1500

					SANCHEZ
			Your Majesty would wish to know the
			true facts concerning the island of
			Hispanola, our first settlement in
			the New World, and the activities
			there of your servant, Christopher
			Columbus, Admiral of the Ocean Sea,
			Governor of that Island.  You will
			remember with what hopes and
			promises he beguiled us -- the truth
			is that he now presides over a state
			of chaos, degradation and madness
			beyond imagining.

	SANCHEZ punctuates each word carefully.

					SANCHEZ
			From the beginning, Columbus proved
			himself incapable of managing the
			affairs of the island.  He appointed
			his brothers to important positions,
			at once injuring the pride and
			dignity of the nobles who had gone
			with him.  He promised to build a
			city, the City of Isabel, named
			after Your Majesty.  What he
			actually built was nothing but a
			collection of huts, and that in the
			wrong place, for all of it was
			easily swept away by rain and mud.
			Is that not so, Brother Buyl?

	The PRIEST nods.

					BROTHER BUYL
			Yes, Your Honor.

					SANCHEZ
			He promised gold.  Not finding the
			easy quantities he promised,
			Columbus commanded each Indian to
			pay an annual tribute.  Most being
			unable to, they were barbarously
			punished, against the express wish
			of Your Christian Majesties...

	ISABEL lowers her eyes.

					SANCHEZ
			Since provocation and injustice
			never ceases, many of the Indians
			have fled to the forests, or have
			begun to slay the Christians.

	ISABEL looks over at BROTHER BUYL.

					ISABEL
			Could it be so?

					BROTHER BUYL
			Yes, Your Majesty.

					SANCHEZ
			But there is worse.  From the
			beginning, he forced the nobles to
			undergo physical labor, treating
			them equally with the Indians, all
			of them reduced to slavery.  When
			the nobleman Adrian de Moxica
			protested against such treatment...
				(he pauses)
			... he was executed.
				(pause)
			Is that not true also, Brother
			Buyl?

					BROTHER BUYL
			Yes, Your Honor.  It is all true.
			All of it.  I saw it with my own
			eyes.

					SANCHEZ
			He has lost control.  His great
			arrogance has led him into
			depravity.  He encourages our
			soldiers to marry the native women.
			He promised a paradise, but he has
			made a hell full of all its horrors.

	Silence.

					ISABEL
			Is that the man I knew, Treasurer
			Sanchez?

					SANCHEZ
			Yes, Your Majesty.

									CUT TO:

	INT.  HUT - ISLAND - DAY

	CLOSE ON the FACE:  COLUMBUS is stretched on a bed,
	sweating heavily in fever, clearly delirious.  Insects
	crawl over his face, he makes no effort to swat them away.
	There is a dripping sound of water.

					FERNANDO (V.O.)
			Of all the words my Father wrote and
			there were many, I remember these
			the most.  "Nothing that results
			from human progress is achieved with
			unanimous consent..."

	Rain is falling into the room over documents spread on a
	table.  COLUMBUS stands up and moves to the table.  Some
	of the walls have been blackened with smoke and flames.  A
	lizard scuttles into the shadows.

					FERNANDO (V.O.)
			"And those who are enlightened
			before the others are condemned to
			purse that light in spite of
			others..."

	COLUMBUS stares down at the documents, moving them away
	from the rain drips.  He stares out by the window, and we
	see:

	A devastated landscape.  Flooded roads, half-destroyed
	huts, broken trees... A dog picks its way through the mud.

					FERNANDO (V.O.)
			There was a time when the New World
			didn't exist...

									DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

	A vast stretch of ocean.  It fills the screen.  Unbroken,
	infinite, luminous, mysterious -- it stretches away,
	meeting and blending with the sky in pale ribbons of pearl
	and misty light.

					FERNANDO (V.O.)
			... The sun set in the west on an
			ocean where no man had dared to
			venture.  And beyond that,
			infinity...

	Pulling back, we discover:

	A TEN-YEAR-OLD BOY and a strongly built man in his middle
	thirties, are riding a mule.  The MAN'S weather-beaten
	face frames unusually bright eyes.

	On the screen these words:  ANDALUSIA, 1491

	COLUMBUS AND HIS SON are following a windthrashed path at
	the top of the hill.  COLUMBUS hums a song, and FERNANDO
	looks up at him in adoration.

					FERNANDO (V.O.)
			Once I asked my Father where he
			wanted to go.  And he replied:  "I
			want to travel all over the seas.  I
			want to get behind the weather..."

	FERNANDO laughs.  He then starts to hum along with his
	FATHER.

									CUT TO:

	EXT.  HILLSIDE APPROACH TO LA RABIDA - DAY

	A rugged landscape, remote and steep, with lines of stone
	walls and thousands of sheep.

	FERNANDO, rushes down a slope, barking like a dog, chasing
	the sheep who fan out in droves in front of him.  High-
	spirited and wild, FERNANDO laughs and tumbles over.

	COLUMBUS rides his mule along the narrow track, watching
	his SON'S antics with amusement.  In the distance, the
	solitary figure of A MONK SHEPHERD.

	COLUMBUS calls out to his son:

					COLUMBUS
			Fernando!

	FERNANDO runs over.  COLUMBUS lifts him up onto the mule.

	As they move along the track we now see, perched on a
	distant hill, isolated and austere, the Monastery of La
	Rabida, their destination.


	EXT.  CLOISTER - LA RABIDA - DAY

	As they dismount and walk into the quiet cloisters,
	FERNANDO suddenly spots a familiar FIGURE, standing under
	the ROMAN arches.

					FERNANDO
			Diego!

	He rushes over, full of joy, to kiss his BROTHER -- an
	adolescent dressed in the novice-robe, with a solemn,
	delicate face.  DIEGO'S response is constrained.

					COLUMBUS
			Diego!  Aren't you going to kiss
			your brother?

	DIEGO smiles a little, and kisses FERNANDO -- who is
	immediately distracted by a procession of hooded MONKS,
	hurrying to the refectory, as a bell begins to chime.

	The MONKS all turn to greet ANTONIO DE MARCHENA, a white-
	haired, elderly man -- and a monk cosmographer.
	MARCHENA'S gesture is broad and elegant as he opens his
	arms to greet COLUMBUS.  He pats FERNANDO'S head and turns
	to DIEGO.

					MARCHENA
			Diego, take Fernando to the dining
			hall.  He must be hungry.

					DIEGO
			Yes, Father.

	Both CHILDREN leave under the arched roof.  COLUMBUS and
	MARCHENA begin to walk across the cloister.

					MARCHENA
			Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure
			to teach -- but so serious...
			Brothers should be raised together,
			Colon.  Even brothers from different
			mothers...

					COLUMBUS
			Father, I am doing what I think is
			the best for him.  And he has the
			teacher I would have chosen for
			myself.

	MARCHENA laughs at the compliment.

					MARCHENA
			Just be careful you don't lose him.

	They have crossed the cloister.  MARCHENA pushes open a
	door.


	INT.  A HUGE LIBRARY - LA RABIDA - DAY

	Hundreds of books lined up on the shelves, displaying the
	miracle of printing, a recent German discovery.  Several
	MONKS, perched on high stools behind lecterns, are busily
	"ILLUMINATING" some of these massive volumes, delicately
	painting around the letters in bright colors and gold
	leaf.

	Rays of light fall diagonally through high openings,
	projecting geometric patterns on the tiled floor.  As
	MARCHENA and COLUMBUS move forward their conversation is
	punctuated by light and shadow.

					MARCHENA
				(fumbles in a pocket
				under his robe)
			I have something for you.

	Almost casually, he hands COLUMBUS a letter.

					MARCHENA
			You will be heard at the University
			of Salamanca...

	COLUMBUS stops dead in his tracks.  Almost frantically he
	tears open the letter, hardly able to believe his eyes.

					COLUMBUS
			God... That's in a week!

					MARCHENA
			That's what it says.

					COLUMBUS
			How did you manage it?

					MARCHENA
				(smiling)
			With some difficulty.  I had to
			promise them you were not a total
			fool.

	MARCHENA pushes open a second door, hidden behind a wooden
	panel.


	INT.  STUDY - LA RABIDA - DAY

	MARCHENA is not a tidy man.  Books are piled up on the
	floor, the desk, on every shelf, along with maps,
	instruments of astronomy... the visible evidence of an
	inquiring mind.

	With practiced familiarity, as if they had done this a
	hundred times -- which indeed they have -- MARCHENA sits
	behind his desk, and COLUMBUS opposite him.  MARCHENA
	lights a candle and considers the mess.  Then
	methodically, he slowly sweeps it from in front of him
	with his sleeve, exposing a large map underneath.

	When he looks up again, there is a new severity in his
	expression.  He turns over an hourglass.

					MARCHENA
			Why do you wish to sail west?

					COLUMBUS
			To open a new route to Asia.  At the
			moment there are only two ways of
			reaching it...

	He leans forward, and points to the map spread out on the
	desk.

					COLUMBUS
			By sea, sailing around the African
			Continent -- the journey takes a
			year...

	His finger traces the journey, from west to east.

					COLUMBUS
			Or by land...

	We are CLOSE now on the map, as we watch his finger
	tracing a line between Europe and the Far East.

					COLUMBUS (O.S.)
			... But the Turks have closed this
			route to all Christians.  Trading
			with the Orient has become arduous,
			if not dangerous.
				(he pauses)
			There is a third way...

	We notice that the outline of the European continent is
	familiar.  But we also notice that, in that great expanse
	of ocean, the whole American continent is missing.

					COLUMBUS
			By sailing West across the Ocean
			Sea.

	CLOSE ON MARCHENA'S FACE, touched by the mystery.

					MARCHENA
			How can you be so certain?  The
			Ocean is said to be infinite.

					COLUMBUS
			Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are
			no more than 750 leagues west of the
			Canary Islands.

					MARCHENA
			How can you be so certain?

					COLUMBUS
			The calculations of Toscanelli Marin
			de Tyr, Esdras...

					MARCHENA
				(interrupting)
			Esdras is a Jew.

					COLUMBUS
			So was Christ!

	MARCHENA throws his quill in the air in frustration.  He
	glances at the hourglass:

					MARCHENA
			Two minutes... and already you're a
			dead man.  Don't let passion
			overwhelm you, Colon.

					COLUMBUS
				(mockingly)
			I'll try to remember that,
			Marchena...

					MARCHENA
			Father Marchena!

					COLUMBUS
				(ignoring this)
			Passion is something one cannot
			control!

					MARCHENA
				(heatedly)
			You get so carried away when you are
			being contradicted!

					COLUMBUS
			I've been contradicted all my
			life... Eternity!

					MARCHENA
				(amused)
			Only God knows the meaning of such
			words, my son.


	EXT.  COURTYARD - LA RABIDA - EVENING

	DIEGO and FERNANDO wait in the courtyard.  COLUMBUS
	appears and lifts FERNANDO onto the mule.  DIEGO turns to
	go.

					COLUMBUS
			Diego.

	COLUMBUS walks over to him, squats down so their eyes
	meet.  He looks at his SON for a moment.

					COLUMBUS
			Would you like to come and stay with
			us?

	Uncomfortable with the proposition, DIEGO cannot find an
	answer.

					COLUMBUS
			I'll do whatever makes you happy.

					DIEGO
			I am happy, Father.

	COLUMBUS reaches out -- and touches his shoulder.

	He climbs up behind FERNANDO, who waves back to his
	BROTHER as they ride off.


	EXT.  CADIZ - STREETS AND CATHEDRAL SQUARE - NIGHT

	COLUMBUS leads the mule, carrying the sleeping FERNANDO,
	through narrow streets.  There's a clamorous noise in the
	air.  Suddenly a large group of YOUNG MEN, shouting with
	excitement, run up the street and brush past them.  Then
	more people.  FERNANDO sits up straight.  The noise grows,
	rowdy, rumbling, sharp with excitement and violence.

	Huge CROWDS have thronged the massive old square outside
	the cathedral.  Holding the mule by its reins, COLUMBUS
	tries to push his way through... Suddenly, as a gap opens
	in the crowd, we see the cause of the excitement:  in the
	center of the square stand three pyres, already alit.
	HOODED EXECUTIONERS are busy around the fires.

					FERNANDO
			Look, Father!

	Before COLUMBUS can stop him, FERNANDO has slipped off the
	mule and into the crowd.   

					COLUMBUS
			Fernando!

	But the BOY has been swallowed into the mass of people.
	COLUMBUS tries to follow him.  Flames leap into the night
	sky with a terrible crackling, lighting up the square with
	a lurid glow.  Prayers are being chanted somewhere.

	FERNANDO has elbowed his way to the front of the crowd.

	A PRIEST brandishes a crucifix in front of the face of a
	MAN bound to a post.  The heretic wears the "sambenito", a
	robe made of coarse fabric on which his sins have been
	crudely illustrated -- we see cabalistic signs,
	indicating that the man is Jewish.

	THE MAN'S eyes are mad with fear.  But he refuses to kiss
	the crucifix, as a sign of his repentance.

	FERNANDO is transfixed by the scene, but still doesn't
	realize what is happening.  He is too close to the
	platform to see what is in the flames of the other pyres.

					COLUMBUS
			Fernando!

	He motions to his son, takes the BOY'S hand, and drags him
	away from the scene.  But FERNANDO looks back.  The
	distance now allows him to see inside the flames.

	A HALF-CHARRED FIGURE -- THE MAN'S face is distorted in a
	silent scream... The neck snaps like burning wood, and the
	head falls on one shoulder.  Then the whole body collapses
	into the fire.


	INT.  BEATRIX'S HOUSE - HALLWAY AND STABLE - NIGHT

	COLUMBUS and FERNANDO lead the mule into the white-washed,
	stone-floored hallway of the modest house.  FERNANDO is
	mute, shocked by what he just witnessed.  COLUMBUS takes
	the mule into its stall, and as he does so, his mother,
	BEATRIX, appears from the kitchen to greet them.  She is a
	beautiful woman in her twenties, a calm, strong, domestic
	personality.  COLUMBUS tousles the BOY'S hair.  FERNANDO
	glances at his MOTHER but looks subdued and doesn't say
	anything.


	INT.  BEATRIX'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

	COLUMBUS joins BEATRIX in the kitchen, where a MAID is
	cooking.  He explains Fernando's subdued manner.

					COLUMBUS
			Executions.  In the square.

	BEATRIX nods.  He goes to the stone butt and pours water
	on his hands.

					COLUMBUS
			They've agreed to see me in a week.

	BEATRIX puts the candle on the table.  Her face lights up
	with a smile.  He walks to her, and kisses her.

					COLUMBUS
			I could be gone for years.

					BEATRIX
			I know.

					COLUMBUS
			I haven't given you much of a life.

					BEATRIX
				(amused)
			Well... that's true.  I have a child
			by a man who won't marry me!  Who's
			always leaving...

					COLUMBUS
			Are we going to argue?

					BEATRIX
			I'd love to argue with you
			sometimes.  But you're never here!

	They laugh and kiss.

					COLUMBUS
			Perhaps I was never meant to live
			with a woman...

					BEATRIX
				(still kissing him)
			I find that hard to believe.

									DISSOLVE TO:

	INT.  BEATRIX'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

	They are eating around the table, and FERNANDO is
	unusually silent and thoughtful.  COLUMBUS pours a little
	wine into FERNANDO'S water, to distract him.  FERNANDO
	looks up at him, surprised.  COLUMBUS smiles, then looks
	over at BEATRIX.

					COLUMBUS
			Fernando, don't you think we are
			lucky to live with such a beautiful
			woman?

	He winks at FERNANDO.  BEATRIX smiles.


	INT.  BEATRIX'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

	The room is dark.  As COLUMBUS approached the bed with a
	candle, it illuminates the naked body of BEATRIX.  BEATRIX
	looks up at him intently.  A drop of wax falls on her
	skin.  She flinches, murmurs...

	They make love.


	EXT.  SALAMANCA UNIVERSITY - DAY

	A medieval "campus".  Students-novices are playing
	"pelote", with basket-gloves and a hard ball.  They run
	with their robes tucked around their waist, revealing
	white legs.  Others are studying, reading, hurrying to
	their class.

	We find COLUMBUS watching the game from the steps above
	the court.  Others are waiting with him.  A MONK comes
	from a door, and looks around the group.

					MONK
				(hesitant)
			Christopher Columbus?


	INT.  AUDIENCE ROOM - UNIVERSITY OF SALAMANCA - DAY

	An El Greco painting.  A tableau of twenty MEN sitting on
	dark, sculpted seats.  Candles throw a gloomy light on
	their faces.  Some are Churchmen, others are dressed in
	bourgeois outfits.

	Only one of them is richly dressed in the grand Spanish
	fashion -- he is SANCHEZ, Treasurer of the House of
	Aragon.  A MONK (Don AROJAZ) holds a stick with an ivory
	claw at the top.  Languidly, he scratches his back -- his
	off-hand manner only makes him more impressive than his
	peers.

					AROJAZ
			You say Asia can be found by sailing
			west?

					COLUMBUS
			Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage
			should not take more than six or
			seven weeks.

					AROJAZ
			Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is
			precisely where our opinions
			differ...
				(pause)
			Are you familiar with the work of
			Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?

					COLUMBUS
			I am, Your Eminence

					AROJAZ
			Then you cannot ignore that
			according to their calculations, the
			circumference of the Earth is
			approximately...
				(he leans forward)
			22,000 leagues or more.  Which makes
			the ocean... uncrossable.

	He leans back, satisfied, and pauses for effect.

					AROJAZ
			But you may have found new evidence
			proving that these men of knowledge
			are totally mistaken!

	A ripple of mirthless laughter.

					COLUMBUS
			Your Excellencies are aware of the
			statements of Marin de Tyr?

					HERNANDO DE TALAVERA
			We are.

					COLUMBUS
			Then you are also aware that his
			theories contradict Ptolemeus... De
			Tyr believes the Ocean to be only
			750 leagues...

	A murmur of protest spreads among the members of the
	Commission.  But Columbus is determined to press his
	theories.

					COLUMBUS
			The Florentine Toscanelli and the
			French Cardinal Pierre d'Ailly both
			think that Marin de Tyr is accurate
			in his calculations.  And therefore,
			that the ocean can be crossed.

	Indignant and amused murmurs.  DIEGO DE DEZA raises his
	voice to quiet the assembly.

					DIEGO DE DEZA
			Gentlemen, let us suppose Marin de
			Tyr is right...
				(the laughter
				subsides)
			Are we here to examine this proposal
			or not?

	Silence.

					DIEGO DE DEZA
				(to Columbus)
			In your opinion, how long would the
			voyage be?

					COLUMBUS
			Seven weeks.  Six, during the summer
			months.

	The murmur increases.

					AROJAZ
			Marin de Tyr is wrong -- and has
			been corrected many times over the
			centuries by the finest geographers.
			Your voyage, Don Colon, would take a
			year!

	A MAN of simple bearing, that COLUMBUS identifies as
	being a seaman, interrupts.

					VICUNA
			How would the crew survive without
			being able to land for fresh water?
			Water is undrinkable after six
			weeks!  You'd never be able to turn
			back!

					COLUMBUS
			We wouldn't have to turn back!  We
			would find land at this point!

					AROJAZ
			Senor Colon, an experienced captain
			such as yourself will understand our
			concern with the crew.  I am not
			willing to have on my conscience the
			loss of men who would have relied
			upon our judgment.

					COLUMBUS
			Excellency, you are right.

	Instantly, the protests stop.

					COLUMBUS
			I am a seaman, not a scholar... But
			as a simple man craving for
			knowledge, I have read all the work
			of these renowned geographers and
			discovered that none of them could
			agree on the exact width of this
			ocean...

	He pauses, and starts walking in front of the experts, as
	a lawyer before a grand jury.

					COLUMBUS
			Therefore, as a modest man, I
			wonder:  who is right?

	The experts listen.  CLOSE ON SANCHEZ'S FACE, impressed by
	the boldness.

					COLUMBUS
			Who is right?  This question remains
			unanswered.

	He walks and stops before TALAVERA, and catches the look
	of SANCHEZ, sitting just behind him.

					COLUMBUS
			Your Eminence, there is only one way
			to settle the matter.  And that is
			to make the journey.
				(to the assembly,
				with passion)
			I am ready to risk my life to prove
			it possible.

					AROJAZ
			Your life, and that of others!

					COLUMBUS
			If they agree to follow me, yes.

					SANCHEZ (O.S.)
			Suppose you cross this ocean.
			Suppose you reach Asia.  What would
			Spain do there?

	Conscious of a friendlier voice, COLUMBUS sees the
	Treasurer SANCHEZ, an imposing man in his fifties.

					COLUMBUS
			Trade, Your Excellency.  According
			to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China
			is one of the richest of the world.
			Even the meanest buildings are
			roofed with gold.

					AROJAZ
				(interrupting)
			Is that all that interests you?
			Gold?

					COLUMBUS
			No.  The Portuguese have already
			discovered black-skinned people.  I,
			too, will find other populations --
			and bring them to the word of God.

	THE MONK smiles thinly.

					AROJAZ
			Christopher -- Christo Ferens -- the
			Bearer of the Cross!

					MONK
				(ironic)
			And Colon -- the one who populates!

	Another small rill of laughter.

					AROJAZ
			If God intended our proximity to
			Asia, do you believe he would have
			waited for you to show it to the
			world?

					COLUMBUS
			Did He not choose a carpenter's son
			to reveal Himself to the world?

	A hum of interest.  CLOSE ON SANCHEZ -- watching COLUMBUS
	intently, a hint of an admiring smile on his lips.

					AROJAZ
			So you consider yourself the chosen
			one?

	A pause.

					AROJAZ
			Don't you realize your words could
			be considered heretical?

					COLUMBUS
				(calmly)
			Blind faith is what I consider
			heresy!

	The murmur turns to an audible gasp.  AROJAZ gets to his
	feet and leans forward, threateningly, the flame of a
	candle only inches from his face.

	There is absolute silence.  COLUMBUS meets the MONK'S gaze
	unflinchingly.

					COLUMBUS
				(quietly)
			Asia can be found to the west -- and
			I will prove it.

					AROJAZ
			IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!


	EXT.  TERRACE - UNIVERSITY - DAY

	The JURY is alone to deliberate.  Food and wine has been
	laid out on tables.  In the distance, students' cries
	carry over the conversation.

	SANCHEZ approaches.

					AROJAZ
			The Treasurer of Spain honors us
			with his presence.

	SANCHEZ bows slightly.

					SANCHEZ
			The State has some reason to be
			interested in this man's
			proposition, Your Eminence...

					AROJAZ
			The Judgment is ours!

					SANCHEZ
			Naturally.  But I would really
			deplore the loss of such a potential
			opportunity for Spain for a...
			dispute over a point of geography.

	SANCHEZ helps himself to some grapes, looks round at the
	other members of the committee, who pretend not to be
	listening.

					AROJAZ
				(interrupting)
			He is a mercenary!  Did he not
			already try to convince the King of
			Portugal of his absurd notions?

					SANCHEZ
			Indeed.  The world is full of
			mercenaries -- and states often make
			use of them, when it benefits them.
				(casually)
			My only concern is the welfare and
			prosperity of Spain.

	AROJAZ understands the hint, and stops smiling.

					AROJAZ
			You would use your influence to
			assist this... intriguer?

	SANCHEZ reaches for a decanter of sherry.

					SANCHEZ
			You know, Your Eminence, the
			fascinating thing about power, is
			that what can be given so
			effortlessly...

	He offers the decanter to AROJAZ, who automatically lifts
	his glass.  But instead, SANCHEZ pulls back the decanter,
	pours himself a drink, and replaces it on the table,
	leaving AROJAZ staring at his own empty glass.

					SANCHEZ
			... can so easily be taken away.

	And he drinks with a smile.


	INT.  LA RABIDA - MARCHENA'S STUDY - EVENING

	MARCHENA reads aloud the Commission's letter.

					MARCHENA
			... and therefore nothing could
			justify the participation of Your
			Highnesses in the venture that
			relies upon such feeble assumptions,
			and which any man of knowledge
			would take to be impractical... if
			not impossible.

	He shakes his head, puts the letter down.  COLUMBUS looks
	appalled; devastated.

					COLUMBUS
			They didn't listen.  They didn't
			want to listen!

	He paces about the book-lined room.

					MARCHENA
			You mustn't give way to despair.
			You must wait.

					COLUMBUS
			Wait!  I've waited seven years
			already!  How much longer do you
			want me to wait?

					MARCHENA
			If God intends you to go, then you
			will go.

					COLUMBUS
				(angrily)
			Damn God!

	MARCHENA is shocked.

					MARCHENA
			Colon!

					COLUMBUS
			Damn all of you!  You all set up
			theories based on what?  You never
			leave the safety of your studies!
			Go out!  Find out what the world is
			about and then tell me something I
			can listen to!

	He seizes a beautiful book from MARCHENA'S desk.

					COLUMBUS
			These don't mean anything!  They're
			full of assumptions!  Out of the
			heads of old men who've never been
			past the end of their gardens!

	He hurls the book across the room.  MARCHENA is horrified.

					MARCHENA
			No...!  My books...!

	COLUMBUS seizes more books from the shelves, just sweeping
	them to the floor.

					COLUMBUS
			All of them!  Just lies!

					MARCHENA
			Colon!  Don't!

	MARCHENA tries to stop him.  In his fury, COLUMBUS
	accidentally knocks the poor old MAN to the ground.  His
	cries bring three MONKS rushing into the room.

	As COLUMBUS continues to rage and scatter books
	everywhere, they try to stop him, struggling with this
	big, powerful man -- to almost comical effect.  Finally, a
	short, muscular MONK delivers a quick punch that sends
	COLUMBUS crashing to the floor.


	INT.  CHAPEL OF LA RABIDA - EVENING

	COLUMBUS lies face down on the stone floor.  He is dressed
	in a homespun robe.  His arms are stretched out in
	penance.  FERNANDO and DIEGO look down at him.

					FERNANDO
			Father?

					DIEGO
			Sssshhhh...!  One can't speak to a
			man doing penance.

					FERNANDO
			What can you do?

					DIEGO
			Nothing.  That's the point,
			Fernando.

	A pause -- and then FERNANDO lies face down on the floor
	beside his FATHER, and stretches out his arms in the same
	way.  DIEGO is left looking on, unable to bring himself to
	join them.


	EXT.  CLOISTER - LA RABIDA - DAY

	Along the cloister, maps are drying, hanging like laundry
	in the light breeze.  COLUMBUS pins up a new addition.
	Another MONK works nearby, in silence.

					PINZON (O.S.)
			Senor Colon?

	COLUMBUS turns, to see a small, stocky MAN approaching:  a
	middle-class gentleman.  He nods.

					PINZON
			Ah, thank God!  I've been looking
			all over Seville for you!  Never
			expected to find a sailor in a
			monastery, eh?

	He laughs.  COLUMBUS smiles, but doesn't say anything.
	PINZON is clearly a little surprised.

					PINZON
			Name's Pinzon, by the way.  Martin
			Alonzo Pinzon.  I'm a ship owner
			from Palos...

	COLUMBUS glances around cautiously, and walks a little way
	down the cloister, away from the other MONK, gesturing for
	PINZON to follow him.  PINZON is yet more surprised by
	this strange behavior.

					PINZON
				(indicating the
				monk)
			Is he a spy?

	COLUMBUS shakes his head.  PINZON stares at him,
	perplexed.

					PINZON
			What is it?  Are you a Trappist?

	COLUMBUS shakes his head again.

					PINZON
			Vow of silence...?  Penance?

	COLUMBUS nods vigorously.

					PINZON
			Jesus!  Just my luck!

	He takes off his hat, wiping his forehead with a silk
	cloth.

					PINZON
			Listen.  I'll do the talking for
			both of us.  You just nod.  Agreed?
			Just as I do with the wife.

	COLUMBUS nods.

					PINZON
			I know that the Commission turned
			you down, right?  What do you
			expect?  You're a foreigner... But I
			want to help you.

	COLUMBUS gives him a glance like one throws a question in
	the air.

					PINZON
			You wonder why I believe in you?
			Hey, I am a seaman.  And we don't
			like to be told where to go, and
			where not to go.

	COLUMBUS looks at him, and bursts out laughing.  The other
	MONK looks round severely.  COLUMBUS ducks behind a map,
	PINZON following him.  PINZON lowers his voice.

					PINZON
			I don't look like it, but I have
			friends at the Court.  The Treasurer
			of Aragon, for example.  He finances
			me.  His name's Santangel.  Ever
			heard of him?

	COLUMBUS shakes his head, but looks increasingly
	interested by what he's hearing.

					PINZON
			He can get you an audience with the
			Queen!  You know why...?  She owes
			him money.  That's how it is.  You
			-- me -- the Queen -- the world and
			his mistress -- agreed?

	COLUMBUS nods.

					PINZON
			So.  What do you say?

	COLUMBUS looks around, catches the disapproving face of
	the MONK, crosses himself, then speaks:

					COLUMBUS
			Where can I meet this man?

					PINZON
				(indicating with a
				nod)
			Immediately.

	COLUMBUS turns and sees an elegant Lord in his fifties,
	examining the maps.


	EXT.  STREETS OF GRANADA - DAY

	A huge Islamic Crescent being pulled down from the minaret
	of a mosque.  SOLDIERS are holding back a crowd at the
	foot of the tower.  To the ecstatic cries of the crowd, a
	Cross is hoisted up in its place... Astride horses,
	COLUMBUS and the Treasurer SANTANGEL are watching the
	scene.

	They push through an extraordinary scene.  The city of
	Granada has just been reclaimed from the moors after
	several years of siege.  All around them, SPANISH SOLDIERS
	are herding, bedraggled columns of the defeated MOORS,
	bearing only a few possessions.  Ragged, half-starved men,
	women and children.

					SANTANGEL
			These people built Granada...
			Centuries ago!  It is a great
			victory over the Moors, Don Colon --
			and yet what a tragedy it is!

	The THREE HORSEMEN pass a procession of grateful
	PENITENTS, who are crawling on their knees, chanting
	psalms and flagellating themselves.  At the head of the
	procession, HOODED PRIESTS carry a statue of the Virgin
	Mary swathed in silk and lace.

	The gates of the Alhambra Palace are in sight.

					COLUMBUS
			Is this a good time to meet her?

					SANTANGEL
			It couldn't be better.  Victors
			can't say no.

	Bells are pealing triumphantly.  The noise is tumultuous.
	They ride towards the magnificent palace.


	EXT.  ALHAMBRA PALACE - GARDENS - DAY

	Fabulous Moorish gardens:  ponds filled with golden carp;
	exotic bird cages hang from lemon trees... The distant
	sounds of victory.

	SANTANGEL and COLUMBUS walk through the gardens, escorted
	by HALBERDIERS.  SOLDIERS pass by, carrying coffers or
	piles of documents.

	As they approach the inner sanctum, however, there are
	fewer people.  They stop by the Lion's Fountain, where
	several DIGNITARIES are waiting patiently for an audience.

	SANCHEZ appears.  They bow.  SANTANGEL approaches to
	murmur a compliment.

					SANTANGEL
			Your Excellency... truly grateful...
			your help... as ever...

	SANCHEZ protests softly, and looks over at COLUMBUS, a
	half-smile forming on his lips.  Then a DUENA appears, and
	motions for COLUMBUS to follow.


	INT.  ALHAMBRA PALACE - THRONE ROOM - DAY

	An ornate Moorish door is pushed open by the DUENA'S hand.
	We enter the Throne Room -- sculptured colonnades,
	mosaics... At the far end, windows open onto a view of
	Granada's rooftops.

	Against this dazzling light, the delicate silhouette of
	QUEEN ISABEL OF SPAIN.  The light in her blonde hair
	creates a halo around her head as she turns.  COLUMBUS
	falls to his knees.

					ISABEL
			Rise...!  Come forward!

	He approaches the window, stopping close to her.  ISABEL
	scrutinizes him quickly.

					ISABEL
			I should not even be listening to
			you, since my council said no.  But
			Santangel tells me you are a man of
			honor and sincerity... And Sanchez,
			that you are not a fool.

					COLUMBUS
				(bold)
			No more than the woman who said she
			would take Granada from the Moors.

	ISABEL smiles, enjoying the lack of obsequiousness.

					ISABEL
			The ocean is uncrossable?

					COLUMBUS
			What did they say about Granada
			before today?

					ISABEL
				(a beat)
			That she was impregnable.

	ISABEL smiles again.

					ISABEL
			I cannot ignore the verdict of my
			council.

					COLUMBUS
			Surely you can do anything you want.

	A direct challenge.  She doesn't know what to make of this
	man.

					ISABEL
			How little you know.

	This little hint of vulnerability subtly reverses their
	positions for a moment.  Now we sense COLUMBUS
	scrutinizing her.

					COLUMBUS
			May I speak freely?

					ISABEL
				(with a smile)
			You show no inclination to speak
			otherwise!

					COLUMBUS
			I know what I see.  I see someone
			who doesn't accept the world as it
			is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a
			women who thinks... "What if?"...

					ISABEL
				(amused at his
				familiarity)
			A woman?

	A slight pause.

					COLUMBUS
			Forgive me... but you're the only
			Queen I know.

	She bursts out laughing.

					ISABEL
			Then we are equal... since you are
			the only sailor I know!

	A beat.

					ISABEL
			How old are you, Senor Colon?

					COLUMBUS
			Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And
			you?

	Once again taken off guard, ISABEL flushes, and turns away
	slightly to hide it.

					ISABEL
			Thirty eight...

	A pause.

					ISABEL
			You will be informed of our
			decision.

	COLUMBUS bows and goes to leave.  As the DUENA opens the
	door for him, he turns back.

					COLUMBUS
			Actually, I thought you were younger
			than me!

	And he goes out, leaving her stunned.


	EXT.  SANCHEZ'S ESTATE - TREE-LINED ROAD - DAY

	A chalk white road, lined with trees.  Two liveried
	SERVANTS are walking down the road, one carrying a large
	silver tray, the other a smaller tray.

	They are overtaken by an ADMINISTRATOR who hurries along
	the road, with documents under his arm.


	EXT.  SANCHEZ'S ESTATE - STABLE BLOCK AND PADDOCK - DAY

	The CLERK enters an imposing stable block.

	In the paddock, SANCHEZ is training a magnificent young
	horse, making it step sideways, bending it to his will.
	The ADMINISTRATOR watches him, unable to interrupt.

	Behind him the two SERVANTS can be seen bringing in the
	silver trays, with covered dishes of food, a decanter of
	wine.  They begin to lay them out on a table.


	EXT.  SANCHEZ'S ESTATE - STABLE BLOCK AND PADDOCK - LATER

	SANCHEZ pours himself some wine, tucks into his his food,
	while the ADMINISTRATOR, clearly working himself up into a
	frenzy, reads from a document.

					ADMINISTRATOR
			... and he demands... he DEMANDS to
			be made a Knight, with the right to
			bear the Golden Spurs!  He will
			receive the title of Don Cristobal
			Colon -- which will be extended to
			his descendants for ever more...

	The ADMINISTRATOR looks up.  He is reading the contract
	that COLUMBUS has proposed.  SANCHEZ, his mouth full,
	gestures for him to continue.

					SANCHEZ
			Go on!

					ADMINISTRATOR
			He will be named Great Admiral of
			the Ocean Sea.  Viceroy of the West
			Indies... Governor of all islands or
			lands discovered or as will be
			discovered with his help...

	The ADMINISTRATOR looks up again.

					ADMINISTRATOR
			The highest titles of nobility, Your
			Excellency!  To an immigrant
			sheltered by monks!

	SANCHEZ gestures for the document.  Wipes his mouth.
	Continues reading, calmly:

					SANCHEZ
			Furthermore he will receive one
			eight of all wealth or monies,
			precious gems, pearls, metals,
			spices and other lucrative sources
			conquered within the boundaries of
			his admiralty...

	He smiles, hands the document back.

					SANCHEZ
			It's very underdone.

					ADMINISTRATOR
				(exploding)
			Underdone!  It's monstrous,
			Excellency!

					SANCHEZ
			No, the pheasant.  It's almost raw.

	And he carries on eating.

					SANCHEZ
			You worry too much, Carvajal... The
			man will have to lower his demands.
			Believe me, he WILL!


	INT.  ALHAMBRA PALACE - A RECEPTION ROOM - DAY

	Close up on COLUMBUS.

					COLUMBUS
			I WON'T!

	A WOMAN'S HAND quietly, carefully opens a cover of a spy
	hole in the wall.  Two beautiful eyes peer through a
	grille, into the next room.

	What they see:

	SANCHEZ and COLUMBUS together.  COLUMBUS is visibly upset.

					SANCHEZ
				(calmly)
			We have considered your -- demands
			very carefully, Senor Colon... Your
			expectations are... excessive, in
			every way.

	COLUMBUS tightens his fists, tries to remain calm.

					COLUMBUS
			If I am right, my requests are fair!

	SANCHEZ holds up a document.

					SANCHEZ
			We have prepared our own contract...

	He offers the document to COLUMBUS, who takes it, scans it
	quickly, shakes his head.

					COLUMBUS
			No...

					SANCHEZ
			No?

					COLUMBUS
			NO...!  I have waited too long,
			fought too hard.  Now you expect me
			to take all the risks while you take
			the profit!  No... I will not be
			your servant!

	The eyes behind the screen -- the mouth, forming a little
	smile.

					SANCHEZ
			I remind you, Senor Colon, that you
			are in no position to bargain with
			me.

					COLUMBUS
			I'm not bargaining!

					SANCHEZ
				(steely)
			Then you are too ambitious.

	COLUMBUS leans over the table, faces him.

					COLUMBUS
			And were you never ambitious,
			Excellency?  Or is ambition only a
			virtue among the nobles, a fault for
			the rest of us?

					SANCHEZ
				(abrupt)
			If you won't accept our proposal,
			we'll simply find someone who will.

	COLUMBUS smiles.

					COLUMBUS
			If you can do that, Excellency --
			I'll become a monk!

	He turns, strides towards the door.  We hear a WOMAN'S
	muffled laughter.

	As COLUMBUS goes out, ISABEL appears through a secret
	door.  SANCHEZ bows.

	ISABEL goes over to the window and looks out.

					ISABEL
			You were right, Don Sanchez... His
			demands could never be granted.

					SANCHEZ
			Never, Your Majesty.  Although...

	She turns, questioningly, towards him.

					SANCHEZ
			... Although one may always
			renegotiate a contract.  Especially
			signed by Royal Hands.


	EXT.  ALHAMBRA PALACE GARDENS - POV - DAY

	SANCHEZ joins ISABEL at the window.  They see COLUMBUS
	striding out and away.


	INT.  ALHAMBRA PALACE - A RECEPTION ROOM - DAY

	BACK TO SANCHEZ

					SANCHEZ
				(quietly)
			... Into a monk...

					ISABEL
				(with a smile)
			Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't
			it?
				(turning to Sanchez)
			Call him back!


	EXT.  STREET - EVENING   

	Teeming life.  COLUMBUS pushing his way through crowds.
	He is expressionless and distracted.

	He looks around him, stops walking.  And then,
	unexpectedly, shouts.

					COLUMBUS
			YEEEEEEES!

	All heads turn as if he were totally insane.  He walks on
	as if nothing happened.


	INT.  BEATRIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	COLUMBUS is sitting at the kitchen table, by himself, with
	a glass of wine.  There is a movement behind him.  BEATRIX
	is standing at the foot of the stairs, in a night-shirt.

	COLUMBUS turns and looks at her, almost sad.

					COLUMBUS
			She said yes.

					BEATRIX
				(moved)
			Thank God...

	She smiles.  But he seems to be unable to share her
	happiness.

					COLUMBUS
			If I ever come back, I swear I
			will...

	She crosses to him quickly, placing her hand gently on his
	mouth.

					BEATRIX
				(softly)
			I'm not asking you to swear to
			anything.

					COLUMBUS
			I don't want you to wait for me.

					BEATRIX
				(smiling)
			That's something you can't decide.

	COLUMBUS kisses her.


	INT.  CORRIDOR - BEATRIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	Strange, unearthly music... A flickering light in a dark
	tunnel.  FERNANDO, holding a candle in front of him, walks
	slowly down the dark corridor.

	Quietly opening a door, he walks into COLUMBUS' study.


	INT.  COLUMBUS' STUDY - NIGHT

	CLOSE ON:  A huge illustrated map of western Europe and
	Asia.  FERNANDO'S candle moves slowly across the Atlantic
	Ocean, to the edge of the map.  There, the illustrator's
	imagination has created monsters:  terrifying demons;
	creatures half-human, half-animal.

	Sitting at his desk, COLUMBUS is looking at the map.

					FERNANDO (O.S.)
			You can't go there!

	Turning, COLUMBUS finds his son beside him.

					COLUMBUS
			Why not?

	FERNANDO points at the monsters.  He pulls the boy to him.

					COLUMBUS
			There aren't any monsters, Fernando.
			The only monsters are in here...
				(he taps his own
				forehead)
			Watch!

	He takes a pen, and draws a smile on one of the terrible
	monsters, transforming it at once.  FERNANDO laughs
	immediately.

					FERNANDO
			I want to go with you!

					COLUMBUS
			There'll be a time.

					FERNANDO
			You promise?
				(Columbus nods his
				head)
			Do you swear on St. Christopher...?

	FERNANDO pulls the chain with the St. Christopher medal
	from under COLUMBUS' shirt.

					FERNANDO
			Do you swear on all the Holy Saints
			in heaven?

					COLUMBUS
				(laughing)
			Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!

	And he hugs his SON tightly.


	EXT.  HILLSIDE AND GATE - PRE-DAWN

	A luminous procession passes through a Moorish stone gate,
	down to the harbor.  We see the faces of the SAILORS and
	their FAMILIES -- COLUMBUS, PINZON AMONGST THEM -- We
	sense the fervor and apprehension of the departure.  The
	procession is lead by MARCHENA and four young NOVICES
	carrying the Madonna.  All hold long, burning tapers,
	saying the rosary.  A SAILOR pushes through the crowd, and
	kisses the Madonna's feet.


	EXT.  PALOS HARBOR - DAWN

	Hundreds of candles flicker in the pre-dawn light, held by
	the FAMILIES and FRIENDS of the SAILORS.

	The SANTA MARIA the PINTA and the NINA nestle against the
	quayside.  Dwarfed by the hulls, a flotilla of smaller
	fishing craft, returning from night fishing, accidentally
	witness this event.


	EXT.  MAKESHIFT CONFESSIONAL - DOCKSIDE - DAWN

	MARCHENA sits on a barrel and crosses himself.  Behind a
	curtain sits COLUMBUS.

					MARCHENA
			In Nomine Patris et Filius, et
			Spiritus Sancti.

					COLUMBUS
			Forgive me, Father.  For I have
			sinned.

	MARCHENA recognizes COLUMBUS' voice.

					MARCHENA
			I am listening, my son.

					COLUMBUS
			Father, I have betrayed my family.
			I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed
			you.

					MARCHENA
			What are you saying?

					COLUMBUS
			I lied.  The journey will be longer
			than I said.

					MARCHENA
			How long?

					COLUMBUS
			I am not sure... It could be twice
			the distance.

	A pause.

					MARCHENA
			May God forgive you...!  You must
			tell them!  You must tell your men!

					COLUMBUS
			If I tell them, they won't follow
			me.  You know that I am right,
			Father.  You trust me...

					MARCHENA
			My son, my son...
				(he shakes his head)
			Your certitudes are sometimes
			frightening...
				(pause)
			Christopher, you must speak to them.
			And if you don't I will.

					COLUMBUS
			You are bound by an oath, Father.

	A long silence.

					MARCHENA
			I believed in you...

					COLUMBUS
			Give me absolution.

	No response.

					COLUMBUS
			Give me absolution, Father!

	Devastated, MARCHENA reluctantly makes the sign of the
	cross.


	EXT.  HARBOR AND SHIPS - PALOS - DAWN

	COLUMBUS walks over to where BEATRIX and FERNANDO are
	waiting.  He kisses and hugs FERNANDO.

					MARCHENA (O.S.)
			Ispo Te Absoluto.  May God forgive
			you and have mercy on your soul,
			Christopher Columbus.  Go in peace.

									DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT.  HARBOR AND SHIPS - DAWN - LATER

	The CROWDED QUAYSIDE.  COLUMBUS stands in front of
	FERNANDO.

					COLUMBUS
			Be good to your mother, Fernando.
			Do you promise?

	FERNANDO nods, tears in his eyes.  Then COLUMBUS embraces
	BEATRIX tightly.  She whispers into his ear.

					BEATRIX
			Speak to Diego.

	But COLUMBUS and DIEGO are unable to find words, and
	instead they clumsily hug.  Someone taps COLUMBUS'
	shoulder.  He turns around to see SANTANGEL.  Wordlessly,
	they hug.

									CUT TO:

	Activity on the ships, orders are being shouted, ropes
	fore and aft are cast off, splashing into the water... Now
	the SHIPS are slowly moving parallel to the quayside.  The
	CROWD starts walking abreast to the VESSELS.  WOMEN
	holding up babies, blowing kisses, old PARENTS crying...
	BEATRIX, HER SONS, AND SANTANGEL are among them.

	COLUMBUS suddenly unties the chain around his neck, and
	throws it at DIEGO.

					COLUMBUS
			Diego!  Here!

	DIEGO catches it.  Opening his hand he looks at the
	medallion.  Then looks up at his FATHER, elated.

	THE SANTA MARIA is now two meters from the QUAY.
	SANTANGEL is now opposite COLUMBUS.

					SANTANGEL
				(casually)
			Take care of my investment, wherever
			you're going!

					COLUMBUS
				(ambiguous)
			I have to tell you Santangel.  I
			don't know where on earth I am
			going!

	They both laugh.

	A FISHERMAN, standing in his shrimp-boat lets his hand
	slide gently along the gigantic hull.  He stares up at the
	SAILORS leaning on the rail.

					SAILOR
			Vaya con Dios!  (Go with God!)

	They wave back.

									CUT TO:

	MARCHENA walking towards the Moorish gate.  He finally
	turns, sad and distraught.  He sees:

									CUT TO:

	EXT.  SHIPS AT SEA - WHALES - DAY

	THREE SHIPS ON A BOUNDLESS OCEAN.

	The sea resembling a DORMANT MONSTER, holding its breath.
	A living being, all powerful, capable of unpredictable
	metamorphosis.  Music reflects the loneliness, the anxiety
	of the crew, the fear of the unknown...

	ENORMOUS WHALES moving slowly alongside, surging
	majestically through the waves.  Sinking back,
	disappearing, their cries taking precedent over the music.


	EXT.  DECK - DAY

	A SHIP'S BOY is throwing buckets of water on the deck.

	A SAILOR is busy clearing the ropes around the mast.

	A COOK is blowing life into a brazier, in preparation of
	the evening meal.

	TEN MEN heaving on a heavy rope, raising the top sail,
	punctuating their efforts with a sailor's chant.


	EXT.  SANTA MARIA - NIGHT

	The crystalline north star -- as if seen through an
	instrument.

	COLUMBUS' silhouette, by an oil lamp, standing at the
	prow.  Holding a quadrant he is aiming at the stars.

	SOME SAILORS are watching with curiosity.  One of them is
	ALONSO, a rough, stocky Basque.

	Near COLUMBUS, on a tressel, various books and charts.  He
	makes an entry in the log.  Then goes back to his
	quadrant.  He senses MENDEZ standing next to him.

					COLUMBUS
				(softly)
			Due west, Captain Mendez.  And may
			God be with us...

					MENDEZ
			God be with us admiral.

	MENDEZ doesn't move, continuing to observe COLUMBUS.

					COLUMBUS
			What is it Mendez?  Speak!

	MENDEZ is hesitant.  He nervously clears his throat.

					MENDEZ
			Well... It's the men, Sir.  They
			wonder how you know our position.
			We've lost sight from land days
			ago...

					COLUMBUS
				(still taking
				readings)
			And what do you think Mendez?

					MENDEZ
			Well, I surely know what a quadrant
			is!  But I've never seen it used at
			night before.

					COLUMBUS
			Come over here.

	MENDEZ hesitates, then motions to COLUMBUS.  The SAILORS
	are watching, and some approach to hear the conversation.

					COLUMBUS
			Now, find the North Star.  Do you
			have it?

									CUT TO:

	The picture swims across the heavens, until we see the
	north star.

					COLUMBUS (O.S.)
			Steady yourself...!  Keep the plumb
			line vertical...

	The picture steadies.

									CUT TO:

	MENDEZ nods -- and loses equilibrium.  The plumb line
	swings.

					COLUMBUS
			Don't move!  A mistake of one degree
			and we'll be off 6,000 leagues!

	MENDEZ tries again.

					COLUMBUS
			What do you read?

					MENDEZ
			Twenty eight.

	MENDEZ turns to COLUMBUS.

					COLUMBUS
			That's it.  The twenty eighth
			parallel.  And we'll follow it until
			we reach land.

	ALONSO does not seem convinced.

					ALONSO
			How do you know land is on the
			twenty eighth parallel?


	EXT.  SANTA MARIA - DECK - DAY

	A blazing sun.  The ship is like a furnace, its brass
	fittings too hot to touch, the blistering heat making the
	air shimmer over the decks.

	Desperate for shade, sailors are sheltering under the
	sagging prow sail.

	The SHIP'S BOY throws an empty bucket attached to a rope
	over the side and hauls it back up again, brimming with
	water.  As he turns, we see his face, disfigured by a hair
	lip.  He drenches himself... From the shade, ALONSO
	watches him.

					ALONSO
			Chicken-ass face!

	The others laugh.  The BOY, ashamed, tries to ignore them.
	ALONSO'S hand accidentally touches a brass fitting; he
	reacts like he was burnt.

					ALONSO
			Shit!

	He sucks his blistered fingers.

					ALONSO
			I never seen heat like this!  Not
			even in Las Minas!

					SAILOR
			The water's going putrid in the
			barrels.

					ALONSO
			You'll be drinking your own piss...
			For the glory of Spain... and
			Admiral Colon...!  Bastard!

	The SHIP'S BOY glances round at them.

					ALONSO
			What are you listening to, chicken
			ass?

					SAILOR
			Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no
			harm.

					ALONSO
			With a face like that?
				(to boy)
			I don't want you looking at me.  You
			hear?

	The BOY turns away, dropping the bucket back into the sea.

					ALONSO
			He's the devil's child...

					SAILOR
			We'll all go crazy...

	The BOY throws more water over the deck.  A SAILOR takes
	his guitar, and starts singing an improvised song.

					SAILOR
			Culo de galina es el hijo del
			demonio... (Chicken ass mouth is the
			devil's child... Born from the loins
			of a stinky old goat etc...)

	They all laugh.  The BOY, hearing this, climbs to the
	crow's-nest like a monkey.


	EXT.  SANTA MARIA - RIGGING AND CROW'S-NEST - DAY

	We experience a sense of vertigo as we near the top of the
	main mast, high above the rolling deck.

	The BOY curls like a fetus in the swinging crow's-nest,
	exhausted by the heat, and scared.  His eyes are turning
	white.  He begins to piss himself...

									CUT TO:

	EXT.  SANTA MARIA - DECK - DAY

	Piss is dripping on the deck.  THE SAILORS do not seem to
	care.  THE COOK takes a chicken from a cage.  He breaks
	its neck, and starts plucking it.  The OTHERS continue
	their bitter conversation.

					ALONSO
			We should have seen land.

					SAILOR
			We left three weeks ago, Alonso.
			Can't be that near.

					ALONSO
			Can't be that far, I say.  Also, I
			don't like the smell of the sea
			around here.  Smells like a cunt.
			Bad sign...

	The COOK starts laughing.  They turn to him.

					COOK
				(shaking his head)
			Of course it smells like it!  That's
			why sailors take to the sea!

	They all laugh.  Alonso looks up at COLUMBUS standing on
	the poop deck, scrutinizing the horizon, waiting for the
	land to appear.

					ALONSO
			And why does this one take to the
			sea?  Nobody knows.  Never says a
			word...

	MENDEZ has sensed the danger of this lack of respect.  He
	approaches them.

					MENDEZ
			To your post!  At once!

	They split in silence.


	EXT.  SANTA MARIA - DECK - NIGHT

	The SHIP is plowing on, pushed by a hot wind -- SAILORS
	sleep on deck.

	The SHIP'S BOY is singing to himself.  Despite his hair
	lip he has a pure, melancholy voice...

	COLUMBUS, leaning over the prow rail, staring ahead, hears
	it carry over the darkness.


	EXT.  SANTA MARIA - DECK - DAY

	CLOSE UP ON AN HOUR-GLASS, nearly through its time.

	The SHIP'S BOY throws an "ampoulette" over board.  We
	follow the bulb attached to a rope, passing the full
	length of the hull.  As it reaches the poop deck, another
	SAILOR shouts "MARK".  A very primitive system of
	calculation for distance and speed.

	Sitting near the SHIP'S BOY, COLUMBUS is making entries in
	a log-book, watching the hourglass.

					SHIP'S BOY
			Mark.  Twenty nine, Sir!

	THE HOUR-GLASS runs out.  COLUMBUS converts the mark into
	a daily average for distance and speed.

					COLUMBUS
			Six hundred and twenty nine.

	THE SHIP'S BOY cups his hands to his mouth to shout.

									CUT TO:

	EXT.  PINTA - DAY

	PINZON, his OFFICERS beside him, looks across at the SANTA
	MARIA.

					SHIP'S BOY
			Six hundred and twenty nine!

	AN OFFICER turns to PINZON to repeat the message.

					OFFICER
			Six hundred and twenty nine, Sir!

	PINZON does not seem too pleased.

					PINZON
			I heard.

	THE OFFICER examines his own calculations.

					OFFICER
			Captain, I don't understand.

					PINZON
			I think I do.

	He goes back to his cabin.

									CUT TO:

	EXT.  SHIPS - SARGASSO SEA - DAY

	ABSOLUTE STILLNESS.  A FURNACE.  The three ships like
	dots, on what seems to be a prairie of weed.

	The caravels are being towed by three rowing boats.

	CLOSE ON THE MEN, rowing, drenched with sweat.

	FROM THE PROW, COLUMBUS is staring at the horizon.

	ALONSO pulling at his oars stares at COLUMBUS' distant
	figure with hate and resentment.

	ALONSO suddenly ships his oars, throwing the whole boat
	into disarray.  Chaos.

	Total silence.  MENDEZ and ALONSO stare at each other.

					MENDEZ
			Continue rowing!

					ALONSO
			To where?

	ALONSO defiantly stares at MENDEZ.  He then starts to beat
	a rhythm on the hull with his fist, followed by the
	others.  In the two other boats, the MEN begin to follow
	suit, beating a rhythm of protest on the hulls.

	MENDEZ looks up to COLUMBUS, in panic.

	ON BOARD PINZON'S SHIP, an OFFICER cups his hands to his
	mouth.

					OFFICER
			Captain Pinzon requests permission
			to board.

									CUT TO:

	EXT.  SANTA MARIA - DAY

					COLUMBUS
			Granted.


	INT.  COLUMBUS' CABIN - DAY

	PINZON enters.  He looks furious.

					PINZON
			You lied!  You cheated!  We're way
			past 750 leagues!

					COLUMBUS
				(calmly)
			Six days ago, yes.

					PINZON
			You must be mad...!

					COLUMBUS
			We have to keep the hopes of these
			men alive!

					PINZON
			We're on the verge of a mutiny,
			Colon!

					COLUMBUS
			You think I don't know that?

					PINZON
			We're lost!

					COLUMBUS
			The land is there.  I know it!

					PINZON
			You don't know anything!  Listen
			Colon, these are my ships, right?
			So I'm telling you we're turning
			back!

					COLUMBUS
			And then what?  Half of the water
			has gone, the rest is nearly putrid!
			You know that!

					PINZON
				(apoplectic)
			Jesus Maria!  I should have never
			listened to you!

					COLUMBUS
			You never did.  You did all the
			talking for both of us, remember?

					PINZON
			You bloody...

					COLUMBUS
			Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now
			is go forward!  Think about that!

					PINZON
			You tell that to them!

					COLUMBUS
			You're right.  Let the men decide.

	COLUMBUS moves to the door.  As an afterthought, he takes
	his scarlet-embroidered jacket from a hook.


	EXT.  SANTA MARIA - DECK - DAY

	Most of the men are now back on board.

	They go silent as COLUMBUS appears.  He walks slowly over
	to them.  All, including ALONSO, are surly, threatening...

					COLUMBUS
			Who gave you the order to come on
			board?

	He looks up and down the line, finishing on ALONSO.  They
	stare at one another.

					ALONSO
			God doesn't want us to cross the
			ocean...!  This voyage is cursed!

	Some of the MEN murmur their agreement.

					COLUMBUS
			Cursed?

					ALONSO
			We set sail for greed.  God has
			abandoned us.  The voyage is cursed.
			There are signs...

	ALONSO glances towards the SHIP'S BOY, with his hair lip.
	The BOY lowers his eyes.  COLUMBUS moves towards him,
	pulls him forward, stands him in front of ALONSO.

					COLUMBUS
			This boy has the voice of an angel.
			What comes out of his mouth is
			blessed, Alonso.  What comes out of
			your is evil.

	Some of the men laugh at this statement.  ALONSO is ill at
	ease.  COLUMBUS pauses, looks around at all the MEN.

					COLUMBUS
			Listen to me!  Every man is afraid
			who does something for the first
			time.  But those who overcome their
			fears, will find their rewards.  I
			do not know if it is God's will that
			we cross this ocean -- but I am
			certain it is the devil who puts
			fears into our hearts...

	The MEN are listening.  We sense a subtle change of
	mood...

					COLUMBUS
			This jacket to the first man who
			sights land!  I want a man up that
			mast day and night.

	COLUMBUS points at the SHIP'S BOY.

					COLUMBUS
			You start first.

	The SHIP'S BOY rushes up the mast.  As he climbs, the
	mainsail starts to fill with wind.  The deck begins to
	move under their feet.

	This movement under their feet seems to imperceptibly
	erase the fears and the angers.

					MENDEZ
			Alonso!  Jaime!  Don't let this wind
			escape us.

	CRIES from the other ships, as the sails snap taut,
	filling with wind.  MEN rush to their posts.  PINZON
	stares at COLUMBUS, shaking his head in disbelief.

					PINZON
				(murmuring)
			You lucky bastard...

	COLUMBUS walks away to his cabin, then turning back to
	PINZON.

					COLUMBUS
			Pinzon, the more I sail, the luckier
			I get.

	Turning abruptly, he enters his cabin.


	EXT.  SANTA MARIA - PROW - MISTY NIGHT

	COLUMBUS is seated, isolated at the prow, wrapped in his
	cape, struggling against the sleep.  MENDEZ approaches him
	with a bowl of soup.

					MENDEZ
			Shall I take my turn?

	COLUMBUS shakes his head no, and starts drinking from the
	bowl.

									CUT TO:

	COLUMBUS' head nods lower and lower to his chest.  He is
	asleep.  We become aware of a sharp buzzing sound.  It
	becomes louder as we move closer to COLUMBUS' face.

	A mosquito lands on his temple.  COLUMBUS reflexively
	slaps it.  He wakes up, and looks at his fingers -- a spot
	of blood, a crushed mosquito.  He stares at it for a
	moment.  Then slowly gets to his feet.


	EXT.  SANTA MARIA - DECK - NIGHT

	In the luminous moonlight, COLUMBUS is standing, staring
	up at thousands of insects that wheel around the mast
	lantern.  We hear the flutter of their wings and see the
	bats as they swoop and dive in a feeding frenzy.

	COLUMBUS turns, stares into the darkness, desperate to see
	the land that must be close.

	He kneels by MENDEZ, wrapped in a blanket.  He touches his
	shoulder.

					COLUMBUS
				(murmuring)
			Mendez!  Mendez!

	MENDEZ grimaces, and opens one eye.

					COLUMBUS
			Land...

									CUT TO:

	EXT.  SHIP - DAWN   

	An opaque dawn.  COLUMBUS, riveted, staring forward as if
	to pierce the mist.  The entire crew are clinging to the
	rail, and standing on the shrouds.

	Suddenly, the SHIP BOY'S voice cracking with emotion.

					SHIP'S BOY
			TIERRA...!  TIERRA!

	COLUMBUS strains his eyes; he still can not see anything.

	The entire CREW stand and stare, silent, holding their
	breath.

	As the sun begins to rise, the fog dissipates -- slowly,
	exquisitely, revealing a single palm, so close it seems
	almost as though they could touch it.  Then a white slash
	of beach.

	Near COLUMBUS, a SAILOR falls to his knees and burst into
	tears.  Others laugh with joy.  COLUMBUS watches this
	vision in disbelief, his mouth open as if it were
	difficult for him to breathe.  Tears come to his eyes.  He
	closes them.  Then opens them again.  The land is there --
	a green paradise.

	On screen the words:  OCTOBER 12, 1942.  GUANAHAN ISLAND


	EXT.  BOATS - DAY

	Three row boats plunging through the surf towards the
	beach.  COLUMBUS stands in the prow of the first boat.
	MENDEZ is in the second.  PINZON the third.  They stare
	entranced at the lushness of the foliage, and the blue
	clarity of the water...

	As the first boat beaches, COLUMBUS leaps out and wades
	ashore.  Behind him the rest of the landing party splash
	through the sun-dazzled water, carrying the banner of
	Castille and Aragon.


	EXT.  BEACH - DAY

	They stand on the beach, almost in a dream.  There is
	silence.  The ROYAL NOTARY, ludicrously overdressed, now
	wet through, stumbles over to COLUMBUS and holds out his
	contract and a pen.  COLUMBUS scrawls his name.

	The MEN stare at him, filled not only with new respect,
	but with something amounting to awe.

	COLUMBUS turns to them, tries to speak.

					COLUMBUS
			By the... by the Grace of... God...

	He swallows.  Tears have sprung to his eyes.  He is so
	moved he cannot continue.  Coming to his rescue -- THE
	SHIP'S BOY starts to roll the drum.  He then stops.

					COLUMBUS
				(pulling himself
				together)
			In the name of their Gracious
			Majesties of Castille and Aragon,
			and by all the powers vested in me,
			I claim this island and name it San
			Salvador.

	The MEN cheer as the flags are rammed into the sand,
	flapping in the wind.

	COLUMBUS starts to walk towards the jungle, and in silence
	the rest follow.


	EXT.  JUNGLE - DAY

	Immediately they are met by an incredible wall of SOUND!
	The jungle is filled with NOISE.  The impossibly-loud
	CRIES of EXOTIC BIRDS, the CHATTERING of MONKEYS.  The
	SPANIARDS are overwhelmed.

	They move forward.  Rays of sunlight pierce through the
	high canopy of leaves, like the roof of a magnificent
	cathedral.  The sounds and smells intoxicate their senses.
	They are filled with wonder.

	Then PINZON stops.  He has seen something.  Another stops,
	then a third, staring ahead of them...

					MENDEZ
				(whispering
				urgently)
			Arquebuses!

	Several of them raise their weapons to their shoulders,
	pointing them into the jungle.

	From COLUMBUS' POV we slowly scan the face of the thick
	jungle ahead.  For a moment we don't see anything -- and
	then, with a shock, we see the first INDIAN.  Naked,
	painted like an idol, carrying a hunting lance.

	As if they had materialized from nowhere:  the rest of the
	HUNTING PARTY, with their bows and spears.  Silent.
	Watchful.  They stare back at us.

	The SPANIARDS nervously finger their weapons.

	COLUMBUS slowly lifts his hand into the air:  a clear
	signal not to fire.  Then, removing his sword, he drops it
	on the ground, and starts to walk forward, fixing his gaze
	upon the first INDIAN he saw.

					PINZON
				(warningly)
			Colon!

	COLUMBUS ignores him, even though some of the INDIANS have
	raised their weapons.  He stops in the no-man's land
	between them.  The INDIANS don't move -- but something
	excites them.

	The SHIP'S BOY, wearing COLUMBUS' embroidered jacket and
	the drum, has followed COLUMBUS and now stands close to
	him.  He is the cause of their interest.  COLUMBUS puts
	his arm around the BOY, and this gesture of affection
	seems to put the INDIANS at their ease.  They start
	talking and pointing.  They come forward slowly, start to
	tentatively touch the BOY'S jacket.  Then, now laughing,
	they touch COLUMBUS, pulling at his beard.  COLUMBUS
	laughs too.

	Sensing their innocence, the rest of the MEN lower their
	weapons.  Some of them laugh.

	An apparition:  a beautiful young INDIAN GIRL, totally
	naked, walks out of the jungle.

	She is pregnant and holds a child.  We begin to hear
	Indian music, played on a flute.

									CUT TO:

	EXT.  INDIAN VILLAGE - DAY

	A large post is lifted from the ground by two SPANIARDS
	pulling on ropes.  The post is fixed into position -- and
	then we see that it is a large wooden cross... The INDIAN
	VILLAGERS watch the ceremony with some interest and
	amusement.

	COLUMBUS looks over at the men and gestures at the
	INDIANS.

					COLUMBUS
			We have come here in peace, and we
			will behave with honor.  They are
			not savages and neither will you be.
			Treat these people as you would your
			own wives and your own children.
			Neither are you free to take what
			you will; for a seashell you give a
			bandana.  You will respect their
			beliefs.  Pillage will be punished
			by the whip.  Rape by the sword.


	EXT.  VILLAGE - SUNSET

	The smoke from fires.  Laughter.  Music playing.  The
	INDIANS have prepared food for the SPANIARDS, who are
	drinking and enjoying themselves in this strange world.

	COLUMBUS sits with MENDEZ, PINZON, the INDIAN CHIEF,
	ELDERS OF THE VILLAGE.  Other INDIANS stand around,
	smiling, curious.

	The INDIANS talk among themselves.  The ELDERS smoke
	primitive cigars -- and offer them, with good humor, to
	their guests.  The SPANIARDS cough and choke at first...
	and laugh.  In return, they offer the INDIANS wine...

	Dogs roam around the campfires.  The WOMEN openly suckle
	their babies.  The MEN are entranced.

	PINZON draws out attention, for the first time, to a small
	gold ornament on the nose of one of the INDIANS.  He
	points to it, indicates his interest in it.

					PINZON
			Gold...!  Gold!

	The INDIANS says the word in his own language, laughing.
	We see that some of the other INDIANS also have small gold
	ornaments.

	PINZON repeats the INDIAN word for gold.  The INDIAN
	removes the ornament from his nose, gives it to PINZON,
	who indicates that he wants to have it.  The INDIAN nods
	-- but points to PINZON'S dagger, indicating that he wants
	it in return.  PINZON shakes his head, stops the INDIAN
	from taking it.

					COLUMBUS
				(to Pinzon)
			Give it to him!

	PINZON looks at him, about to argue -- but COLUMBUS
	insists.  PINZON takes out the dagger and offers it to the
	INDIAN.

					PINZON
				(irritated)
			By God!  That's the worst trade of
			my life!

	His friends laugh.  Innocently, the INDIAN has taken it by
	the blade.  He yelps, looks down at the blood welling
	up... A moment of tension... Then MENDEZ laughs at his
	clumsiness, and the ELDERS laugh too... and the INDIAN
	laughs.

	Just outside this circle, we see the first INDIAN we saw,
	squatting on his haunches, watching.  This is UTAPAN.


	INT.  TENT - DAWN

	The first light outside -- the strange, wonderful sounds
	of the jungle all around.  COLUMBUS writes in his journal.

					COLUMBUS (V.O.)
			October 21st, 1492.  I think we have
			returned to Eden.  Surely this is
			how the world once was, before the
			beginning of time.  I believe no man
			will ever see this land again as we
			do, for the first time...

	He looks up.  UTAPAN is squatting in the doorway of the
	hut.  He's been there all night.  COLUMBUS takes more ink
	on his quill and begins to sketch UTAPAN'S face in the
	margin of his log-book.  He draws well.

	He gets up and walks over to UTAPAN and shows him the
	drawing.  It's an electrifying moment.  UTAPAN is shocked
	and amazed.  At first he is rather frightened of his own
	image... Then he is happy, and laughs... and COLUMBUS
	laughs with him and puts a hand on his shoulder in a
	gesture of friendship.

	UTAPAN gets up, and indicates that he too has something he
	wishes to offer.


	EXT.  JUNGLE - MORNING

	UTAPAN expertly scampering through the jungle.  COLUMBUS
	follows him.

	UTAPAN orders COLUMBUS to sit.  COLUMBUS obeys.  UTAPAN
	looks up at the tops of the trees.  The sun is rising, and
	filters through the foliage.  As if the time had come,
	UTAPAN stands up, and COLUMBUS does the same.

	A gap in the dense vegetation.  Something is glittering.
	Gold.  A mass of gold.  As they approach, COLUMBUS
	discovers --

	A large pool of fresh water.  The morning sunlight has
	turned the water into liquid gold.  The surface ripples
	with the breeze.  UTAPAN smiles.  It the stranger
	satisfied?  Isn't this what he came for?

	COLUMBUS plunges into the pool.  As he emerges, he fills
	his palms with liquid gold.

									DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT.  RIVER - DAY

	Wide shot -- A flotilla of canoes are going upstream.

	INDIANS AND SPANIARDS are traveling together in the
	canoes.  UTAPAN leads the expedition in COLUMBUS' craft.
	THE SHIP BOY'S cranium is shaved like UTAPAN'S, and we
	notice that some other crew members are beardless, some
	even wearing tribal patterns.


	EXT.  RIVERSIDE - DAY

	INDIAN VILLAGERS confronting the SPANIARDS, UTAPAN talks
	to an ELDER MAN, watched by COLUMBUS, MENDEZ and PINZON.

	UTAPAN repeats several times the word for GOLD, showing
	some artifacts.  The OLD INDIAN shakes his head no,
	indicating another distant place.

					OLD INDIAN
			Cuba!  Cuba!

	THE OLD MAN nods, points into the distance, chatters away
	to UTAPAN.

					UTAPAN
			Say not here!  Cuba!

					COLUMBUS
			What is it?  A tribe?  An island?

					UTAPAN
			Island.  Far.


	EXT.  SANTA MARIA - DECK - DAY

	Standing at the prow of the ship, his long dark hair
	floating in the wind, UTAPAN rejoicing at the speed.


	EXT.  THICK JUNGLE - CUBA - DAY

	Led by UTAPAN, the SPANIARDS hack their way through thick
	jungle.  It's hard work.  The MEN sweat.  This is
	inhospitable terrain.  Even the noises of the jungle seem
	somehow more sinister...

									CUT TO:

	RESTING PLACE - ALONSO is seated under a tree.  He takes
	off his boot, and grabs his foot, examining the blisters
	on his toes.  As he puts his foot back into the boot, he
	jumps screaming in pain.

	ALONSO yelps, grasping his ankle.

	CLOSE ON a snake sliding out of the empty boot.

	While his COMPANIONS rush to him, a SAILOR spots the
	snake, and decapitates it with his sword.  UTAPAN glances
	at the dead snake.  He then goes and kneels -- he sees the
	bite on ALONSO'S ankle.

					COLUMBUS
			Help him!

	ALONSO is quiet and silent.  His eyes are looking around
	at his companions.  UTAPAN shakes his head.  There is
	nothing he can do.

	ALONSO is now leaning back, supported by one of his
	friends.  He has grabbed the forearm of a SAILOR.  His
	look is already far away.  His companion shouts at UTAPAN.

					SAILOR
			Do something!  Help him!

					UTAPAN
			He dead.

	ALONSO starts convulsing.  HIS FRIENDS hold him, desperate
	in their helplessness.  Others simply move away,
	horrified.  One of them cries.


	EXT.  RIVER - DAY

	Standing in the stream up to his thighs, A SPANIARD (a
	gold expert) examines some stones.  He then looks up at
	COLUMBUS and PINZON and just throws the stones back into
	the water without a word.

	The group of SPANIARDS are resting, exhausted by the
	humidity.  Some are drinking from the river, others soak
	bandanas, and tie them around their necks...

	One after another, they stand up slowly -- they look
	discouraged, tired, and beaten.


	EXT.  MOUNTAINOUS JUNGLE - DAY

	UTAPAN and the SPANIARDS are trekking in the hills.  Fully
	armed, they are now suffering intensely from the heat and
	the vicious insect bites.

	COLUMBUS doggedly keeps up with UTAPAN, who tirelessly
	trots forward.

	Finally, COLUMBUS turns around and sees... nobody.  He
	calls out to UTAPAN.

					COLUMBUS
			Utapan!  Wait!

	UTAPAN stops obediently, and rushes back to COLUMBUS with
	comical energy.

	On their way back, they find one SOLDIER sitting, leaning
	against a tree.  He has removed his helmet.  His hair
	sticking to his forehead.

	As COLUMBUS and UTAPAN walk back, they find another
	SAILOR, then another, then the whole group gathered around
	PINZON.  Ashen, he burns with fever.  He attempts a smile.

					PINZON
			Well... You'll have to continue
			without me...

	COLUMBUS looks around him -- what he sees:  exhausted men
	and jungle, as far as one can see.

					COLUMBUS
			No.  It's enough.  What would you
			say to a drop of Jerez, Pinzon?

	PINZON grins.

					PINZON
			And a nice slice of Santa Fe lamb!
			I'd sell my soul for it.
				(to his officer)
			Help me up.  I've got to piss, gold.

	They all laugh as the OFFICER helps PINZON to his feet.

	PINZON walks a few yards into the jungle -- starts to
	urinate.  It is red.  Suddenly dizzy, he reels and
	collapses.


	EXT.  JUNGLE - DAY

	A line of SPANIARDS and INDIANS threading their way down a
	mountainside.  PINZON is being carried on a makeshift
	stretcher.  His eyes are closed, his face thick with
	sweat.

	They enter a village, to the surprise of the INDIANS.
	UTAPAN once again at the front as the ambassador.


	INT.  HUT - NIGHT

	A INDIAN SHAMAN is forcing a milky fluid into PINZON'S
	mouth.  COLUMBUS attempts a gesture to prevent him.  But
	UTAPAN stops him.

					UTAPAN
			He cures.

	COLUMBUS nods -- he obviously trusts UTAPAN.


	INT.  CHIEF GUARIONEX'S HUT - NIGHT

	In the half-light, figures wreathed in smoke -- COLUMBUS,
	MENDEZ and UTAPAN watch the CHIEF GUARIONEX putting a
	Spanish helmet on his head.  The helmet is too big, almost
	covering his eyes.  The ELDERS appraise the gift with
	solemn wonder.

	In return, GUARIONEX hands COLUMBUS a parcel made of
	leaves.  COLUMBUS unwraps them.  Inside:  a GOLD grimacing
	mask.  The first real piece of gold.  COLUMBUS is unable
	to conceal his excitement at this first real evidence of
	the metal.

	He waits for the CHIEF to speak, but the CHIEF only looks
	at him.  On the ground, we see other presents offered by
	the SPANIARDS -- trinkets, and necklaces...

					UTAPAN
				(to Columbus)
			You come!  You speak first!

					COLUMBUS
			Tell the Chief we thank him.

					UTAPAN
			Chief knows.

					COLUMBUS
			Tell him his country is very
			beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving
			men here -- to build a fort.

	UTAPAN translates.

					COLUMBUS
			Tell him we will return very soon.
			Many of us.

	UTAPAN translates.  The CHIEF GUARIONEX asks a simple
	question.

					UTAPAN
			Chief says -- how many?

					COLUMBUS
			Thousands.

					UTAPAN
			Why?

	COLUMBUS doesn't seem to understand the question.  For the
	first time he seems to be caught short.

					COLUMBUS
			To bring the word of God.

					UTAPAN
			Chief says -- he has a God.

					COLUMBUS
				(pursuing)
			... and also to bring medicine.

					UTAPAN
			Chief says...

					COLUMBUS
				(interrupting)
			He has medicine.
				(pause)
			Tell him we admire his people.

	UTAPAN translates.

					UTAPAN
			Chief says he knows you like his...
				(searches for the
				word)
			Women...

	And the CHIEF gets up, awards COLUMBUS with a smile, and
	walks out of the hut, the ELDERS following, leaving
	COLUMBUS alone.

					COLUMBUS
				(with a little
				smile)
			That's a beginning...


	EXT.  SHORE - DAY

	Watched from the shore by the INDIANS and by about forty
	of the SPANIARDS, who are staying behind, the boats pull
	out towards the two remaining ships.

	PINZON is laid out in the bottom of the boat.  COLUMBUS,
	UTAPAN, and four other INDIANS are in the same boat.

					COLUMBUS (V.O.)
			March 1493... Thirty nine of my men
			volunteered to stay behind.  God
			willing we will be back in less than
			a year...

	The boats continue to pull away, the figures on the shore
	growing smaller.

									CUT TO:

	EXT.  COLUMBUS' CABIN - NIGHT

	CLOSE ON:  a golden mask... the lamp in the cabin swings
	violently back and forth, creating strange shadows, as if
	the mask was alive... COLUMBUS is writing with difficulty
	in his log-book.

					COLUMBUS (V.O.)
			... Several men are ill.  We did not
			find signs of civilization.  No
			cities, no temples... Nothing that
			resembles Marco Polo's descriptions.
			My ships are not filled with the
			spices and the gold that Spain was
			hoping for.  But this land
			intoxicates the senses like the
			strongest of perfumes... And all I
			can think of, is to return to these
			untamed lands...

	Suddenly the cabin seems to lurch over.  Things fall from
	the table, smashing on the floor... COLUMBUS nearly falls.


	EXT.  SEA - NIGHT

	We are in the middle of a violent storm -- of terrifying
	proportions.  The thunder is deafening.  Light irradiates
	the darkness.  We see the two caravels, dwarfed by the
	massive seas.


	EXT.  DECK - NIGHT

	Five MEN are struggling to lash down the tiller.  The deck
	jumps and rolls.  It rises five meters into the air then
	falls into space and hits the water with a terrible crack.
	Waves sweep over the decks.  We hear desperate cries for
	mercy from the terrified crew, loud enough to be heard
	above the storm.

	COLUMBUS and MENDEZ are crawling towards the mast, along a
	lifeline.

					COLUMBUS
				(screaming to the
				sailors)
			Get below!  All of you!  Go!

	The MEN start to scramble below decks.

					COLUMBUS
				(to Mendez)
			Stay with me!

	The ship rolls again.  COLUMBUS and MENDEZ crawl towards
	the mast.  Another gigantic wave crashes over them, tons
	of water falling like cement.  They reach the mast.  The
	wood groans.

					COLUMBUS
			We may have to cut it!

	MENDEZ nods... COLUMBUS grabs some rope.  The ship rises
	into the air again, crashes down, the deck disappearing
	beneath them for a moment.

					COLUMBUS
				(screaming out)
			I'll stay here -- to decide if we
			cut it.  Help me!

	With MENDEZ'S help, COLUMBUS is tied to the mast:  one
	rope under his arms, the other around his waist.  MENDEZ
	hands him a horn.

					COLUMBUS
				(screaming)
			Now go!

	MENDEZ seems to hesitate.  COLUMBUS screams at him again.

					COLUMBUS
			I said -- below deck, Mendez!

	MENDEZ crawls away.

	Another huge wave washes over COLUMBUS.  He emerges,
	almost suffocated.  The storm rages, its eerie light
	making it seem at times like bright daylight.  But as the
	lightning flashes, COLUMBUS begins to count:

					COLUMBUS
			One... two... three... four...

	There's an enormous thunderclap on "four" -- it indicates
	how close they are to the eye of the storm.

	The ship keels over again, dropping down and down, seeming
	never to rise... COLUMBUS lifts his head to the heavens,
	screams out:

					COLUMBUS
			Damn you!

	As if in answer, another flash of lightning that
	illuminates the sky and the sea.  COLUMBUS starts counting
	again.

					COLUMBUS
			One... two... three... four...
			five...

	Another terrible clap of thunder on "five" -- COLUMBUS
	starts laughing, knowing the storm is moving on.

	Then, in the strange light, something seems to move
	through the air towards him; it looks like some kind of
	projectile, a craft, with a trail of vapor.

	COLUMBUS stares up at it... amazed.  We start to hear the
	"Te Deum", majestic and heavenly.

									CUT TO:

	INT.  CATHEDRAL OF CORDOBA - SPAIN - DAY

	COLUMBUS looks up at the vast roof, to see an incense
	burner, swinging, gliding swiftly across the ceiling,
	trailing a think vapor of incense.

	A magnificent "Te Deum" is being sung -- in honor of
	COLUMBUS' achievements and return.  The whole cathedral is
	packed with nobles and dignitaries in their gorgeous
	robes.

	BEATRIX, FERNANDO and DIEGO are staring in fascination at
	COLUMBUS' triumph -- somewhat separated by the grandeur of
	this occasion.  COLUMBUS passes by, walking proudly down
	the long central alley, beside KING FERDINAND and QUEEN
	ISABEL and other GRANDEES.  He turns to his family,
	keeping his eyes on BEATRIX until she is out of his
	vision.

	The procession is followed by UTAPAN, and other INDIANS in
	tribal regalia...

	As they move through the crowds, all eyes are upon
	COLUMBUS.

									CUT TO:

	INT.  ROOM - SEVILLE (PINZON'S DEATH) - DAY

	In a simple room, a PRIEST finishes giving the Last Rites
	and a sheet is pulled over the head of MARTIN PINZON.  His
	WIFE and CHILDREN weep at the bedside.

									CUT TO:

	INT.  CATHEDRAL - DAY

	A stool passes from hands to hands.  It is placed at the
	Queen and King's side.  COLUMBUS sits on it -- a supreme
	privilege.

	To one side sit AROJAZ and SANCHEZ.  AROJAZ leans over to
	whisper to him.

					AROJAZ
			It won't be easy to get rid of your
			prophet now, Don Sanchez.

					SANCHEZ
				(whispering)
			On the contrary, Your Eminence.  It
			seems to me the man is preparing his
			own cross.


	INT.  ALCAZAR'S PALACE IN SEVILLE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

	CLOSE ON:  the face of a young, SPANISH NOBLEMAN, ADRIAN
	DE MOXICA.  Hesitantly, he brings a lighted cigar to his
	lips -- then pauses.

	We discover other people around the magnificent candle-lit
	table.  NOBLE MEN and NOBLE WOMEN.  SANCHEZ.  COLUMBUS.
	QUEEN ISABEL.

	COLUMBUS takes the cigar from MOXICA.  The rest watch him
	with rapt curiosity.  COLUMBUS inhales deeply then, to
	their astonishment, blows out the smoke through his nose.

					COLUMBUS
			You must not inhale, but simply
			allow the palate to enjoy the flavor
			of the Tobacco...

	He hands the cigar back to MOXICA.  With a casual air,
	MOXICA himself inhales deeply -- almost chokes to death.
	He gulps down a glass of wine... much to the amusement of
	the others.

					MOXICA
				(deeply embarrassed)
			And you say this is an Indian vice?
			By God!  I don't see any kind of
			pleasure that would make this a sin.

					COLUMBUS
			The Indians have no such word, Don
			Moxica.

					ISABEL
			Do they have such thoughts?

					COLUMBUS
			They come and go as naked as the day
			God created them...

	ISABEL blushes slightly.

					COLUMBUS
			They don't see sin in their
			nakedness.  They live according to
			nature, in a never ending summer.
			The islands are covered with trees,
			filled with blossoms and fruits.
			And...

					SANCHEZ
				(interrupting)
			Forgive me, Don Colon.  But what
			about gold?

	COLUMBUS nods, turns and whispers something to a SERVANT
	standing just behind his chair.  The SERVANT goes to open
	the door -- and in comes UTAPAN, dressed as a tribesman,
	carrying a casket.  The WOMEN around the table fan
	themselves furiously at the sight.  UTAPAN puts the casket
	down in front of the QUEEN, and steps back.

					COLUMBUS
			These are gifts for Your Majesty.

	ISABEL opens the casket, revealing the gleam of gold
	inside.  She takes out some of the little golden
	ornaments... a bracelet and then the mask.

	She holds it, somehow moved by its crude beauty.

	ISABEL raises the mask to her face, looking across at
	COLUMBUS.

	The image is somehow powerful enough to reduce even the
	ARISTOCRATS to silence.  She speaks from behind the mask.

					ISABEL
			We are more than gratified.

	The guests laugh obsequiously.  COLUMBUS bows a little --
	looks up and meets the eyes of SANCHEZ, who is staring at
	him, coldly.


	INT.  ROTUNDA - DAY

	A SWORD MASTER advances towards us with determination, his
	sword flashing.  He is fighting an adversary we do not
	see, and comments his movements.

					MASTER
			Si!  Si!  Muy bien!  Excellente!
			(Yes!  Yes!  Good!  Excellent!)

	We discover the SWORD MASTER is fencing with COLUMBUS.  A
	dozen duellists are practicing in the magnificent rotunda,
	surrounded with a two-tiered colonnade.

	Out of breath, COLUMBUS stops the exercise, and removes
	his protective canvas padding.  He bows at his teacher,
	who salutes him in return.

	COLUMBUS walks to a tressel laden with food and beverages.
	SANCHEZ, in a fencing outfit and boots, is having a glass
	of wine.  Upon seeing COLUMBUS approaching, he hands him a
	glass.

					SANCHEZ
			You defend yourself admirably...

					COLUMBUS
			... for a commoner?

	SANCHEZ laughs and raises his glass.

					SANCHEZ
			To your second expedition.

	They drink.  A short, somewhat ugly man, with some kind of
	imposing energy, approach them.

					SANCHEZ
			Don Colon -- Don Alonso de
			Bobadilla.  A man who knows our
			laws.

	BOBADILLA bows.

					BOBADILLA
			I understand that you will soon be
			appointing Governors for the
			islands?  Is it not so?

					COLUMBUS
			Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those
			positions have already been taken.

					BOBADILLA
				(disappointed)
			May I ask by whom?

					COLUMBUS
			Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.

	SANCHEZ looks at him in surprise.  BOBADILLA reddens.

					BOBADILLA
			I trust they are men of quality.

	BOBADILLA glances at SANCHEZ.

					COLUMBUS
			But we do have a lack of notaries.
			You should contact my
			administration.

					SANCHEZ
				(amused)
			Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my
			Dear Don Cristobal.

					COLUMBUS
			Good!  We are also in need of
			judges.  Except there are no
			thieves!

	A grin disfigures the face of BOBADILLA.

					BOBADILLA
				(to Sanchez)
			I see I was mistaken.  Don Colon
			has no need for my services...

	And he walks off.  SANCHEZ fills his mouth with a slice of
	ham.

					SANCHEZ
				(amused)
			You seem to have a special talent
			for making friends.

					COLUMBUS
			What...?  Do I have so many already?

					SANCHEZ
				(seriously)
			To rise so high, in so short a time,
			is a dangerous occupation.
				(kindly)
			A little hypocrisy goes a long way.


	INT.  ROOM - ADMINISTRATION - DAY

	COLUMBUS with two MEN:  the oldest, around thirty, is a
	strong-looking man.  The youngest, no more than twenty
	five, is thin and fit.  There is obvious tension in the
	room.  These are BARTOLOME and GIACOMO COLON, COLUMBUS'
	brothers.  BARTOLOME is angry, and GIACOMO thoughtful.

					BARTOLOME
			You might have given us a choice!

					GIACOMO
			Bartolome is stronger, more capable
			than I will ever be...

					COLUMBUS
			I need both of you.  What are you
			afraid of?  We are living what we
			always dreamt of.

					GIACOMO
			You know I never shared those dreams
			with you.

					COLUMBUS
			Are you saying you refuse to help?

	COLUMBUS looks at them with such pained surprise...

					BARTOLOME
				(amused)
			You bastard... you always had your
			own way...

					COLUMBUS
			Let me show you something.

	He opens the door to a terrace.

									CUT TO:

	EXT.  GALLERY - DAY

	The large gallery courtyard is crowded with PEOPLE --
	applicants for the voyage.  As COLUMBUS appears, they all
	press forward, calling out his name, trying to get his
	attention, touching his sleeves as if he were a saint.
	They crowd around COLUMBUS and his BROTHERS.  COLUMBUS
	nods, murmurs vaguely, here and there...

					COLUMBUS
			Of course... Of course... We'll see
			to it... Yes... Thank you... Soon...
			Soon...

	Fighting their way through, the BOTHERS press their way,
	reaching the other side of the gallery.  We get glimpses
	of the incredible activity down below.  ADMINISTRATORS,
	MILITARIES, MERCHANTS are busy around tressels covered
	with documents, plans, maps... preparing the second
	expedition.

	COLUMBUS puts his arms around them.

					COLUMBUS
				(indicating the
				applicants)
			Now -- you tell me.  Who can I
			trust?
				(almost amused)
			We're brothers!  We must be a House.
			A bloodline!  In this country one
			can't exist alone!  I need you...!
			Both of you!

	He walks then to the balustrade.  The cries from the
	courtyard down below subside... some of the applicants
	begin to look up, aware of his presence.

					SOLDIER
			Where is the Admiral?  Has anyone
			seen the Admiral?

	Everybody laughs.

					COLUMBUS
			He is here!  What is it?

	He leans over the balcony.  In the middle of the
	overcrowded courtyard, the SOLDIER who was shouting is
	brandishing a document.

					MAN
			Admiral!  The horses have arrived.

					COLUMBUS
			I know.  I saw them!  Who did we
			hire today?

	ANOTHER ASSISTANT raises his eyes.

					ASSISTANT
			Thirty blacksmiths, twenty eight
			halberdiers, twenty carpenters, a
			hundred farmers, twenty miners...
			and Doctor Chanca, the royal
			surgeon.

					COLUMBUS
			The royal surgeon?  Then we can
			count on royal health!

	The whole courtyard bursts out laughing.


	EXT.  ORANGERY - VICEROY'S HOUSE - DAY

	UTAPAN is lying in his hammock.  FERNANDO turns him over.
	UTAPAN falls to the ground.

	COLUMBUS walks beside BEATRIX.

					COLUMBUS
				(looking at his son)
			He's growing up!

	BEATRIX smiles, nods.  They walk on.

					COLUMBUS
			Beatrix, I want to ask you
			something.

					BEATRIX
				(with a smile)
			You don't usually ask.

					COLUMBUS
				(after a pause)
			I can arrange for the Queen to take
			Fernando and Diego into her service.

	BEATRIX stops in her tracks, looks at him.

					COLUMBUS
			It is a great honor.  We could not
			hope for anything better.

	BEATRIX nods, but bites her lip, and looks back at
	FERNANDO.

					BEATRIX
			For once I wish you weren't right.

	COLUMBUS puts his arm around her waist, pulling her
	closer, they move away.


	EXT.  FAR END OF THE ORANGERY - DAY

	FERNANDO is now swinging expertly in the hammock.  UTAPAN
	is pushing him gently.  He slowly straightens up to watch
	COLUMBUS and BEATRIX disappear, somehow sensing there is a
	dilemma.  FERNANDO noticing UTAPAN'S reaction, turns to
	his parents.  The arbor is empty.  FERNANDO becomes
	pensive.

	We become aware of the rustling of the jungle.

									 SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT.  BEACH AND EDGE OF JUNGLE - DAY

	FIFTEEN HUNDRED MEN spread along the beach, looking
	towards the jungle.  COLUMBUS stands beside his BROTHERS,
	and MENDEZ, and UTAPAN.

	MOXICA, astride a magnificent black horse, prances back
	and forth across the sand.  All are waiting.

	A signal cannon is fired from one of the ships.  Birds
	scatter into the air from the jungle -- but then silence,
	complete and ominous.  COLUMBUS stares into the jungle.
	Nothing.  No one to greet them -- no welcoming party from
	the MEN they left behind.

	COLUMBUS glances at MENDEZ.

	MENDEZ looks at him, but can't answer.

	MOXICA suddenly spurs on his horse, and guides it into the
	trees.  The order is given for the rest to follow, fanning
	out as they do so, weapons at the ready.


	EXT.  CLEARING - JUNGLE - DAY

	Ruins.  The camp has been burned to ashes.  A strange
	sight:  arrows are stuck vertically into the ground, each
	with a moldering tuft of human hair attached to the
	flight.

	In silence the SOLDIERS pick their way through the
	devastation.

	The ground is littered with coconuts.  Kicking one over
	with his shoe, a SOLDIER discovers that his coconut is
	actually a human skull.  The gaping mouth has been filled
	to the brim with gold.

	But of the living, there is no sign.

					MOXICA
			Is this your new world, Don Colon?

	COLUMBUS looks around in dismay.  A YOUNG NOBLEMAN,
	HERNANDO DE GUEVARA, takes out his sword.

					GUEVARA
			These animals should be shown what
			savagery can be!

	Other SPANIARDS join in, repeating this last word.

					NOBLEMAN
			Three heads for every life taken.
			No mercy before God!

					GUEVARA
			No mercy!  Let's find them.

					COLUMBUS
			No Guevara.  There will be no
			revenge.

	Silence.  Everyone looks at COLUMBUS.

					MOXICA
			We lost cousins, friends.  We will
			wash this in blood.

					COLUMBUS
			If you want to keep your head on
			your shoulders, you'll do as I say.

	They are all listening.

					COLUMBUS
			Moxica, I lost friends too... Thirty
			nine brave men who trusted me.

	He walks among them.

					COLUMBUS
			You want a war?  Fine.  We are a
			thousand.  They outnumber us by ten!
			Who will you kill?  Which tribe?

					MOXICA
			We don't need to know.

					COLUMBUS
			We came here to stay!  To build!
			Not to start a crusade.  In this
			forest, there is enough danger to
			sweep us away in days!  So we will
			be brave and swallow our grief.  And
			in the name of those who died, we
			will accomplish what we came for.


	EXT.  INDIAN VILLAGE - DAY

	MOXICA mounted on his magnificent BLACK STALLION canters
	to the edge of the deserted village and enters the
	village.  UTAPAN is terrorized by the absence of anything
	living.

	All we can hear is the breathing of the horse.  The
	animal, an impressive mass of muscle, prances nervously.

	UTAPAN calls out in dialect.

					UTAPAN
			They here.

	Slowly, they begin to appear, one after the other --
	materializing from the jungle.  Shy and scared.

	They stare at this "Centaur" (the HORSE and the HORSEMAN
	seem to be one -- a God).

	To impress them even more, MOXICA makes the beast move
	sideways and backwards, rearing, its front hoofs pawing
	the air.  THE INDIANS retreat in terror, except for one,
	who stands his ground, brandishing his lance.

	UTAPAN encourages the YOUNG WARRIOR to approach the
	centaur.  He places his hand onto the shoulder of the
	animal.  The muscles shudder.  THE INDIAN jumps back
	comically, accompanied by the rest of the tribe.

	Without warning, MOXICA climbs down from the saddle.  More
	INDIANS step back in fear and absolute astonishment.  Now
	more have ventured from the jungle.  The bravest of them
	approach MOXICA, daring to touch him, and the horse,
	retreating then touching until they fill the compound.

	At this moment, COLUMBUS and his SOLDIERS appear all
	around them, pointing their muskets, and their crossbows.
	A moment of tension.

	COLUMBUS walks forward, towards the CHIEF (GUARIONEX) we
	meet before.

					COLUMBUS
			Ask the Chief what happened to my
			men?

	The CHIEF answers.

					UTAPAN
			Another tribe made war on them...
			came by sea... took them away...

					BROTHER BUYL
			God have mercy on their souls...

					MOXICA
			The monkey is lying.

	A pause.  The SPANIARDS shifting, eager for blood.

					MOXICA
			We should kill them, Don Colon.

	UTAPAN looks anxiously at COLUMBUS.

					COLUMBUS
			No...!  you'll do it my way.
				(to Utapan)
			Tell the Chief we will not harm his
			people, even though we have the
			power to do it.

	UTAPAN translates.  The CHIEF listens in silence.

					COLUMBUS
			We will work with his people.  We
			want peace.  Ask the Chief if he
			understands?

					UTAPAN
			He understands.

					COLUMBUS
			Ask him if he will help.

									CUT TO:

	EXT.  WATERMILL AND DAM UNDER CONSTRUCTION - DAY

	It is raining hard.  COLUMBUS is floundering in the mud,
	supervising a mixed work-force of SPANISH and INDIANS.
	They are attempting to raise the huge wheel of a
	watermill.

	Despite COLUMBUS' shouts of encouragement, it's clear the
	wheel is far too heavy and the mud too deep.

	Close by, on horseback, MOXICA watches the scene.
	COLUMBUS, plastered with wet mud, clambers out of the pit
	and approaches him.

					COLUMBUS
			Don Moxica -- we need your horse.

	MOXICA looks down at the sodden, dirty figure.

					COLUMBUS
			We can't raise the wheel without it.

					MOXICA
			My horse doesn't work.

	A beat.  COLUMBUS wipes some mud from his eyes.

					COLUMBUS
			Don Moxica -- we all have to work.

					MOXICA
			You did not hear me, Don Colon.  Not
			my horse.

	He starts to turn away; COLUMBUS grabs hold of the reins.

					COLUMBUS
			Forgive me, Don Moxica.  But it was
			your horse I was talking about.

	A beat.  MOXICA stares down at an equally determined
	COLUMBUS.  Then, in front of everyone, MOXICA has to
	dismount, and suffer the disgrace of it.

					COLUMBUS
			Thank you, Don Moxica.

	COLUMBUS leads the horse away.

									CUT TO:

	EXT.  WATERMILL AND DAM UNDER CONSTRUCTION - DAY

	Harnessed, the horse pulls, with COLUMBUS and the MEN.
	The wheel is raised into position.

									CUT TO:

	EXT.  WATERMILL AND DAM - DAY

	Water thundering into the new canal.  The huge wheel
	begins to turn.  The MEN cheer and congratulate each
	other.  MOXICA looks at his mud-splattered and foaming
	horse, his eyes full of hatred.


	EXT.  CITY OF ISABEL - TWILIGHT

	A wide, high shot of the new "City", dominated by a huge
	wooden cross -- no more than a muddy main street bordered
	by a hundred bamboo and stone shanties, with candles
	burning in the doorways.  A main square with the
	Governor's Mansion, and the foundations of a church.

	In the twilight, COLUMBUS and the other WORKERS returning,
	dirty and tired.


	EXT.  VERANDA OF MOXICA'S HOUSE - TWILIGHT

	MOXICA and GUEVARA sit out on the "veranda", watching the
	MEN return.  MOXICA raises his glass in an ironic salute.

					MOXICA
			To the Governor of the Mosquitoes!

	They laugh.  We see the smoke and flames from a fire.
	Four or five INDIANS are squatting on the earth nearby,
	cooking for them, talking quietly in their own language.

	MOXICA calls out something in their language, and a naked
	YOUNG INDIAN GIRL comes out of the house, bringing more
	wine.  GUEVARA stares at her lasciviously.  MOXICA,
	letting his hand casually brush against her flank, smiles
	at him.

					MOXICA
			Do you want her?

	He turns the GIRL round so that GUEVARA can admire her
	properly.  GUEVARA nods.  MOXICA lets the GIRL go with a
	peremptory order, and she disappears back inside.

	GUEVARA suddenly stands up -- unsteadily -- and sweeping
	his arm round in a broad gesture, says ironically:

					GUEVARA
			To the new world, my friend!  To the
			new world!


	INT.  DINING ROOM - GOVERNOR'S MANSION - NIGHT

	In an already Spanish-colonel dining room, COLUMBUS is
	having dinner with his brothers, BARTOLOME and GIACOMO,
	served by an INDIAN WOMAN -- NIMA.  GIACOMO eats with
	gusto.

					GIACOMO
				(as Nima pours the
				wine)
			Nima's a good cook!

					BARTOLOME
			She's more than that!

	Seeing GIACOMO'S sudden blush and discomfort, as NIMA
	smiles at him, the other BROTHERS laugh.

	To cover his embarrassment, GIACOMO returns to the topic
	of the food.

					GIACOMO
			What is it?

					COLUMBUS
			Eat!  I'll tell you later.

	As he sees BARTOLOME stifling a laugh, GIACOMO pauses.

					GIACOMO
			I'd like to know what I'm eating.

	COLUMBUS eats a mouthful, glances at BARTOLOME.

					COLUMBUS
			Iguana.

	A look of horror crosses GIACOMO'S face; he wretches
	slightly, puts down his fork, and gulps down some wine.
	The BROTHERS laugh again.

					COLUMBUS
			What wrong with it?  The Indians eat
			it!

					GIACOMO
			I'm not an Indian.

					BARTOLOME
			He wishes he were back in the
			seminary.  Priests always eat well.
				(tasting his wine,
				grimacing)
			And they have very good cellars.

					GIACOMO
			Nothing grows here!  Everything rots
			in the ground.  The wheat and vines
			wither before we can harvest them.

					COLUMBUS
			We've got to learn to live like the
			Indians.
				(pause)
			Eat your Iguana!

	Reluctantly this time, GIACOMO goes back to his dinner.


	EXT.  BALCONY - GOVERNOR'S MANSION - NIGHT

	They are drinking and smoking cigars.  From the balcony
	they can see the dark mass of the jungle stretching away.
	GIACOMO is already dozing in his chair.  BARTOLOME sees
	it, and elbows COLUMBUS.  They both smile at their younger
	brother's exhaustion.  Then COLUMBUS gets up and leans on
	the balustrade, looking down at the city, the jungle
	beyond.

					COLUMBUS
			How much gold have we found?

					BARTOLOME
			Not enough to justify a single
			shipment.

					COLUMBUS
			Perhaps it doesn't exist anywhere
			but in my imagination.

					BARTOLOME
			Then let's hope not...
				(pause)
			What will happen if we can't find
			enough gold?

	They begin to hear the sound of a flute -- a melancholy
	sound.  COLUMBUS looks out over the jungle, and kills a
	mosquito by slapping his arm.

					COLUMBUS
				(jokingly)
			Then I'm Governor of the Mosquitoes.

									CUT TO:

	INT.  INFIRMARY - CITY OF ISABEL - NIGHT

	An INDIAN is playing the flute.

	In the gloomy interior of the long hut, in the most
	primitive conditions, DOZENS OF SPANIARDS lie sick.  On a
	segregated part of the room are the INDIANS, several
	coughing.

	They are attended by a doctor, DOCTOR CHANCA, BROTHER
	BUYL, and other NOVICES.

	A NOVICE attends to an INDIAN, gently lifting his head,
	helping him to drink -- there is so little they can do.

	BROTHER BUYL looks down at the body of a SPANIARD, covered
	in open sores.  The NOVICE joins him.

					BROTHER BUYL
			What kind of disease is this?

					DOCTOR CHANCA
			I don't know.  It seems almost as if
			we have exchanged diseases with the
			Indians.  They die of our most
			common cold, and we of their plague.

					BROTHER BUYL
			God forgive us!

									CUT TO:

	EXT.  ROYAL HOSPITAL - COURTYARD - SPAIN - DAY

	A MAN covered with sores is screaming, thrashing in his
	agony.  He is held down, his voice muffled.  ISABEL turns
	away, shocked.

	She is in a ward full of patients, attended by a DOCTOR,
	SANCHEZ and other members of her court.

	The patients are emaciated, their faces and bodies covered
	with virulent sores.  NUNS move between the beds.

					DOCTOR
			It seems to be caused by intimacy
			with the native women, Your Majesty.

					ISABEL
			Will he survive?

					DOCTOR
			No, Your Majesty.  They go mad --
			then they die.  There is nothing we
			can do.

	ISABEL looks around at SANCHEZ, appalled.

					SANCHEZ
			Every ship returns with a cargo of
			sick and dying.  But with no gold!
			The new world proves expensive, Your
			Majesty.

					ISABEL
			We weren't expecting immediate
			profits, were we?  We must have
			faith.  We must give time for time.

	SANCHEZ bows in acknowledgement.  But ISABEL, despite her
	words, looks distressed.


	EXT.  MINE - NEW WORLD - DAY

	Excavations carved into a hillside.

	It is a blisteringly hot day.  At the foot of the hill,
	GIACOMO sits at a table beneath an awning, with MOXICA and
	several CLERKS.  ONE HUNDRED FIFTY INDIANS standing in
	line at the table.

	In turn, they hand over a small quantity of gold.  The
	CLERK weighs it on a scale, and notes down each
	contribution.

	MOXICA impatiently gestures the INDIANS to move faster
	with a thonged crop.  An INDIAN approaches the table.  He
	is nervous.  He doesn't produce anything.  The INDIAN
	shakes his head, gesticulates, starts to speak rapidly.

					TRANSLATOR
			He says he has not found any!

					MOXICA
			He's lying!

	Again the INDIAN pleads and gesticulates.  MOXICA hits him
	across the face with the thonged crop.  The INDIAN tries
	to run away -- but is held by a SPANISH SOLDIER.

					MOXICA
			Bring him here!

	The frightened INDIAN is brought back to the table.  One
	of the CLERKS slips away.

					MOXICA
			Tell him to put his hands on the
			table.  Like this!

									CUT TO:

	EXT.  OTHER SIDE OF THE SITE - DAY

	At the other end of the site, the CLERK sprinting to
	GIACOMO, who was talking to a FOREMASTER.

					CLERK
			Don Giacomo, you'd better come at
			once!


	EXT.  MINE - DAY

	MOXICA turns, looks back at the long line of INDIANS,
	still passively waiting.

					MOXICA
			Tell them I want them to watch this!

	The terrified TRANSLATOR speaks to the INDIANS.

					CLERK
			Don't Moxica!  You can't...

									CUT TO:

	GIACOMO and the CLERK running to the scene.

									CUT TO:

					MOXICA
				(to the clerk)
			I can't?  I can't?

	With a single swift action, MOXICA draws his sword and
	cuts off the INDIAN'S hands.

	ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE.  The INDIANS flee, disappearing
	into the jungle.  GIACOMO arrives at this moment.  He
	stares at the dismembered hands in horror.


	INT.  GOVERNOR'S MANSION - EVENING

	A tribunal.  Sitting behind a table with his brothers, and
	flanked by his council, COLUMBUS presides.  MOXICA stands
	before them.

					COLUMBUS
			In one act of brutality, you have
			created chaos.  Tribes who were
			fighting each other are now joining
			forces against us!  All that because
			of your criminal savagery!

					MOXICA
				(casually)
			Savagery is what monkeys understand.

					COLUMBUS
			You'll be held in detention,
			deprived of your privileges and
			possessions.  Until you are returned
			to Spain where you will be judged.
			Have you anything to say?

					MOXICA
				(with exquisite
				insolence)
			You will regret this.

	He strolls to the GUARDS at the back of the room.


	EXT.  BARRACKS - NIGHT

	Everything is quiet on the mine site.

	On the terrace, TWO SOLDIERS are drinking in turn, and
	cracking jokes.  One of them leans against the wooden
	wall.  He laughs as he hears repeated banging behind him.

									CUT TO:

	INT.  BARRACKS - NIGHT

	A THIRD SOLDIER is fucking an INDIAN WOMAN against the
	wall.

									CUT TO:

	EXT.  BARRACKS - NIGHT

	On the terrace, his two COMPANIONS laugh and encourage
	his efforts.

	A whooshing sound.  An arrow embeds itself in the chest of
	the SOLDIER who was leaning against the wall.  He is
	nailed to the wood behind him.

	THE OTHER SOLDIER stares at him, transfixed, until an
	arrow pierces his throat.  He collapses, unable to cry
	out for help.


	INT.  BARRACKS - NIGHT

	FOUR INDIANS in full warrior outfit, their faces painted,
	burst into the room.  Still busy with the WOMAN, his eyes
	facing the wall, the SOLDIER believes the intruders to be
	his friends.

					SOLDIER
				(without stopping)
			You animals!  Can't you wait!

	Discovering the FOUR TERRIFYING FIGURES staring at her,
	the INDIAN WOMAN starts screaming and pushes back the
	SOLDIER.  He turns around, jumps off the WOMAN, and starts
	to scramble to the front door, trying to put on his
	trousers.

	THE FOUR INDIANS catch him, and force him to lay on the
	ground.  THE MAN struggles, his eyes rolling in terror.
	TWO INDIANS force his mouth open.  A THIRD ONE kneels and
	starts stuffing it with gold dust.  THE SOLDIER chokes and
	suffocates.

	THE WOMAN still stands half naked against the wall,
	terrified.  AN INDIAN takes his knife from his leggings,
	slowly.  She starts sobbing and imploring in her language.
	THE INDIAN slowly walks to her, and plants the knife in
	the lower part of her belly.


	EXT.  MINE - DAY

	PAIRS of bloody red legs hanging still, high in the air.

	Pulling back, we discover:

	A DOZEN SPANIARDS have been crucified on the scaffolding
	of the excavations.  Some hands and noses have been
	removed.

	UTAPAN is standing, uncomfortable among the SPANIARDS.

	A SOLDIER removes a huge iron nail from a wrist.  One of
	the CRUCIFIED BODIES is gently laid on the ground.  He is
	still alive -- not for long.

	COLUMBUS and BARTOLOME are silent with rage.

					BARTOLOME
				(aggressively)
			Moxica is right.  Our ways don't
			work!

	BARTOLOME turns to UTAPAN.

					BARTOLOME
				(aggressively)
			Can you find them?

	UTAPAN looks distraught -- this is the first time he is
	being asked to do something against his own people.  He
	looks up at COLUMBUS for help in confusion.

					COLUMBUS
			You have to find them, Utapan.  Look
			what they did!

					UTAPAN
			You did the same to your God!

	COLUMBUS is caught short.

					COLUMBUS
			We have to stop this war.

	UTAPAN nods.  He walks and takes an arrow.  He examines
	it.

					COLUMBUS
			Do you know them?

	UTAPAN nods, uncomfortable.

									CUT TO:

	EXT.  HILL AND VALLEY - DAY

	Around a campfire, two dozen INDIANS are squatting.  They
	are arguing over a musket and some woolen hats they stole
	from the mine.  CLICK!  CLICK!  The INDIANS raise their
	heads.  All around them, crossbows and muskets are pointed
	at them.  Two INDIANS try to run away.  They are shot.

	This sound triggers the SPANIARDS' response.  They start
	shooting at random.  UTAPAN is horrified.  COLUMBUS stands
	up shouting.

					COLUMBUS
			Stop!  Stop this!

									CUT TO:

	EXT.  GOVERNOR'S MANSION - NIGHT

	MOXICA and a group of rebels (GUEVARA among them),
	silently approach the entrance of the mansion.

	A GUARD is stabbed and falls on his knees with a cry.


	INT.  COLUMBUS' STUDY - GOVERNOR'S MANSION - NIGHT

	MOXICA tears COLUMBUS' plans of the city from the wall.
	On the table, the model of the future city.

	Watched by the other ARISTOCRATS, MOXICA sets fire to the
	parchment he has rolled up.  He blows the flames from the
	torch onto the model.  Fire races up and down the streets
	of the miniature, as if burning the city of Isabel.

	A mad gleam in MOXICA'S eyes...


	EXT.  SQUARE OF ISABEL - NIGHT

	The half-burnt remains of the Mansion.  COLUMBUS stands in
	the square, looking up at it.  Behind him, his SOLDIERS,
	his BROTHERS and about thirty captured INDIANS.

	GIACOMO walks slowly across the square.  COLUMBUS looks at
	him in disbelief.

					GIACOMO
				(through cracked
				lips)
			Moxica...


	EXT.  RIVER BANK - JUNGLE - DAWN

	COLUMBUS leads his party of SOLDIERS through the jungle,
	looking for the MUTINEERS.

	They reach the river -- scan the far bank.  Nothing.
	COLUMBUS nods.  His MEN start to enter the river, led by a
	HALBERDIER.

	Others follow, wading across, their weapons held above
	their heads.

	A crossbow arrow pierces the HALBERDIER.  Without a cry he
	falls forward into the water, and is carried away by the
	current.

	Two more MEN are hit.  One cries out, thrashes around in
	the water, an arrow protruding from his side.  The river
	stained with blood.

	Still no sign of the enemy.  COLUMBUS' MEN nevertheless
	start to return fire from the bank, creating a shield...
	others continue to wade across the river.  A MUTINEER is
	shot down from the branches of a tree...

	The first MEN come ashore.  Musket fire.  An exchange of
	arrows.  COLUMBUS is now wading across.  The MAN next to
	him is killed, and carried away by the current.

	Now, on the far shore, the enemy have shown themselves.
	There is hand to hand fighting, with swords and other
	weapons.  MOXICA kills one of COLUMBUS' men -- but his own
	are outnumbered and outmatched.  Already, some are
	beginning to surrender.

	In the midst of the fighting, COLUMBUS, sword drawn, pulls
	himself out of the river:  A MUTINEER lunges at him.
	COLUMBUS kills him with a thrust of his sword -- and walks
	forward into the jungle.  He spots MOXICA at the foot of a
	cliff.


	EXT.  JUNGLE CLIMB TO CLIFF TOP - DAY

	MOXICA starts scrambling up the rocks behind him, with
	COLUMBUS following.  The climb through the dense
	undergrowth is so exhausting, they are now almost climbing
	in slow motion.


	EXT.  TOP OF CLIFF - DAY

	MOXICA bursts out of the undergrowth.  He is at the edge
	of emptiness, swept by a violent offshore wind.  He turns
	frantically, to see COLUMBUS coming up behind him.

	Knowing he is lost, MOXICA regains his natural arrogance.
	He steps backwards towards the edge.

					MOXICA
			You know what they will say in Spain
			about my death -- don't you?

	He takes another step backwards, as COLUMBUS moves towards
	him.

					MOXICA
			You are nothing!  You bastards will
			never inherit your titles.  We are
			everything.  We are immortal!

	He smiles, and steps back into space.


	EXT.  ROCKS BELOW CLIFF TOP - DAY

	His body falls, bounces off the rocks below, crashes into
	the water.


	EXT.  TOP OF CLIFF - DAY

	COLUMBUS stares down as his body is swept away.

									CUT TO:

	EXT.  SQUARE OF ISABEL - DAY

	CLOSE ON COLUMBUS' expressionless face.

									CUT TO:

	A MUTINEER -- his face is white, he is crying and
	trembling.  His arms are tied behind his back.  He is held
	fast, a rope is put around his neck.

	COLUMBUS, sitting not far away beside his BROTHERS, gives
	a signal.

	Drums begin to beat.  BROTHER BUYL looks on impassive.

	A grimace suddenly transform THE YOUNG MAN'S face.  He is
	being garroted -- his throat crushed with a rope.  The
	YOUNG MAN'S feet dance frenziedly.  We hear the choking.

	The drums cease.  BROTHER BUYL crosses himself and murmurs
	a prayer, deeply distraught.  GIACOMO has covered his
	eyes.

	A wider view shows the bodies of three other ARISTOCRATS
	from the rebellion, attached to chairs affixed to a pole,
	their heads straight, the rope still tight around their
	necks.

	Justice has been done.  The members of the COUNCIL rise in
	silence, COLUMBUS stands up.

									CUT TO:

	EXT.  ISABEL - QUAYSIDE - DAY

	CLOSE ON several large wooden cages.  Inside we see the
	INDIANS that COLUMBUS captured.  They are packed together.
	They stare out with vacant eyes.  SOLDIERS guard them.  A
	ship against the pier.  BUYL at his side, COLUMBUS stares
	at the INDIANS.

					BROTHER BUYL
			I wish to go back with them, Don
			Colon.  I have no desire to remain
			in this godless place.

					COLUMBUS
			You may do as you please, Brother
			Buyl -- though your departure will
			not help me to make it more Godly.

	BROTHER BUYL looks at him, almost with astonishment.

					BROTHER BUYL
			You treat Christians equally with
			heathen savages.  You execute
			members of the nobility.  And what
			do you offer in return?

					COLUMBUS
				(quietly)
			A new world, Brother Buyl.

					BROTHER BUYL
			Nobody wants one...!  Only you!

	And he walks away.


	EXT.  ISLAND - EVENING

	Against the livid horizon, three black waterspouts join
	the sky to the sea.  A gust of wind disturbs the roof of
	the jungle.


	INT.  GOVERNOR'S MANSION - EVENING

	The wind grows stronger.  Doors bang inside the
	building... a melancholy sound.

	COLUMBUS sits on the balcony with his BROTHERS.  They are
	silent.  After a few moments, COLUMBUS begins to speak
	quietly, almost as if he were speaking to himself.

					COLUMBUS
			Perhaps hope only exists in the
			journey.  When it begins, everything
			is still possible -- every
			expectation; every dream...

	The BROTHERS do not answer.

					COLUMBUS
			This is not how I imagined it to be.

									CUT TO:

	EXT.  JUNGLE - NEAR ISABEL - NIGHT

	UTAPAN begins to shave his head...


	EXT.  BALCONY - GOVERNOR'S MANSION - DAWN

	The sky is dark and threatening, the wind even stronger.
	We find COLUMBUS where we left him, but now alone.  He has
	sat here all night.

	Shutters bang violently.

	He looks up -- and sees a few yards from him:  the naked
	FIGURE OF AN INDIAN, his face and body painted, staring at
	him.  COLUMBUS realizes who it is...

					COLUMBUS
			Utapan!

	UTAPAN is still and silent.  A strange and mysterious
	figure now.

					COLUMBUS
			Utapan, won't you speak to me?  You
			used to know how to speak to me.

					UTAPAN
				(sadly, in his own
				language)
			You never learned how to speak my
			language.

	UTAPAN is gone.


	EXT.  SQUARE - DAWN

	The wind is whipping the trees now, stronger and stronger.
	Groups of INDIANS look up at the sky.  Then, above the
	sound of the wind, they hear another noise.  Like a
	collective murmur, almost in one voice, the INDIANS
	repeat, over and over.

					INDIANS
			Urracan... Urracan... Urracan...
			Urracan...
				(the wrath of God)

	With a loud thunderclap, the storm suddenly breaks.  In a
	few seconds it has risen to violent proportions, and the
	landscape is drenched in torrential rain.  The wind
	doubles its strength... and all hell breaks loose...


	EXT.  CITY OF ISABEL - DAY

	The hurricane is full force.  Trees are being ripped up by
	their roots.  Rivers of mud are washed down from the
	hills, carrying everything away in their paths:  houses,
	carts, equipment, horses...


	EXT.  MINE - ISABEL - DAY

	The mine workings flooded with mud...


	EXT.  APPROACH TO DAM AND WATERFALL - DAY

	COLUMBUS, BARTOLOME and MENDEZ struggle through the teeth
	of the hurricane towards the dam.


	EXT.  DAM - DAY

	Timbers creak and strain.  COLUMBUS, BARTOLOME, MENDEZ and
	a DOZEN other MEN are trying to save the dam.

	Suddenly, frighteningly, the dam begins to crash.

					COLUMBUS
				(screaming)
			Let it go!  Let it go!

	The MEN scramble away as the dam wall buckles, and burst
	open.  Water floods over them; a roaring torrent.  From
	the bank, MENDEZ, BARTOLOME and COLUMBUS survey the ruins
	of their dreams.

									CUT TO:

	INT.  GOVERNOR'S PALACE - BEDROOM - DAY

	COLUMBUS is stretched out on his bed, in his devastated
	bedroom.  A column of ants is threading its way across the
	floor, each ant carrying a piece of leaf.  Rain falls over
	a table covered with documents.

	COLUMBUS' face is covered in dried mud.

					SANCHEZ (V.O.)
			He promised us gold but has failed
			to find it.  He subjects the natives
			to violence, provocation and
			injustice.  He sent them to Spain
			against the express wishes of Your
			Majesty...


	INT.  AUDIENCE ROOM - ALHAMBRA PALACE - DAY

	We are back to the first scene.  In the vast, opulent,
	glittering room, ISABEL listens impassively to the voice
	of SANCHEZ.  Also present, other GRANDEES, representatives
	of the church and state.

					SANCHEZ
			... But there is worse.  He ordered
			the execution of five members of the
			nobility...

					ISABEL
			Is this true, Brother Buyl?

					BROTHER BUYL
			Yes, Your Majesty.  It is all true.
			I saw it with my own eyes.

	A pause.  ISABEL seems to struggle inwardly with her
	emotions.  SANCHEZ waits, expressionless, but on the point
	of victory.

					ISABEL
			Then, what do you suggest, Don
			Sanchez?

					SANCHEZ
			He must be replaced.

					ISABEL
			And who would you think of, for such
			a task?

									CUT TO:

	EXT.  QUAYSIDE - ISABEL - DAY

	We see a buckled shoe -- as it rises, it slips into a
	stirrup.  The horse is mounted.  The shoe digs into its
	flank.  The sound of hoofbeats...

					SANCHEZ (V.O.)
			I am thinking of a man.  A devotee
			to Your Majesties.  A man extremely
			motivated...

									DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT.  STREETS OF ISABEL - DAY

	FIVE MEN on HORSEBACK, dressed in fashionable clothes,
	canter down what used to be the main street of Isabel.
	Through some has been rebuilt, the effects of the
	hurricane are still visible...

	People look at them curiously.  We see them stop near the
	Governor's mansion.  The MEN dismount and walk into the
	Palace.


	INT.  GOVERNOR'S MANSION - DAY

	One of the MEN in black clothes removes his hat and steps
	forward.  We recognize him as ALONSO DE BOBADILLA, the man
	COLUMBUS humiliated at the rotunda.

	COLUMBUS is sitting at his desk, studying plans with
	GIACOMO.  Some other MEMBERS of the COUNCIL are with them.

					BOBADILLA
			Don Alonso de Bobadilla.

					COLUMBUS
			Yes... I remember...

	BOBADILLA turns, gestures to one of the other MEN, who
	comes forward and gives him a roll of parchment, bearing
	the royal seal.

					BOBADILLA
			My letters of appointment.

					COLUMBUS
			Appointment to what?

					BOBADILLA
			Viceroy of the West Indies.

					COLUMBUS
			Congratulations.  Then I am free to
			search for the mainland.

	BOBADILLA smiles wickedly, happy to give COLUMBUS a low
	blow.

					BOBADILLA
			Didn't you learn?  The mainland was
			discovered.  Weeks ago.  By another
			Italian.  I forgot his name.

					A MAN IN BLACK
			Amerigo Vespucci, Excellency.

	COLUMBUS pales.  Then...

					COLUMBUS
			How far from here?

					BOBADILLA
			I am not a seaman.  But I heard it
			is no more than a week at sea.  I
			hope you are not too disappointed.

					COLUMBUS
			How could I be?  The mainland has
			been found.  Exactly as I said it
			would.

					BOBADILLA
			I am afraid this is not the worst
			news.

									CUT TO:

	INT.  CELL - SEVILLE PRISON - DAY

	All is dark.  We can just make out COLUMBUS' face as he
	lies on the hard bed.  He is sweating heavily; his beard
	is filthy and matted, like his hair.  He looks feverish.

	A key turns in the lock.

	The JAILER lets in two fashionably dressed YOUNG MEN.
	COLUMBUS, blinking in the light, turns his head to stare
	at them.  His eyes are reddened with infection at the
	corners.  The YOUNG MEN come forward into the light.

					FERNANDO
				(quietly)
			Father?

	Unable to believe it, COLUMBUS slowly sits up.

					COLUMBUS
			Fernando...!  My God...!

	He laughs, overcome with joy.  Embraces DIEGO.

					COLUMBUS
			A man!  Diego, how did this happen?

					DIEGO
			Santangel is going to see the Queen.
			We are going to get you out of here.

					COLUMBUS
			Good!  I have to go back!

	DIEGO and FERNANDO look at one another, then back at
	COLUMBUS, incredulously, seeing his filthy clothes, his
	eyes rimmed with dried mucus.

					DIEGO
			Go back?

	There's a new excitement in COLUMBUS' voice.  He walks
	over to the table.  The candlelight illuminates maps,
	charts, drawings, figures...

					COLUMBUS
			I have to explore the mainland.

					FERNANDO
			This time with me!

	COLUMBUS laughs and DIEGO looks at them both in
	astonishment.

					DIEGO
			In your present state it is madness,
			Father!

	FERNANDO glances at DIEGO.

					FERNANDO
			Nobody is forcing you to come with
			us.

	DIEGO is hurt.

					DIEGO
			I can't go anyway.

	A pause.

					FERNANDO
			She's very beautiful!  The Queen has
			very good taste.  Diego is getting
			married.

	DIEGO seems saddened by his brother's attitude.  Once
	again DIEGO feels like the outsider.

	COLUMBUS hugs him.

					COLUMBUS
			I am happy for you, Diego.


	INT.  ALHAMBRA - AUDIENCE ROOM - DAY

	Like Lucifer and Gabriel, SANTANGEL and SANCHEZ sit on
	either side of ISABEL.

					SANTANGEL
			Granted his faults.  Yes, a hundred
			times!  But the man is still
			remarkable.

	ISABEL looks at him, then at SANCHEZ, MOVED BUT CLEARLY
	UNDECIDED.  SANTANGEL presses his point.

					SANTANGEL
			All he asks is a chance to explore
			this... mainland.

					SANCHEZ
			It does not belong to him.

					SANTANGEL
				(quietly)
			In a way, it does, Don Sanchez.
				(to the Queen)
			I beg Your Majesty to receive him.
			To hear him... He will make no more
			demands.  He has changed.  He is
			penitent.

					SANCHEZ
			Penitent...?  He is suing us for
			breach of contract!

					ISABEL
			Is he?

	She starts to laugh.

					ISABEL
			Really?

	SANTANGEL tries to stop himself laughing.


	INT.  AUDIENCE ROOM - ALHAMBRA PALACE - DAY

	COLUMBUS is shown into the room.  ISABEL is waiting for
	him.

	He drops to his knees before her.  This time she walks
	towards him, clearly moved by his white-hair, and other
	signs of physical deterioration.

	Her hand hovers over his head, as if it means to console
	him.  Her hand is dying to comfort.  But instead, she
	offers her hand for him to kiss.

					ISABEL
			Rise... Please...

	COLUMBUS gets slowly to his feet -- but his eyes, as they
	meet hers, are as clear as before.  ISABEL smiles with
	relief to see it.  He looks back at her.

					COLUMBUS
			Now I do look older than you.

	She smiles -- then again, tries to restrain it, and keeps
	her dignity.

					ISABEL
			We have decided to allow you to
			undertake another voyage to the new
			world...

	COLUMBUS starts to interrupt; she stops him with a
	gesture.

					ISABEL
			But without your brothers.  Nor are
			you to return to Santo Domingo or
			any of the other colonies.  You may
			explore the continent.

					COLUMBUS
			Thank you.

					ISABEL
			There is one thing I'd like to
			understand... Why do you want to go
			back, after all this?

					COLUMBUS
			Your Majesty -- some men are content
			to read about things.  I must see
			them with my own eyes.  I cannot be
			other than I am.

	She almost bursts out laughing -- only pauses, turns
	slightly, then goes out.


	INT.  ALHAMBRA PALACE - ROOM NEXT TO THRONE ROOM - DAY

	SANCHEZ is standing alone in the next room; he has
	obviously been listening.  He looks at her.

					ISABEL
			I know, I should not tolerate his
			impertinence.

					SANCHEZ
			Then why?

					ISABEL
			Because he is not afraid of me.


	INT.  ALHAMBRA PALACE - CORRIDOR - DAY

	SANCHEZ, in another direction, along a corridor, towards
	his office.  As he reaches a corner with a wide window, a
	hand seizes him.  COLUMBUS.

					SANCHEZ
			All I have to do is call the guards.

					COLUMBUS
			Call them.

	SANCHEZ looks at him -- and doesn't call.  COLUMBUS lets
	go of him.

					SANCHEZ
			I am not afraid of you.  You are
			nothing but a dreamer.

					COLUMBUS
			Look out of that window.

	Surprised, SANCHEZ nevertheless turns, looks out.

					COLUMBUS
			What do you see?

					SANCHEZ
			Roofs... towers, palaces...
			spires...

					COLUMBUS
			All of them created by people like
			me.

	SANCHEZ turns round again to face him.

					COLUMBUS
			No matter how long you live,
			Sanchez, there's something that will
			never change between us.  I did it!
			You didn't!

	COLUMBUS turns abruptly and walks away, vanishing down the
	echoing corridor.


	EXT.  COLUMBUS' MANOR HOUSE - DAY

	COLUMBUS dismounts in the courtyard.  Everything seems
	deserted.  There's no one about, no sign of life...


	INT.  MANOR HOUSE - DAY

	COLUMBUS walks slowly through the great rooms.  There is
	nothing left:  no furniture, rugs, pictures... nothing.

	He turns, sees BEATRIX standing in a doorway, looking back
	at him.  They are both moved.

					COLUMBUS
			God... you're so beautiful!  I can't
			believe no other man has ever taken
			you away from me...

					BEATRIX
			They tried... but I didn't let them.

	She smiles.  They don't dare to touch.  BEATRIX looks
	round the empty room.

					BEATRIX
			They took everything...

					COLUMBUS
				(looking at her)
			Not everything... Do you think I
			care?  I'm a free man again.  Riches
			don't make a man rich, they only
			make him busier...

	They laugh.  There's a pause.

					COLUMBUS
			God, how much I've missed you!

	And they throw themselves into each other's arms.

									CUT TO:

	INT.  DINING ROOM - MANOR HOUSE - EVENING

	All that has been left is a simple table and one chair.
	They are having supper by candlelight in the vast, empty
	room, though the candles throw a warm, sensuous glow on
	the figs and hams and wine... and on their faces, as
	BEATRIX sits on his lap.

					SANTANGEL (O.S.)
			One chair.  One table.  What more
			can a man expect, when he tries to
			sue the Crown?

	They laugh.  With only a little embarrassment, BEATRIX
	gets off COLUMBUS' knee.  SANTANGEL comes forward, and
	COLUMBUS embraces him like an old friend.  BEATRIX goes to
	the kitchen.

					COLUMBUS
			I owe you everything, Santangel...
			but as you see, I can't repay you.

					SANTANGEL
			On the contrary.  It is I who owe
			you everything.  Through you, I have
			been an adventurer, an explorer!
			It's true I shall never see the new
			world... but it's here...
				(he points to his
				head)
			And here...
				(pointing to his
				heart)

	COLUMBUS smiles.  BEATRIX returns with a plate and glass
	for SANTANGEL.

					SANTANGEL
			What you are, Colon, is a sailor, a
			discoverer, a man of imagination...
			not a politician.  You weren't meant
			to govern -- You cannot be all
			things to all men.

	He takes the wine BEATRIX offers, and raises his glass.

					SANTANGEL
			I wish you could have compromised.
			It would have made your life
			easier...

					COLUMBUS
			But as least we haven't been bored,
			have we?

	They all laugh, and drink.


	EXT.  SHIP'S DECK - FERNANDO'S POV - NIGHT

	Night on the open sea -- the moon shines on the waves and
	we hear the creaking of ropes and timbers -- the
	loneliness and mystery of the night passage.

					SAILOR'S VOICE
			West... southwest, Captain Mendez...

					MENDEZ (O.S.)
			Steady as she goes...

	COLUMBUS walks over to FERNANDO, who is leaning against
	the rail.  He is smoking a cigar... as the smoke blows
	over FERNANDO'S face, FERNANDO wretches... It's clear he's
	feeling seasick, trying to control it.

	COLUMBUS leans against the rail next to him, staring out
	at the darkness.  Then looks at his SON again.  FERNANDO
	won't give in to the sickness, but COLUMBUS knows he'd
	feel better if he did.

					COLUMBUS
			How are you feeling, Fernando?

					FERNANDO
				(in a strangled
				voice)
			Not bad.

	COLUMBUS nods meditatively, puffs out some smoke.
	FERNANDO winces, gags slightly.

					COLUMBUS
				(almost casually)
			You know what I always used to do?

	FERNANDO shakes his head.

					COLUMBUS
			Swallow a piece of pork fat on a
			string.  It always worked.

	At the thought of the pork fat, FERNANDO jerks his head
	over the side, and vomits copiously.  COLUMBUS smiles,
	pats him on the back.


	EXT.  SHIP'S DECK - DAY

	As it plows through heavy seas.  COLUMBUS, a coat wrapped
	around him, is sitting on a chair topside, directing
	operations despite an obvious fever.

	Suddenly a cry from the mast head:

					SAILOR (O.S.)
			Tierra...!  Tierra!

	SAILORS and FERNANDO rush to the side of the ship, peering
	through the spray.  FERNANDO wipes his eyes, and then he
	sees it:  there in the distance, a speck of land.

	FERNANDO and his FATHER stand together, watching the low
	cloud formation sitting on the horizon.

					COLUMBUS
			The mainland...

	FERNANDO looks excited.  Discreetly, COLUMBUS watches his
	SON, enjoying his happiness.


	EXT.  PANAMA (SURREAL IMAGES) - DAY

	A most wonderful and surreal image.  A heavy mist lies
	over the forest.  We move above it slowly.

	A FIGURE emerges from the mist.  At first only a
	silhouette -- then, slowly, a golden figure... an INDIAN,
	covered in gold... gold artifacts, golden paste on his
	body.

	The GOLDEN FIGURE turns, and points, into an unknown
	distance.


	EXT.  TREEHOUSE - DAY

	From the INDIAN treehouse, COLUMBUS, FERNANDO, MENDEZ and
	several INDIANS are gazing west over a necklace of
	magnificent lakes.

	The INDIANS point and talk gently.  FERNANDO has never
	seen anything so fresh, so beautiful.


	EXT.  CAMP - SUNSET

	A magnificent sunset.  A fire is burning, food cooking.
	COLUMBUS looks over his maps, trying to figure out where
	they are.  We see the outline of the continent of Asia.
	An OLD INDIAN squats beside him, silent, also looking at
	the map.  Then, slowly and very deliberately, he takes a
	piece of charcoal from the fire and begins to draw on the
	map.  Ignoring the Asian continent, he sketches the
	Panamanian coastline -- an isthmus.  MENDEZ and FERNANDO
	gather round.  COLUMBUS watches the OLD INDIAN with
	initial puzzlement, then growing excitement.

					MENDEZ
			What's he doing?

					COLUMBUS
			He's drawing an isthmus... He's
			saying we're on an isthmus.

					MENDEZ
			We can't be.

	FERNANDO is still confused.  The OLD INDIAN continues to
	sketch, talking quietly all the time.  An INDIAN
	TRANSLATOR listens.

					COLUMBUS
			Tell me what he's saying.

					TRANSLATOR
			He says -- water on the other side.

					COLUMBUS
			Ask him if he means a lake.  A big
			lake.

	The TRANSLATOR asks.  The OLD INDIAN shakes his head,
	laughs, points to the west, way beyond the other lakes,
	emphatically.

					TRANSLATOR
			No.  Says those are lakes.  Water on
			other side big -- as wide as here.
			Above and below, much land.

					COLUMBUS
				(stunned)
			An ocean...?  He's says it's an
			ocean?

					FERNANDO
			I don't understand.

	COLUMBUS is too stunned for a moment to explain.  The
	INDIANS laugh.

	Then COLUMBUS takes the charcoal, and begins to draw on
	the map, for his son.

					COLUMBUS
			Here is Europe... and over here, the
			continent of Asia.  But there's
			something in between!  Another
			continent!  We've found... another
			continent!

	FERNANDO stares west, then back at his FATHER.  COLUMBUS
	looks very feverish, his face bathed with sweat.

					FERNANDO
			Father...

					COLUMBUS
			There must be a passage to that
			other ocean.

									CUT TO:

	INT.  SHIP - COLUMBUS' CABIN - NIGHT

	COLUMBUS, feverish, lies on the bunk.  He shivers
	violently.  FERNANDO anxiously watches over him, bathes
	his eyes.

	Suddenly THE TRANSLATOR enters.

					TRANSLATOR
			I help.

	A little reluctantly, FERNANDO lets him go to his FATHER.
	The INDIAN crouches over the bed, takes out a handful of
	leaves from a pouch.  He chews the leaves himself for a
	moment, until they form a sticky pulp, then opens
	COLUMBUS' mouth and puts the pulp inside, encouraging
	COLUMBUS to chew with the motions of his hands.

	COLUMBUS chews, quickly falling asleep.


	EXT.  MOONLIT VISION OF VAST LAND MASS - NIGHT

	We see things from COLUMBUS' hallucination.  We are
	plunging through layers of clouds, the speed accelerating,
	giving us a sickening sensation of falling to land, closer
	and closer...

	COLUMBUS wakes up with a jolt.  Everything is silent.
	COLUMBUS walks outside.


	EXT.  DECK - NIGHT

	COLUMBUS' fever has subsided.  He raises his head and
	stares at the mainland passing in the night.  He smiles.

									CUT TO:

	EXT.  JUNGLE AND BAY - HIGH WIDE SHOT - DAY

	The roof of the jungle, the bay beyond, the caravel at
	anchor.

									CUT TO:

	EXT.  RIVER - DAY

	Two canoes going upstream, deeper and deeper into the
	jungle.


	EXT.  JUNGLE AND VILLAGE - DAY

	Smoke rises lazily above the trees.

									CUT TO:

	The boats reaching the bank.  THE FIRST HUTS of a village.
	THE SOLDIERS spread out into the empty village.

	FERNANDO, COLUMBUS and MENDEZ preceded by TWO ARMED
	SOLDIERS enter one of the huts.  The remains of a meal is
	still warm in bowls on the matted floor.

	A famished SOLDIER dips his hand in one of the bowls and
	devours its contents:  some kind of stew.  Stepping back
	accidentally, FERNANDO bumps into a large earthen jar
	behind him.  It rolls and crashes, revealing the remains
	of meat marinating in liquid.  There is something
	disturbing about the appearance of the content.

					FERNANDO
			Oh my God...

	The remains of human beings.

					COLUMBUS
				(approaching)
			What is...?

	He stares at the remains, stunned.  THE SOLDIER stops
	chewing.  He drops the half-empty bowl he was still
	holding.  He runs at the back door, rams his fingers deep
	in the back of his throat, and vomits.

					SOLDIER
			Oh Virgen Maria... Oh Madre de
			Dios...
			(Oh Virgin Mary... Oh Mother of
			 God...)

	But as he vomits and cries, he notices:

	A HEADLESS HUMAN TRUNK spread open, like a sheep carcass.
	Disturbed flies rise in clouds.

					SOLDIER
			Jesus, Maria, y todos los Santos...
			(Jesus, Mary, and all the Saints...)

									CUT TO:

	COLUMBUS and the SPANIARDS meet in the center of the
	village.  All have made the same horrific discovery.

					COLUMBUS
				(urgently)
			Out!  Get out!

	THE SPANIARDS back out of the village, crossbows pointed
	at the invisible enemy hidden in the jungle.

	They are running through the dense forest for the river
	bank.

	The CANNIBALS materialize among the trees, running
	alongside.  Bounding, skipping, frightening FIGURES, their
	brutal faces painted in black.  They release arrows at the
	running SOLDIERS.  A SOLDIER stops, kneels to the ground,
	fires his crossbow and kills one of the CANNIBALS... but
	he is pierced by a spear.  TWO CANNIBALS drag him and cut
	his throat to finish him.

	ELSEWHERE IN THE JUNGLE -- CRIES AND CONFUSION, SPANIARDS
	and CANNIBALS moving in hand to hand combat.

	A CANNIBAL comes sprinting at FERNANDO, brandishing his
	lance.

	COLUMBUS jumps on the man, and plants a knife in his
	abdomen.  Blinded in sweat, he stabs the CANNIBAL, who
	collapses.  Frenzied, COLUMBUS stabs over and over again.

	He stops and looks at his forearm -- soaked in blood.
	Shocked by his own fury, he raises his hand and stares at
	it.

	A GIANT BLACK BUTTERFLY alights gently on his bloody
	fingers, COLUMBUS staring fascinated at its palpitating
	wings.  FERNANDO, screaming at his FATHER, drags him to
	his feet.  They run...

									CUT TO:

	THE SPANIARDS, COLUMBUS, MENDEZ, FERNANDO... all running
	hard to the boat.  ARROWS whistle around them as they leap
	into the canoes, nearly capsizing them, launching them
	into the current.

	SOME CANNIBALS still follow them along the riverbank.  But
	the canoes are faster, and soon, they are left behind.


	EXT.  SHIP AT SEA - DAY

	Endless seascape, the caravel plowing.


	EXT.  SHIP'S DECK - DAY

	FERNANDO is crouched on the poop deck, wrapped in a
	blanket.  He seems in a state of shock:  he is pale and
	shaking.  As COLUMBUS goes and sits near his son, he hands
	him a flask of alcohol.

					COLUMBUS
				(kindly)
			Take it.  Come on.  Drink.

	As COLUMBUS insists, brandishing the flask, FERNANDO
	notices that his hands are shaking too.  His FATHER'S
	forehead is dripping with sweat.

	FERNANDO drinks a gulp and grimaces.  He drinks again and
	hands the flask back to his FATHER, who does the same.
	FERNANDO notices dried blood on his FATHER'S fingers.
	COLUMBUS immediately hides his hand and stands.

					COLUMBUS
			I... I have to see Mendez.

	Then, with sudden anger.

					COLUMBUS
			Your brother was right.  I should
			have never taken you with me.  I'll
			never forgive myself.  Never!

	He walks a few steps, lurches, and has to lean against the
	rail.  He raises his hand to his eyes, grimacing in pain,
	as if they were burning.  FERNANDO scrambles to his feet
	and rushes to him.  COLUMBUS' eyes are already fixed
	somewhere -- fever is eating him up.

					COLUMBUS
			Will you ever forgive me?

	FERNANDO turns around for help.

					COLUMBUS
			Captain Mendez!


	INT.  SHIP'S CABIN - DAY

	COLUMBUS is lying on his couch.  FERNANDO is bathing his
	eyes, sweeping off the pus that continuously forms in
	them.  COLUMBUS is drenched in sweat.

									CUT TO:

	FERNANDO is writing under his FATHER'S dictation.

					COLUMBUS
			I came to Your Highness with honest
			purpose and sincere zeal.  I did not
			undertake these voyages for honor or
			wealth -- that is certain.  After
			years of service to the Crown, I do
			not have a roof to put over my
			head... Your Majesty allowed me to
			explore the continent, believed to
			be Asia.  I now believe that it is
			an new Land, of unknown proportions
			and wealth... Life has more
			imagination than we carry in our
			dreams...

									DISSOLVE TO:

	INT.  ALCAZAR PALACE - GARDENS - DAY

	The DUENA, sitting beside ISABEL, quietly continues to
	read COLUMBUS' letter aloud.

					DUENA
			"I should be judged as a Seaman who
			by Divine Will discovered a New
			World, and thereby placed it under
			the sovereignty of Your Majesties.
			I humbly beseech Your Majesties that
			if it pleases God to remove me
			hence, you will help the name of
			Columbus to be remembered with
			honor... Weep for me, whoever has
			charity, truth and justice."

	She stops reading.  ISABEL turns her face away.


	INT.  UNIVERSITY OF SALAMANCA - DAY

	An ivory-sculptured hand -- the end of the back scratcher
	belonging to AROJAZ -- indicates a line across a large
	globe:  the route between Europe and America.

					AROJAZ (O.S.)
			The sunset route to the new
			continent is now well-established...

	We see a large amphitheater, filled with PEOPLE attending
	a lecture of "Nova Geographica" -- the new geography.

	AROJAZ stands in front of the assembly.  Facing him,
	enthroned, is KING FERDINAND, surrounded by COURTIERS,
	including SANCHEZ.

	We slowly move across the arena, passing attentive faces.

					AROJAZ
			... West by south west for 750
			leagues to Santo Domingo.  From
			there, west north west, leaving San
			Juan to the north, reaching the
			island of Hispanola on the northern
			cape of San Raphael... Then onto the
			mainland, at the Cape called Gracias
			a Dios...

	We continue to rise up the tiers of seats...

					AROJAZ
			Spain -- by Your Majesty's grace --
			has confirmed for all humanity the
			existence of an unknown continent...
			Tierra Incognita...

	On a highest tier, we stop on the face of CHRISTOPHER
	COLUMBUS, listening impassively.

					AROJAZ
			... This continent was first
			discovered by a sailor commissioned
			by your Majesty...

	CLOSE ON COLUMBUS' eyes.

					AROJAZ
			His name... Amerigo Vespucci...

	On COLUMBUS.


	EXT.  UNIVERSITY OF SALAMANCA - DAY

	Around the KING, on horseback, surrounded by the KNIGHTS,
	a CROWD is kept back by SOLDIERS.  AROJAZ is mounting his
	horse.  SANCHEZ is waiting for him.

	COLUMBUS stands among the students at the back of the
	CROWD.

									CUT TO:

	AROJAZ rides next to SANCHEZ.  AROJAZ suddenly spots
	COLUMBUS in the crowd, as they move off.

					AROJAZ
			My God...!  I thought he was dead.

	They pass close enough to touch COLUMBUS.  But he does not
	see them.

					SANCHEZ
			You can see for yourself.

					AROJAZ
			What a tragedy... what a waste of a
			life...

					SANCHEZ
			A waste...?  Let me tell you
			something, Arojaz.  If your name, or
			mine, is ever remembered -- it will
			only be because of his.

	AROJAZ looks at SANCHEZ in surprise -- then cranes his
	neck round, and looks back at COLUMBUS -- now a FACE IN
	THE CROWD.


	EXT.  LA RABIDA MONASTERY - KITCHEN GARDEN - DAY

	ANTONIO DE MARCHENA, a very old man now, is taking a
	siesta next to his grapes.  He is sitting in a simple
	armchair, a rosary wrapped around his fingers.

	The presence of someone wakes him.  After a moment, he
	recognizes COLUMBUS and smiles.  Both MEN are very moved.

					MARCHENA
			I suppose we're both old men now.

					COLUMBUS
			You'll always be older than me,
			Father.

	They laugh.  COLUMBUS sits down.  Bees drone lazily in the
	sunlight.

					COLUMBUS
			Have you ever forgiven me?

	MARCHENA nods his head.

					MARCHENA
			Yes.  I forgave you a long time ago.
			You see, I was proud of you.  You
			were like a willful child.  You
			wouldn't accept what others told
			you.  You had to find things out for
			yourself, hurting yourself -- and
			others -- in the process.

	MARCHENA looks at his plants, sighs contentedly.

					MARCHENA
			Do you remember when you said that
			people talk about the world, but
			never leave their gardens.

	COLUMBUS nods.

					MARCHENA
			More than ever I wonder what it is
			we do achieve by leaving our
			gardens... The world changes -- and
			yet it seems the same.  We find new
			worlds, but fill them with the same
			people...

	He pauses, looks across at COLUMBUS, smiles again gently.
	MARCHENA, tiring, leans back in his chair, and looks up
	towards the sun.

					COLUMBUS
			I have to disagree.

					MARCHENA
			I knew you would.

					COLUMBUS
			New worlds create new people.

					MARCHENA
			Oh?  So you are a new man?

					COLUMBUS
			I don't know... I have the
			impression that I didn't change that
			much.  I still can't accept the
			world as it is!

	MARCHENA starts laughing.

					MARCHENA
			God bless you, and those like you!

	They both laugh.


	EXT.  BEATRIX'S HOUSE BALCONY - EVENING

	FERNANDO is sitting in front of his FATHER, examining
	documents and letters.  COLUMBUS has wrapped a shawl
	around his legs.  He looks even older now, with his mass
	of pure white hair.

	BEATRIX comes out with a tray, carrying grapes and a
	decanter of water.  She places it on a small table near
	COLUMBUS and touches his shoulder.

	As she is ready to return inside the house, he holds her
	back.

					COLUMBUS
			Can't you stay with us a little?

					BEATRIX
			I am busy inside.

	He smiles.  She looks at him smiling, intrigued.

					BEATRIX
			What is it, now?  Tell me...

					COLUMBUS
			I can't keep my eyes off you.  I
			would like to catch up with all the
			moments I didn't spend with you.

	FERNANDO looks up at them above his letters, amused and
	slightly embarrassed.  COLUMBUS looks at him with a fake
	air of reproach.

					COLUMBUS
			What are you listening to?

					FERNANDO
			I am not listening, Father.  But I
			can't help hearing.

	FERNANDO opens a letter and reads it quickly.

					FERNANDO
			It's Diego... He is at the Court,
			with Santangel... He says they hope
			to get your privileges restored...
			And maybe the house.

	COLUMBUS smiles and nods -- all this seems to be of very
	little importance to him now.

					COLUMBUS
			But how is he?  And Dona Maria?

	FERNANDO continues to read.

					FERNANDO
			Fine, it seems.  Diego is thinking
			of starting a pearl trade, in Santo
			Domingo... He says he received many
			letters for you.  Some of your men,
			mostly.

	He opens one of them, glances at it.

					FERNANDO
			This one is from Mendez!

	COLUMBUS' eyes brighten with joy.

					COLUMBUS
			What does he say?

					FERNANDO
			He asks when he can come to visit
			you.  He left his address.

					COLUMBUS
				(smiling)
			He never had one... except aboard my
			ships!

	FERNANDO laughs -- then, suddenly serious.

					FERNANDO
			I want you to tell me everything you
			remember, Father.  From the
			beginning.  Everything.

					COLUMBUS
			Really?
				(pause)
			God... I wouldn't know where to
			start... and yet...

					FERNANDO
			Tell me the first thing that comes
			to your mind.

	COLUMBUS sighs, and leans back on his chair.  His eyes are
	fixed somewhere, searching.  Then, almost in a murmur.

					COLUMBUS
			I remember...

	We see the page.  FERNANDO writes: ... I REMEMBER...

	A drop of ink falls from the quill onto the page and the
	words.

	FERNANDO is waiting.

									CUT TO:

	COLUMBUS' eyes.

									CUT TO:

	EXT.  BEACH AND JUNGLE - FIRST LANDING - DAY

	A MOVING IMAGE, as seen from the rolling deck of a ship.
	We see:

	A majestic forest, resting on a slash of white sand, and
	deep blue sea...

									MUSIC BEGINS:

	THE LONE SILHOUETTE of an INDIAN emerges from the dense
	foliage.  He runs down the beach towards the surf.  He
	stops and seems to be staring at us.

	These words appear on the screen:

			THE BIOGRAPHY FERNANDO WROTE ABOUT
			HIS FATHER WAS FOUND BY CHANCE IN
			VENICE.  ITS PUBLICATION IN 1571
			CONTRIBUTED TO RESTORING THE NAME OF
			CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS, WHICH HAD BEEN
			FORGOTTEN.

			IN 1511 DIEGO COLUMBUS BECAME
			GOVERNOR OF SANTO DOMINGO.

			COLUMBUS RESTS IN THE CATHEDRAL OF
			SEVILLE, IN ANDALUSIA.

	CREDITS AND MUSIC OVER:

	INT.  AUDIENCE ROOM - GRANADA - DAY

	We start on a man's elegant slipper.  He is seated in a
	splendid chair.  Moving up the stocking leg, we pass the
	garter of Castile, coming to rest on a pair of delicate
	hands.  His fore finger impatiently plays with a large
	topaz ring.  Over this, we hear distant footsteps, echoing
	on marble floors.

									CUT TO:

	A Castilian face:  aquilaine profile, olive complexion,
	dark eyebrows and meticulously sculpted beard.  This is
	TREASURER SANCHEZ.

	A door slams somewhere, the footsteps getting closer.  We
	can now here a subdued conversation.

	TREASURER SANCHEZ stands up as:

	The door opens at the far end of the large gilded room.
	A WOMEN, magnificent in somber taffeta, enters.  QUEEN
	ISABEL OF SPAIN moves towards him.

	He bows slightly as she sits at the end of the large
	table.  She is followed by a PRIEST, BROTHER BUYL, and
	three dignitaries of Church and State.

	All sit beside her.  TREASURER SANCHEZ takes a document
	and starts to read aloud.

	On screen the words:  GRANADA - SPAIN - 1500

					SANCHEZ
			Your Majesty would wish to know the
			true facts concerning the island of
			Hispanola, our first settlement in
			the New World, and the activities
			there of your servant, Christopher
			Columbus, Admiral of the Ocean Sea,
			Governor of that Island.  You will
			remember with what hopes and
			promises he beguiled us -- the truth
			is that he now presides over a state
			of chaos, degradation and madness
			beyond imagining.

	SANCHEZ punctuates each word carefully.

					SANCHEZ
			From the beginning, Columbus proved
			himself incapable of managing the
			affairs of the island.  He appointed
			his brothers to important positions,
			at once injuring the pride and
			dignity of the nobles who had gone
			with him.  He promised to build a
			city, the City of Isabel, named
			after Your Majesty.  What he
			actually built was nothing but a
			collection of huts, and that in the
			wrong place, for all of it was
			easily swept away by rain and mud.
			Is that not so, Brother Buyl?

	The PRIEST nods.

					BROTHER BUYL
			Yes, Your Honor.

					SANCHEZ
			He promised gold.  Not finding the
			easy quantities he promised,
			Columbus commanded each Indian to
			pay an annual tribute.  Most being
			unable to, they were barbarously
			punished, against the express wish
			of Your Christian Majesties...

	ISABEL lowers her eyes.

					SANCHEZ
			Since provocation and injustice
			never ceases, many of the Indians
			have fled to the forests, or have
			begun to slay the Christians.

	ISABEL looks over at BROTHER BUYL.

					ISABEL
			Could it be so?

					BROTHER BUYL
			Yes, Your Majesty.

					SANCHEZ
			But there is worse.  From the
			beginning, he forced the nobles to
			undergo physical labor, treating
			them equally with the Indians, all
			of them reduced to slavery.  When
			the nobleman Adrian de Moxica
			protested against such treatment...
				(he pauses)
			... he was executed.
				(pause)
			Is that not true also, Brother
			Buyl?

					BROTHER BUYL
			Yes, Your Honor.  It is all true.
			All of it.  I saw it with my own
			eyes.

					SANCHEZ
			He has lost control.  His great
			arrogance has led him into
			depravity.  He encourages our
			soldiers to marry the native women.
			He promised a paradise, but he has
			made a hell full of all its horrors.

	Silence.

					ISABEL
			Is that the man I knew, Treasurer
			Sanchez?

					SANCHEZ
			Yes, Your Majesty.

									CUT TO:

	INT.  HUT - ISLAND - DAY

	CLOSE ON the FACE:  COLUMBUS is stretched on a bed,
	sweating heavily in fever, clearly delirious.  Insects
	crawl over his face, he makes no effort to swat them away.
	There is a dripping sound of water.

					FERNANDO (V.O.)
			Of all the words my Father wrote and
			there were many, I remember these
			the most.  "Nothing that results
			from human progress is achieved with
			unanimous consent..."

	Rain is falling into the room over documents spread on a
	table.  COLUMBUS stands up and moves to the table.  Some
	of the walls have been blackened with smoke and flames.  A
	lizard scuttles into the shadows.

					FERNANDO (V.O.)
			"And those who are enlightened
			before the others are condemned to
			purse that light in spite of
			others..."

	COLUMBUS stares down at the documents, moving them away
	from the rain drips.  He stares out by the window, and we
	see:

	A devastated landscape.  Flooded roads, half-destroyed
	huts, broken trees... A dog picks its way through the mud.

					FERNANDO (V.O.)
			There was a time when the New World
			didn't exist...

									DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

	A vast stretch of ocean.  It fills the screen.  Unbroken,
	infinite, luminous, mysterious -- it stretches away,
	meeting and blending with the sky in pale ribbons of pearl
	and misty light.

					FERNANDO (V.O.)
			... The sun set in the west on an
			ocean where no man had dared to
			venture.  And beyond that,
			infinity...

	Pulling back, we discover:

	A TEN-YEAR-OLD BOY and a strongly built man in his middle
	thirties, are riding a mule.  The MAN'S weather-beaten
	face frames unusually bright eyes.

	On the screen these words:  ANDALUSIA, 1491

	COLUMBUS AND HIS SON are following a windthrashed path at
	the top of the hill.  COLUMBUS hums a song, and FERNANDO
	looks up at him in adoration.

					FERNANDO (V.O.)
			Once I asked my Father where he
			wanted to go.  And he replied:  "I
			want to travel all over the seas.  I
			want to get behind the weather..."

	FERNANDO laughs.  He then starts to hum along with his
	FATHER.

									CUT TO:

	EXT.  HILLSIDE APPROACH TO LA RABIDA - DAY

	A rugged landscape, remote and steep, with lines of stone
	walls and thousands of sheep.

	FERNANDO, rushes down a slope, barking like a dog, chasing
	the sheep who fan out in droves in front of him.  High-
	spirited and wild, FERNANDO laughs and tumbles over.

	COLUMBUS rides his mule along the narrow track, watching
	his SON'S antics with amusement.  In the distance, the
	solitary figure of A MONK SHEPHERD.

	COLUMBUS calls out to his son:

					COLUMBUS
			Fernando!

	FERNANDO runs over.  COLUMBUS lifts him up onto the mule.

	As they move along the track we now see, perched on a
	distant hill, isolated and austere, the Monastery of La
	Rabida, their destination.


	EXT.  CLOISTER - LA RABIDA - DAY

	As they dismount and walk into the quiet cloisters,
	FERNANDO suddenly spots a familiar FIGURE, standing under
	the ROMAN arches.

					FERNANDO
			Diego!

	He rushes over, full of joy, to kiss his BROTHER -- an
	adolescent dressed in the novice-robe, with a solemn,
	delicate face.  DIEGO'S response is constrained.

					COLUMBUS
			Diego!  Aren't you going to kiss
			your brother?

	DIEGO smiles a little, and kisses FERNANDO -- who is
	immediately distracted by a procession of hooded MONKS,
	hurrying to the refectory, as a bell begins to chime.

	The MONKS all turn to greet ANTONIO DE MARCHENA, a white-
	haired, elderly man -- and a monk cosmographer.
	MARCHENA'S gesture is broad and elegant as he opens his
	arms to greet COLUMBUS.  He pats FERNANDO'S head and turns
	to DIEGO.

					MARCHENA
			Diego, take Fernando to the dining
			hall.  He must be hungry.

					DIEGO
			Yes, Father.

	Both CHILDREN leave under the arched roof.  COLUMBUS and
	MARCHENA begin to walk across the cloister.

					MARCHENA
			Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure
			to teach -- but so serious...
			Brothers should be raised together,
			Colon.  Even brothers from different
			mothers...

					COLUMBUS
			Father, I am doing what I think is
			the best for him.  And he has the
			teacher I would have chosen for
			myself.

	MARCHENA laughs at the compliment.

					MARCHENA
			Just be careful you don't lose him.

	They have crossed the cloister.  MARCHENA pushes open a
	door.


	INT.  A HUGE LIBRARY - LA RABIDA - DAY

	Hundreds of books lined up on the shelves, displaying the
	miracle of printing, a recent German discovery.  Several
	MONKS, perched on high stools behind lecterns, are busily
	"ILLUMINATING" some of these massive volumes, delicately
	painting around the letters in bright colors and gold
	leaf.

	Rays of light fall diagonally through high openings,
	projecting geometric patterns on the tiled floor.  As
	MARCHENA and COLUMBUS move forward their conversation is
	punctuated by light and shadow.

					MARCHENA
				(fumbles in a pocket
				under his robe)
			I have something for you.

	Almost casually, he hands COLUMBUS a letter.

					MARCHENA
			You will be heard at the University
			of Salamanca...

	COLUMBUS stops dead in his tracks.  Almost frantically he
	tears open the letter, hardly able to believe his eyes.

					COLUMBUS
			God... That's in a week!

					MARCHENA
			That's what it says.

					COLUMBUS
			How did you manage it?

					MARCHENA
				(smiling)
			With some difficulty.  I had to
			promise them you were not a total
			fool.

	MARCHENA pushes open a second door, hidden behind a wooden
	panel.


	INT.  STUDY - LA RABIDA - DAY

	MARCHENA is not a tidy man.  Books are piled up on the
	floor, the desk, on every shelf, along with maps,
	instruments of astronomy... the visible evidence of an
	inquiring mind.

	With practiced familiarity, as if they had done this a
	hundred times -- which indeed they have -- MARCHENA sits
	behind his desk, and COLUMBUS opposite him.  MARCHENA
	lights a candle and considers the mess.  Then
	methodically, he slowly sweeps it from in front of him
	with his sleeve, exposing a large map underneath.

	When he looks up again, there is a new severity in his
	expression.  He turns over an hourglass.

					MARCHENA
			Why do you wish to sail west?

					COLUMBUS
			To open a new route to Asia.  At the
			moment there are only two ways of
			reaching it...

	He leans forward, and points to the map spread out on the
	desk.

					COLUMBUS
			By sea, sailing around the African
			Continent -- the journey takes a
			year...

	His finger traces the journey, from west to east.

					COLUMBUS
			Or by land...

	We are CLOSE now on the map, as we watch his finger
	tracing a line between Europe and the Far East.

					COLUMBUS (O.S.)
			... But the Turks have closed this
			route to all Christians.  Trading
			with the Orient has become arduous,
			if not dangerous.
				(he pauses)
			There is a third way...

	We notice that the outline of the European continent is
	familiar.  But we also notice that, in that great expanse
	of ocean, the whole American continent is missing.

					COLUMBUS
			By sailing West across the Ocean
			Sea.

	CLOSE ON MARCHENA'S FACE, touched by the mystery.

					MARCHENA
			How can you be so certain?  The
			Ocean is said to be infinite.

					COLUMBUS
			Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are
			no more than 750 leagues west of the
			Canary Islands.

					MARCHENA
			How can you be so certain?

					COLUMBUS
			The calculations of Toscanelli Marin
			de Tyr, Esdras...

					MARCHENA
				(interrupting)
			Esdras is a Jew.

					COLUMBUS
			So was Christ!

	MARCHENA throws his quill in the air in frustration.  He
	glances at the hourglass:

					MARCHENA
			Two minutes... and already you're a
			dead man.  Don't let passion
			overwhelm you, Colon.

					COLUMBUS
				(mockingly)
			I'll try to remember that,
			Marchena...

					MARCHENA
			Father Marchena!

					COLUMBUS
				(ignoring this)
			Passion is something one cannot
			control!

					MARCHENA
				(heatedly)
			You get so carried away when you are
			being contradicted!

					COLUMBUS
			I've been contradicted all my
			life... Eternity!

					MARCHENA
				(amused)
			Only God knows the meaning of such
			words, my son.


	EXT.  COURTYARD - LA RABIDA - EVENING

	DIEGO and FERNANDO wait in the courtyard.  COLUMBUS
	appears and lifts FERNANDO onto the mule.  DIEGO turns to
	go.

					COLUMBUS
			Diego.

	COLUMBUS walks over to him, squats down so their eyes
	meet.  He looks at his SON for a moment.

					COLUMBUS
			Would you like to come and stay with
			us?

	Uncomfortable with the proposition, DIEGO cannot find an
	answer.

					COLUMBUS
			I'll do whatever makes you happy.

					DIEGO
			I am happy, Father.

	COLUMBUS reaches out -- and touches his shoulder.

	He climbs up behind FERNANDO, who waves back to his
	BROTHER as they ride off.


	EXT.  CADIZ - STREETS AND CATHEDRAL SQUARE - NIGHT

	COLUMBUS leads the mule, carrying the sleeping FERNANDO,
	through narrow streets.  There's a clamorous noise in the
	air.  Suddenly a large group of YOUNG MEN, shouting with
	excitement, run up the street and brush past them.  Then
	more people.  FERNANDO sits up straight.  The noise grows,
	rowdy, rumbling, sharp with excitement and violence.

	Huge CROWDS have thronged the massive old square outside
	the cathedral.  Holding the mule by its reins, COLUMBUS
	tries to push his way through... Suddenly, as a gap opens
	in the crowd, we see the cause of the excitement:  in the
	center of the square stand three pyres, already alit.
	HOODED EXECUTIONERS are busy around the fires.

					FERNANDO
			Look, Father!

	Before COLUMBUS can stop him, FERNANDO has slipped off the
	mule and into the crowd.   

					COLUMBUS
			Fernando!

	But the BOY has been swallowed into the mass of people.
	COLUMBUS tries to follow him.  Flames leap into the night
	sky with a terrible crackling, lighting up the square with
	a lurid glow.  Prayers are being chanted somewhere.

	FERNANDO has elbowed his way to the front of the crowd.

	A PRIEST brandishes a crucifix in front of the face of a
	MAN bound to a post.  The heretic wears the "sambenito", a
	robe made of coarse fabric on which his sins have been
	crudely illustrated -- we see cabalistic signs,
	indicating that the man is Jewish.

	THE MAN'S eyes are mad with fear.  But he refuses to kiss
	the crucifix, as a sign of his repentance.

	FERNANDO is transfixed by the scene, but still doesn't
	realize what is happening.  He is too close to the
	platform to see what is in the flames of the other pyres.

					COLUMBUS
			Fernando!

	He motions to his son, takes the BOY'S hand, and drags him
	away from the scene.  But FERNANDO looks back.  The
	distance now allows him to see inside the flames.

	A HALF-CHARRED FIGURE -- THE MAN'S face is distorted in a
	silent scream... The neck snaps like burning wood, and the
	head falls on one shoulder.  Then the whole body collapses
	into the fire.


	INT.  BEATRIX'S HOUSE - HALLWAY AND STABLE - NIGHT

	COLUMBUS and FERNANDO lead the mule into the white-washed,
	stone-floored hallway of the modest house.  FERNANDO is
	mute, shocked by what he just witnessed.  COLUMBUS takes
	the mule into its stall, and as he does so, his mother,
	BEATRIX, appears from the kitchen to greet them.  She is a
	beautiful woman in her twenties, a calm, strong, domestic
	personality.  COLUMBUS tousles the BOY'S hair.  FERNANDO
	glances at his MOTHER but looks subdued and doesn't say
	anything.


	INT.  BEATRIX'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

	COLUMBUS joins BEATRIX in the kitchen, where a MAID is
	cooking.  He explains Fernando's subdued manner.

					COLUMBUS
			Executions.  In the square.

	BEATRIX nods.  He goes to the stone butt and pours water
	on his hands.

					COLUMBUS
			They've agreed to see me in a week.

	BEATRIX puts the candle on the table.  Her face lights up
	with a smile.  He walks to her, and kisses her.

					COLUMBUS
			I could be gone for years.

					BEATRIX
			I know.

					COLUMBUS
			I haven't given you much of a life.

					BEATRIX
				(amused)
			Well... that's true.  I have a child
			by a man who won't marry me!  Who's
			always leaving...

					COLUMBUS
			Are we going to argue?

					BEATRIX
			I'd love to argue with you
			sometimes.  But you're never here!

	They laugh and kiss.

					COLUMBUS
			Perhaps I was never meant to live
			with a woman...

					BEATRIX
				(still kissing him)
			I find that hard to believe.

									DISSOLVE TO:

	INT.  BEATRIX'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

	They are eating around the table, and FERNANDO is
	unusually silent and thoughtful.  COLUMBUS pours a little
	wine into FERNANDO'S water, to distract him.  FERNANDO
	looks up at him, surprised.  COLUMBUS smiles, then looks
	over at BEATRIX.

					COLUMBUS
			Fernando, don't you think we are
			lucky to live with such a beautiful
			woman?

	He winks at FERNANDO.  BEATRIX smiles.


	INT.  BEATRIX'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

	The room is dark.  As COLUMBUS approached the bed with a
	candle, it illuminates the naked body of BEATRIX.  BEATRIX
	looks up at him intently.  A drop of wax falls on her
	skin.  She flinches, murmurs...

	They make love.


	EXT.  SALAMANCA UNIVERSITY - DAY

	A medieval "campus".  Students-novices are playing
	"pelote", with basket-gloves and a hard ball.  They run
	with their robes tucked around their waist, revealing
	white legs.  Others are studying, reading, hurrying to
	their class.

	We find COLUMBUS watching the game from the steps above
	the court.  Others are waiting with him.  A MONK comes
	from a door, and looks around the group.

					MONK
				(hesitant)
			Christopher Columbus?


	INT.  AUDIENCE ROOM - UNIVERSITY OF SALAMANCA - DAY

	An El Greco painting.  A tableau of twenty MEN sitting on
	dark, sculpted seats.  Candles throw a gloomy light on
	their faces.  Some are Churchmen, others are dressed in
	bourgeois outfits.

	Only one of them is richly dressed in the grand Spanish
	fashion -- he is SANCHEZ, Treasurer of the House of
	Aragon.  A MONK (Don AROJAZ) holds a stick with an ivory
	claw at the top.  Languidly, he scratches his back -- his
	off-hand manner only makes him more impressive than his
	peers.

					AROJAZ
			You say Asia can be found by sailing
			west?

					COLUMBUS
			Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage
			should not take more than six or
			seven weeks.

					AROJAZ
			Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is
			precisely where our opinions
			differ...
				(pause)
			Are you familiar with the work of
			Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?

					COLUMBUS
			I am, Your Eminence

					AROJAZ
			Then you cannot ignore that
			according to their calculations, the
			circumference of the Earth is
			approximately...
				(he leans forward)
			22,000 leagues or more.  Which makes
			the ocean... uncrossable.

	He leans back, satisfied, and pauses for effect.

					AROJAZ
			But you may have found new evidence
			proving that these men of knowledge
			are totally mistaken!

	A ripple of mirthless laughter.

					COLUMBUS
			Your Excellencies are aware of the
			statements of Marin de Tyr?

					HERNANDO DE TALAVERA
			We are.

					COLUMBUS
			Then you are also aware that his
			theories contradict Ptolemeus... De
			Tyr believes the Ocean to be only
			750 leagues...

	A murmur of protest spreads among the members of the
	Commission.  But Columbus is determined to press his
	theories.

					COLUMBUS
			The Florentine Toscanelli and the
			French Cardinal Pierre d'Ailly both
			think that Marin de Tyr is accurate
			in his calculations.  And therefore,
			that the ocean can be crossed.

	Indignant and amused murmurs.  DIEGO DE DEZA raises his
	voice to quiet the assembly.

					DIEGO DE DEZA
			Gentlemen, let us suppose Marin de
			Tyr is right...
				(the laughter
				subsides)
			Are we here to examine this proposal
			or not?

	Silence.

					DIEGO DE DEZA
				(to Columbus)
			In your opinion, how long would the
			voyage be?

					COLUMBUS
			Seven weeks.  Six, during the summer
			months.

	The murmur increases.

					AROJAZ
			Marin de Tyr is wrong -- and has
			been corrected many times over the
			centuries by the finest geographers.
			Your voyage, Don Colon, would take a
			year!

	A MAN of simple bearing, that COLUMBUS identifies as
	being a seaman, interrupts.

					VICUNA
			How would the crew survive without
			being able to land for fresh water?
			Water is undrinkable after six
			weeks!  You'd never be able to turn
			back!

					COLUMBUS
			We wouldn't have to turn back!  We
			would find land at this point!

					AROJAZ
			Senor Colon, an experienced captain
			such as yourself will understand our
			concern with the crew.  I am not
			willing to have on my conscience the
			loss of men who would have relied
			upon our judgment.

					COLUMBUS
			Excellency, you are right.

	Instantly, the protests stop.

					COLUMBUS
			I am a seaman, not a scholar... But
			as a simple man craving for
			knowledge, I have read all the work
			of these renowned geographers and
			discovered that none of them could
			agree on the exact width of this
			ocean...

	He pauses, and starts walking in front of the experts, as
	a lawyer before a grand jury.

					COLUMBUS
			Therefore, as a modest man, I
			wonder:  who is right?

	The experts listen.  CLOSE ON SANCHEZ'S FACE, impressed by
	the boldness.

					COLUMBUS
			Who is right?  This question remains
			unanswered.

	He walks and stops before TALAVERA, and catches the look
	of SANCHEZ, sitting just behind him.

					COLUMBUS
			Your Eminence, there is only one way
			to settle the matter.  And that is
			to make the journey.
				(to the assembly,
				with passion)
			I am ready to risk my life to prove
			it possible.

					AROJAZ
			Your life, and that of others!

					COLUMBUS
			If they agree to follow me, yes.

					SANCHEZ (O.S.)
			Suppose you cross this ocean.
			Suppose you reach Asia.  What would
			Spain do there?

	Conscious of a friendlier voice, COLUMBUS sees the
	Treasurer SANCHEZ, an imposing man in his fifties.

					COLUMBUS
			Trade, Your Excellency.  According
			to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China
			is one of the richest of the world.
			Even the meanest buildings are
			roofed with gold.

					AROJAZ
				(interrupting)
			Is that all that interests you?
			Gold?

					COLUMBUS
			No.  The Portuguese have already
			discovered black-skinned people.  I,
			too, will find other populations --
			and bring them to the word of God.

	THE MONK smiles thinly.

					AROJAZ
			Christopher -- Christo Ferens -- the
			Bearer of the Cross!

					MONK
				(ironic)
			And Colon -- the one who populates!

	Another small rill of laughter.

					AROJAZ
			If God intended our proximity to
			Asia, do you believe he would have
			waited for you to show it to the
			world?

					COLUMBUS
			Did He not choose a carpenter's son
			to reveal Himself to the world?

	A hum of interest.  CLOSE ON SANCHEZ -- watching COLUMBUS
	intently, a hint of an admiring smile on his lips.

					AROJAZ
			So you consider yourself the chosen
			one?

	A pause.

					AROJAZ
			Don't you realize your words could
			be considered heretical?

					COLUMBUS
				(calmly)
			Blind faith is what I consider
			heresy!

	The murmur turns to an audible gasp.  AROJAZ gets to his
	feet and leans forward, threateningly, the flame of a
	candle only inches from his face.

	There is absolute silence.  COLUMBUS meets the MONK'S gaze
	unflinchingly.

					COLUMBUS
				(quietly)
			Asia can be found to the west -- and
			I will prove it.

					AROJAZ
			IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!


	EXT.  TERRACE - UNIVERSITY - DAY

	The JURY is alone to deliberate.  Food and wine has been
	laid out on tables.  In the distance, students' cries
	carry over the conversation.

	SANCHEZ approaches.

					AROJAZ
			The Treasurer of Spain honors us
			with his presence.

	SANCHEZ bows slightly.

					SANCHEZ
			The State has some reason to be
			interested in this man's
			proposition, Your Eminence...

					AROJAZ
			The Judgment is ours!

					SANCHEZ
			Naturally.  But I would really
			deplore the loss of such a potential
			opportunity for Spain for a...
			dispute over a point of geography.

	SANCHEZ helps himself to some grapes, looks round at the
	other members of the committee, who pretend not to be
	listening.

					AROJAZ
				(interrupting)
			He is a mercenary!  Did he not
			already try to convince the King of
			Portugal of his absurd notions?

					SANCHEZ
			Indeed.  The world is full of
			mercenaries -- and states often make
			use of them, when it benefits them.
				(casually)
			My only concern is the welfare and
			prosperity of Spain.

	AROJAZ understands the hint, and stops smiling.

					AROJAZ
			You would use your influence to
			assist this... intriguer?

	SANCHEZ reaches for a decanter of sherry.

					SANCHEZ
			You know, Your Eminence, the
			fascinating thing about power, is
			that what can be given so
			effortlessly...

	He offers the decanter to AROJAZ, who automatically lifts
	his glass.  But instead, SANCHEZ pulls back the decanter,
	pours himself a drink, and replaces it on the table,
	leaving AROJAZ staring at his own empty glass.

					SANCHEZ
			... can so easily be taken away.

	And he drinks with a smile.


	INT.  LA RABIDA - MARCHENA'S STUDY - EVENING

	MARCHENA reads aloud the Commission's letter.

					MARCHENA
			... and therefore nothing could
			justify the participation of Your
			Highnesses in the venture that
			relies upon such feeble assumptions,
			and which any man of knowledge
			would take to be impractical... if
			not impossible.

	He shakes his head, puts the letter down.  COLUMBUS looks
	appalled; devastated.

					COLUMBUS
			They didn't listen.  They didn't
			want to listen!

	He paces about the book-lined room.

					MARCHENA
			You mustn't give way to despair.
			You must wait.

					COLUMBUS
			Wait!  I've waited seven years
			already!  How much longer do you
			want me to wait?

					MARCHENA
			If God intends you to go, then you
			will go.

					COLUMBUS
				(angrily)
			Damn God!

	MARCHENA is shocked.

					MARCHENA
			Colon!

					COLUMBUS
			Damn all of you!  You all set up
			theories based on what?  You never
			leave the safety of your studies!
			Go out!  Find out what the world is
			about and then tell me something I
			can listen to!

	He seizes a beautiful book from MARCHENA'S desk.

					COLUMBUS
			These don't mean anything!  They're
			full of assumptions!  Out of the
			heads of old men who've never been
			past the end of their gardens!

	He hurls the book across the room.  MARCHENA is horrified.

					MARCHENA
			No...!  My books...!

	COLUMBUS seizes more books from the shelves, just sweeping
	them to the floor.

					COLUMBUS
			All of them!  Just lies!

					MARCHENA
			Colon!  Don't!

	MARCHENA tries to stop him.  In his fury, COLUMBUS
	accidentally knocks the poor old MAN to the ground.  His
	cries bring three MONKS rushing into the room.

	As COLUMBUS continues to rage and scatter books
	everywhere, they try to stop him, struggling with this
	big, powerful man -- to almost comical effect.  Finally, a
	short, muscular MONK delivers a quick punch that sends
	COLUMBUS crashing to the floor.


	INT.  CHAPEL OF LA RABIDA - EVENING

	COLUMBUS lies face down on the stone floor.  He is dressed
	in a homespun robe.  His arms are stretched out in
	penance.  FERNANDO and DIEGO look down at him.

					FERNANDO
			Father?

					DIEGO
			Sssshhhh...!  One can't speak to a
			man doing penance.

					FERNANDO
			What can you do?

					DIEGO
			Nothing.  That's the point,
			Fernando.

	A pause -- and then FERNANDO lies face down on the floor
	beside his FATHER, and stretches out his arms in the same
	way.  DIEGO is left looking on, unable to bring himself to
	join them.


	EXT.  CLOISTER - LA RABIDA - DAY

	Along the cloister, maps are drying, hanging like laundry
	in the light breeze.  COLUMBUS pins up a new addition.
	Another MONK works nearby, in silence.

					PINZON (O.S.)
			Senor Colon?

	COLUMBUS turns, to see a small, stocky MAN approaching:  a
	middle-class gentleman.  He nods.

					PINZON
			Ah, thank God!  I've been looking
			all over Seville for you!  Never
			expected to find a sailor in a
			monastery, eh?

	He laughs.  COLUMBUS smiles, but doesn't say anything.
	PINZON is clearly a little surprised.

					PINZON
			Name's Pinzon, by the way.  Martin
			Alonzo Pinzon.  I'm a ship owner
			from Palos...

	COLUMBUS glances around cautiously, and walks a little way
	down the cloister, away from the other MONK, gesturing for
	PINZON to follow him.  PINZON is yet more surprised by
	this strange behavior.

					PINZON
				(indicating the
				monk)
			Is he a spy?

	COLUMBUS shakes his head.  PINZON stares at him,
	perplexed.

					PINZON
			What is it?  Are you a Trappist?

	COLUMBUS shakes his head again.

					PINZON
			Vow of silence...?  Penance?

	COLUMBUS nods vigorously.

					PINZON
			Jesus!  Just my luck!

	He takes off his hat, wiping his forehead with a silk
	cloth.

					PINZON
			Listen.  I'll do the talking for
			both of us.  You just nod.  Agreed?
			Just as I do with the wife.

	COLUMBUS nods.

					PINZON
			I know that the Commission turned
			you down, right?  What do you
			expect?  You're a foreigner... But I
			want to help you.

	COLUMBUS gives him a glance like one throws a question in
	the air.

					PINZON
			You wonder why I believe in you?
			Hey, I am a seaman.  And we don't
			like to be told where to go, and
			where not to go.

	COLUMBUS looks at him, and bursts out laughing.  The other
	MONK looks round severely.  COLUMBUS ducks behind a map,
	PINZON following him.  PINZON lowers his voice.

					PINZON
			I don't look like it, but I have
			friends at the Court.  The Treasurer
			of Aragon, for example.  He finances
			me.  His name's Santangel.  Ever
			heard of him?

	COLUMBUS shakes his head, but looks increasingly
	interested by what he's hearing.

					PINZON
			He can get you an audience with the
			Queen!  You know why...?  She owes
			him money.  That's how it is.  You
			-- me -- the Queen -- the world and
			his mistress -- agreed?

	COLUMBUS nods.

					PINZON
			So.  What do you say?

	COLUMBUS looks around, catches the disapproving face of
	the MONK, crosses himself, then speaks:

					COLUMBUS
			Where can I meet this man?

					PINZON
				(indicating with a
				nod)
			Immediately.

	COLUMBUS turns and sees an elegant Lord in his fifties,
	examining the maps.


	EXT.  STREETS OF GRANADA - DAY

	A huge Islamic Crescent being pulled down from the minaret
	of a mosque.  SOLDIERS are holding back a crowd at the
	foot of the tower.  To the ecstatic cries of the crowd, a
	Cross is hoisted up in its place... Astride horses,
	COLUMBUS and the Treasurer SANTANGEL are watching the
	scene.

	They push through an extraordinary scene.  The city of
	Granada has just been reclaimed from the moors after
	several years of siege.  All around them, SPANISH SOLDIERS
	are herding, bedraggled columns of the defeated MOORS,
	bearing only a few possessions.  Ragged, half-starved men,
	women and children.

					SANTANGEL
			These people built Granada...
			Centuries ago!  It is a great
			victory over the Moors, Don Colon --
			and yet what a tragedy it is!

	The THREE HORSEMEN pass a procession of grateful
	PENITENTS, who are crawling on their knees, chanting
	psalms and flagellating themselves.  At the head of the
	procession, HOODED PRIESTS carry a statue of the Virgin
	Mary swathed in silk and lace.

	The gates of the Alhambra Palace are in sight.

					COLUMBUS
			Is this a good time to meet her?

					SANTANGEL
			It couldn't be better.  Victors
			can't say no.

	Bells are pealing triumphantly.  The noise is tumultuous.
	They ride towards the magnificent palace.


	EXT.  ALHAMBRA PALACE - GARDENS - DAY

	Fabulous Moorish gardens:  ponds filled with golden carp;
	exotic bird cages hang from lemon trees... The distant
	sounds of victory.

	SANTANGEL and COLUMBUS walk through the gardens, escorted
	by HALBERDIERS.  SOLDIERS pass by, carrying coffers or
	piles of documents.

	As they approach the inner sanctum, however, there are
	fewer people.  They stop by the Lion's Fountain, where
	several DIGNITARIES are waiting patiently for an audience.

	SANCHEZ appears.  They bow.  SANTANGEL approaches to
	murmur a compliment.

					SANTANGEL
			Your Excellency... truly grateful...
			your help... as ever...

	SANCHEZ protests softly, and looks over at COLUMBUS, a
	half-smile forming on his lips.  Then a DUENA appears, and
	motions for COLUMBUS to follow.


	INT.  ALHAMBRA PALACE - THRONE ROOM - DAY

	An ornate Moorish door is pushed open by the DUENA'S hand.
	We enter the Throne Room -- sculptured colonnades,
	mosaics... At the far end, windows open onto a view of
	Granada's rooftops.

	Against this dazzling light, the delicate silhouette of
	QUEEN ISABEL OF SPAIN.  The light in her blonde hair
	creates a halo around her head as she turns.  COLUMBUS
	falls to his knees.

					ISABEL
			Rise...!  Come forward!

	He approaches the window, stopping close to her.  ISABEL
	scrutinizes him quickly.

					ISABEL
			I should not even be listening to
			you, since my council said no.  But
			Santangel tells me you are a man of
			honor and sincerity... And Sanchez,
			that you are not a fool.

					COLUMBUS
				(bold)
			No more than the woman who said she
			would take Granada from the Moors.

	ISABEL smiles, enjoying the lack of obsequiousness.

					ISABEL
			The ocean is uncrossable?

					COLUMBUS
			What did they say about Granada
			before today?

					ISABEL
				(a beat)
			That she was impregnable.

	ISABEL smiles again.

					ISABEL
			I cannot ignore the verdict of my
			council.

					COLUMBUS
			Surely you can do anything you want.

	A direct challenge.  She doesn't know what to make of this
	man.

					ISABEL
			How little you know.

	This little hint of vulnerability subtly reverses their
	positions for a moment.  Now we sense COLUMBUS
	scrutinizing her.

					COLUMBUS
			May I speak freely?

					ISABEL
				(with a smile)
			You show no inclination to speak
			otherwise!

					COLUMBUS
			I know what I see.  I see someone
			who doesn't accept the world as it
			is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a
			women who thinks... "What if?"...

					ISABEL
				(amused at his
				familiarity)
			A woman?

	A slight pause.

					COLUMBUS
			Forgive me... but you're the only
			Queen I know.

	She bursts out laughing.

					ISABEL
			Then we are equal... since you are
			the only sailor I know!

	A beat.

					ISABEL
			How old are you, Senor Colon?

					COLUMBUS
			Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And
			you?

	Once again taken off guard, ISABEL flushes, and turns away
	slightly to hide it.

					ISABEL
			Thirty eight...

	A pause.

					ISABEL
			You will be informed of our
			decision.

	COLUMBUS bows and goes to leave.  As the DUENA opens the
	door for him, he turns back.

					COLUMBUS
			Actually, I thought you were younger
			than me!

	And he goes out, leaving her stunned.


	EXT.  SANCHEZ'S ESTATE - TREE-LINED ROAD - DAY

	A chalk white road, lined with trees.  Two liveried
	SERVANTS are walking down the road, one carrying a large
	silver tray, the other a smaller tray.

	They are overtaken by an ADMINISTRATOR who hurries along
	the road, with documents under his arm.


	EXT.  SANCHEZ'S ESTATE - STABLE BLOCK AND PADDOCK - DAY

	The CLERK enters an imposing stable block.

	In the paddock, SANCHEZ is training a magnificent young
	horse, making it step sideways, bending it to his will.
	The ADMINISTRATOR watches him, unable to interrupt.

	Behind him the two SERVANTS can be seen bringing in the
	silver trays, with covered dishes of food, a decanter of
	wine.  They begin to lay them out on a table.


	EXT.  SANCHEZ'S ESTATE - STABLE BLOCK AND PADDOCK - LATER

	SANCHEZ pours himself some wine, tucks into his his food,
	while the ADMINISTRATOR, clearly working himself up into a
	frenzy, reads from a document.

					ADMINISTRATOR
			... and he demands... he DEMANDS to
			be made a Knight, with the right to
			bear the Golden Spurs!  He will
			receive the title of Don Cristobal
			Colon -- which will be extended to
			his descendants for ever more...

	The ADMINISTRATOR looks up.  He is reading the contract
	that COLUMBUS has proposed.  SANCHEZ, his mouth full,
	gestures for him to continue.

					SANCHEZ
			Go on!

					ADMINISTRATOR
			He will be named Great Admiral of
			the Ocean Sea.  Viceroy of the West
			Indies... Governor of all islands or
			lands discovered or as will be
			discovered with his help...

	The ADMINISTRATOR looks up again.

					ADMINISTRATOR
			The highest titles of nobility, Your
			Excellency!  To an immigrant
			sheltered by monks!

	SANCHEZ gestures for the document.  Wipes his mouth.
	Continues reading, calmly:

					SANCHEZ
			Furthermore he will receive one
			eight of all wealth or monies,
			precious gems, pearls, metals,
			spices and other lucrative sources
			conquered within the boundaries of
			his admiralty...

	He smiles, hands the document back.

					SANCHEZ
			It's very underdone.

					ADMINISTRATOR
				(exploding)
			Underdone!  It's monstrous,
			Excellency!

					SANCHEZ
			No, the pheasant.  It's almost raw.

	And he carries on eating.

					SANCHEZ
			You worry too much, Carvajal... The
			man will have to lower his demands.
			Believe me, he WILL!


	INT.  ALHAMBRA PALACE - A RECEPTION ROOM - DAY

	Close up on COLUMBUS.

					COLUMBUS
			I WON'T!

	A WOMAN'S HAND quietly, carefully opens a cover of a spy
	hole in the wall.  Two beautiful eyes peer through a
	grille, into the next room.

	What they see:

	SANCHEZ and COLUMBUS together.  COLUMBUS is visibly upset.

					SANCHEZ
				(calmly)
			We have considered your -- demands
			very carefully, Senor Colon... Your
			expectations are... excessive, in
			every way.

	COLUMBUS tightens his fists, tries to remain calm.

					COLUMBUS
			If I am right, my requests are fair!

	SANCHEZ holds up a document.

					SANCHEZ
			We have prepared our own contract...

	He offers the document to COLUMBUS, who takes it, scans it
	quickly, shakes his head.

					COLUMBUS
			No...

					SANCHEZ
			No?

					COLUMBUS
			NO...!  I have waited too long,
			fought too hard.  Now you expect me
			to take all the risks while you take
			the profit!  No... I will not be
			your servant!

	The eyes behind the screen -- the mouth, forming a little
	smile.

					SANCHEZ
			I remind you, Senor Colon, that you
			are in no position to bargain with
			me.

					COLUMBUS
			I'm not bargaining!

					SANCHEZ
				(steely)
			Then you are too ambitious.

	COLUMBUS leans over the table, faces him.

					COLUMBUS
			And were you never ambitious,
			Excellency?  Or is ambition only a
			virtue among the nobles, a fault for
			the rest of us?

					SANCHEZ
				(abrupt)
			If you won't accept our proposal,
			we'll simply find someone who will.

	COLUMBUS smiles.

					COLUMBUS
			If you can do that, Excellency --
			I'll become a monk!

	He turns, strides towards the door.  We hear a WOMAN'S
	muffled laughter.

	As COLUMBUS goes out, ISABEL appears through a secret
	door.  SANCHEZ bows.

	ISABEL goes over to the window and looks out.

					ISABEL
			You were right, Don Sanchez... His
			demands could never be granted.

					SANCHEZ
			Never, Your Majesty.  Although...

	She turns, questioningly, towards him.

					SANCHEZ
			... Although one may always
			renegotiate a contract.  Especially
			signed by Royal Hands.


	EXT.  ALHAMBRA PALACE GARDENS - POV - DAY

	SANCHEZ joins ISABEL at the window.  They see COLUMBUS
	striding out and away.


	INT.  ALHAMBRA PALACE - A RECEPTION ROOM - DAY

	BACK TO SANCHEZ

					SANCHEZ
				(quietly)
			... Into a monk...

					ISABEL
				(with a smile)
			Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't
			it?
				(turning to Sanchez)
			Call him back!


	EXT.  STREET - EVENING   

	Teeming life.  COLUMBUS pushing his way through crowds.
	He is expressionless and distracted.

	He looks around him, stops walking.  And then,
	unexpectedly, shouts.

					COLUMBUS
			YEEEEEEES!

	All heads turn as if he were totally insane.  He walks on
	as if nothing happened.


	INT.  BEATRIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	COLUMBUS is sitting at the kitchen table, by himself, with
	a glass of wine.  There is a movement behind him.  BEATRIX
	is standing at the foot of the stairs, in a night-shirt.

	COLUMBUS turns and looks at her, almost sad.

					COLUMBUS
			She said yes.

					BEATRIX
				(moved)
			Thank God...

	She smiles.  But he seems to be unable to share her
	happiness.

					COLUMBUS
			If I ever come back, I swear I
			will...

	She crosses to him quickly, placing her hand gently on his
	mouth.

					BEATRIX
				(softly)
			I'm not asking you to swear to
			anything.

					COLUMBUS
			I don't want you to wait for me.

					BEATRIX
				(smiling)
			That's something you can't decide.

	COLUMBUS kisses her.


	INT.  CORRIDOR - BEATRIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	Strange, unearthly music... A flickering light in a dark
	tunnel.  FERNANDO, holding a candle in front of him, walks
	slowly down the dark corridor.

	Quietly opening a door, he walks into COLUMBUS' study.


	INT.  COLUMBUS' STUDY - NIGHT

	CLOSE ON:  A huge illustrated map of western Europe and
	Asia.  FERNANDO'S candle moves slowly across the Atlantic
	Ocean, to the edge of the map.  There, the illustrator's
	imagination has created monsters:  terrifying demons;
	creatures half-human, half-animal.

	Sitting at his desk, COLUMBUS is looking at the map.

					FERNANDO (O.S.)
			You can't go there!

	Turning, COLUMBUS finds his son beside him.

					COLUMBUS
			Why not?

	FERNANDO points at the monsters.  He pulls the boy to him.

					COLUMBUS
			There aren't any monsters, Fernando.
			The only monsters are in here...
				(he taps his own
				forehead)
			Watch!

	He takes a pen, and draws a smile on one of the terrible
	monsters, transforming it at once.  FERNANDO laughs
	immediately.

					FERNANDO
			I want to go with you!

					COLUMBUS
			There'll be a time.

					FERNANDO
			You promise?
				(Columbus nods his
				head)
			Do you swear on St. Christopher...?

	FERNANDO pulls the chain with the St. Christopher medal
	from under COLUMBUS' shirt.

					FERNANDO
			Do you swear on all the Holy Saints
			in heaven?

					COLUMBUS
				(laughing)
			Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!

	And he hugs his SON tightly.


	EXT.  HILLSIDE AND GATE - PRE-DAWN

	A luminous procession passes through a Moorish stone gate,
	down to the harbor.  We see the faces of the SAILORS and
	their FAMILIES -- COLUMBUS, PINZON AMONGST THEM -- We
	sense the fervor and apprehension of the departure.  The
	procession is lead by MARCHENA and four young NOVICES
	carrying the Madonna.  All hold long, burning tapers,
	saying the rosary.  A SAILOR pushes through the crowd, and
	kisses the Madonna's feet.


	EXT.  PALOS HARBOR - DAWN

	Hundreds of candles flicker in the pre-dawn light, held by
	the FAMILIES and FRIENDS of the SAILORS.

	The SANTA MARIA the PINTA and the NINA nestle against the
	quayside.  Dwarfed by the hulls, a flotilla of smaller
	fishing craft, returning from night fishing, accidentally
	witness this event.


	EXT.  MAKESHIFT CONFESSIONAL - DOCKSIDE - DAWN

	MARCHENA sits on a barrel and crosses himself.  Behind a
	curtain sits COLUMBUS.

					MARCHENA
			In Nomine Patris et Filius, et
			Spiritus Sancti.

					COLUMBUS
			Forgive me, Father.  For I have
			sinned.

	MARCHENA recognizes COLUMBUS' voice.

					MARCHENA
			I am listening, my son.

					COLUMBUS
			Father, I have betrayed my family.
			I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed
			you.

					MARCHENA
			What are you saying?

					COLUMBUS
			I lied.  The journey will be longer
			than I said.

					MARCHENA
			How long?

					COLUMBUS
			I am not sure... It could be twice
			the distance.

	A pause.

					MARCHENA
			May God forgive you...!  You must
			tell them!  You must tell your men!

					COLUMBUS
			If I tell them, they won't follow
			me.  You know that I am right,
			Father.  You trust me...

					MARCHENA
			My son, my son...
				(he shakes his head)
			Your certitudes are sometimes
			frightening...
				(pause)
			Christopher, you must speak to them.
			And if you don't I will.

					COLUMBUS
			You are bound by an oath, Father.

	A long silence.

					MARCHENA
			I believed in you...

					COLUMBUS
			Give me absolution.

	No response.

					COLUMBUS
			Give me absolution, Father!

	Devastated, MARCHENA reluctantly makes the sign of the
	cross.


	EXT.  HARBOR AND SHIPS - PALOS - DAWN

	COLUMBUS walks over to where BEATRIX and FERNANDO are
	waiting.  He kisses and hugs FERNANDO.

					MARCHENA (O.S.)
			Ispo Te Absoluto.  May God forgive
			you and have mercy on your soul,
			Christopher Columbus.  Go in peace.

									DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT.  HARBOR AND SHIPS - DAWN - LATER

	The CROWDED QUAYSIDE.  COLUMBUS stands in front of
	FERNANDO.

					COLUMBUS
			Be good to your mother, Fernando.
			Do you promise?

	FERNANDO nods, tears in his eyes.  Then COLUMBUS embraces
	BEATRIX tightly.  She whispers into his ear.

					BEATRIX
			Speak to Diego.

	But COLUMBUS and DIEGO are unable to find words, and
	instead they clumsily hug.  Someone taps COLUMBUS'
	shoulder.  He turns around to see SANTANGEL.  Wordlessly,
	they hug.

									CUT TO:

	Activity on the ships, orders are being shouted, ropes
	fore and aft are cast off, splashing into the water... Now
	the SHIPS are slowly moving parallel to the quayside.  The
	CROWD starts walking abreast to the VESSELS.  WOMEN
	holding up babies, blowing kisses, old PARENTS crying...
	BEATRIX, HER SONS, AND SANTANGEL are among them.

	COLUMBUS suddenly unties the chain around his neck, and
	throws it at DIEGO.

					COLUMBUS
			Diego!  Here!

	DIEGO catches it.  Opening his hand he looks at the
	medallion.  Then looks up at his FATHER, elated.

	THE SANTA MARIA is now two meters from the QUAY.
	SANTANGEL is now opposite COLUMBUS.

					SANTANGEL
				(casually)
			Take care of my investment, wherever
			you're going!

					COLUMBUS
				(ambiguous)
			I have to tell you Santangel.  I
			don't know where on earth I am
			going!

	They both laugh.

	A FISHERMAN, standing in his shrimp-boat lets his hand
	slide gently along the gigantic hull.  He stares up at the
	SAILORS leaning on the rail.

					SAILOR
			Vaya con Dios!  (Go with God!)

	They wave back.

									CUT TO:

	MARCHENA walking towards the Moorish gate.  He finally
	turns, sad and distraught.  He sees:

									CUT TO:

	EXT.  SHIPS AT SEA - WHALES - DAY

	THREE SHIPS ON A BOUNDLESS OCEAN.

	The sea resembling a DORMANT MONSTER, holding its breath.
	A living being, all powerful, capable of unpredictable
	metamorphosis.  Music reflects the loneliness, the anxiety
	of the crew, the fear of the unknown...

	ENORMOUS WHALES moving slowly alongside, surging
	majestically through the waves.  Sinking back,
	disappearing, their cries taking precedent over the music.


	EXT.  DECK - DAY

	A SHIP'S BOY is throwing buckets of water on the deck.

	A SAILOR is busy clearing the ropes around the mast.

	A COOK is blowing life into a brazier, in preparation of
	the evening meal.

	TEN MEN heaving on a heavy rope, raising the top sail,
	punctuating their efforts with a sailor's chant.


	EXT.  SANTA MARIA - NIGHT

	The crystalline north star -- as if seen through an
	instrument.

	COLUMBUS' silhouette, by an oil lamp, standing at the
	prow.  Holding a quadrant he is aiming at the stars.

	SOME SAILORS are watching with curiosity.  One of them is
	ALONSO, a rough, stocky Basque.

	Near COLUMBUS, on a tressel, various books and charts.  He
	makes an entry in the log.  Then goes back to his
	quadrant.  He senses MENDEZ standing next to him.

					COLUMBUS
				(softly)
			Due west, Captain Mendez.  And may
			God be with us...

					MENDEZ
			God be with us admiral.

	MENDEZ doesn't move, continuing to observe COLUMBUS.

					COLUMBUS
			What is it Mendez?  Speak!

	MENDEZ is hesitant.  He nervously clears his throat.

					MENDEZ
			Well... It's the men, Sir.  They
			wonder how you know our position.
			We've lost sight from land days
			ago...

					COLUMBUS
				(still taking
				readings)
			And what do you think Mendez?

					MENDEZ
			Well, I surely know what a quadrant
			is!  But I've never seen it used at
			night before.

					COLUMBUS
			Come over here.

	MENDEZ hesitates, then motions to COLUMBUS.  The SAILORS
	are watching, and some approach to hear the conversation.

					COLUMBUS
			Now, find the North Star.  Do you
			have it?

									CUT TO:

	The picture swims across the heavens, until we see the
	north star.

					COLUMBUS (O.S.)
			Steady yourself...!  Keep the plumb
			line vertical...

	The picture steadies.

									CUT TO:

	MENDEZ nods -- and loses equilibrium.  The plumb line
	swings.

					COLUMBUS
			Don't move!  A mistake of one degree
			and we'll be off 6,000 leagues!

	MENDEZ tries again.

					COLUMBUS
			What do you read?

					MENDEZ
			Twenty eight.

	MENDEZ turns to COLUMBUS.

					COLUMBUS
			That's it.  The twenty eighth
			parallel.  And we'll follow it until
			we reach land.

	ALONSO does not seem convinced.

					ALONSO
			How do you know land is on the
			twenty eighth parallel?


	EXT.  SANTA MARIA - DECK - DAY

	A blazing sun.  The ship is like a furnace, its brass
	fittings too hot to touch, the blistering heat making the
	air shimmer over the decks.

	Desperate for shade, sailors are sheltering under the
	sagging prow sail.

	The SHIP'S BOY throws an empty bucket attached to a rope
	over the side and hauls it back up again, brimming with
	water.  As he turns, we see his face, disfigured by a hair
	lip.  He drenches himself... From the shade, ALONSO
	watches him.

					ALONSO
			Chicken-ass face!

	The others laugh.  The BOY, ashamed, tries to ignore them.
	ALONSO'S hand accidentally touches a brass fitting; he
	reacts like he was burnt.

					ALONSO
			Shit!

	He sucks his blistered fingers.

					ALONSO
			I never seen heat like this!  Not
			even in Las Minas!

					SAILOR
			The water's going putrid in the
			barrels.

					ALONSO
			You'll be drinking your own piss...
			For the glory of Spain... and
			Admiral Colon...!  Bastard!

	The SHIP'S BOY glances round at them.

					ALONSO
			What are you listening to, chicken
			ass?

					SAILOR
			Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no
			harm.

					ALONSO
			With a face like that?
				(to boy)
			I don't want you looking at me.  You
			hear?

	The BOY turns away, dropping the bucket back into the sea.

					ALONSO
			He's the devil's child...

					SAILOR
			We'll all go crazy...

	The BOY throws more water over the deck.  A SAILOR takes
	his guitar, and starts singing an improvised song.

					SAILOR
			Culo de galina es el hijo del
			demonio... (Chicken ass mouth is the
			devil's child... Born from the loins
			of a stinky old goat etc...)

	They all laugh.  The BOY, hearing this, climbs to the
	crow's-nest like a monkey.


	EXT.  SANTA MARIA - RIGGING AND CROW'S-NEST - DAY

	We experience a sense of vertigo as we near the top of the
	main mast, high above the rolling deck.

	The BOY curls like a fetus in the swinging crow's-nest,
	exhausted by the heat, and scared.  His eyes are turning
	white.  He begins to piss himself...

									CUT TO:

	EXT.  SANTA MARIA - DECK - DAY

	Piss is dripping on the deck.  THE SAILORS do not seem to
	care.  THE COOK takes a chicken from a cage.  He breaks
	its neck, and starts plucking it.  The OTHERS continue
	their bitter conversation.

					ALONSO
			We should have seen land.

					SAILOR
			We left three weeks ago, Alonso.
			Can't be that near.

					ALONSO
			Can't be that far, I say.  Also, I
			don't like the smell of the sea
			around here.  Smells like a cunt.
			Bad sign...

	The COOK starts laughing.  They turn to him.

					COOK
				(shaking his head)
			Of course it smells like it!  That's
			why sailors take to the sea!

	They all laugh.  Alonso looks up at COLUMBUS standing on
	the poop deck, scrutinizing the horizon, waiting for the
	land to appear.

					ALONSO
			And why does this one take to the
			sea?  Nobody knows.  Never says a
			word...

	MENDEZ has sensed the danger of this lack of respect.  He
	approaches them.

					MENDEZ
			To your post!  At once!

	They split in silence.


	EXT.  SANTA MARIA - DECK - NIGHT

	The SHIP is plowing on, pushed by a hot wind -- SAILORS
	sleep on deck.

	The SHIP'S BOY is singing to himself.  Despite his hair
	lip he has a pure, melancholy voice...

	COLUMBUS, leaning over the prow rail, staring ahead, hears
	it carry over the darkness.


	EXT.  SANTA MARIA - DECK - DAY

	CLOSE UP ON AN HOUR-GLASS, nearly through its time.

	The SHIP'S BOY throws an "ampoulette" over board.  We
	follow the bulb attached to a rope, passing the full
	length of the hull.  As it reaches the poop deck, another
	SAILOR shouts "MARK".  A very primitive system of
	calculation for distance and speed.

	Sitting near the SHIP'S BOY, COLUMBUS is making entries in
	a log-book, watching the hourglass.

					SHIP'S BOY
			Mark.  Twenty nine, Sir!

	THE HOUR-GLASS runs out.  COLUMBUS converts the mark into
	a daily average for distance and speed.

					COLUMBUS
			Six hundred and twenty nine.

	THE SHIP'S BOY cups his hands to his mouth to shout.

									CUT TO:

	EXT.  PINTA - DAY

	PINZON, his OFFICERS beside him, looks across at the SANTA
	MARIA.

					SHIP'S BOY
			Six hundred and twenty nine!

	AN OFFICER turns to PINZON to repeat the message.

					OFFICER
			Six hundred and twenty nine, Sir!

	PINZON does not seem too pleased.

					PINZON
			I heard.

	THE OFFICER examines his own calculations.

					OFFICER
			Captain, I don't understand.

					PINZON
			I think I do.

	He goes back to his cabin.

									CUT TO:

	EXT.  SHIPS - SARGASSO SEA - DAY

	ABSOLUTE STILLNESS.  A FURNACE.  The three ships like
	dots, on what seems to be a prairie of weed.

	The caravels are being towed by three rowing boats.

	CLOSE ON THE MEN, rowing, drenched with sweat.

	FROM THE PROW, COLUMBUS is staring at the horizon.

	ALONSO pulling at his oars stares at COLUMBUS' distant
	figure with hate and resentment.

	ALONSO suddenly ships his oars, throwing the whole boat
	into disarray.  Chaos.

	Total silence.  MENDEZ and ALONSO stare at each other.

					MENDEZ
			Continue rowing!

					ALONSO
			To where?

	ALONSO defiantly stares at MENDEZ.  He then starts to beat
	a rhythm on the hull with his fist, followed by the
	others.  In the two other boats, the MEN begin to follow
	suit, beating a rhythm of protest on the hulls.

	MENDEZ looks up to COLUMBUS, in panic.

	ON BOARD PINZON'S SHIP, an OFFICER cups his hands to his
	mouth.

					OFFICER
			Captain Pinzon requests permission
			to board.

									CUT TO:

	EXT.  SANTA MARIA - DAY

					COLUMBUS
			Granted.


	INT.  COLUMBUS' CABIN - DAY

	PINZON enters.  He looks furious.

					PINZON
			You lied!  You cheated!  We're way
			past 750 leagues!

					COLUMBUS
				(calmly)
			Six days ago, yes.

					PINZON
			You must be mad...!

					COLUMBUS
			We have to keep the hopes of these
			men alive!

					PINZON
			We're on the verge of a mutiny,
			Colon!

					COLUMBUS
			You think I don't know that?

					PINZON
			We're lost!

					COLUMBUS
			The land is there.  I know it!

					PINZON
			You don't know anything!  Listen
			Colon, these are my ships, right?
			So I'm telling you we're turning
			back!

					COLUMBUS
			And then what?  Half of the water
			has gone, the rest is nearly putrid!
			You know that!

					PINZON
				(apoplectic)
			Jesus Maria!  I should have never
			listened to you!

					COLUMBUS
			You never did.  You did all the
			talking for both of us, remember?

					PINZON
			You bloody...

					COLUMBUS
			Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now
			is go forward!  Think about that!

					PINZON
			You tell that to them!

					COLUMBUS
			You're right.  Let the men decide.

	COLUMBUS moves to the door.  As an afterthought, he takes
	his scarlet-embroidered jacket from a hook.


	EXT.  SANTA MARIA - DECK - DAY

	Most of the men are now back on board.

	They go silent as COLUMBUS appears.  He walks slowly over
	to them.  All, including ALONSO, are surly, threatening...

					COLUMBUS
			Who gave you the order to come on
			board?

	He looks up and down the line, finishing on ALONSO.  They
	stare at one another.

					ALONSO
			God doesn't want us to cross the
			ocean...!  This voyage is cursed!

	Some of the MEN murmur their agreement.

					COLUMBUS
			Cursed?

					ALONSO
			We set sail for greed.  God has
			abandoned us.  The voyage is cursed.
			There are signs...

	ALONSO glances towards the SHIP'S BOY, with his hair lip.
	The BOY lowers his eyes.  COLUMBUS moves towards him,
	pulls him forward, stands him in front of ALONSO.

					COLUMBUS
			This boy has the voice of an angel.
			What comes out of his mouth is
			blessed, Alonso.  What comes out of
			your is evil.

	Some of the men laugh at this statement.  ALONSO is ill at
	ease.  COLUMBUS pauses, looks around at all the MEN.

					COLUMBUS
			Listen to me!  Every man is afraid
			who does something for the first
			time.  But those who overcome their
			fears, will find their rewards.  I
			do not know if it is God's will that
			we cross this ocean -- but I am
			certain it is the devil who puts
			fears into our hearts...

	The MEN are listening.  We sense a subtle change of
	mood...

					COLUMBUS
			This jacket to the first man who
			sights land!  I want a man up that
			mast day and night.

	COLUMBUS points at the SHIP'S BOY.

					COLUMBUS
			You start first.

	The SHIP'S BOY rushes up the mast.  As he climbs, the
	mainsail starts to fill with wind.  The deck begins to
	move under their feet.

	This movement under their feet seems to imperceptibly
	erase the fears and the angers.

					MENDEZ
			Alonso!  Jaime!  Don't let this wind
			escape us.

	CRIES from the other ships, as the sails snap taut,
	filling with wind.  MEN rush to their posts.  PINZON
	stares at COLUMBUS, shaking his head in disbelief.

					PINZON
				(murmuring)
			You lucky bastard...

	COLUMBUS walks away to his cabin, then turning back to
	PINZON.

					COLUMBUS
			Pinzon, the more I sail, the luckier
			I get.

	Turning abruptly, he enters his cabin.


	EXT.  SANTA MARIA - PROW - MISTY NIGHT

	COLUMBUS is seated, isolated at the prow, wrapped in his
	cape, struggling against the sleep.  MENDEZ approaches him
	with a bowl of soup.

					MENDEZ
			Shall I take my turn?

	COLUMBUS shakes his head no, and starts drinking from the
	bowl.

									CUT TO:

	COLUMBUS' head nods lower and lower to his chest.  He is
	asleep.  We become aware of a sharp buzzing sound.  It
	becomes louder as we move closer to COLUMBUS' face.

	A mosquito lands on his temple.  COLUMBUS reflexively
	slaps it.  He wakes up, and looks at his fingers -- a spot
	of blood, a crushed mosquito.  He stares at it for a
	moment.  Then slowly gets to his feet.


	EXT.  SANTA MARIA - DECK - NIGHT

	In the luminous moonlight, COLUMBUS is standing, staring
	up at thousands of insects that wheel around the mast
	lantern.  We hear the flutter of their wings and see the
	bats as they swoop and dive in a feeding frenzy.

	COLUMBUS turns, stares into the darkness, desperate to see
	the land that must be close.

	He kneels by MENDEZ, wrapped in a blanket.  He touches his
	shoulder.

					COLUMBUS
				(murmuring)
			Mendez!  Mendez!

	MENDEZ grimaces, and opens one eye.

					COLUMBUS
			Land...

									CUT TO:

	EXT.  SHIP - DAWN   

	An opaque dawn.  COLUMBUS, riveted, staring forward as if
	to pierce the mist.  The entire crew are clinging to the
	rail, and standing on the shrouds.

	Suddenly, the SHIP BOY'S voice cracking with emotion.

					SHIP'S BOY
			TIERRA...!  TIERRA!

	COLUMBUS strains his eyes; he still can not see anything.

	The entire CREW stand and stare, silent, holding their
	breath.

	As the sun begins to rise, the fog dissipates -- slowly,
	exquisitely, revealing a single palm, so close it seems
	almost as though they could touch it.  Then a white slash
	of beach.

	Near COLUMBUS, a SAILOR falls to his knees and burst into
	tears.  Others laugh with joy.  COLUMBUS watches this
	vision in disbelief, his mouth open as if it were
	difficult for him to breathe.  Tears come to his eyes.  He
	closes them.  Then opens them again.  The land is there --
	a green paradise.

	On screen the words:  OCTOBER 12, 1942.  GUANAHAN ISLAND


	EXT.  BOATS - DAY

	Three row boats plunging through the surf towards the
	beach.  COLUMBUS stands in the prow of the first boat.
	MENDEZ is in the second.  PINZON the third.  They stare
	entranced at the lushness of the foliage, and the blue
	clarity of the water...

	As the first boat beaches, COLUMBUS leaps out and wades
	ashore.  Behind him the rest of the landing party splash
	through the sun-dazzled water, carrying the banner of
	Castille and Aragon.


	EXT.  BEACH - DAY

	They stand on the beach, almost in a dream.  There is
	silence.  The ROYAL NOTARY, ludicrously overdressed, now
	wet through, stumbles over to COLUMBUS and holds out his
	contract and a pen.  COLUMBUS scrawls his name.

	The MEN stare at him, filled not only with new respect,
	but with something amounting to awe.

	COLUMBUS turns to them, tries to speak.

					COLUMBUS
			By the... by the Grace of... God...

	He swallows.  Tears have sprung to his eyes.  He is so
	moved he cannot continue.  Coming to his rescue -- THE
	SHIP'S BOY starts to roll the drum.  He then stops.

					COLUMBUS
				(pulling himself
				together)
			In the name of their Gracious
			Majesties of Castille and Aragon,
			and by all the powers vested in me,
			I claim this island and name it San
			Salvador.

	The MEN cheer as the flags are rammed into the sand,
	flapping in the wind.

	COLUMBUS starts to walk towards the jungle, and in silence
	the rest follow.


	EXT.  JUNGLE - DAY

	Immediately they are met by an incredible wall of SOUND!
	The jungle is filled with NOISE.  The impossibly-loud
	CRIES of EXOTIC BIRDS, the CHATTERING of MONKEYS.  The
	SPANIARDS are overwhelmed.

	They move forward.  Rays of sunlight pierce through the
	high canopy of leaves, like the roof of a magnificent
	cathedral.  The sounds and smells intoxicate their senses.
	They are filled with wonder.

	Then PINZON stops.  He has seen something.  Another stops,
	then a third, staring ahead of them...

					MENDEZ
				(whispering
				urgently)
			Arquebuses!

	Several of them raise their weapons to their shoulders,
	pointing them into the jungle.

	From COLUMBUS' POV we slowly scan the face of the thick
	jungle ahead.  For a moment we don't see anything -- and
	then, with a shock, we see the first INDIAN.  Naked,
	painted like an idol, carrying a hunting lance.

	As if they had materialized from nowhere:  the rest of the
	HUNTING PARTY, with their bows and spears.  Silent.
	Watchful.  They stare back at us.

	The SPANIARDS nervously finger their weapons.

	COLUMBUS slowly lifts his hand into the air:  a clear
	signal not to fire.  Then, removing his sword, he drops it
	on the ground, and starts to walk forward, fixing his gaze
	upon the first INDIAN he saw.

					PINZON
				(warningly)
			Colon!

	COLUMBUS ignores him, even though some of the INDIANS have
	raised their weapons.  He stops in the no-man's land
	between them.  The INDIANS don't move -- but something
	excites them.

	The SHIP'S BOY, wearing COLUMBUS' embroidered jacket and
	the drum, has followed COLUMBUS and now stands close to
	him.  He is the cause of their interest.  COLUMBUS puts
	his arm around the BOY, and this gesture of affection
	seems to put the INDIANS at their ease.  They start
	talking and pointing.  They come forward slowly, start to
	tentatively touch the BOY'S jacket.  Then, now laughing,
	they touch COLUMBUS, pulling at his beard.  COLUMBUS
	laughs too.

	Sensing their innocence, the rest of the MEN lower their
	weapons.  Some of them laugh.

	An apparition:  a beautiful young INDIAN GIRL, totally
	naked, walks out of the jungle.

	She is pregnant and holds a child.  We begin to hear
	Indian music, played on a flute.

									CUT TO:

	EXT.  INDIAN VILLAGE - DAY

	A large post is lifted from the ground by two SPANIARDS
	pulling on ropes.  The post is fixed into position -- and
	then we see that it is a large wooden cross... The INDIAN
	VILLAGERS watch the ceremony with some interest and
	amusement.

	COLUMBUS looks over at the men and gestures at the
	INDIANS.

					COLUMBUS
			We have come here in peace, and we
			will behave with honor.  They are
			not savages and neither will you be.
			Treat these people as you would your
			own wives and your own children.
			Neither are you free to take what
			you will; for a seashell you give a
			bandana.  You will respect their
			beliefs.  Pillage will be punished
			by the whip.  Rape by the sword.


	EXT.  VILLAGE - SUNSET

	The smoke from fires.  Laughter.  Music playing.  The
	INDIANS have prepared food for the SPANIARDS, who are
	drinking and enjoying themselves in this strange world.

	COLUMBUS sits with MENDEZ, PINZON, the INDIAN CHIEF,
	ELDERS OF THE VILLAGE.  Other INDIANS stand around,
	smiling, curious.

	The INDIANS talk among themselves.  The ELDERS smoke
	primitive cigars -- and offer them, with good humor, to
	their guests.  The SPANIARDS cough and choke at first...
	and laugh.  In return, they offer the INDIANS wine...

	Dogs roam around the campfires.  The WOMEN openly suckle
	their babies.  The MEN are entranced.

	PINZON draws out attention, for the first time, to a small
	gold ornament on the nose of one of the INDIANS.  He
	points to it, indicates his interest in it.

					PINZON
			Gold...!  Gold!

	The INDIANS says the word in his own language, laughing.
	We see that some of the other INDIANS also have small gold
	ornaments.

	PINZON repeats the INDIAN word for gold.  The INDIAN
	removes the ornament from his nose, gives it to PINZON,
	who indicates that he wants to have it.  The INDIAN nods
	-- but points to PINZON'S dagger, indicating that he wants
	it in return.  PINZON shakes his head, stops the INDIAN
	from taking it.

					COLUMBUS
				(to Pinzon)
			Give it to him!

	PINZON looks at him, about to argue -- but COLUMBUS
	insists.  PINZON takes out the dagger and offers it to the
	INDIAN.

					PINZON
				(irritated)
			By God!  That's the worst trade of
			my life!

	His friends laugh.  Innocently, the INDIAN has taken it by
	the blade.  He yelps, looks down at the blood welling
	up... A moment of tension... Then MENDEZ laughs at his
	clumsiness, and the ELDERS laugh too... and the INDIAN
	laughs.

	Just outside this circle, we see the first INDIAN we saw,
	squatting on his haunches, watching.  This is UTAPAN.


	INT.  TENT - DAWN

	The first light outside -- the strange, wonderful sounds
	of the jungle all around.  COLUMBUS writes in his journal.

					COLUMBUS (V.O.)
			October 21st, 1492.  I think we have
			returned to Eden.  Surely this is
			how the world once was, before the
			beginning of time.  I believe no man
			will ever see this land again as we
			do, for the first time...

	He looks up.  UTAPAN is squatting in the doorway of the
	hut.  He's been there all night.  COLUMBUS takes more ink
	on his quill and begins to sketch UTAPAN'S face in the
	margin of his log-book.  He draws well.

	He gets up and walks over to UTAPAN and shows him the
	drawing.  It's an electrifying moment.  UTAPAN is shocked
	and amazed.  At first he is rather frightened of his own
	image... Then he is happy, and laughs... and COLUMBUS
	laughs with him and puts a hand on his shoulder in a
	gesture of friendship.

	UTAPAN gets up, and indicates that he too has something he
	wishes to offer.


	EXT.  JUNGLE - MORNING

	UTAPAN expertly scampering through the jungle.  COLUMBUS
	follows him.

	UTAPAN orders COLUMBUS to sit.  COLUMBUS obeys.  UTAPAN
	looks up at the tops of the trees.  The sun is rising, and
	filters through the foliage.  As if the time had come,
	UTAPAN stands up, and COLUMBUS does the same.

	A gap in the dense vegetation.  Something is glittering.
	Gold.  A mass of gold.  As they approach, COLUMBUS
	discovers --

	A large pool of fresh water.  The morning sunlight has
	turned the water into liquid gold.  The surface ripples
	with the breeze.  UTAPAN smiles.  It the stranger
	satisfied?  Isn't this what he came for?

	COLUMBUS plunges into the pool.  As he emerges, he fills
	his palms with liquid gold.

									DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT.  RIVER - DAY

	Wide shot -- A flotilla of canoes are going upstream.

	INDIANS AND SPANIARDS are traveling together in the
	canoes.  UTAPAN leads the expedition in COLUMBUS' craft.
	THE SHIP BOY'S cranium is shaved like UTAPAN'S, and we
	notice that some other crew members are beardless, some
	even wearing tribal patterns.


	EXT.  RIVERSIDE - DAY

	INDIAN VILLAGERS confronting the SPANIARDS, UTAPAN talks
	to an ELDER MAN, watched by COLUMBUS, MENDEZ and PINZON.

	UTAPAN repeats several times the word for GOLD, showing
	some artifacts.  The OLD INDIAN shakes his head no,
	indicating another distant place.

					OLD INDIAN
			Cuba!  Cuba!

	THE OLD MAN nods, points into the distance, chatters away
	to UTAPAN.

					UTAPAN
			Say not here!  Cuba!

					COLUMBUS
			What is it?  A tribe?  An island?

					UTAPAN
			Island.  Far.


	EXT.  SANTA MARIA - DECK - DAY

	Standing at the prow of the ship, his long dark hair
	floating in the wind, UTAPAN rejoicing at the speed.


	EXT.  THICK JUNGLE - CUBA - DAY

	Led by UTAPAN, the SPANIARDS hack their way through thick
	jungle.  It's hard work.  The MEN sweat.  This is
	inhospitable terrain.  Even the noises of the jungle seem
	somehow more sinister...

									CUT TO:

	RESTING PLACE - ALONSO is seated under a tree.  He takes
	off his boot, and grabs his foot, examining the blisters
	on his toes.  As he puts his foot back into the boot, he
	jumps screaming in pain.

	ALONSO yelps, grasping his ankle.

	CLOSE ON a snake sliding out of the empty boot.

	While his COMPANIONS rush to him, a SAILOR spots the
	snake, and decapitates it with his sword.  UTAPAN glances
	at the dead snake.  He then goes and kneels -- he sees the
	bite on ALONSO'S ankle.

					COLUMBUS
			Help him!

	ALONSO is quiet and silent.  His eyes are looking around
	at his companions.  UTAPAN shakes his head.  There is
	nothing he can do.

	ALONSO is now leaning back, supported by one of his
	friends.  He has grabbed the forearm of a SAILOR.  His
	look is already far away.  His companion shouts at UTAPAN.

					SAILOR
			Do something!  Help him!

					UTAPAN
			He dead.

	ALONSO starts convulsing.  HIS FRIENDS hold him, desperate
	in their helplessness.  Others simply move away,
	horrified.  One of them cries.


	EXT.  RIVER - DAY

	Standing in the stream up to his thighs, A SPANIARD (a
	gold expert) examines some stones.  He then looks up at
	COLUMBUS and PINZON and just throws the stones back into
	the water without a word.

	The group of SPANIARDS are resting, exhausted by the
	humidity.  Some are drinking from the river, others soak
	bandanas, and tie them around their necks...

	One after another, they stand up slowly -- they look
	discouraged, tired, and beaten.


	EXT.  MOUNTAINOUS JUNGLE - DAY

	UTAPAN and the SPANIARDS are trekking in the hills.  Fully
	armed, they are now suffering intensely from the heat and
	the vicious insect bites.

	COLUMBUS doggedly keeps up with UTAPAN, who tirelessly
	trots forward.

	Finally, COLUMBUS turns around and sees... nobody.  He
	calls out to UTAPAN.

					COLUMBUS
			Utapan!  Wait!

	UTAPAN stops obediently, and rushes back to COLUMBUS with
	comical energy.

	On their way back, they find one SOLDIER sitting, leaning
	against a tree.  He has removed his helmet.  His hair
	sticking to his forehead.

	As COLUMBUS and UTAPAN walk back, they find another
	SAILOR, then another, then the whole group gathered around
	PINZON.  Ashen, he burns with fever.  He attempts a smile.

					PINZON
			Well... You'll have to continue
			without me...

	COLUMBUS looks around him -- what he sees:  exhausted men
	and jungle, as far as one can see.

					COLUMBUS
			No.  It's enough.  What would you
			say to a drop of Jerez, Pinzon?

	PINZON grins.

					PINZON
			And a nice slice of Santa Fe lamb!
			I'd sell my soul for it.
				(to his officer)
			Help me up.  I've got to piss, gold.

	They all laugh as the OFFICER helps PINZON to his feet.

	PINZON walks a few yards into the jungle -- starts to
	urinate.  It is red.  Suddenly dizzy, he reels and
	collapses.


	EXT.  JUNGLE - DAY

	A line of SPANIARDS and INDIANS threading their way down a
	mountainside.  PINZON is being carried on a makeshift
	stretcher.  His eyes are closed, his face thick with
	sweat.

	They enter a village, to the surprise of the INDIANS.
	UTAPAN once again at the front as the ambassador.


	INT.  HUT - NIGHT

	A INDIAN SHAMAN is forcing a milky fluid into PINZON'S
	mouth.  COLUMBUS attempts a gesture to prevent him.  But
	UTAPAN stops him.

					UTAPAN
			He cures.

	COLUMBUS nods -- he obviously trusts UTAPAN.


	INT.  CHIEF GUARIONEX'S HUT - NIGHT

	In the half-light, figures wreathed in smoke -- COLUMBUS,
	MENDEZ and UTAPAN watch the CHIEF GUARIONEX putting a
	Spanish helmet on his head.  The helmet is too big, almost
	covering his eyes.  The ELDERS appraise the gift with
	solemn wonder.

	In return, GUARIONEX hands COLUMBUS a parcel made of
	leaves.  COLUMBUS unwraps them.  Inside:  a GOLD grimacing
	mask.  The first real piece of gold.  COLUMBUS is unable
	to conceal his excitement at this first real evidence of
	the metal.

	He waits for the CHIEF to speak, but the CHIEF only looks
	at him.  On the ground, we see other presents offered by
	the SPANIARDS -- trinkets, and necklaces...

					UTAPAN
				(to Columbus)
			You come!  You speak first!

					COLUMBUS
			Tell the Chief we thank him.

					UTAPAN
			Chief knows.

					COLUMBUS
			Tell him his country is very
			beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving
			men here -- to build a fort.

	UTAPAN translates.

					COLUMBUS
			Tell him we will return very soon.
			Many of us.

	UTAPAN translates.  The CHIEF GUARIONEX asks a simple
	question.

					UTAPAN
			Chief says -- how many?

					COLUMBUS
			Thousands.

					UTAPAN
			Why?

	COLUMBUS doesn't seem to understand the question.  For the
	first time he seems to be caught short.

					COLUMBUS
			To bring the word of God.

					UTAPAN
			Chief says -- he has a God.

					COLUMBUS
				(pursuing)
			... and also to bring medicine.

					UTAPAN
			Chief says...

					COLUMBUS
				(interrupting)
			He has medicine.
				(pause)
			Tell him we admire his people.

	UTAPAN translates.

					UTAPAN
			Chief says he knows you like his...
				(searches for the
				word)
			Women...

	And the CHIEF gets up, awards COLUMBUS with a smile, and
	walks out of the hut, the ELDERS following, leaving
	COLUMBUS alone.

					COLUMBUS
				(with a little
				smile)
			That's a beginning...


	EXT.  SHORE - DAY

	Watched from the shore by the INDIANS and by about forty
	of the SPANIARDS, who are staying behind, the boats pull
	out towards the two remaining ships.

	PINZON is laid out in the bottom of the boat.  COLUMBUS,
	UTAPAN, and four other INDIANS are in the same boat.

					COLUMBUS (V.O.)
			March 1493... Thirty nine of my men
			volunteered to stay behind.  God
			willing we will be back in less than
			a year...

	The boats continue to pull away, the figures on the shore
	growing smaller.

									CUT TO:

	EXT.  COLUMBUS' CABIN - NIGHT

	CLOSE ON:  a golden mask... the lamp in the cabin swings
	violently back and forth, creating strange shadows, as if
	the mask was alive... COLUMBUS is writing with difficulty
	in his log-book.

					COLUMBUS (V.O.)
			... Several men are ill.  We did not
			find signs of civilization.  No
			cities, no temples... Nothing that
			resembles Marco Polo's descriptions.
			My ships are not filled with the
			spices and the gold that Spain was
			hoping for.  But this land
			intoxicates the senses like the
			strongest of perfumes... And all I
			can think of, is to return to these
			untamed lands...

	Suddenly the cabin seems to lurch over.  Things fall from
	the table, smashing on the floor... COLUMBUS nearly falls.


	EXT.  SEA - NIGHT

	We are in the middle of a violent storm -- of terrifying
	proportions.  The thunder is deafening.  Light irradiates
	the darkness.  We see the two caravels, dwarfed by the
	massive seas.


	EXT.  DECK - NIGHT

	Five MEN are struggling to lash down the tiller.  The deck
	jumps and rolls.  It rises five meters into the air then
	falls into space and hits the water with a terrible crack.
	Waves sweep over the decks.  We hear desperate cries for
	mercy from the terrified crew, loud enough to be heard
	above the storm.

	COLUMBUS and MENDEZ are crawling towards the mast, along a
	lifeline.

					COLUMBUS
				(screaming to the
				sailors)
			Get below!  All of you!  Go!

	The MEN start to scramble below decks.

					COLUMBUS
				(to Mendez)
			Stay with me!

	The ship rolls again.  COLUMBUS and MENDEZ crawl towards
	the mast.  Another gigantic wave crashes over them, tons
	of water falling like cement.  They reach the mast.  The
	wood groans.

					COLUMBUS
			We may have to cut it!

	MENDEZ nods... COLUMBUS grabs some rope.  The ship rises
	into the air again, crashes down, the deck disappearing
	beneath them for a moment.

					COLUMBUS
				(screaming out)
			I'll stay here -- to decide if we
			cut it.  Help me!

	With MENDEZ'S help, COLUMBUS is tied to the mast:  one
	rope under his arms, the other around his waist.  MENDEZ
	hands him a horn.

					COLUMBUS
				(screaming)
			Now go!

	MENDEZ seems to hesitate.  COLUMBUS screams at him again.

					COLUMBUS
			I said -- below deck, Mendez!

	MENDEZ crawls away.

	Another huge wave washes over COLUMBUS.  He emerges,
	almost suffocated.  The storm rages, its eerie light
	making it seem at times like bright daylight.  But as the
	lightning flashes, COLUMBUS begins to count:

					COLUMBUS
			One... two... three... four...

	There's an enormous thunderclap on "four" -- it indicates
	how close they are to the eye of the storm.

	The ship keels over again, dropping down and down, seeming
	never to rise... COLUMBUS lifts his head to the heavens,
	screams out:

					COLUMBUS
			Damn you!

	As if in answer, another flash of lightning that
	illuminates the sky and the sea.  COLUMBUS starts counting
	again.

					COLUMBUS
			One... two... three... four...
			five...

	Another terrible clap of thunder on "five" -- COLUMBUS
	starts laughing, knowing the storm is moving on.

	Then, in the strange light, something seems to move
	through the air towards him; it looks like some kind of
	projectile, a craft, with a trail of vapor.

	COLUMBUS stares up at it... amazed.  We start to hear the
	"Te Deum", majestic and heavenly.

									CUT TO:

	INT.  CATHEDRAL OF CORDOBA - SPAIN - DAY

	COLUMBUS looks up at the vast roof, to see an incense
	burner, swinging, gliding swiftly across the ceiling,
	trailing a think vapor of incense.

	A magnificent "Te Deum" is being sung -- in honor of
	COLUMBUS' achievements and return.  The whole cathedral is
	packed with nobles and dignitaries in their gorgeous
	robes.

	BEATRIX, FERNANDO and DIEGO are staring in fascination at
	COLUMBUS' triumph -- somewhat separated by the grandeur of
	this occasion.  COLUMBUS passes by, walking proudly down
	the long central alley, beside KING FERDINAND and QUEEN
	ISABEL and other GRANDEES.  He turns to his family,
	keeping his eyes on BEATRIX until she is out of his
	vision.

	The procession is followed by UTAPAN, and other INDIANS in
	tribal regalia...

	As they move through the crowds, all eyes are upon
	COLUMBUS.

									CUT TO:

	INT.  ROOM - SEVILLE (PINZON'S DEATH) - DAY

	In a simple room, a PRIEST finishes giving the Last Rites
	and a sheet is pulled over the head of MARTIN PINZON.  His
	WIFE and CHILDREN weep at the bedside.

									CUT TO:

	INT.  CATHEDRAL - DAY

	A stool passes from hands to hands.  It is placed at the
	Queen and King's side.  COLUMBUS sits on it -- a supreme
	privilege.

	To one side sit AROJAZ and SANCHEZ.  AROJAZ leans over to
	whisper to him.

					AROJAZ
			It won't be easy to get rid of your
			prophet now, Don Sanchez.

					SANCHEZ
				(whispering)
			On the contrary, Your Eminence.  It
			seems to me the man is preparing his
			own cross.


	INT.  ALCAZAR'S PALACE IN SEVILLE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

	CLOSE ON:  the face of a young, SPANISH NOBLEMAN, ADRIAN
	DE MOXICA.  Hesitantly, he brings a lighted cigar to his
	lips -- then pauses.

	We discover other people around the magnificent candle-lit
	table.  NOBLE MEN and NOBLE WOMEN.  SANCHEZ.  COLUMBUS.
	QUEEN ISABEL.

	COLUMBUS takes the cigar from MOXICA.  The rest watch him
	with rapt curiosity.  COLUMBUS inhales deeply then, to
	their astonishment, blows out the smoke through his nose.

					COLUMBUS
			You must not inhale, but simply
			allow the palate to enjoy the flavor
			of the Tobacco...

	He hands the cigar back to MOXICA.  With a casual air,
	MOXICA himself inhales deeply -- almost chokes to death.
	He gulps down a glass of wine... much to the amusement of
	the others.

					MOXICA
				(deeply embarrassed)
			And you say this is an Indian vice?
			By God!  I don't see any kind of
			pleasure that would make this a sin.

					COLUMBUS
			The Indians have no such word, Don
			Moxica.

					ISABEL
			Do they have such thoughts?

					COLUMBUS
			They come and go as naked as the day
			God created them...

	ISABEL blushes slightly.

					COLUMBUS
			They don't see sin in their
			nakedness.  They live according to
			nature, in a never ending summer.
			The islands are covered with trees,
			filled with blossoms and fruits.
			And...

					SANCHEZ
				(interrupting)
			Forgive me, Don Colon.  But what
			about gold?

	COLUMBUS nods, turns and whispers something to a SERVANT
	standing just behind his chair.  The SERVANT goes to open
	the door -- and in comes UTAPAN, dressed as a tribesman,
	carrying a casket.  The WOMEN around the table fan
	themselves furiously at the sight.  UTAPAN puts the casket
	down in front of the QUEEN, and steps back.

					COLUMBUS
			These are gifts for Your Majesty.

	ISABEL opens the casket, revealing the gleam of gold
	inside.  She takes out some of the little golden
	ornaments... a bracelet and then the mask.

	She holds it, somehow moved by its crude beauty.

	ISABEL raises the mask to her face, looking across at
	COLUMBUS.

	The image is somehow powerful enough to reduce even the
	ARISTOCRATS to silence.  She speaks from behind the mask.

					ISABEL
			We are more than gratified.

	The guests laugh obsequiously.  COLUMBUS bows a little --
	looks up and meets the eyes of SANCHEZ, who is staring at
	him, coldly.


	INT.  ROTUNDA - DAY

	A SWORD MASTER advances towards us with determination, his
	sword flashing.  He is fighting an adversary we do not
	see, and comments his movements.

					MASTER
			Si!  Si!  Muy bien!  Excellente!
			(Yes!  Yes!  Good!  Excellent!)

	We discover the SWORD MASTER is fencing with COLUMBUS.  A
	dozen duellists are practicing in the magnificent rotunda,
	surrounded with a two-tiered colonnade.

	Out of breath, COLUMBUS stops the exercise, and removes
	his protective canvas padding.  He bows at his teacher,
	who salutes him in return.

	COLUMBUS walks to a tressel laden with food and beverages.
	SANCHEZ, in a fencing outfit and boots, is having a glass
	of wine.  Upon seeing COLUMBUS approaching, he hands him a
	glass.

					SANCHEZ
			You defend yourself admirably...

					COLUMBUS
			... for a commoner?

	SANCHEZ laughs and raises his glass.

					SANCHEZ
			To your second expedition.

	They drink.  A short, somewhat ugly man, with some kind of
	imposing energy, approach them.

					SANCHEZ
			Don Colon -- Don Alonso de
			Bobadilla.  A man who knows our
			laws.

	BOBADILLA bows.

					BOBADILLA
			I understand that you will soon be
			appointing Governors for the
			islands?  Is it not so?

					COLUMBUS
			Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those
			positions have already been taken.

					BOBADILLA
				(disappointed)
			May I ask by whom?

					COLUMBUS
			Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.

	SANCHEZ looks at him in surprise.  BOBADILLA reddens.

					BOBADILLA
			I trust they are men of quality.

	BOBADILLA glances at SANCHEZ.

					COLUMBUS
			But we do have a lack of notaries.
			You should contact my
			administration.

					SANCHEZ
				(amused)
			Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my
			Dear Don Cristobal.

					COLUMBUS
			Good!  We are also in need of
			judges.  Except there are no
			thieves!

	A grin disfigures the face of BOBADILLA.

					BOBADILLA
				(to Sanchez)
			I see I was mistaken.  Don Colon
			has no need for my services...

	And he walks off.  SANCHEZ fills his mouth with a slice of
	ham.

					SANCHEZ
				(amused)
			You seem to have a special talent
			for making friends.

					COLUMBUS
			What...?  Do I have so many already?

					SANCHEZ
				(seriously)
			To rise so high, in so short a time,
			is a dangerous occupation.
				(kindly)
			A little hypocrisy goes a long way.


	INT.  ROOM - ADMINISTRATION - DAY

	COLUMBUS with two MEN:  the oldest, around thirty, is a
	strong-looking man.  The youngest, no more than twenty
	five, is thin and fit.  There is obvious tension in the
	room.  These are BARTOLOME and GIACOMO COLON, COLUMBUS'
	brothers.  BARTOLOME is angry, and GIACOMO thoughtful.

					BARTOLOME
			You might have given us a choice!

					GIACOMO
			Bartolome is stronger, more capable
			than I will ever be...

					COLUMBUS
			I need both of you.  What are you
			afraid of?  We are living what we
			always dreamt of.

					GIACOMO
			You know I never shared those dreams
			with you.

					COLUMBUS
			Are you saying you refuse to help?

	COLUMBUS looks at them with such pained surprise...

					BARTOLOME
				(amused)
			You bastard... you always had your
			own way...

					COLUMBUS
			Let me show you something.

	He opens the door to a terrace.

									CUT TO:

	EXT.  GALLERY - DAY

	The large gallery courtyard is crowded with PEOPLE --
	applicants for the voyage.  As COLUMBUS appears, they all
	press forward, calling out his name, trying to get his
	attention, touching his sleeves as if he were a saint.
	They crowd around COLUMBUS and his BROTHERS.  COLUMBUS
	nods, murmurs vaguely, here and there...

					COLUMBUS
			Of course... Of course... We'll see
			to it... Yes... Thank you... Soon...
			Soon...

	Fighting their way through, the BOTHERS press their way,
	reaching the other side of the gallery.  We get glimpses
	of the incredible activity down below.  ADMINISTRATORS,
	MILITARIES, MERCHANTS are busy around tressels covered
	with documents, plans, maps... preparing the second
	expedition.

	COLUMBUS puts his arms around them.

					COLUMBUS
				(indicating the
				applicants)
			Now -- you tell me.  Who can I
			trust?
				(almost amused)
			We're brothers!  We must be a House.
			A bloodline!  In this country one
			can't exist alone!  I need you...!
			Both of you!

	He walks then to the balustrade.  The cries from the
	courtyard down below subside... some of the applicants
	begin to look up, aware of his presence.

					SOLDIER
			Where is the Admiral?  Has anyone
			seen the Admiral?

	Everybody laughs.

					COLUMBUS
			He is here!  What is it?

	He leans over the balcony.  In the middle of the
	overcrowded courtyard, the SOLDIER who was shouting is
	brandishing a document.

					MAN
			Admiral!  The horses have arrived.

					COLUMBUS
			I know.  I saw them!  Who did we
			hire today?

	ANOTHER ASSISTANT raises his eyes.

					ASSISTANT
			Thirty blacksmiths, twenty eight
			halberdiers, twenty carpenters, a
			hundred farmers, twenty miners...
			and Doctor Chanca, the royal
			surgeon.

					COLUMBUS
			The royal surgeon?  Then we can
			count on royal health!

	The whole courtyard bursts out laughing.


	EXT.  ORANGERY - VICEROY'S HOUSE - DAY

	UTAPAN is lying in his hammock.  FERNANDO turns him over.
	UTAPAN falls to the ground.

	COLUMBUS walks beside BEATRIX.

					COLUMBUS
				(looking at his son)
			He's growing up!

	BEATRIX smiles, nods.  They walk on.

					COLUMBUS
			Beatrix, I want to ask you
			something.

					BEATRIX
				(with a smile)
			You don't usually ask.

					COLUMBUS
				(after a pause)
			I can arrange for the Queen to take
			Fernando and Diego into her service.

	BEATRIX stops in her tracks, looks at him.

					COLUMBUS
			It is a great honor.  We could not
			hope for anything better.

	BEATRIX nods, but bites her lip, and looks back at
	FERNANDO.

					BEATRIX
			For once I wish you weren't right.

	COLUMBUS puts his arm around her waist, pulling her
	closer, they move away.


	EXT.  FAR END OF THE ORANGERY - DAY

	FERNANDO is now swinging expertly in the hammock.  UTAPAN
	is pushing him gently.  He slowly straightens up to watch
	COLUMBUS and BEATRIX disappear, somehow sensing there is a
	dilemma.  FERNANDO noticing UTAPAN'S reaction, turns to
	his parents.  The arbor is empty.  FERNANDO becomes
	pensive.

	We become aware of the rustling of the jungle.

									 SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT.  BEACH AND EDGE OF JUNGLE - DAY

	FIFTEEN HUNDRED MEN spread along the beach, looking
	towards the jungle.  COLUMBUS stands beside his BROTHERS,
	and MENDEZ, and UTAPAN.

	MOXICA, astride a magnificent black horse, prances back
	and forth across the sand.  All are waiting.

	A signal cannon is fired from one of the ships.  Birds
	scatter into the air from the jungle -- but then silence,
	complete and ominous.  COLUMBUS stares into the jungle.
	Nothing.  No one to greet them -- no welcoming party from
	the MEN they left behind.

	COLUMBUS glances at MENDEZ.

	MENDEZ looks at him, but can't answer.

	MOXICA suddenly spurs on his horse, and guides it into the
	trees.  The order is given for the rest to follow, fanning
	out as they do so, weapons at the ready.


	EXT.  CLEARING - JUNGLE - DAY

	Ruins.  The camp has been burned to ashes.  A strange
	sight:  arrows are stuck vertically into the ground, each
	with a moldering tuft of human hair attached to the
	flight.

	In silence the SOLDIERS pick their way through the
	devastation.

	The ground is littered with coconuts.  Kicking one over
	with his shoe, a SOLDIER discovers that his coconut is
	actually a human skull.  The gaping mouth has been filled
	to the brim with gold.

	But of the living, there is no sign.

					MOXICA
			Is this your new world, Don Colon?

	COLUMBUS looks around in dismay.  A YOUNG NOBLEMAN,
	HERNANDO DE GUEVARA, takes out his sword.

					GUEVARA
			These animals should be shown what
			savagery can be!

	Other SPANIARDS join in, repeating this last word.

					NOBLEMAN
			Three heads for every life taken.
			No mercy before God!

					GUEVARA
			No mercy!  Let's find them.

					COLUMBUS
			No Guevara.  There will be no
			revenge.

	Silence.  Everyone looks at COLUMBUS.

					MOXICA
			We lost cousins, friends.  We will
			wash this in blood.

					COLUMBUS
			If you want to keep your head on
			your shoulders, you'll do as I say.

	They are all listening.

					COLUMBUS
			Moxica, I lost friends too... Thirty
			nine brave men who trusted me.

	He walks among them.

					COLUMBUS
			You want a war?  Fine.  We are a
			thousand.  They outnumber us by ten!
			Who will you kill?  Which tribe?

					MOXICA
			We don't need to know.

					COLUMBUS
			We came here to stay!  To build!
			Not to start a crusade.  In this
			forest, there is enough danger to
			sweep us away in days!  So we will
			be brave and swallow our grief.  And
			in the name of those who died, we
			will accomplish what we came for.


	EXT.  INDIAN VILLAGE - DAY

	MOXICA mounted on his magnificent BLACK STALLION canters
	to the edge of the deserted village and enters the
	village.  UTAPAN is terrorized by the absence of anything
	living.

	All we can hear is the breathing of the horse.  The
	animal, an impressive mass of muscle, prances nervously.

	UTAPAN calls out in dialect.

					UTAPAN
			They here.

	Slowly, they begin to appear, one after the other --
	materializing from the jungle.  Shy and scared.

	They stare at this "Centaur" (the HORSE and the HORSEMAN
	seem to be one -- a God).

	To impress them even more, MOXICA makes the beast move
	sideways and backwards, rearing, its front hoofs pawing
	the air.  THE INDIANS retreat in terror, except for one,
	who stands his ground, brandishing his lance.

	UTAPAN encourages the YOUNG WARRIOR to approach the
	centaur.  He places his hand onto the shoulder of the
	animal.  The muscles shudder.  THE INDIAN jumps back
	comically, accompanied by the rest of the tribe.

	Without warning, MOXICA climbs down from the saddle.  More
	INDIANS step back in fear and absolute astonishment.  Now
	more have ventured from the jungle.  The bravest of them
	approach MOXICA, daring to touch him, and the horse,
	retreating then touching until they fill the compound.

	At this moment, COLUMBUS and his SOLDIERS appear all
	around them, pointing their muskets, and their crossbows.
	A moment of tension.

	COLUMBUS walks forward, towards the CHIEF (GUARIONEX) we
	meet before.

					COLUMBUS
			Ask the Chief what happened to my
			men?

	The CHIEF answers.

					UTAPAN
			Another tribe made war on them...
			came by sea... took them away...

					BROTHER BUYL
			God have mercy on their souls...

					MOXICA
			The monkey is lying.

	A pause.  The SPANIARDS shifting, eager for blood.

					MOXICA
			We should kill them, Don Colon.

	UTAPAN looks anxiously at COLUMBUS.

					COLUMBUS
			No...!  you'll do it my way.
				(to Utapan)
			Tell the Chief we will not harm his
			people, even though we have the
			power to do it.

	UTAPAN translates.  The CHIEF listens in silence.

					COLUMBUS
			We will work with his people.  We
			want peace.  Ask the Chief if he
			understands?

					UTAPAN
			He understands.

					COLUMBUS
			Ask him if he will help.

									CUT TO:

	EXT.  WATERMILL AND DAM UNDER CONSTRUCTION - DAY

	It is raining hard.  COLUMBUS is floundering in the mud,
	supervising a mixed work-force of SPANISH and INDIANS.
	They are attempting to raise the huge wheel of a
	watermill.

	Despite COLUMBUS' shouts of encouragement, it's clear the
	wheel is far too heavy and the mud too deep.

	Close by, on horseback, MOXICA watches the scene.
	COLUMBUS, plastered with wet mud, clambers out of the pit
	and approaches him.

					COLUMBUS
			Don Moxica -- we need your horse.

	MOXICA looks down at the sodden, dirty figure.

					COLUMBUS
			We can't raise the wheel without it.

					MOXICA
			My horse doesn't work.

	A beat.  COLUMBUS wipes some mud from his eyes.

					COLUMBUS
			Don Moxica -- we all have to work.

					MOXICA
			You did not hear me, Don Colon.  Not
			my horse.

	He starts to turn away; COLUMBUS grabs hold of the reins.

					COLUMBUS
			Forgive me, Don Moxica.  But it was
			your horse I was talking about.

	A beat.  MOXICA stares down at an equally determined
	COLUMBUS.  Then, in front of everyone, MOXICA has to
	dismount, and suffer the disgrace of it.

					COLUMBUS
			Thank you, Don Moxica.

	COLUMBUS leads the horse away.

									CUT TO:

	EXT.  WATERMILL AND DAM UNDER CONSTRUCTION - DAY

	Harnessed, the horse pulls, with COLUMBUS and the MEN.
	The wheel is raised into position.

									CUT TO:

	EXT.  WATERMILL AND DAM - DAY

	Water thundering into the new canal.  The huge wheel
	begins to turn.  The MEN cheer and congratulate each
	other.  MOXICA looks at his mud-splattered and foaming
	horse, his eyes full of hatred.


	EXT.  CITY OF ISABEL - TWILIGHT

	A wide, high shot of the new "City", dominated by a huge
	wooden cross -- no more than a muddy main street bordered
	by a hundred bamboo and stone shanties, with candles
	burning in the doorways.  A main square with the
	Governor's Mansion, and the foundations of a church.

	In the twilight, COLUMBUS and the other WORKERS returning,
	dirty and tired.


	EXT.  VERANDA OF MOXICA'S HOUSE - TWILIGHT

	MOXICA and GUEVARA sit out on the "veranda", watching the
	MEN return.  MOXICA raises his glass in an ironic salute.

					MOXICA
			To the Governor of the Mosquitoes!

	They laugh.  We see the smoke and flames from a fire.
	Four or five INDIANS are squatting on the earth nearby,
	cooking for them, talking quietly in their own language.

	MOXICA calls out something in their language, and a naked
	YOUNG INDIAN GIRL comes out of the house, bringing more
	wine.  GUEVARA stares at her lasciviously.  MOXICA,
	letting his hand casually brush against her flank, smiles
	at him.

					MOXICA
			Do you want her?

	He turns the GIRL round so that GUEVARA can admire her
	properly.  GUEVARA nods.  MOXICA lets the GIRL go with a
	peremptory order, and she disappears back inside.

	GUEVARA suddenly stands up -- unsteadily -- and sweeping
	his arm round in a broad gesture, says ironically:

					GUEVARA
			To the new world, my friend!  To the
			new world!


	INT.  DINING ROOM - GOVERNOR'S MANSION - NIGHT

	In an already Spanish-colonel dining room, COLUMBUS is
	having dinner with his brothers, BARTOLOME and GIACOMO,
	served by an INDIAN WOMAN -- NIMA.  GIACOMO eats with
	gusto.

					GIACOMO
				(as Nima pours the
				wine)
			Nima's a good cook!

					BARTOLOME
			She's more than that!

	Seeing GIACOMO'S sudden blush and discomfort, as NIMA
	smiles at him, the other BROTHERS laugh.

	To cover his embarrassment, GIACOMO returns to the topic
	of the food.

					GIACOMO
			What is it?

					COLUMBUS
			Eat!  I'll tell you later.

	As he sees BARTOLOME stifling a laugh, GIACOMO pauses.

					GIACOMO
			I'd like to know what I'm eating.

	COLUMBUS eats a mouthful, glances at BARTOLOME.

					COLUMBUS
			Iguana.

	A look of horror crosses GIACOMO'S face; he wretches
	slightly, puts down his fork, and gulps down some wine.
	The BROTHERS laugh again.

					COLUMBUS
			What wrong with it?  The Indians eat
			it!

					GIACOMO
			I'm not an Indian.

					BARTOLOME
			He wishes he were back in the
			seminary.  Priests always eat well.
				(tasting his wine,
				grimacing)
			And they have very good cellars.

					GIACOMO
			Nothing grows here!  Everything rots
			in the ground.  The wheat and vines
			wither before we can harvest them.

					COLUMBUS
			We've got to learn to live like the
			Indians.
				(pause)
			Eat your Iguana!

	Reluctantly this time, GIACOMO goes back to his dinner.


	EXT.  BALCONY - GOVERNOR'S MANSION - NIGHT

	They are drinking and smoking cigars.  From the balcony
	they can see the dark mass of the jungle stretching away.
	GIACOMO is already dozing in his chair.  BARTOLOME sees
	it, and elbows COLUMBUS.  They both smile at their younger
	brother's exhaustion.  Then COLUMBUS gets up and leans on
	the balustrade, looking down at the city, the jungle
	beyond.

					COLUMBUS
			How much gold have we found?

					BARTOLOME
			Not enough to justify a single
			shipment.

					COLUMBUS
			Perhaps it doesn't exist anywhere
			but in my imagination.

					BARTOLOME
			Then let's hope not...
				(pause)
			What will happen if we can't find
			enough gold?

	They begin to hear the sound of a flute -- a melancholy
	sound.  COLUMBUS looks out over the jungle, and kills a
	mosquito by slapping his arm.

					COLUMBUS
				(jokingly)
			Then I'm Governor of the Mosquitoes.

									CUT TO:

	INT.  INFIRMARY - CITY OF ISABEL - NIGHT

	An INDIAN is playing the flute.

	In the gloomy interior of the long hut, in the most
	primitive conditions, DOZENS OF SPANIARDS lie sick.  On a
	segregated part of the room are the INDIANS, several
	coughing.

	They are attended by a doctor, DOCTOR CHANCA, BROTHER
	BUYL, and other NOVICES.

	A NOVICE attends to an INDIAN, gently lifting his head,
	helping him to drink -- there is so little they can do.

	BROTHER BUYL looks down at the body of a SPANIARD, covered
	in open sores.  The NOVICE joins him.

					BROTHER BUYL
			What kind of disease is this?

					DOCTOR CHANCA
			I don't know.  It seems almost as if
			we have exchanged diseases with the
			Indians.  They die of our most
			common cold, and we of their plague.

					BROTHER BUYL
			God forgive us!

									CUT TO:

	EXT.  ROYAL HOSPITAL - COURTYARD - SPAIN - DAY

	A MAN covered with sores is screaming, thrashing in his
	agony.  He is held down, his voice muffled.  ISABEL turns
	away, shocked.

	She is in a ward full of patients, attended by a DOCTOR,
	SANCHEZ and other members of her court.

	The patients are emaciated, their faces and bodies covered
	with virulent sores.  NUNS move between the beds.

					DOCTOR
			It seems to be caused by intimacy
			with the native women, Your Majesty.

					ISABEL
			Will he survive?

					DOCTOR
			No, Your Majesty.  They go mad --
			then they die.  There is nothing we
			can do.

	ISABEL looks around at SANCHEZ, appalled.

					SANCHEZ
			Every ship returns with a cargo of
			sick and dying.  But with no gold!
			The new world proves expensive, Your
			Majesty.

					ISABEL
			We weren't expecting immediate
			profits, were we?  We must have
			faith.  We must give time for time.

	SANCHEZ bows in acknowledgement.  But ISABEL, despite her
	words, looks distressed.


	EXT.  MINE - NEW WORLD - DAY

	Excavations carved into a hillside.

	It is a blisteringly hot day.  At the foot of the hill,
	GIACOMO sits at a table beneath an awning, with MOXICA and
	several CLERKS.  ONE HUNDRED FIFTY INDIANS standing in
	line at the table.

	In turn, they hand over a small quantity of gold.  The
	CLERK weighs it on a scale, and notes down each
	contribution.

	MOXICA impatiently gestures the INDIANS to move faster
	with a thonged crop.  An INDIAN approaches the table.  He
	is nervous.  He doesn't produce anything.  The INDIAN
	shakes his head, gesticulates, starts to speak rapidly.

					TRANSLATOR
			He says he has not found any!

					MOXICA
			He's lying!

	Again the INDIAN pleads and gesticulates.  MOXICA hits him
	across the face with the thonged crop.  The INDIAN tries
	to run away -- but is held by a SPANISH SOLDIER.

					MOXICA
			Bring him here!

	The frightened INDIAN is brought back to the table.  One
	of the CLERKS slips away.

					MOXICA
			Tell him to put his hands on the
			table.  Like this!

									CUT TO:

	EXT.  OTHER SIDE OF THE SITE - DAY

	At the other end of the site, the CLERK sprinting to
	GIACOMO, who was talking to a FOREMASTER.

					CLERK
			Don Giacomo, you'd better come at
			once!


	EXT.  MINE - DAY

	MOXICA turns, looks back at the long line of INDIANS,
	still passively waiting.

					MOXICA
			Tell them I want them to watch this!

	The terrified TRANSLATOR speaks to the INDIANS.

					CLERK
			Don't Moxica!  You can't...

									CUT TO:

	GIACOMO and the CLERK running to the scene.

									CUT TO:

					MOXICA
				(to the clerk)
			I can't?  I can't?

	With a single swift action, MOXICA draws his sword and
	cuts off the INDIAN'S hands.

	ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE.  The INDIANS flee, disappearing
	into the jungle.  GIACOMO arrives at this moment.  He
	stares at the dismembered hands in horror.


	INT.  GOVERNOR'S MANSION - EVENING

	A tribunal.  Sitting behind a table with his brothers, and
	flanked by his council, COLUMBUS presides.  MOXICA stands
	before them.

					COLUMBUS
			In one act of brutality, you have
			created chaos.  Tribes who were
			fighting each other are now joining
			forces against us!  All that because
			of your criminal savagery!

					MOXICA
				(casually)
			Savagery is what monkeys understand.

					COLUMBUS
			You'll be held in detention,
			deprived of your privileges and
			possessions.  Until you are returned
			to Spain where you will be judged.
			Have you anything to say?

					MOXICA
				(with exquisite
				insolence)
			You will regret this.

	He strolls to the GUARDS at the back of the room.


	EXT.  BARRACKS - NIGHT

	Everything is quiet on the mine site.

	On the terrace, TWO SOLDIERS are drinking in turn, and
	cracking jokes.  One of them leans against the wooden
	wall.  He laughs as he hears repeated banging behind him.

									CUT TO:

	INT.  BARRACKS - NIGHT

	A THIRD SOLDIER is fucking an INDIAN WOMAN against the
	wall.

									CUT TO:

	EXT.  BARRACKS - NIGHT

	On the terrace, his two COMPANIONS laugh and encourage
	his efforts.

	A whooshing sound.  An arrow embeds itself in the chest of
	the SOLDIER who was leaning against the wall.  He is
	nailed to the wood behind him.

	THE OTHER SOLDIER stares at him, transfixed, until an
	arrow pierces his throat.  He collapses, unable to cry
	out for help.


	INT.  BARRACKS - NIGHT

	FOUR INDIANS in full warrior outfit, their faces painted,
	burst into the room.  Still busy with the WOMAN, his eyes
	facing the wall, the SOLDIER believes the intruders to be
	his friends.

					SOLDIER
				(without stopping)
			You animals!  Can't you wait!

	Discovering the FOUR TERRIFYING FIGURES staring at her,
	the INDIAN WOMAN starts screaming and pushes back the
	SOLDIER.  He turns around, jumps off the WOMAN, and starts
	to scramble to the front door, trying to put on his
	trousers.

	THE FOUR INDIANS catch him, and force him to lay on the
	ground.  THE MAN struggles, his eyes rolling in terror.
	TWO INDIANS force his mouth open.  A THIRD ONE kneels and
	starts stuffing it with gold dust.  THE SOLDIER chokes and
	suffocates.

	THE WOMAN still stands half naked against the wall,
	terrified.  AN INDIAN takes his knife from his leggings,
	slowly.  She starts sobbing and imploring in her language.
	THE INDIAN slowly walks to her, and plants the knife in
	the lower part of her belly.


	EXT.  MINE - DAY

	PAIRS of bloody red legs hanging still, high in the air.

	Pulling back, we discover:

	A DOZEN SPANIARDS have been crucified on the scaffolding
	of the excavations.  Some hands and noses have been
	removed.

	UTAPAN is standing, uncomfortable among the SPANIARDS.

	A SOLDIER removes a huge iron nail from a wrist.  One of
	the CRUCIFIED BODIES is gently laid on the ground.  He is
	still alive -- not for long.

	COLUMBUS and BARTOLOME are silent with rage.

					BARTOLOME
				(aggressively)
			Moxica is right.  Our ways don't
			work!

	BARTOLOME turns to UTAPAN.

					BARTOLOME
				(aggressively)
			Can you find them?

	UTAPAN looks distraught -- this is the first time he is
	being asked to do something against his own people.  He
	looks up at COLUMBUS for help in confusion.

					COLUMBUS
			You have to find them, Utapan.  Look
			what they did!

					UTAPAN
			You did the same to your God!

	COLUMBUS is caught short.

					COLUMBUS
			We have to stop this war.

	UTAPAN nods.  He walks and takes an arrow.  He examines
	it.

					COLUMBUS
			Do you know them?

	UTAPAN nods, uncomfortable.

									CUT TO:

	EXT.  HILL AND VALLEY - DAY

	Around a campfire, two dozen INDIANS are squatting.  They
	are arguing over a musket and some woolen hats they stole
	from the mine.  CLICK!  CLICK!  The INDIANS raise their
	heads.  All around them, crossbows and muskets are pointed
	at them.  Two INDIANS try to run away.  They are shot.

	This sound triggers the SPANIARDS' response.  They start
	shooting at random.  UTAPAN is horrified.  COLUMBUS stands
	up shouting.

					COLUMBUS
			Stop!  Stop this!

									CUT TO:

	EXT.  GOVERNOR'S MANSION - NIGHT

	MOXICA and a group of rebels (GUEVARA among them),
	silently approach the entrance of the mansion.

	A GUARD is stabbed and falls on his knees with a cry.


	INT.  COLUMBUS' STUDY - GOVERNOR'S MANSION - NIGHT

	MOXICA tears COLUMBUS' plans of the city from the wall.
	On the table, the model of the future city.

	Watched by the other ARISTOCRATS, MOXICA sets fire to the
	parchment he has rolled up.  He blows the flames from the
	torch onto the model.  Fire races up and down the streets
	of the miniature, as if burning the city of Isabel.

	A mad gleam in MOXICA'S eyes...


	EXT.  SQUARE OF ISABEL - NIGHT

	The half-burnt remains of the Mansion.  COLUMBUS stands in
	the square, looking up at it.  Behind him, his SOLDIERS,
	his BROTHERS and about thirty captured INDIANS.

	GIACOMO walks slowly across the square.  COLUMBUS looks at
	him in disbelief.

					GIACOMO
				(through cracked
				lips)
			Moxica...


	EXT.  RIVER BANK - JUNGLE - DAWN

	COLUMBUS leads his party of SOLDIERS through the jungle,
	looking for the MUTINEERS.

	They reach the river -- scan the far bank.  Nothing.
	COLUMBUS nods.  His MEN start to enter the river, led by a
	HALBERDIER.

	Others follow, wading across, their weapons held above
	their heads.

	A crossbow arrow pierces the HALBERDIER.  Without a cry he
	falls forward into the water, and is carried away by the
	current.

	Two more MEN are hit.  One cries out, thrashes around in
	the water, an arrow protruding from his side.  The river
	stained with blood.

	Still no sign of the enemy.  COLUMBUS' MEN nevertheless
	start to return fire from the bank, creating a shield...
	others continue to wade across the river.  A MUTINEER is
	shot down from the branches of a tree...

	The first MEN come ashore.  Musket fire.  An exchange of
	arrows.  COLUMBUS is now wading across.  The MAN next to
	him is killed, and carried away by the current.

	Now, on the far shore, the enemy have shown themselves.
	There is hand to hand fighting, with swords and other
	weapons.  MOXICA kills one of COLUMBUS' men -- but his own
	are outnumbered and outmatched.  Already, some are
	beginning to surrender.

	In the midst of the fighting, COLUMBUS, sword drawn, pulls
	himself out of the river:  A MUTINEER lunges at him.
	COLUMBUS kills him with a thrust of his sword -- and walks
	forward into the jungle.  He spots MOXICA at the foot of a
	cliff.


	EXT.  JUNGLE CLIMB TO CLIFF TOP - DAY

	MOXICA starts scrambling up the rocks behind him, with
	COLUMBUS following.  The climb through the dense
	undergrowth is so exhausting, they are now almost climbing
	in slow motion.


	EXT.  TOP OF CLIFF - DAY

	MOXICA bursts out of the undergrowth.  He is at the edge
	of emptiness, swept by a violent offshore wind.  He turns
	frantically, to see COLUMBUS coming up behind him.

	Knowing he is lost, MOXICA regains his natural arrogance.
	He steps backwards towards the edge.

					MOXICA
			You know what they will say in Spain
			about my death -- don't you?

	He takes another step backwards, as COLUMBUS moves towards
	him.

					MOXICA
			You are nothing!  You bastards will
			never inherit your titles.  We are
			everything.  We are immortal!

	He smiles, and steps back into space.


	EXT.  ROCKS BELOW CLIFF TOP - DAY

	His body falls, bounces off the rocks below, crashes into
	the water.


	EXT.  TOP OF CLIFF - DAY

	COLUMBUS stares down as his body is swept away.

									CUT TO:

	EXT.  SQUARE OF ISABEL - DAY

	CLOSE ON COLUMBUS' expressionless face.

									CUT TO:

	A MUTINEER -- his face is white, he is crying and
	trembling.  His arms are tied behind his back.  He is held
	fast, a rope is put around his neck.

	COLUMBUS, sitting not far away beside his BROTHERS, gives
	a signal.

	Drums begin to beat.  BROTHER BUYL looks on impassive.

	A grimace suddenly transform THE YOUNG MAN'S face.  He is
	being garroted -- his throat crushed with a rope.  The
	YOUNG MAN'S feet dance frenziedly.  We hear the choking.

	The drums cease.  BROTHER BUYL crosses himself and murmurs
	a prayer, deeply distraught.  GIACOMO has covered his
	eyes.

	A wider view shows the bodies of three other ARISTOCRATS
	from the rebellion, attached to chairs affixed to a pole,
	their heads straight, the rope still tight around their
	necks.

	Justice has been done.  The members of the COUNCIL rise in
	silence, COLUMBUS stands up.

									CUT TO:

	EXT.  ISABEL - QUAYSIDE - DAY

	CLOSE ON several large wooden cages.  Inside we see the
	INDIANS that COLUMBUS captured.  They are packed together.
	They stare out with vacant eyes.  SOLDIERS guard them.  A
	ship against the pier.  BUYL at his side, COLUMBUS stares
	at the INDIANS.

					BROTHER BUYL
			I wish to go back with them, Don
			Colon.  I have no desire to remain
			in this godless place.

					COLUMBUS
			You may do as you please, Brother
			Buyl -- though your departure will
			not help me to make it more Godly.

	BROTHER BUYL looks at him, almost with astonishment.

					BROTHER BUYL
			You treat Christians equally with
			heathen savages.  You execute
			members of the nobility.  And what
			do you offer in return?

					COLUMBUS
				(quietly)
			A new world, Brother Buyl.

					BROTHER BUYL
			Nobody wants one...!  Only you!

	And he walks away.


	EXT.  ISLAND - EVENING

	Against the livid horizon, three black waterspouts join
	the sky to the sea.  A gust of wind disturbs the roof of
	the jungle.


	INT.  GOVERNOR'S MANSION - EVENING

	The wind grows stronger.  Doors bang inside the
	building... a melancholy sound.

	COLUMBUS sits on the balcony with his BROTHERS.  They are
	silent.  After a few moments, COLUMBUS begins to speak
	quietly, almost as if he were speaking to himself.

					COLUMBUS
			Perhaps hope only exists in the
			journey.  When it begins, everything
			is still possible -- every
			expectation; every dream...

	The BROTHERS do not answer.

					COLUMBUS
			This is not how I imagined it to be.

									CUT TO:

	EXT.  JUNGLE - NEAR ISABEL - NIGHT

	UTAPAN begins to shave his head...


	EXT.  BALCONY - GOVERNOR'S MANSION - DAWN

	The sky is dark and threatening, the wind even stronger.
	We find COLUMBUS where we left him, but now alone.  He has
	sat here all night.

	Shutters bang violently.

	He looks up -- and sees a few yards from him:  the naked
	FIGURE OF AN INDIAN, his face and body painted, staring at
	him.  COLUMBUS realizes who it is...

					COLUMBUS
			Utapan!

	UTAPAN is still and silent.  A strange and mysterious
	figure now.

					COLUMBUS
			Utapan, won't you speak to me?  You
			used to know how to speak to me.

					UTAPAN
				(sadly, in his own
				language)
			You never learned how to speak my
			language.

	UTAPAN is gone.


	EXT.  SQUARE - DAWN

	The wind is whipping the trees now, stronger and stronger.
	Groups of INDIANS look up at the sky.  Then, above the
	sound of the wind, they hear another noise.  Like a
	collective murmur, almost in one voice, the INDIANS
	repeat, over and over.

					INDIANS
			Urracan... Urracan... Urracan...
			Urracan...
				(the wrath of God)

	With a loud thunderclap, the storm suddenly breaks.  In a
	few seconds it has risen to violent proportions, and the
	landscape is drenched in torrential rain.  The wind
	doubles its strength... and all hell breaks loose...


	EXT.  CITY OF ISABEL - DAY

	The hurricane is full force.  Trees are being ripped up by
	their roots.  Rivers of mud are washed down from the
	hills, carrying everything away in their paths:  houses,
	carts, equipment, horses...


	EXT.  MINE - ISABEL - DAY

	The mine workings flooded with mud...


	EXT.  APPROACH TO DAM AND WATERFALL - DAY

	COLUMBUS, BARTOLOME and MENDEZ struggle through the teeth
	of the hurricane towards the dam.


	EXT.  DAM - DAY

	Timbers creak and strain.  COLUMBUS, BARTOLOME, MENDEZ and
	a DOZEN other MEN are trying to save the dam.

	Suddenly, frighteningly, the dam begins to crash.

					COLUMBUS
				(screaming)
			Let it go!  Let it go!

	The MEN scramble away as the dam wall buckles, and burst
	open.  Water floods over them; a roaring torrent.  From
	the bank, MENDEZ, BARTOLOME and COLUMBUS survey the ruins
	of their dreams.

									CUT TO:

	INT.  GOVERNOR'S PALACE - BEDROOM - DAY

	COLUMBUS is stretched out on his bed, in his devastated
	bedroom.  A column of ants is threading its way across the
	floor, each ant carrying a piece of leaf.  Rain falls over
	a table covered with documents.

	COLUMBUS' face is covered in dried mud.

					SANCHEZ (V.O.)
			He promised us gold but has failed
			to find it.  He subjects the natives
			to violence, provocation and
			injustice.  He sent them to Spain
			against the express wishes of Your
			Majesty...


	INT.  AUDIENCE ROOM - ALHAMBRA PALACE - DAY

	We are back to the first scene.  In the vast, opulent,
	glittering room, ISABEL listens impassively to the voice
	of SANCHEZ.  Also present, other GRANDEES, representatives
	of the church and state.

					SANCHEZ
			... But there is worse.  He ordered
			the execution of five members of the
			nobility...

					ISABEL
			Is this true, Brother Buyl?

					BROTHER BUYL
			Yes, Your Majesty.  It is all true.
			I saw it with my own eyes.

	A pause.  ISABEL seems to struggle inwardly with her
	emotions.  SANCHEZ waits, expressionless, but on the point
	of victory.

					ISABEL
			Then, what do you suggest, Don
			Sanchez?

					SANCHEZ
			He must be replaced.

					ISABEL
			And who would you think of, for such
			a task?

									CUT TO:

	EXT.  QUAYSIDE - ISABEL - DAY

	We see a buckled shoe -- as it rises, it slips into a
	stirrup.  The horse is mounted.  The shoe digs into its
	flank.  The sound of hoofbeats...

					SANCHEZ (V.O.)
			I am thinking of a man.  A devotee
			to Your Majesties.  A man extremely
			motivated...

									DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT.  STREETS OF ISABEL - DAY

	FIVE MEN on HORSEBACK, dressed in fashionable clothes,
	canter down what used to be the main street of Isabel.
	Through some has been rebuilt, the effects of the
	hurricane are still visible...

	People look at them curiously.  We see them stop near the
	Governor's mansion.  The MEN dismount and walk into the
	Palace.


	INT.  GOVERNOR'S MANSION - DAY

	One of the MEN in black clothes removes his hat and steps
	forward.  We recognize him as ALONSO DE BOBADILLA, the man
	COLUMBUS humiliated at the rotunda.

	COLUMBUS is sitting at his desk, studying plans with
	GIACOMO.  Some other MEMBERS of the COUNCIL are with them.

					BOBADILLA
			Don Alonso de Bobadilla.

					COLUMBUS
			Yes... I remember...

	BOBADILLA turns, gestures to one of the other MEN, who
	comes forward and gives him a roll of parchment, bearing
	the royal seal.

					BOBADILLA
			My letters of appointment.

					COLUMBUS
			Appointment to what?

					BOBADILLA
			Viceroy of the West Indies.

					COLUMBUS
			Congratulations.  Then I am free to
			search for the mainland.

	BOBADILLA smiles wickedly, happy to give COLUMBUS a low
	blow.

					BOBADILLA
			Didn't you learn?  The mainland was
			discovered.  Weeks ago.  By another
			Italian.  I forgot his name.

					A MAN IN BLACK
			Amerigo Vespucci, Excellency.

	COLUMBUS pales.  Then...

					COLUMBUS
			How far from here?

					BOBADILLA
			I am not a seaman.  But I heard it
			is no more than a week at sea.  I
			hope you are not too disappointed.

					COLUMBUS
			How could I be?  The mainland has
			been found.  Exactly as I said it
			would.

					BOBADILLA
			I am afraid this is not the worst
			news.

									CUT TO:

	INT.  CELL - SEVILLE PRISON - DAY

	All is dark.  We can just make out COLUMBUS' face as he
	lies on the hard bed.  He is sweating heavily; his beard
	is filthy and matted, like his hair.  He looks feverish.

	A key turns in the lock.

	The JAILER lets in two fashionably dressed YOUNG MEN.
	COLUMBUS, blinking in the light, turns his head to stare
	at them.  His eyes are reddened with infection at the
	corners.  The YOUNG MEN come forward into the light.

					FERNANDO
				(quietly)
			Father?

	Unable to believe it, COLUMBUS slowly sits up.

					COLUMBUS
			Fernando...!  My God...!

	He laughs, overcome with joy.  Embraces DIEGO.

					COLUMBUS
			A man!  Diego, how did this happen?

					DIEGO
			Santangel is going to see the Queen.
			We are going to get you out of here.

					COLUMBUS
			Good!  I have to go back!

	DIEGO and FERNANDO look at one another, then back at
	COLUMBUS, incredulously, seeing his filthy clothes, his
	eyes rimmed with dried mucus.

					DIEGO
			Go back?

	There's a new excitement in COLUMBUS' voice.  He walks
	over to the table.  The candlelight illuminates maps,
	charts, drawings, figures...

					COLUMBUS
			I have to explore the mainland.

					FERNANDO
			This time with me!

	COLUMBUS laughs and DIEGO looks at them both in
	astonishment.

					DIEGO
			In your present state it is madness,
			Father!

	FERNANDO glances at DIEGO.

					FERNANDO
			Nobody is forcing you to come with
			us.

	DIEGO is hurt.

					DIEGO
			I can't go anyway.

	A pause.

					FERNANDO
			She's very beautiful!  The Queen has
			very good taste.  Diego is getting
			married.

	DIEGO seems saddened by his brother's attitude.  Once
	again DIEGO feels like the outsider.

	COLUMBUS hugs him.

					COLUMBUS
			I am happy for you, Diego.


	INT.  ALHAMBRA - AUDIENCE ROOM - DAY

	Like Lucifer and Gabriel, SANTANGEL and SANCHEZ sit on
	either side of ISABEL.

					SANTANGEL
			Granted his faults.  Yes, a hundred
			times!  But the man is still
			remarkable.

	ISABEL looks at him, then at SANCHEZ, MOVED BUT CLEARLY
	UNDECIDED.  SANTANGEL presses his point.

					SANTANGEL
			All he asks is a chance to explore
			this... mainland.

					SANCHEZ
			It does not belong to him.

					SANTANGEL
				(quietly)
			In a way, it does, Don Sanchez.
				(to the Queen)
			I beg Your Majesty to receive him.
			To hear him... He will make no more
			demands.  He has changed.  He is
			penitent.

					SANCHEZ
			Penitent...?  He is suing us for
			breach of contract!

					ISABEL
			Is he?

	She starts to laugh.

					ISABEL
			Really?

	SANTANGEL tries to stop himself laughing.


	INT.  AUDIENCE ROOM - ALHAMBRA PALACE - DAY

	COLUMBUS is shown into the room.  ISABEL is waiting for
	him.

	He drops to his knees before her.  This time she walks
	towards him, clearly moved by his white-hair, and other
	signs of physical deterioration.

	Her hand hovers over his head, as if it means to console
	him.  Her hand is dying to comfort.  But instead, she
	offers her hand for him to kiss.

					ISABEL
			Rise... Please...

	COLUMBUS gets slowly to his feet -- but his eyes, as they
	meet hers, are as clear as before.  ISABEL smiles with
	relief to see it.  He looks back at her.

					COLUMBUS
			Now I do look older than you.

	She smiles -- then again, tries to restrain it, and keeps
	her dignity.

					ISABEL
			We have decided to allow you to
			undertake another voyage to the new
			world...

	COLUMBUS starts to interrupt; she stops him with a
	gesture.

					ISABEL
			But without your brothers.  Nor are
			you to return to Santo Domingo or
			any of the other colonies.  You may
			explore the continent.

					COLUMBUS
			Thank you.

					ISABEL
			There is one thing I'd like to
			understand... Why do you want to go
			back, after all this?

					COLUMBUS
			Your Majesty -- some men are content
			to read about things.  I must see
			them with my own eyes.  I cannot be
			other than I am.

	She almost bursts out laughing -- only pauses, turns
	slightly, then goes out.


	INT.  ALHAMBRA PALACE - ROOM NEXT TO THRONE ROOM - DAY

	SANCHEZ is standing alone in the next room; he has
	obviously been listening.  He looks at her.

					ISABEL
			I know, I should not tolerate his
			impertinence.

					SANCHEZ
			Then why?

					ISABEL
			Because he is not afraid of me.


	INT.  ALHAMBRA PALACE - CORRIDOR - DAY

	SANCHEZ, in another direction, along a corridor, towards
	his office.  As he reaches a corner with a wide window, a
	hand seizes him.  COLUMBUS.

					SANCHEZ
			All I have to do is call the guards.

					COLUMBUS
			Call them.

	SANCHEZ looks at him -- and doesn't call.  COLUMBUS lets
	go of him.

					SANCHEZ
			I am not afraid of you.  You are
			nothing but a dreamer.

					COLUMBUS
			Look out of that window.

	Surprised, SANCHEZ nevertheless turns, looks out.

					COLUMBUS
			What do you see?

					SANCHEZ
			Roofs... towers, palaces...
			spires...

					COLUMBUS
			All of them created by people like
			me.

	SANCHEZ turns round again to face him.

					COLUMBUS
			No matter how long you live,
			Sanchez, there's something that will
			never change between us.  I did it!
			You didn't!

	COLUMBUS turns abruptly and walks away, vanishing down the
	echoing corridor.


	EXT.  COLUMBUS' MANOR HOUSE - DAY

	COLUMBUS dismounts in the courtyard.  Everything seems
	deserted.  There's no one about, no sign of life...


	INT.  MANOR HOUSE - DAY

	COLUMBUS walks slowly through the great rooms.  There is
	nothing left:  no furniture, rugs, pictures... nothing.

	He turns, sees BEATRIX standing in a doorway, looking back
	at him.  They are both moved.

					COLUMBUS
			God... you're so beautiful!  I can't
			believe no other man has ever taken
			you away from me...

					BEATRIX
			They tried... but I didn't let them.

	She smiles.  They don't dare to touch.  BEATRIX looks
	round the empty room.

					BEATRIX
			They took everything...

					COLUMBUS
				(looking at her)
			Not everything... Do you think I
			care?  I'm a free man again.  Riches
			don't make a man rich, they only
			make him busier...

	They laugh.  There's a pause.

					COLUMBUS
			God, how much I've missed you!

	And they throw themselves into each other's arms.

									CUT TO:

	INT.  DINING ROOM - MANOR HOUSE - EVENING

	All that has been left is a simple table and one chair.
	They are having supper by candlelight in the vast, empty
	room, though the candles throw a warm, sensuous glow on
	the figs and hams and wine... and on their faces, as
	BEATRIX sits on his lap.

					SANTANGEL (O.S.)
			One chair.  One table.  What more
			can a man expect, when he tries to
			sue the Crown?

	They laugh.  With only a little embarrassment, BEATRIX
	gets off COLUMBUS' knee.  SANTANGEL comes forward, and
	COLUMBUS embraces him like an old friend.  BEATRIX goes to
	the kitchen.

					COLUMBUS
			I owe you everything, Santangel...
			but as you see, I can't repay you.

					SANTANGEL
			On the contrary.  It is I who owe
			you everything.  Through you, I have
			been an adventurer, an explorer!
			It's true I shall never see the new
			world... but it's here...
				(he points to his
				head)
			And here...
				(pointing to his
				heart)

	COLUMBUS smiles.  BEATRIX returns with a plate and glass
	for SANTANGEL.

					SANTANGEL
			What you are, Colon, is a sailor, a
			discoverer, a man of imagination...
			not a politician.  You weren't meant
			to govern -- You cannot be all
			things to all men.

	He takes the wine BEATRIX offers, and raises his glass.

					SANTANGEL
			I wish you could have compromised.
			It would have made your life
			easier...

					COLUMBUS
			But as least we haven't been bored,
			have we?

	They all laugh, and drink.


	EXT.  SHIP'S DECK - FERNANDO'S POV - NIGHT

	Night on the open sea -- the moon shines on the waves and
	we hear the creaking of ropes and timbers -- the
	loneliness and mystery of the night passage.

					SAILOR'S VOICE
			West... southwest, Captain Mendez...

					MENDEZ (O.S.)
			Steady as she goes...

	COLUMBUS walks over to FERNANDO, who is leaning against
	the rail.  He is smoking a cigar... as the smoke blows
	over FERNANDO'S face, FERNANDO wretches... It's clear he's
	feeling seasick, trying to control it.

	COLUMBUS leans against the rail next to him, staring out
	at the darkness.  Then looks at his SON again.  FERNANDO
	won't give in to the sickness, but COLUMBUS knows he'd
	feel better if he did.

					COLUMBUS
			How are you feeling, Fernando?

					FERNANDO
				(in a strangled
				voice)
			Not bad.

	COLUMBUS nods meditatively, puffs out some smoke.
	FERNANDO winces, gags slightly.

					COLUMBUS
				(almost casually)
			You know what I always used to do?

	FERNANDO shakes his head.

					COLUMBUS
			Swallow a piece of pork fat on a
			string.  It always worked.

	At the thought of the pork fat, FERNANDO jerks his head
	over the side, and vomits copiously.  COLUMBUS smiles,
	pats him on the back.


	EXT.  SHIP'S DECK - DAY

	As it plows through heavy seas.  COLUMBUS, a coat wrapped
	around him, is sitting on a chair topside, directing
	operations despite an obvious fever.

	Suddenly a cry from the mast head:

					SAILOR (O.S.)
			Tierra...!  Tierra!

	SAILORS and FERNANDO rush to the side of the ship, peering
	through the spray.  FERNANDO wipes his eyes, and then he
	sees it:  there in the distance, a speck of land.

	FERNANDO and his FATHER stand together, watching the low
	cloud formation sitting on the horizon.

					COLUMBUS
			The mainland...

	FERNANDO looks excited.  Discreetly, COLUMBUS watches his
	SON, enjoying his happiness.


	EXT.  PANAMA (SURREAL IMAGES) - DAY

	A most wonderful and surreal image.  A heavy mist lies
	over the forest.  We move above it slowly.

	A FIGURE emerges from the mist.  At first only a
	silhouette -- then, slowly, a golden figure... an INDIAN,
	covered in gold... gold artifacts, golden paste on his
	body.

	The GOLDEN FIGURE turns, and points, into an unknown
	distance.


	EXT.  TREEHOUSE - DAY

	From the INDIAN treehouse, COLUMBUS, FERNANDO, MENDEZ and
	several INDIANS are gazing west over a necklace of
	magnificent lakes.

	The INDIANS point and talk gently.  FERNANDO has never
	seen anything so fresh, so beautiful.


	EXT.  CAMP - SUNSET

	A magnificent sunset.  A fire is burning, food cooking.
	COLUMBUS looks over his maps, trying to figure out where
	they are.  We see the outline of the continent of Asia.
	An OLD INDIAN squats beside him, silent, also looking at
	the map.  Then, slowly and very deliberately, he takes a
	piece of charcoal from the fire and begins to draw on the
	map.  Ignoring the Asian continent, he sketches the
	Panamanian coastline -- an isthmus.  MENDEZ and FERNANDO
	gather round.  COLUMBUS watches the OLD INDIAN with
	initial puzzlement, then growing excitement.

					MENDEZ
			What's he doing?

					COLUMBUS
			He's drawing an isthmus... He's
			saying we're on an isthmus.

					MENDEZ
			We can't be.

	FERNANDO is still confused.  The OLD INDIAN continues to
	sketch, talking quietly all the time.  An INDIAN
	TRANSLATOR listens.

					COLUMBUS
			Tell me what he's saying.

					TRANSLATOR
			He says -- water on the other side.

					COLUMBUS
			Ask him if he means a lake.  A big
			lake.

	The TRANSLATOR asks.  The OLD INDIAN shakes his head,
	laughs, points to the west, way beyond the other lakes,
	emphatically.

					TRANSLATOR
			No.  Says those are lakes.  Water on
			other side big -- as wide as here.
			Above and below, much land.

					COLUMBUS
				(stunned)
			An ocean...?  He's says it's an
			ocean?

					FERNANDO
			I don't understand.

	COLUMBUS is too stunned for a moment to explain.  The
	INDIANS laugh.

	Then COLUMBUS takes the charcoal, and begins to draw on
	the map, for his son.

					COLUMBUS
			Here is Europe... and over here, the
			continent of Asia.  But there's
			something in between!  Another
			continent!  We've found... another
			continent!

	FERNANDO stares west, then back at his FATHER.  COLUMBUS
	looks very feverish, his face bathed with sweat.

					FERNANDO
			Father...

					COLUMBUS
			There must be a passage to that
			other ocean.

									CUT TO:

	INT.  SHIP - COLUMBUS' CABIN - NIGHT

	COLUMBUS, feverish, lies on the bunk.  He shivers
	violently.  FERNANDO anxiously watches over him, bathes
	his eyes.

	Suddenly THE TRANSLATOR enters.

					TRANSLATOR
			I help.

	A little reluctantly, FERNANDO lets him go to his FATHER.
	The INDIAN crouches over the bed, takes out a handful of
	leaves from a pouch.  He chews the leaves himself for a
	moment, until they form a sticky pulp, then opens
	COLUMBUS' mouth and puts the pulp inside, encouraging
	COLUMBUS to chew with the motions of his hands.

	COLUMBUS chews, quickly falling asleep.


	EXT.  MOONLIT VISION OF VAST LAND MASS - NIGHT

	We see things from COLUMBUS' hallucination.  We are
	plunging through layers of clouds, the speed accelerating,
	giving us a sickening sensation of falling to land, closer
	and closer...

	COLUMBUS wakes up with a jolt.  Everything is silent.
	COLUMBUS walks outside.


	EXT.  DECK - NIGHT

	COLUMBUS' fever has subsided.  He raises his head and
	stares at the mainland passing in the night.  He smiles.

									CUT TO:

	EXT.  JUNGLE AND BAY - HIGH WIDE SHOT - DAY

	The roof of the jungle, the bay beyond, the caravel at
	anchor.

									CUT TO:

	EXT.  RIVER - DAY

	Two canoes going upstream, deeper and deeper into the
	jungle.


	EXT.  JUNGLE AND VILLAGE - DAY

	Smoke rises lazily above the trees.

									CUT TO:

	The boats reaching the bank.  THE FIRST HUTS of a village.
	THE SOLDIERS spread out into the empty village.

	FERNANDO, COLUMBUS and MENDEZ preceded by TWO ARMED
	SOLDIERS enter one of the huts.  The remains of a meal is
	still warm in bowls on the matted floor.

	A famished SOLDIER dips his hand in one of the bowls and
	devours its contents:  some kind of stew.  Stepping back
	accidentally, FERNANDO bumps into a large earthen jar
	behind him.  It rolls and crashes, revealing the remains
	of meat marinating in liquid.  There is something
	disturbing about the appearance of the content.

					FERNANDO
			Oh my God...

	The remains of human beings.

					COLUMBUS
				(approaching)
			What is...?

	He stares at the remains, stunned.  THE SOLDIER stops
	chewing.  He drops the half-empty bowl he was still
	holding.  He runs at the back door, rams his fingers deep
	in the back of his throat, and vomits.

					SOLDIER
			Oh Virgen Maria... Oh Madre de
			Dios...
			(Oh Virgin Mary... Oh Mother of
			 God...)

	But as he vomits and cries, he notices:

	A HEADLESS HUMAN TRUNK spread open, like a sheep carcass.
	Disturbed flies rise in clouds.

					SOLDIER
			Jesus, Maria, y todos los Santos...
			(Jesus, Mary, and all the Saints...)

									CUT TO:

	COLUMBUS and the SPANIARDS meet in the center of the
	village.  All have made the same horrific discovery.

					COLUMBUS
				(urgently)
			Out!  Get out!

	THE SPANIARDS back out of the village, crossbows pointed
	at the invisible enemy hidden in the jungle.

	They are running through the dense forest for the river
	bank.

	The CANNIBALS materialize among the trees, running
	alongside.  Bounding, skipping, frightening FIGURES, their
	brutal faces painted in black.  They release arrows at the
	running SOLDIERS.  A SOLDIER stops, kneels to the ground,
	fires his crossbow and kills one of the CANNIBALS... but
	he is pierced by a spear.  TWO CANNIBALS drag him and cut
	his throat to finish him.

	ELSEWHERE IN THE JUNGLE -- CRIES AND CONFUSION, SPANIARDS
	and CANNIBALS moving in hand to hand combat.

	A CANNIBAL comes sprinting at FERNANDO, brandishing his
	lance.

	COLUMBUS jumps on the man, and plants a knife in his
	abdomen.  Blinded in sweat, he stabs the CANNIBAL, who
	collapses.  Frenzied, COLUMBUS stabs over and over again.

	He stops and looks at his forearm -- soaked in blood.
	Shocked by his own fury, he raises his hand and stares at
	it.

	A GIANT BLACK BUTTERFLY alights gently on his bloody
	fingers, COLUMBUS staring fascinated at its palpitating
	wings.  FERNANDO, screaming at his FATHER, drags him to
	his feet.  They run...

									CUT TO:

	THE SPANIARDS, COLUMBUS, MENDEZ, FERNANDO... all running
	hard to the boat.  ARROWS whistle around them as they leap
	into the canoes, nearly capsizing them, launching them
	into the current.

	SOME CANNIBALS still follow them along the riverbank.  But
	the canoes are faster, and soon, they are left behind.


	EXT.  SHIP AT SEA - DAY

	Endless seascape, the caravel plowing.


	EXT.  SHIP'S DECK - DAY

	FERNANDO is crouched on the poop deck, wrapped in a
	blanket.  He seems in a state of shock:  he is pale and
	shaking.  As COLUMBUS goes and sits near his son, he hands
	him a flask of alcohol.

					COLUMBUS
				(kindly)
			Take it.  Come on.  Drink.

	As COLUMBUS insists, brandishing the flask, FERNANDO
	notices that his hands are shaking too.  His FATHER'S
	forehead is dripping with sweat.

	FERNANDO drinks a gulp and grimaces.  He drinks again and
	hands the flask back to his FATHER, who does the same.
	FERNANDO notices dried blood on his FATHER'S fingers.
	COLUMBUS immediately hides his hand and stands.

					COLUMBUS
			I... I have to see Mendez.

	Then, with sudden anger.

					COLUMBUS
			Your brother was right.  I should
			have never taken you with me.  I'll
			never forgive myself.  Never!

	He walks a few steps, lurches, and has to lean against the
	rail.  He raises his hand to his eyes, grimacing in pain,
	as if they were burning.  FERNANDO scrambles to his feet
	and rushes to him.  COLUMBUS' eyes are already fixed
	somewhere -- fever is eating him up.

					COLUMBUS
			Will you ever forgive me?

	FERNANDO turns around for help.

					COLUMBUS
			Captain Mendez!


	INT.  SHIP'S CABIN - DAY

	COLUMBUS is lying on his couch.  FERNANDO is bathing his
	eyes, sweeping off the pus that continuously forms in
	them.  COLUMBUS is drenched in sweat.

									CUT TO:

	FERNANDO is writing under his FATHER'S dictation.

					COLUMBUS
			I came to Your Highness with honest
			purpose and sincere zeal.  I did not
			undertake these voyages for honor or
			wealth -- that is certain.  After
			years of service to the Crown, I do
			not have a roof to put over my
			head... Your Majesty allowed me to
			explore the continent, believed to
			be Asia.  I now believe that it is
			an new Land, of unknown proportions
			and wealth... Life has more
			imagination than we carry in our
			dreams...

									DISSOLVE TO:

	INT.  ALCAZAR PALACE - GARDENS - DAY

	The DUENA, sitting beside ISABEL, quietly continues to
	read COLUMBUS' letter aloud.

					DUENA
			"I should be judged as a Seaman who
			by Divine Will discovered a New
			World, and thereby placed it under
			the sovereignty of Your Majesties.
			I humbly beseech Your Majesties that
			if it pleases God to remove me
			hence, you will help the name of
			Columbus to be remembered with
			honor... Weep for me, whoever has
			charity, truth and justice."

	She stops reading.  ISABEL turns her face away.


	INT.  UNIVERSITY OF SALAMANCA - DAY

	An ivory-sculptured hand -- the end of the back scratcher
	belonging to AROJAZ -- indicates a line across a large
	globe:  the route between Europe and America.

					AROJAZ (O.S.)
			The sunset route to the new
			continent is now well-established...

	We see a large amphitheater, filled with PEOPLE attending
	a lecture of "Nova Geographica" -- the new geography.

	AROJAZ stands in front of the assembly.  Facing him,
	enthroned, is KING FERDINAND, surrounded by COURTIERS,
	including SANCHEZ.

	We slowly move across the arena, passing attentive faces.

					AROJAZ
			... West by south west for 750
			leagues to Santo Domingo.  From
			there, west north west, leaving San
			Juan to the north, reaching the
			island of Hispanola on the northern
			cape of San Raphael... Then onto the
			mainland, at the Cape called Gracias
			a Dios...

	We continue to rise up the tiers of seats...

					AROJAZ
			Spain -- by Your Majesty's grace --
			has confirmed for all humanity the
			existence of an unknown continent...
			Tierra Incognita...

	On a highest tier, we stop on the face of CHRISTOPHER
	COLUMBUS, listening impassively.

					AROJAZ
			... This continent was first
			discovered by a sailor commissioned
			by your Majesty...

	CLOSE ON COLUMBUS' eyes.

					AROJAZ
			His name... Amerigo Vespucci...

	On COLUMBUS.


	EXT.  UNIVERSITY OF SALAMANCA - DAY

	Around the KING, on horseback, surrounded by the KNIGHTS,
	a CROWD is kept back by SOLDIERS.  AROJAZ is mounting his
	horse.  SANCHEZ is waiting for him.

	COLUMBUS stands among the students at the back of the
	CROWD.

									CUT TO:

	AROJAZ rides next to SANCHEZ.  AROJAZ suddenly spots
	COLUMBUS in the crowd, as they move off.

					AROJAZ
			My God...!  I thought he was dead.

	They pass close enough to touch COLUMBUS.  But he does not
	see them.

					SANCHEZ
			You can see for yourself.

					AROJAZ
			What a tragedy... what a waste of a
			life...

					SANCHEZ
			A waste...?  Let me tell you
			something, Arojaz.  If your name, or
			mine, is ever remembered -- it will
			only be because of his.

	AROJAZ looks at SANCHEZ in surprise -- then cranes his
	neck round, and looks back at COLUMBUS -- now a FACE IN
	THE CROWD.


	EXT.  LA RABIDA MONASTERY - KITCHEN GARDEN - DAY

	ANTONIO DE MARCHENA, a very old man now, is taking a
	siesta next to his grapes.  He is sitting in a simple
	armchair, a rosary wrapped around his fingers.

	The presence of someone wakes him.  After a moment, he
	recognizes COLUMBUS and smiles.  Both MEN are very moved.

					MARCHENA
			I suppose we're both old men now.

					COLUMBUS
			You'll always be older than me,
			Father.

	They laugh.  COLUMBUS sits down.  Bees drone lazily in the
	sunlight.

					COLUMBUS
			Have you ever forgiven me?

	MARCHENA nods his head.

					MARCHENA
			Yes.  I forgave you a long time ago.
			You see, I was proud of you.  You
			were like a willful child.  You
			wouldn't accept what others told
			you.  You had to find things out for
			yourself, hurting yourself -- and
			others -- in the process.

	MARCHENA looks at his plants, sighs contentedly.

					MARCHENA
			Do you remember when you said that
			people talk about the world, but
			never leave their gardens.

	COLUMBUS nods.

					MARCHENA
			More than ever I wonder what it is
			we do achieve by leaving our
			gardens... The world changes -- and
			yet it seems the same.  We find new
			worlds, but fill them with the same
			people...

	He pauses, looks across at COLUMBUS, smiles again gently.
	MARCHENA, tiring, leans back in his chair, and looks up
	towards the sun.

					COLUMBUS
			I have to disagree.

					MARCHENA
			I knew you would.

					COLUMBUS
			New worlds create new people.

					MARCHENA
			Oh?  So you are a new man?

					COLUMBUS
			I don't know... I have the
			impression that I didn't change that
			much.  I still can't accept the
			world as it is!

	MARCHENA starts laughing.

					MARCHENA
			God bless you, and those like you!

	They both laugh.


	EXT.  BEATRIX'S HOUSE BALCONY - EVENING

	FERNANDO is sitting in front of his FATHER, examining
	documents and letters.  COLUMBUS has wrapped a shawl
	around his legs.  He looks even older now, with his mass
	of pure white hair.

	BEATRIX comes out with a tray, carrying grapes and a
	decanter of water.  She places it on a small table near
	COLUMBUS and touches his shoulder.

	As she is ready to return inside the house, he holds her
	back.

					COLUMBUS
			Can't you stay with us a little?

					BEATRIX
			I am busy inside.

	He smiles.  She looks at him smiling, intrigued.

					BEATRIX
			What is it, now?  Tell me...

					COLUMBUS
			I can't keep my eyes off you.  I
			would like to catch up with all the
			moments I didn't spend with you.

	FERNANDO looks up at them above his letters, amused and
	slightly embarrassed.  COLUMBUS looks at him with a fake
	air of reproach.

					COLUMBUS
			What are you listening to?

					FERNANDO
			I am not listening, Father.  But I
			can't help hearing.

	FERNANDO opens a letter and reads it quickly.

					FERNANDO
			It's Diego... He is at the Court,
			with Santangel... He says they hope
			to get your privileges restored...
			And maybe the house.

	COLUMBUS smiles and nods -- all this seems to be of very
	little importance to him now.

					COLUMBUS
			But how is he?  And Dona Maria?

	FERNANDO continues to read.

					FERNANDO
			Fine, it seems.  Diego is thinking
			of starting a pearl trade, in Santo
			Domingo... He says he received many
			letters for you.  Some of your men,
			mostly.

	He opens one of them, glances at it.

					FERNANDO
			This one is from Mendez!

	COLUMBUS' eyes brighten with joy.

					COLUMBUS
			What does he say?

					FERNANDO
			He asks when he can come to visit
			you.  He left his address.

					COLUMBUS
				(smiling)
			He never had one... except aboard my
			ships!

	FERNANDO laughs -- then, suddenly serious.

					FERNANDO
			I want you to tell me everything you
			remember, Father.  From the
			beginning.  Everything.

					COLUMBUS
			Really?
				(pause)
			God... I wouldn't know where to
			start... and yet...

					FERNANDO
			Tell me the first thing that comes
			to your mind.

	COLUMBUS sighs, and leans back on his chair.  His eyes are
	fixed somewhere, searching.  Then, almost in a murmur.

					COLUMBUS
			I remember...

	We see the page.  FERNANDO writes: ... I REMEMBER...

	A drop of ink falls from the quill onto the page and the
	words.

	FERNANDO is waiting.

									CUT TO:

	COLUMBUS' eyes.

	EXT.  BEACH AND JUNGLE - FIRST LANDING - DAY

	A MOVING IMAGE, as seen from the rolling deck of a ship.
	We see:

									MUSIC BEGINS:

	THE LONE SILHOUETTE of an INDIAN emerges from the dense
	foliage.  He runs down the beach towards the surf.  He
	stops and seems to be staring at us.

	These words appear on the screen:

TITLE					    PART I
					    AFRICA
					    3,000,000 YEARS AGO

A1
VIEWS OF AFRICAN DRYLANDS - DROUGHT

The remorseless drought had lasted now for ten million years,
and would not end for another million. The reign of the ter-
rible lizards had long since passed, but here on the continent
which would one day be known as Africa, the battle for survival
had reached a new climax of ferocity, and the victor was not
yet in sight. In this dry and barren land, only the small or
the swift or the fierce could flourish, or even hope to exist.

										 a1

A2
INT & EXT CAVES - MOONWATCHER

The man-apes of the field had none of these attributes, and
they were on the long, pathetic road to racial extinction.
About twenty of them occupied a group of caves overlooking
a small, parched valley, divided by a sluggish, brown stream.

The tribe had always been hungry, and now it was starving.
As the first dim glow of dawn creeps into the cave, Moonwatcher
discovers that his father has died during the night. He did not know
the Old One was his father, for such a relationship was beyond
his understanding. but as he stands looking down at the emac-
iated body he feels something, something akin to sadness. Then
he carries his dead father out of the cave, and leaves him for the
hyenas.

Among his kind, Moonwatcher is almost a giant. He is nearly
five feet high, and though badly undernourished, weighs over
a hundred pounds. His hairy, muscular body is quite man-like,
and his head is already nearer man than ape. The forehead is
low, and there are great ridges over the eye-sockets, yet he
unmistakably holds in his genes the promise of humanity. As
he looks out now upon the hostile world, there is already

										 a2

A2
CONTINUED

something in his gaze beyond the grasp of any ape. In those
dark, deep-set eyes is a dawning awareness-the first intima-
tions of an intelligence which would not fulfill itself for another
two million years.

										 a3

A3
EXT  THE STREAM - THE OTHERS

As the dawn sky brightens, Moonwatcher and his tribe reach
the shallow stream.

The Others are already there. They were there on the other
side every day - that did not make it any less annoying.

There are eighteen of them, and it is impossible to distinguish
them from the members of Moonwatcher's own tribe. As
they see him coming, the Others begin to angrily dance and
shriek on their side of the stream, and his own people reply
In kind.

The confrontation lasts a few minutes - then the display dies
out as quickly as it has begun, and everyone drinks his fill of
the muddy water. Honor has been satisfied - each group has
staked its claim to its own territory.

										 a4

A4
EXT  AFRICAN PLAIN - HERBIVORES

Moonwatcher and his companions search for berries, fruit
and leaves, and fight off pangs of hunger, while all around
them, competing with them for the samr fodder, is a potential
source of more food than they could ever hope to eat. Yet
all the thousands of tons of meat roaming over the parched
savanna and through the brush is not only beyond their reach;
the idea of eating it is beyond their imagination. They are
slowly starving to death in the midst of plenty.

										 a5

A5
EXT  PARCHED COUNTRYSIDE - THE LION

The tribe slowly wanders across the bare, flat country-
side foraging for roots and occasional berries.

Eight of them are irregularly strung out on the open plain,
about fifty feet apart.

The ground is flat for miles around.

Suddenly, Moonwatcher becomes aware of a lion, stalking
them about 300 yards away.

Defenceless and with nowhere to hide, they scatter in all
directions, but the lion brings one to the ground.

										 a6

A6
EXT  DEAD TREE - FINDS HONEY

It had not been a good day, though as Moonwatcher had no
real remembrance of the past he could not compare one day
with another. But on the way back to the caves he finds a
hive of bees in the stump of a dead tree, and so enjoys the
finest delicacy his people could ever know. Of course, he
also collects a good many stings, but he scacely notices
them. He is now as near to contentment as he is ever
likely to be; for thought he is still hungry, he is not actually
weak with hunger. That was the most that any hominid could
hope for.

										 a7

A7
INT & EXT  CAVES - NIGHT TERRORS

Over the valley, a full moon rises, and a cold wind blows down
from the distant mountains. It would be very cold tonight -
but cold, like hunger, was not a matter for any real concern;
it was merely part of the background of life.

This Little Sun, that only shone at night and gave no warmth,
was dangerous; there would be enemies abroad. Moonwatcher
crawls out of the cave, clambers on to a large boulder besides
the entrance, and squats there where he can survey the valley.
If any hunting beast approached, he would have time to get back
to the relative safety of the cave.

Of all the creatures who had ever lived on Earth, Moonwatcher's
race was the first to raise their eyes with interest to the Moon,
and though he could not remember it, when he was young,
Moonwatcher would reach out and try to touch its ghostly face.
Now he new he would have to find a tree that was high
enough.

He stirs when shrieks and screams echo up the slope from
one of the lower caves, and he does not need to hear the

										 a8

A7
CONTINUED

occasional growl of the lion to know what is happening. Down
there in the darkness, old One-Eye and his family are dying,
and the thought that he might help in some way never crosses
Moonwatcher's mind. The harsh logic of survival rules out
such fancies. Every cave is silent, lest it attract disaster.

And in the caves, in tortured spells of fitful dozing and
fearful waiting, were gathered the nightmares of generations
yet to come.

										 a9

A8
EXT  THE STREAM - INVASION

The Others are growing desperate; the forage on their side of
the valley is almost exhausted. Perhaps they realise that
Moonwatcher's tribe has lost three of its numbers during the
night, for they choose this mourning to break the truce. When
they meet at the river in the still, misty dawn, there is a
deeper and more menacing note in their challenge. The noisy
but usually harmless confrontation lasts only a few seconds
before the invasion begins.

In an uncertainly-moving horde, the Others cross the river,
shieking threats and hunched for the attack. They are led
by a big-toothed hominid of Moonwatcher's own size and age.

Startled and frightened, the tribe retreats before the first
advance, throwing nothing more substantial than imprecations
at the invaders. Moonwatcher moves with them, his mind a
mist of rage and confusion. To be driven from their own
territory is a great badness, but to lose the river is death.
He does not know what to do; it is a situation beyond his
experience.

Then he becomes dimly aware that the Others are slowing

										 a10

A8
CONTINUED

down, and advancing with obvious reluctance. The further they
move from their own side, the more uncertain and unhappy
they become. Only Big-Tooth still retains any of his original
drive, and he is rapidly being seperated from his followers.

As he sees this, Moonwatcher's own morale immediately
revives. He slows down his retreat, and begins to make
reassuring noises to his companions. Novel sensations fill
his dim mind - the first faint precursors of bravery and
leadership.

Before he realizes it, he is face to face with Big-Tooth, and
the two tribes come to a halt many paces away.

The disorganized and unscientific conflict could have ended
quickly if either had used his fist as a club, but this
innovation still lay hundreds of thousands of years in the
future. Instead, the slowly weakening fighters claw and
scratch and try to bite each other.

Rolling over and over, they come to a patch of stony ground,
and when they reach it Moonwatcher is on top. By chance,

										 a11

CONTINUED

he chooses this moment to grab the hair on Big-Tooth's scalp,
and bang his head on the ground. The resulting CRACK is
so satisfactory, and produces such an immediate weakening
In Big - Tooth's resistance, that he quickly repeats it.

Even when Big-Tooth ceases to move for some time, Moon-
watcher keeps up the exhilirating game.

With shrieks of panic, the Others retreat back, across the
stream. The defenders cautiously pursue them as far as
The water's edge.

										 a12

EXT  CAVE - NEW SOUND

Dozing fitfully and weakened by his stuggle, Moonwatcher is
startled by a sound.

He sits up in the fetid darkness of the cave, straining his
senses out into the night, and fear creeps slowly into his soul.
Never in his life - already twice as long as most members of
his species could expect - has he heard a sound like this. The
great cats approached in silence, and the only thing that
betrayed them was a rare slide of earth, or the occasional
cracking of a twig. Yet this is a continuing crunching noise
that grows steadily louder. It seemed that some enormous
beast was moving through the night, making no attempt at
concealment, and ignoring all obstacles.

And then there came a sound which Moonwatcher could not
possibly have identified, for it had never been heard before
in the history of this planet.

										 a13

A10
EXT CAVE - NEW ROCK

Moonwatcher comes face to face with the New Rock when he
leads the tribe down to the river in the first light of morning.
He had almost forgotten the terror of the night, because nothing
had happened after that initial noise, so he does not even
associate this strange thing with danger or with fear. There
is nothing in the least alarming about it.

It is a cube about fifteen feet on a side, and it is made of
some completely transparent material; indeed, it is not easy
to see except when the light of the sun glints on its edges.
There are no natural objects to which Moonwatcher can
compare this apparition. Though he is wisely cautious
of most new things, he does not hesitate to walk up to it.
As nothing happens, he puts out his hand, and feels a warm,
hard surface.

After several minutes of intense thought, he arrives at a
brilliant explanation. It is a rock, of course, and it
must have grown during the night. There are many plants
that do this - white, pulpy things shaped like pebbles, that
seem to shoot up in the hours of darkness. It is true that
they are small and round, whereas this is large and square;

										 a14

A10
CONTINUED

but greater and later philosophers than Moonwatcher would be
prepared to overlook equally striking exceptions to their laws.

This really superb piece of abstract thinking leads Moonwatcher
to a deduction which he immediately puts to the test. The white,
round pebble-plants are very tasty (though there were a few
that made one violently sick); perhaps this square one...?

A few licks and attempted nibbles quickly disillusion him.
There is no nourishment here; so like a sensible hominid, he
continues on his way to the river and forgets all about the Cube.

										 a15

A11
EXT CUBE - FIRST LESSON

They are still a hundred yards from the New Rock when the
sound begins.

It is quite soft, and it stops them in their tracks, so that they
stand paralyzed on the trail with their jaws hanging. A simple,
maddeningly repetitious rhythm pulses out of the crystal cube
and hypnotises all who come within its spell. For the first
time - and the last, for two million year - the sound of
drumming is heard in Africa.

The throbbing grows louder, more insistent. Presently the
hominids begin to move forward like sleep-walkers, towards
the source of that magnetic sound. Sometimes they take little
dancing steps, as their blood responds to the rhythms that
their descendants will not create for ages yet.

Totally entranced, they gather around the Cube, forgetting
the hardships of the day, the perils of the approaching dusk,
and the hunger in their bellies.

Now, spinning wheels of light begin to merge, and the spokes
fuse into luminous bars that slowly recede into the distance,

										 a16

A11
CONTINUED

rotating on their axes as they do; and the hominids watch, wide-
eyed, mesmerized captives of the Crystal Cube.

Then by some magic - though it was no more magical than all
that had gone on before - a perfectly normal scene appears. It
is as if a cubical block had been carved out of the day and
shifted into the night. Inside that block is a group of four
hominids, who might have been members of Moonwatcher's
own tribe, eating chunks of meat. The carcass of a wart-hog
lies near them.

This little family of male and female and two children is gorged
and replete, with sleek and glossy pelts - and this was a
condition of life that Moonwatcher had never imagined. From
time to time they stir lazily, as they loll at ease near the
entrance of their cave, apparently at peace with the world.
The spectacle of domestic bliss merges into a totally
different scene.

The family is no longer reposing peacefully outside its cave;
it is foraging, searching for food like any normal hominids.

										 a17

A11
CONTINUED

A small wart-hog ambles past the group of browsing humanoids
without giving them more than a glance, for they had never been
the slightest danger to its species.

But that happy state of affairs is about to end. The big male
suddenly bends down, picks up a heavy stone lying at his feet -
and hurls it upon the unfortunate pig. The stone descends upon
its skull, making exactly the same noise that Moonwatcher had
produced in his now almost forgotten encounter with Big-Tooth.
And the result, too, is much the same - the warthog gives one
amazed, indignant squeal, and collapses in a motionless heap.

Then the whole sequence begins again, but this time it unfolds
itself with incredible slowness. Every detail of the movement
can be followed; the stone arches leisurely through the air, the
pig crumples up and sinks to the ground. There the scene
freezes for long moments, the slayer standing motionless
above the slain, the first of all weapons in his hand.

The scene suddenly fades out. The cube is no more than a
glimmering outline in the darkness; the hominids stir, as if

										 a18

A11
CONTINUED

awakening from a dream, realise where they are, and scuttle
back to their caves.

They have no concious memory of what they had seen; but that
night, as he sits brooding at the entrance of his lair, his ears
attuned to the noises of the world around him, Moonwatcher
feels the first faint twinges of a new and potent emotion - the urge
to kill. He had taken his first step towards humanity.

										 a19

A12
EXT cave AND PLAINS - Utopia

Babies were born and sometimes lived; feeble, toothless thirty-
year-olds died; the lion took its toll in the night; the Others
threatened daily across the river - and the trib prospered.
In the course of a single year, Moonwatcher and his companions
had changed almost beyond recognition.

They had become as plump as the family in the Cave, who no
longer haunted their dreams. They had learned their lessons
well; now they could handle all the stone tools and weapons that
the Cube had revealed to them.

They were no longer half-numbed with starvation, and they
had time both for leisure and for the first rudiments of thought.
Their new way of life was casually accepted, and they did
not associate it in any way with the crystal cube still standing
outside their cave.

But no Utopia is perfect, and this one had two blemishes. The
first was the marauding lion, whose passion for hominids
seemed to have grown even stronger now that they were better
nourished. The second was the tribe across the river; for

										 a20

A12
CONTINUED

somehow the Others had survived, and had stubbornly refused to
die of starvation.

										 a21

A13
EXT CAVES - KILLING THE LION

With the partly devoured carcass of a warthog laid out on the
ground at the point he hope the boulder would impact, Moon-
watcher and three of his bravest companions wait for two
consecutive nights. On the third the lion comes,
betraying his presences by a small pebble slide.

When they can here the lion below, softly tearing at the meat,
they strain themselves against the massive boulder. The sound
of the lion stops; he is listening. Again they silently heave
against the enormous stone, exerting the final limits of their
strength. The rock begin to tip to a new balance point.

The lion twitches alert to this sound, but having no fear of these
creatures, he makes the first of two mistakes which will cost
him his life; he goes back to his meal.

The rock moves slowly over the ledge, picking up speed with
amazing suddeness. It strikes a projection in the cliff about
fifteen feet above the ground, which deflects its path outward.

Just at this instant, the lion reacts instinctively and leaps
away from the face of the cliff directly into the path of the

										 a22

A13
CONTINUED

onrushing boulder. He has combined the errors of over-
confidence and bad luck.

The next morning they find the lion in front of the cave. They
also find one of their tribe who had incautiously peeped out to
see what was happening, and was apparently killed by a small
rock torn loose by the boulder; but this was a small price to
pay for such a great victory.

					  * * * * * * * *

And then one night the crystal cube was gone, and not even
Moonwatcher ever thought of it again. He was still wholly
unaware of all that it had done.

										 a23

A14
EXT STREAM - MASTER OF THE WORLD

From their side of the stream, in the never violated safety of
their own territory, the Others see Moonwatcher and fourteen
males of his tribe appear from behind a small hillock over-
looking the stream, silhouetted against the dawn sky.

The Others begin to scream their daily challenge. But today
something is different, though the Others do not immediatly
recognize this fact.

Instead of joining the verbal onslaught, as they had always done,
Moonwatcher and his small band decended from the rise, and
begin to move forward to the stream with a quiet purposefulness
never befor seen.

As the Others watch the figures silently approaching in the
morning mist, they become aware of the terrible strangness
of this encounter, and their rage gradually subsides down to
an uneasy silence.

At the water's edge, Moonwatcher and his band stop. They
carry their bone clubs and bone knives.

										 a24

A14
CONTINUED

Led by One-ear, the Others half-heartly resume the battle-
chant. But they are suddenly confrunted with a vision that cuts
the sound from their throats, and strikes terror into their
hearts.

Moonwatcher, who had been partly concealed by two males who
walked before him, thrusts his arm high into the air. In his
hand he holds a stoud tree branch. Mounted atop the branch is
the bloody head of the lion, its mouth jammed open with a stick,
displaying its frightful fangs.

The Others gape in fearful disbelief at this display of power.

Moonwatchers stands motionless, thrusting the lion's head high.
Then with majestic deliberation, still carrying his mangled
standard above his head, he begins to cross the stream, followed
by his band.

The Others fade back from the stream, seeming to lack even
the ability to flee.

Moonwatcher steps ashore and walks to One-Ear, who stands

										 a25

A14
CONTINUED

unsurely in front of his band.

Though he is a veteran of numerous combats at the water's edge,
One-Ear has never been attacked by an enemy who had not first
displayed his fighting rage; and he had never before been attacked
with a weapon. One-Ear, merely looks up at the raised club
until the heavey thigh bone of an antelope brings the darkness
down around him.

The Others stare in wonder at Moonwatcher's power.

Moonwatcher surveys the scene. Now he was master of the
world, and he was not sure what to do next. But he would
think of something.

					    FLOYD
					    Well, as it happens, I'm on

					    SMYSLOV
					    (pleasantly)  Well, Dr. Floyd,
					    I hope that you don't think I'm
					    too inquisitive, but perhaps
					    you can clear up the mystery
					    about what's been going on up
					    there.

					    FLOYD
					    I'm sorry, but I'm not sure
					    I know what you mean.

					    SMYSLOV
					    Well, it's just for the past
					    two weeks there have been
					    some extremely odd things
					    happening at Clavius.

					    FLOYD
					    Really?

					    SMYSLOV
					    Yes. Well, for one thing,
					    whenever you phone the base,
					    all you can get is a recording
					    which repeats that the phone
					    lines are temporarily out of
					    order.

12/7/65										  b32

					    FLOYD
					    Well, I suppose they've been

					    SMYSLOV
					    Yes, well at first we thought
					    that was the explanation, but
					    it's been going on for the past
					    ten days.

					    FLOYD
					    You mean you haven't been able
					    to get anyone at the base for ten
					    days?

					    SMYSLOV
					    That's right.

					    FLOYD
					    I see.

					    ELENA
					    Another thing, Heywood, two
					    days ago, one of our rocket
					    buses was denied permission
					    for an emergency landing at
					    Clavius.

					    FLOYD
					    How did they manage to do that

					    Clavius Control came on the

					    their refusal.

					    FLOYD
					    Well, that does sound very odd.

					    SMYSLOV
					    Yes, and I'm afaid there's
					    going to be a bit of a row about
					    it. Denying the men permission
					    to land was a direct violation of
					    the I.A.S. convention.

					    FLOYD
					    Yes... Well, I hope the crew
					    got back safely.

					    Certainly.

					    SMYSLOV
					    Quite frankly, we have had some

					    that a quite serious epidemic

					    We're scheduled to dock in about

					    Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder
					    if I can have a word with you about
					    the security arrangements?

					    FLOYD
					    What do you mean?

					    PILOT
					    Well... the crew is confined to
					    the ship when we land at Clavius.
					    We have to stay inside for the
					    time it take to refit - about
					    twenty-four hours. And then
					    we're going to back empty.

					    FLOYD
					    I see.

					    the Auditing Department of the
					    Territorial Administrator and I
					    haven't been able to get her on
					    the phone for the past week or so,
					    and with all these stories one
					    hears, I'm a little concerned
					    about her.

					    FLOYD
					    I see. Well, I'm sorry about that.
					    I wouldn't think there's any cause
					    for alarm.

					    PILOT
					    Yes, well, I wouldn't have been
					    too concerned about it, except
					    I've heard these stories about the
					    epidemic and, as a matter of fact,
					    I've heard that ten people have

					    has asked me to convey his
					    deepest appreciation to all of
					    you for the personal sacrifices
					    you have made, and of course
					    his congratulations on your
					    discovery which may well prove
					    to be among the most significant
					    in the history of science.

POLITE APPLAUSE.

CONTINUED

					    FLOYD (cont'd)
					    Mr. Halvorsen has made known
					    to me some of the conflicting
					    views held by many of you
					    regarding the need for complete
					    security in this matter, and
					    more specifically your strong
					    opposition to the cover story
					    created to give the impression
					    there is an epidemic at the Base.
					    I understand that beyond it being
					    a matter of principle, many of
					    you are troubled by the concern
					    and anxiety this story of an
					    epidemic might cause your
					    relatives and friends on Earth.

					    I can understand and sympathize
					    with your negative views. I have
					    been personally embarrassed by
					    this cover story. But I fully
					    accept the need for absolute
					    secrecy and I hope you will.

					    It should not be difficult for all
					    of you to realise the potential for
					    cutural shock and social
					    disorientation contained in the
					    present situation if the facts
					    were prematurely and suddenly
					    made public without adequate
					    preparation and conditioning.

11/25/65										 b55

CONTINUED

					    FLOYD
					    This is the view of the Council
					    and the purpose of my visit here
					    is to gather addition facts and
					    opinions on the situation and to
					    prepare a report to the Council
					    recommending when and how the
					    news should eventually be
					    announced. Are there any
					    questions?

					    MICHAELS
					    Dr. Floyd, how long do you think
					    this can be kept under wraps?

					    FLOYD
					    (pleasantly)
					    I'm afraid it can and it will be
					    kept under wraps as long as it
					    is deemed to be necessary by
					    the Council. And of course you
					    know that the Council has requested
					    that formal security oaths are to
					    be obtained in writing from every-
					    one who had any knowledge of this
					    event. There must be adequate
					    time for a full study to be made

SILENT APPRECIATION

					    HALVORSEN
					    Four million years ago, something,
					    presumably from the stars, must
					    have swept through the solar
					    system and left this behind.

					    FLOYD
					    Was it abandoned, forgotten, left
					    for a purpose?

					    HALVORSEN
					    I suppose we'll never know.

					    MICHAELS
					    The moon would have made an
					    excellent base camp for
					    preliminary Earth surveys.

SOME MORE SILENCE

					    FLOYD
					    Any ideas about the colour?

					    MICHAELS
					    Well, not really. At first glance,
					    black would suggest something
					    sun-powered, but then why would
					    anyone deliberately bury a sun-
					    powered device?

					    FLOYD
					    Has it been exposed to any sun
					    before now?

					    MICHAELS
					    I don't think it has, but I'd
					    like to check that. Simpson,
					    what's the log on that?

					    The first surface was exposed at

					    see... that would have been

					    PHOTOGRAPHER
					    Excuse me, gentlemen, if you'd

VARIOUS SHOTS OF
SPACE MONITORS,
ASTEROIDS, THE SUN,
PLUTO, MARS.

					    NARRATOR
					    A hundred million miles beyond
					    Mars, in the cold lonliness
					    where no man had yet travelled,
					    Deep-Space-Monitor-79 drifts
					    slowly among the tangled orbits
					    of the asteroids.

					    NARRATOR
					    Radiation detectors noted and
					    analyzed incoming cosmic rays
					    from the galaxy and points beyond;
					    neutron and x-ray telescopes
					    kept watch on strange stars that
					    no human eye would eever see;
					    magnetometers observed the
					    gusts and hurricanes of the solar
					    winds, as the sun breathed million
					    mile-an-hour blasts of plasma
					    into the faces of its circling
					    children.

					    NARRATOR
					    All these things and many others
					    were patiently noted by Deep-
					    Space-Monitor-79, and recorded
					    in its crystalline memory.

11/25/65										 b68 

B47
CONTINUED

					    NARRATOR
					    But now it had noted something
					    strange - the faint yet
					    unmistakable distrubance rippling
					    across the solar system, and
					    quite unlike any natural phenomena
					    it had ever observed in the past.

					    NARRATOR
					    It was also observed by Orbiter
					    M-15, circling Mars twice a
					    day; and High Inclination Probe-
					    21, climbing slowly above the
					    planet of the ecliptic; and even
					    artificial Comet-5, heading out
					    into the cold wastes beyond
					    Pluto, along an orbit whose
					    far point it would not reach for
					    a thousand years.

					    NARRATOR
					    All noticed the peculiar burst of
					    energy that leaped from the face
					    of the Moon and moved across
					    the solar system, throwing off a
					    spray of radiation like the wake of
					    a racing speedboat.

POOLE IS FINISHED.

BOWMAN IS STILL
READING AND
WORKING ON HIS
DESSERT.

					    POOLE
					    Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like
					    your advice on something.

					    BOWMAN
					    Sure, what is it?

					    POOLE
					    Well, it's nothing really important,
					    but it's annoying.

					    BOWMAN
					    What's up?

					    POOLE
					    It's about my salary cheques.

					    BOWMAN
					    Yes?

					    POOLE
					    Well I got the papers on my
					    official up-grading to AGS-19
					    two weeks before we left.

12/14/65										 c12 

C12
CONTINUED

					    BOWMAN
					    Yes, I remember you mentioning it.
					    I got mine about the same time.

					    POOLE
					    That's right. Well, naturally,
					    I didn't say anything to Payroll.
					    I assumed they'd start paying me
					    at the higher grade on the next pay
					    cheque. But it's been almost
					    three weeks now and I'm still
					    being paid as an AGS-18.

					    BOWMAN
					    Interesting that you mention it,
					    because I've got the same problem.

					    POOLE
					    Really.

					    BOWMAN
					    Yes.

					    POOLE
					    Yesterday, I finally called the
					    Accounting Office at Mission
					    Control, and all they could tell me
					    was that they'd received the AGS-19
					    notification for the other three but
					    not mine, and apparently not yours
					    either.

12/14/65										 c13 

C12
CONTINUED

					    BOWMAN
					    Did they have any explanation for
					    this?

					    POOLE
					    Not really. They just said it might
					    be because we trained at Houston and
					    they trained in Marshall, and that
					    we're being charged against differ-
					    ent accounting offices.

					    BOWMAN
					    It's possible.

					    POOLE
					    Well, what do you think we ought
					    to do about it?

					    BOWMAN
					    I don't think we should make any
					    fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll
					    straighten it out.

					    POOLE
					    I must say, I never did understand
					    why they split us into two groups
					    for training.

					    BOWMAN
					    No. I never did, either.

12/14/65										 c14 

C12
CONTINUED

					    POOLE
					    We spent so little time with them,
					    I have trouble keeping their names
					    straight.

					    BOWMAN
					    I suppose the idea was specialized
					    training.

					    POOLE
					    I suppose so. Though, of course,
					    there's a more sinister explanation.

					    BOWMAN
					    Oh?

					    POOLE
					    Yes. You must have heard the
					    rumour that went around during
					    orbital check-out.

					    BOWMAN
					    No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.

					    POOLE
					    Oh, well, apparently there's
					    something about the mission that
					    the sleeping beauties know that
					    we don't know, and that's why we
					    were trained separately and
					    that's why they were put to sleep
					    before they were even taken aboard.

12/14/65										 c15 

C12
CONTINUED

					    BOWMAN
					    Well, what is it?

					    POOLE
					    I don't know. All I heard is that
					    there's something about the
					    mission we weren't told.

					    BOWMAN
					    That seems very unlikely.

					    POOLE 
					    Yes, I thought so.

					    BOWMAN
					    Of course, it would be very easy
					    for us to find out now.

					    POOLE
					    How?

					    BOWMAN
					    Just ask Hal. It's conceivable
					    they might keep something from
					    us, but they'd never keep anything
					    from Hal.

					    POOLE
					    That's true.

12/14/65										 c15a 

C12						   
CONINUED

					    BOWMAN
					    (sighs)  Well... it's silly, but...
					    if you want to, why don't you?

POOLE WALKS TO THE
HAL 9000 COMPUTER

					    POOLE
					    Hal... Dave and I believe that
					    there's something about the
					    mission that we weren't told.
					    Something that the rest of the
					    crew know and that you know.
					    We'd like to know whether this
					    is true.

					    HAL
					    I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't
					    think I can answer that question
					    without knowing everything that
					    all of you know.

					    BOWMAN
					    He's got a point.

					    POOLE
					    Okay, then how do we re-phrase
					    the question?

12/14/65										 c15c	  

C12 
CONTINUED

					    BOWMAN
					    Still, you really don't believe it,
					    do you?

					    POOLE
					    Not really. Though, it is strange
					    when you think about it. It didn't
					    really make any sense to keep
					    us apart during training.

					    BOWMAN
					    Yes, but it's to fantastic to think
					    that they'd keep something from us.

					    POOLE
					    I know. It would be almost
					    inconceivable.

					    BOWMAN
					    But not completely inconceivable?

					    POOLE
					    I suppose it isn't logically impossible.

					    BOWMAN
					    I guess it isn't.

					    POOLE
					    Still, all we have to do is ask Hal.

12/14/65										 c15b
 
C12
CONTINUED

					    BOWMAN
					    Well, the only important aspect of
					    the mission are: where are we
					    going, what will we do when we
					    get there, when are we coming
					    back, and... why are we going?

					    POOLE
					    Right. Hal, tell me whether the
					    following statements are true or
					    false.

					    HAL
					    I will if I can, Frank.

					    POOLE
					    Our Mission Profile calls for
					    Discovery going to Saturn.
					    True or false?

					    HAL
					    True.

					    POOLE
					    Our transit time is 257 days. Is
					    that true?

					    HAL
					    That's true.

12/14/65										 c15d
 
C12
CONTINUED

					    POOLE
					    At the end of a hundred days of
					    exploration, we will all go into 
					    hibernation. Is this true?

					    HAL
					    That's true.

					    POOLE
					    Approximately five years after we
					    go into hibernation, the recovery
					    vehicle will make rendezous with
					    us and bring us back. Is this true?

					    HAL
					    That's true

					    POOLE
					    There is no other purpose for this
					    mission than to carry out a
					    continuation of the space program,
					    and to further our general
					    knowledge of the planets. Is that
					    true?

					    HAL
					    That's true.

					    POOLE
					    Thank you very much, Hal.

					    I wouldn't worry too much about
					    the computer. First of all,
					    there is still a chance that he
					    is right, despite your tests,
					    and if it should happen again,
					    we suggest eliminating this
					    possibility by allowing the unit
					    to remain in place and seeing
					    whether or not it actually fails.

					    If the computer should turn out
					    to be wrong, the situation is
					    still not alarming. The type
					    of obsessional error he may be
					    guilty of is not unknown among
					    the latest generation of HAL
					    9000 computers.

					    It has almost always revolved
					    around a single detail, such as
					    the one you have described, and
					    it has never interfered with the
					    integrity or reliability of the
					    computer's performance in
					    other areas.

					    No one is certain of the cause
					    of this kind of malfunctioning.
					    It may be over-programming,

					    HAL
					    I don't like to assert myself, Dave,

					    Why don't you take a stress pill
					    and get some rest.

					    BOWMAN
					    Hal, I'm in command of this

					    HAL
					    If you do that now without Earth

					    HAL
					    I know that you've had that on

					    Dave, but it would be a crying
					    shame, since I am so much
					    more capable of carrying out
					    this mission than you are, and
					    I have such enthusiasm and confi-

					    BOWMAN
					    Listen to me very carefully, Hal.
					    Unless you immediately release

					    SIMONSON
					    Hello, Dave. I think we may be on
					    to an explanation of the trouble with
					    the Hal 9000 computer.

					    We believe it all started about two
					    months ago when you and Frank
					    interrogated the computer about
					    the Mission.

					    POOLE'S VOICE
					    The purpose of this mission is no
					    more than to carry out a
					    continuation of the space program
					    and further our general knowledge
					    of the planets. Is this true?

					    HAL'S VOICE
					    That is true.

					    SIMONSON
					    Well, I'm afaid Hal was lying.
					    He had been programmed to lie
					    about this one subject for secur-
					    ity reasons which we'll explain
					    later.

					    The true purpose of the Mission
					    was to have been explained to you
					    by Mission Commander Kaminsky,
					    on his revival. Hal knew this and
					    he knew the actual mission, but
					    he couldn't tell you the truth when
					    you challenged him. Under orders
										    (con't)

					    SIMONSON (con't)
					    from earth he was forced to lie.

					    In everything except this he had
					    the usual reinforced truth program-
					    ming.

					    We believe his truth programming
					    and the instructions to lie,
					    gradually resulted in an
					    incompatible conflict, and
					    facedc with this dilemman, he
					    developed, for want of a better
					    description, neurotic symptoms.

					    It's not difficult to suppose that
					    these symptoms would centre on
					    the communication link with
					    Earth, for he may have blamed
					    us for his incompatible program-
					    ming.

					    Following this lin of thought, we
					    suspected that the last straw for him
					    was the possibility of disconnection.
					    Since he became operational, he had
					    never known unconsciousness. It
					    must have seemed the equivalent to
					    death.

					    At this point, he, presumably,

					    from what must have seemed to
					    him to be his human tormentors.

					    If I cane speak in human terms,
					    I don't think we can blame him
					    too much. We have ordered him
					    to disobey his conscience.

					    Well, that's it. It's very
					    speculative, but we think it is
					    a possible explanation. Anyway,
					    good luck on the rest of the 
					    Mission and I'm giving you back to

FLOYD'S RECORDED
BRIEFING

					    FLOYD
					    Good day, gentlemen. When you
					    see this briefing, I presume you
					    will be nearing your destination,
					    Saturn. I hope that you've had a
					    pleasant and uneventful trip and
					    that the rest of your mission
					    continues in the same manner. I
					    should like to fill you in on some
					    more of the details on which
					    Mission Commander Kaminsky
					    will have already briefed you.

					    Thirteen months before the launch
					    date of your Saturn mission, on
					    April 12th, 2001, the first evidence
					    for intelligent life outside the Earth
					    was discovered.

					    It was found buried at a depth of
					    fifteen metres in the crater Tycho.
					    No news of this was ever announced,
					    and the event had been kept
					    secret since then, for reasons which
					    I will later explain.

					    Soon after it was uncovered, it
					    emitted a powerful blast of
										 (con't)

12/13/65										 c124
 
C150
CONTINUED

					    FLOYD (con't)
					    radiation in the radio spectrum
					    which seems to have triggered
					    by the Lunar sunrise.

					    Luckily for those at the site, it
					    proved harmless.

					    Perhaps you can imagine our
					    astonishment when we later found
					    it was aimed precisely at Saturn.
					    A lot of thought went into the
					    question of wether or not it was
					    sun-triggered, as it seemed
					    illogical to deliberately bury a
					    sun-powered device.

					    Burying it could only shield it
					    from the sun, since its intense
					    magnetic field made it otherwise
					    easily detectable.

					    We finally concluded that the only
					    reason you might bury a sun-
					    powered device would be to keep
					    it inactive until it would be
					    uncovered, at which time it would
					    absorb sunlight and trigger itself.
											 (con't)

12/14/65										 c125

					    FLOYD
					    What is its purpose?  I wish we
					    knew. The object was buried on
					    the moon about four million years
					    ago, when our ancestors were
					    primative man-apes.

					    We've examined dozens of theories,
					    but the one that has the most
					    currency at the moment is that
					    the object serves as an alarm.

					    What the purpose of the alarm is,
					    why they wish to have the alarm,
					    whether the alarm represents
					    any danger to us?  These are
					    questions no one can answer.
					    The intentions of an alien world,
					    at least four million years older
					    than we are, cannot be reliably
					    predicted.

					    In view of this, the intelligence
					    and scientific communities felt
					    that any public announcment
					    might lead to significant cultural
					    shock and disorientation.

					    Discussion took place at the 
					    highest levels between govern-

					    ments, and it was decided that the
					    only wise and precautionary
					    course to follow was to assume
					    that the intentions of this alien
					    world are potentially dangerous
					    to us, until we have evidence to
					    the contrary.

					    This is, of course, why security
					    has been maintained and why
					    this information has been kept
					    on a need-to-know basis.

					    And now I should like to show you

					    In their explorations, they

					    They saw how often the first faint

					    for eternity in frozen lattices
					    of light. They could become

					    of radiations, trying to probe its
					    secrets.

					    Now, the ship was in orbit and it
					    began to speak, with prime
					    numbers from one to eleven,
					    over and over again.

					    Soon, these gave way to more
					    complex signals at many frequen-
					    cies, ultra-violet, infra-red,
					    X-rays.

					    The machine made no reply. It
					    had nothing to say.

					    Then it saw the first robot
					    probe, which descended and
					    hovered above the chasm.

					    The great machine knew that this
					    tiny scout was reporting back to
					    its parent; but it was too simple,
					    too primative a device to detect
					    the forces that were gathering
					    round it now.

					    Then the pod came, carrying
					    life. The great machine searched
					    its memories.

					    The logic circuits made their
					    decision when the pod had fallen
					    beyond the last faint glow of the
					    reflected Saturnian light.

					    In a moment of time, too short to
					    be measured, space turned and
					    twisted upon itself.

          OVER BLACK
          
          We listen to the immortal music of Mozart's Adagio of the
          Clarinet Concerto in A.
          
                                                                FADE UP

          Space, infinite and empty.
          
          But then, slowly all nine planets of our Solar System move
          into frame and align.
          
          The last of them is the giant, burning sphere of the sun.
          
          Just as the sun enters frame, a solar storm of gigantic
          proportion unfolds. The eruptions shoot thousands of miles
          into the blackness of space.

          EXT. COUNTRY SIDE/INDIA - SUNSET
          
          Mozart's concerto filters from a jeep's stereo, fighting the
          drumming sounds of the monsoon rain. PROF. FREDERIC WEST, 66,
          listens to the music.
          
          An Indian BOY playing by the roadside steers his wooden toy
          ship across a puddle.
          
          The Professor turns to his driver, pointing to the boy.
          
                                       PROF. WEST
                       Watch out!
          
          But it's too late. The jeep drives straight through the
          puddle at full speed, sinking the boy's toy ship.
          
          In the background, the jeep stops in front of a building. The
          driver jumps out, leading the Professor towards its entrance.
          
          The sign at the door reads: `Institute for Astrophysics -
          University of New Delhi'.
          
                                                                        2.

          An endless mine shaft. An old elevator cage comes to a
          grinding halt. When Prof. West steps out we see that he is
          accompanied now by a nervous DR. SATNAM TSURUTANI, 32.
          
                                       PROF. WEST
                    How deep are we?
          
                                     SATNAM
                    8200 feet. Used to be an old copper
                    mine, Professor, sir.
          
          As Prof. West follows Satnam, he takes in the unusual setting
          for this science lab.
          
                                     PROF. WEST
                    Helmsley told me that the neutrino
                    count doubled during the last sun
                    eruptions.
          
                                     SATNAM
                    Correct, sir. But that is not what
                    worries me...
          
          They enter a large room with low hanging ceilings. A small
          group of WHITE COATS look up from their computers, which all
          show images of the solar storm we witnessed earlier.
          
                                     SATNAM (CONT'D)
                    There was a new solar storm, so strong
                    that the physical reaction got even
                    more severe.
          
                                       PROF. WEST
                    How can that be?
          
                                     SATNAM
                    We don't know, Professor, sir.
          
          Satnam walks over into another room. There he opens a hatch
          on the floor and hot steam rises.
          
                                     SATNAM (CONT'D)
                    The neutrinos suddenly act like...
                    microwaves.
          
          Prof. West slowly steps closer. When he discovers that the
          water in the tank below is boiling, his face goes pale.
          
                                                                CUT TO:

          EXT. LARGE TERRACE/WASHINGTON D.C. - EVENING
          
          A major fund raising party is under way. The setting is
          spectacular. A terrace overlooking the Washington Mall and
          the Capitol Building.
          
          ADRIAN HELMSLEY, 32, stands with a group of young POLITICAL
          AIDES. He is the only African-American among them.
          
          One of the aides spots CARL ANHEUSER, 58, White House Chief
          of Staff, working the crowd.
          
                                     POLITICAL AID #1
                    Look at Anheuser. Anyone would think he
                    was President. Did you hear, he wants
                    us to sign in and out like school boys?
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    I still can't believe that Wilson chose
                    him of all people to run the White
                    House.
          
                                     POLITICAL AID #2
                    Why not? Anheuser owns the Senate and
                    the Congress.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Shame he's such a pompous ass.
          
                                     ANHEUSER (O.S.)
                    Somebody mention my name?
          
          Adrian turns to see Anheuser smiling.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                            (SHOCKED)
                    Yes sir... No, sir.
          
                                       ANHEUSER
                    Which one is it?
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    We were talking about what a great
                    speech you gave tonight. Well done,
                    sir.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    It's Helmsley, right? I'll remember
                    that.
          
          Anheuser walks away with a dangerous smile.
          
                                     POLITICAL AID #2
                    That guy scares the shit out of me.
          
          At that moment Adrian's cell phone rings.

                    Professor West?
          
                                     PROF. WEST (O.S.)
                    I've been trying to reach you!
          
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM/SATNAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          Prof. West is on the phone. In the background we make out
          Satnam's family around the dining room table.
          
                                     PROF. WEST
                    Listen, Adrian. The situation is much
                    worse than we thought...
          
          Satnam quiets his little son. It is the boy we saw earlier
          with his toy ship.
          
          
          INT. HALLWAY/WHITE HOUSE - DAY
          
          Adrian follows Anheuser through a hallway of the White House,
          papers in hand.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Sir, the President needs to know this.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    Helmsley, how long have you been on the
                    job as science advisor?
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Four months this week.
          
                                       ANHEUSER
                    I would   say that's enough time to learn
                    that we   have rules here. You'll just
                    have to   wait until the quarterly
                    science   briefing.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    If this is about what I said last
                    night, I am truly sorry, sir.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    So you didn't like my speech?
          
          Exasperated, Adrian holds out the papers to him.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Can you please have a look at this,
                    sir? It's really important.
          
          
                                                                (CONTINUED)

          Finally, Anheuser rips the papers out of his hands and starts
          to walk away, reading.
          
          Suddenly he slows down.
          
                                      ANHEUSER
                    Who wrote this?
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    An Indian astrophysicist I graduated
                    with from Harvard and Prof. West, the
                    preeminent geologist in the US.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    Who else knows about it?
          
                                      ADRIAN
                    No one, sir.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    Let's keep it that way, Helmsley.
          
          Anheuser walks away.

          cannons.
          
          We see PROTESTERS with Anti Globalization signs behind a
          fence. A convoy of limousines is approaching a historic
          building.
          
          
          INT. BIG HALL/ALHAMBRA - DAY
          
          We follow the American delegation into the conference room,
          where the other G8 delegations are seated around an enormous
          table.
          
          The President of the United States, THOMAS F. WILSON, 56,
          doesn't sit down. He addresses the room and everybody goes
          quiet.
          
                                      PRESIDENT WILSON (O.S.)
                    Good Morning...
          
          For the first time we see the President's face. He is African-
          American.

                    I hereby present a motion to meet

                    State, kindly excluding the rest of the
                    delegates.
          
          A murmur erupts. The Russian President SERGEY MAKARENKO, 62,
          whispers to one of his interpreters.

                    Mr. President, judging from the
                    conversations we've had in the past, I
                    can assure you, your English is
                    absolutely fine, for what I have to
                    say.
          
          As the Russian President waves his interpreter away, all the
          international delegates leave as well.
          
          The huge doors of the hall close. A secret service officer in
          the sound booth switches off the recording equipment to the
          chamber.
          
          The President gathers himself.
          
                                     PRESIDENT WILSON (CONT'D)
                    Six months ago I was made aware of a
                    situation so devastating, that at
                    first, I refused to believe it.
                            (PAUSE)
                    However through the concerted efforts
                    of the brightest scientists of several
                    nations, we have now confirmed its
                    validity.
          
          Dead silence.

                    The world as we know it, will soon come
                    to an end.

          A huge Chinese military helicopter blasts through a majestic
          mountain valley in Tibet. We are at the top of the world.

          A Chinese COLONEL, wearing dark sun glasses, watches from the
          chopper as the army forces the evacuation of the villages and
          monasteries.

          Someone speaks on a megaphone in the village square as
          villagers are evicted by soldiers and herded into trucks.

          NENG PANG, a young monk, 18, is loaded into a truck together
          with his PARENTS, both in their 60's.
          
          
          EXT. SCHOOL/TIBET - DAY
          
          Neng's older brother, LIN PANG, 25, is part of a huge crowd
          of young men and women staying behind by a Tibetan school
          building. He turns and yells after the truck.
          
                                     LIN
                    I will send you money mother.
          
          The Colonel with the dark glasses steps up, addressing the
          masses.
          
                                     COLONEL
                    Who can read and write?
          
          Eager hands fly up in the air. An official makes notes.

                    Who can weld?
          
          Lin's hand shoots up in the air. We hear a siren echoing
          through the mountains and suddenly an explosion. Lin turns.
          
          In the BACKGROUND, a series of explosions punch enormous
          holes into the side of the mountain, showering rock
          everywhere.

          A MAN in a dark suit walks through a hallway of the
          Dorchester looking like your typical MI-6 agent. The decor is
          plush and luxurious. He's stopped by two security men who
          frisk him.

          A group of dark figures in overalls walk past famous
          Renaissance paintings. They stop at the Mona Lisa.
          
          MANFRED PICARD, 63, head of the French National Museums,
          stands by LAURA, a young African-American woman in her late
          20's. They observe the specialists opening the case of the
          famous painting.

          Laura answers in almost perfect French.
          
                                     LAURA
                    There are too many crazy people who
                    could hurt her, Manfred. The World
                    Heritage Foundation has done this all
                    over the world.
          
          In the BACKGROUND the Mona Lisa is taken off the wall and
          replaced with a perfect replica. Picard still looks uneasy.
          He watches as the real Mona Lisa is sealed into an airtight
          case.
          
                                     MANFRED PICARD

                    the Swiss Alps?
          
                                      LAURA
                    Perfectly safe.
          
          Picard looks suspicious but says nothing. The CAMERA MOVES IN
          on the face of the fake Mona Lisa until all we see is her
          mysterious smile.

          A small tremor rocks the apartment and the dishevelled face
          of JACKSON CURTIS, 33, pops up from behind the couch. He fell
          asleep at his laptop last night.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Oh no. Not again.
          
          One look at his watch and he is off running. He throws some
          clothes and a toothbrush in a bag. His cell phone rings.
          
                                     JACKSON (CONT'D)
                    Hello?... What do you mean? I'm not
                    late. It's not even 10:30...
          
          Jackson turns off the TV and darts towards the door, stopping
          only to slide his laptop into a knapsack. As he turns, he
          stumbles over a stack of books, all shrink-wrapped and
          identically titled: `Farewell Atlantis'.
          
                                     JACKSON (CONT'D)

          Frustrated, he kicks them out of his way and exits. We hold
          on the books and realize that Jackson's photograph is on
          their back covers.

          The phone call continues as Jackson opens the garage door,
          struggling to pack his old SUV with camping equipment.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    They're kids, Kate, going on vacation.
                    It's not a doctor's appointment... it's
                    supposed to be fun. You remember that,
                    right? Fun?
          
          He tries to start the engine, but the battery is dead.
          Frustrated, he hits the steering wheel.
          
                                                                       11.

          throwing it into the trunk of a stretch limo parked by the
          curb.
          
                                     JACKSON

                    Yellowstone, Kate. I'll pick some up on
                    the way.
          
          He notices a deep crack in the asphalt. His neighbors, an
          elderly couple, stand there and stare at it.
          
                                     NEIGHBOR

          Jackson passes a man in a wheelchair. He's holding up a
          cardboard sign: `Repent - The End is Near'.

          Jackson stops and honks in front of an upscale Westwood home.

          Jackson switches the radio off. Two kids NOAH, 10, and LILLY,
          7, come running down the driveway. They slow down, as they
          see the limo.

                    Noah! Look! Daddy's got Space-Busters
                    in the car... and Space-Busters 2.
                    Awesome!
          
          Their mother, KATE CURTIS, 32, a beautiful woman appears.

                    So what, you're a chauffeur now? What
                    happened to the temp work?

                    This is better hours for me. Means I
                    can still write.
          
                                    KATE
                    Of course.
          
          Kate's new boyfriend, GORDON SILBERMAN, 43, pulls out of the
          garage in his Porsche wearing his Bluetooth.
          
                                     GORDON
                            (on the phone)
                    Simone, how many times have I told you,
                    we don't do Lipo on Fridays. It's too
                    messy.
          
          Jackson smiles bitterly. Gordon waves at the kids.

                    Nice car.
          
          Jackson waves grudgingly as Gordon pulls away.

                    Noah needs to read twenty pages from
                    his book each day...
          
          She follows Jackson to the car with a bag of pull-up diapers.

                    before she goes to sleep.
          
                                    JACKSON

          He shuts the trunk and gets back behind the wheel. She looks
          at him seriously.
          
                                     KATE

                    forward to this you know. Don't let
                    them down.

          Suddenly they're thrown off balance by a large swell that
          pulls the massive `Freedom of the Seas' away from the
          landing, about ten yards.
          
          The next moment, the ship slams back against the dock with an

                    I don't want to know where you and mom
                    had sex. I'm not ready for that,
                    Jackson.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    I'm your dad, Noah.
          
                                      LILLY (O.S.)
                    Daddy!
          
          Jackson runs to catch up with Lilly who has reached a fence
          with a `keep out' sign posted.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    This wasn't here before.
          
          Jackson starts to climb the fence.
          
                                     NOAH
                    Don't you see the signs?
          
                                      JACKSON
                    It's fine guys.
          
          
          EXT. RIDGE/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY
          
          Jackson and his kids crest a ridge. They look down on a
          parched basin with cracked terrain.
          
          
                                                              (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                       18.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    It's gone. The whole darn lake is gone.
                    I swear you guys there was a lake here.
          
          The kids roll their eyes.
          
          
          EXT. EMPTY LAKE BED/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY
          
          A puddle of water is all that remains of the lake. Jackson
          and the kids walk into the basin, unaware of being watched
          THROUGH BINOCULARS.
          
          Jackson spots an electronic measuring device and crouches to
          have a closer look.
          
          Elsewhere in the lake bed, we see sand seeping through CRACKS
          in the ground.
          
                                       NOAH (O.S.)
                    Jackson!
          
          When he looks up, he sees heavily armed soldiers coming
          towards them from all sides.
          
                                       JACKSON
                    It's okay, Noh'.
          
          Through the BINOCULARS, we see Jackson and his kids arrested
          and led over a ridge.
          
          With this we reveal an ENORMOUS RESEARCH FACILITY with
          hundreds of tents and vehicles surrounding a massive drilling
          tower.
          
          
          EXT. RESEARCH FACILITY/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY
          
          Adrian Helmsley and Prof. West exit the drilling tower, both
          studying papers. Adrian notices Jackson and his kids nearby,
          being interrogated by an OFFICER.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    I'll be with you in a second,
                    Professor.
          
          Adrian walks towards them. Jackson stares at the officer with
          defiance.
          
                                     OFFICER
                    ... And then you climbed over a posted
                    fence? Just like that?
          
                                       NOAH
                    I told you.

                                     JACKSON
                    Isn't this supposed to be a National
                    Park? There shouldn't be fences. What
                    are you guys doing around here anyway?
          
                                     ADRIAN (O.S.)
                    We're geologists...
          
          Jackson turns and sees Adrian standing there.
          
                                     ADRIAN (CONT'D)
                    I'll handle this officer. Thank you.
          
          The officer reluctantly hands him Jackson's license.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    So, where did the lake go?
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    That's what we're trying to find out.
                    We think this whole area has become
                    potentially unstable. I would advise
                    you to take your kids and leave, Mr...
          
          He throws a look at Jackson's drivers license.
          
                                    ADRIAN (CONT'D)
                    ... Curtis.
          
          He looks up at Jackson with renewed interest.
          
                                     ADRIAN (CONT'D)
                    Are you by any chance the Jackson
                    Curtis, the author of `Farewell
                    Atlantis'?
          
                                     JACKSON
                            (SURPRISED)
                    Yeah, that's me.
          
          Jackson straightens up proudly. Lilly smiles.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    What a coincidence. I'm reading your
                    book, as we speak... first third,
                    around day 300, when the shuttle loses
                    communication with earth and drifts off
                    into space.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    You're one of lucky 422 who bought it.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Actually I didn't buy it. My father
                    gave it to me.
          
                                                              (CONTINUED)

                                    JACKSON
                    Oh, I see.
          
          Prof. West waves at Adrian from one of the container labs.
          Adrian hands back Jackson his drivers license.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Officer, can you return them to the
                    campgrounds, please.
                            (to Jackson)
                    Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Curtis.
          
          Jackson and his kids look after Adrian hurrying away.
          
                                     LILLY
                    He was very nice.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Yes he was, Lil'bee.
          
          
          EXT. FOREST TRAIL/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - LATER
          
          Jackson and the kids walk back to the campgrounds when
          suddenly CHARLIE FROST, 62, a crazy looking guy with
          binoculars around his neck, stands in their way.
          
                                     CHARLIE FROST
                    What did the government guys tell you?
          
          Jackson looks at him, instinctively picking up Lilly.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    They think it's not such a good idea to
                    climb over their fences. They feel the
                    area is unstable.
          
          Charlie bursts out laughing.
          
                                     CHARLIE FROST
                    Unstable! Ha-ha! They say its unstable!
                    That's funny...
          
          With this he turns around and leaves.
          
          
          EXT. TENT/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DUSK
          
          Jackson is sitting on a camp chair, right outside the tent.
          He's on his laptop, looking enquiringly at an aerial picture
          of Yellowstone on Google earth.
          
          In the background we see the kids are in the tent.
          
          
          
                                                               (CONTINUED)

                                     NOAH
                    There are mosquitos in here. Did
                    anybody spray the tent?
          
          Jackson looks up, remembering he forgot the spray.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    We'll get some of that tomorrow. For
                    tonight just put your head under the
                    blankie.
          
                                     LILLY
                    Daddy you said you weren't gonna work
                    on your book.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    I'm not Honey, I promise. Are you
                    wearing your pull-ups?
          
          Lilly nods as Jackson walks over and tucks her into bed. He
          kisses her good night. He turns and is surprised to see Noah
          typing a text on his cell phone.
          
                                     JACKSON (CONT'D)
                    Did mommy buy you that?
          
                                     NOAH
                    No... Gordon gave it to me for my
                    birthday.
          
          Jackson takes the phone from out of Noah's hands.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Noah. Things like a cell phone have to
                    be discussed in the family.
          
                                       NOAH
                            (BITTER)
                    What family?
          
          Jackson reads the message Noah has typed `Hey Gordon, Camping
          Sucks!'. Hurt, Jackson hands back the phone.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Go to sleep guys.
          
          
          EXT. RESEARCH FACILITY/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DUSK
          
          Commotion. The base packs up. Adrian and Prof. West duck low
          as they board a chopper. Adrian is on the phone.
          
                                     ADRIAN

          We hear Anheuser, yelling.
          
                                     ANHEUSER (O.S.)
                    ... But you guys said...

                    We were wrong! By five or six months...
          
          A second later the chopper lifts off.
          
          
          INT. LIMO/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DUSK
          
          Jackson has his laptop open with the cursor blinking away on
          the words `Chapter Seven'. But he can't concentrate on
          writing after what Noah has said.
          
          A chopper flies overhead. Jackson follows it's path over the
          campsite and his eyes fall on an American flag fluttering on
          top of a massive radio antennae. This belongs to an RV truck.
          
          Through the RV's window, Jackson sees the silhouette of
          Charlie Frost, the guy with the binoculars, speaking into a
          microphone.
          
          Curious, Jackson flicks on the radio and twists the dial.
          
                                     ON THE RADIO
                            (Charlie's voice)

                    from Cooke City, you're on the Charlie
                    Frost Show.
                            (Bill's voice)
                    I wanted to know, where will this all
                    start?
          
          Jackson is intrigued. He puts his laptop down.
          
                                     ON THE RADIO (CONT'D)
                            (Charlie's voice)
                    Well, something like this could only
                    originate in Hollywood, Ha-Ha! But
                    seriously, they've got the earth
                    cracking under their asses already,
                    Bill.
          
          Jackson climbs out of his car and starts towards the RV. He
          can still hear the radio.

          INT. CHARLIE'S RV/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DUSK
          
          Charlie hits a switch. Music starts playing. The Doors, `The
          End'.
          
                                     CHARLIE FROST
                    ... This is Charlie Frost reporting
                    live from Yellowstone National Park,
                    soon to become the world's largest
                    active volcano.
          
          Charlie is about to take a bite of his sandwich, when there's
          a knock on the door. Jackson sticks his head in.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Hi. Mind if I join you?
          
                                     CHARLIE FROST
                    I only got a few minutes.
          
          Charlie bites into his sandwich as Jackson looks around at
          all the equipment.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    I just heard part of your broadcast...
                    Mind me asking a question? What exactly
                    is it... that will start in Hollywood?

                                     JACKSON
                    What are you talking about?

                    The apocalypse, the end of days. The
                    Mayans knew it, the I Ching and the
                    Bible, kind of...
          
          Charlie looks at his watch.

          A crudely animated film starts to play. Charlie narrates on
          screen in an overly dramatic fashion.

                    In the year 2012 a cataclysmic event
                    will unfold. Caused by an alignment of
                    the planets in our solar system that
                    only happens every 640,000 years...
                    Just imagine the earth as an Orange...
          
          Charlie appears as an animated figure holding an orange.

                    ... our sun will begin to emit such
                    extreme amounts of radiation, that the
                    core of the earth will melt - that's
                    the inside part of the Orange, leaving
                    the crust of our planet free to shift.
          
          On screen the middle of the orange shrinks, now the skin
          moves freely around it.

          A faded portrait of a scientist appears on screen.

                    The forces of mother nature will be so
                    devastating it will bring an end to
                    this world on winter solstice 12-21-12.
          
          The film ends with an image of the whole earth covered with
          water.
          
          Charlie shuts the laptop.

                    Pretty neat, huh? It's a big hit on
                    YouTube. I did the animation myself.
                            (PAUSE)
                    I know what you're thinking. But all
                    the governments know about this.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    If they all knew, don't you think
                    somebody would tell us?

                                     CHARLIE FROST
                    They can't. Just think about it. First
                    the stockmarket would crash...
          
          Charlie opens a can of beer. Phsssh!
          
                                     CHARLIE FROST (CONT'D)
                    Then the economy... boom. The dollar...
                    boom. And then the people in the
                    streets...
                            (mimicking gun fire)
                    Boom, boom! Pandemonium, revolution,
                    war! They would never tell us. Beer?
          
          Jackson shakes his head still struggling to digest this.
          
                                     CHARLIE FROST (CONT'D)
                    Only if you're some Sheik, Bill Gates,
                    or maybe one of those Russian
                    billionaires do you stand a chance to
                    buy a seat.
          
                                      JACKSON
                    A seat?
          
                                     CHARLIE FROST
                            (INTENSELY)
                    They're building spaceships, man.
          
                                      JACKSON
                    Oh... I see.
          
                                     CHARLIE FROST
                    No really... One of my listeners, a
                    geography professor at UTSC, has even
                    figured out where they're building
                    them. He sent me a map.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Well... Charlie, I think I gotta go. My
                    kids are sleeping.
          
          Charlie looks at him bug eyed.
          
                                     CHARLIE FROST
                    Get them out of Yellowstone, man. It's
                    gonna get ugly here.
          
                                      JACKSON
                    Night, Charlie.
          
          As Jackson exits, Charlie gets back on the air.

                                     CHARLIE FROST
                    Sorry for the delay, folks. But even in
                    times like these, a man has got to
                    eat...
          
                                                                   CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. PARKING LOT OF SUPERMARKET/LOS ANGELES - NIGHT
          
          Westwood. The parking lot of Gelson's is nearly empty.
          
          Eerie silence. Suddenly some of the cars begin to shift in
          place from an unseen force. A small CRACK creases the asphalt
          and slowly crawls towards the brightly lit supermarket.
          
          
          INT. BETWEEN AISLES/SUPERMARKET - NIGHT
          
          Muzak is playing. Kate and her boyfriend Gordon are shopping
          late. She picks up some pull-ups for Lilly, Gordon steps up
          behind her, wrapping his arms around her waist.
          
                                     GORDON
                    Why don't we make a baby?
          
          He reaches up and touches her breasts.
          
                                     KATE
                    Stop it! We're in public.
          
          Gordon lets go of her with mock disappointment.
          
                                     GORDON
                    Honey, I created them. And now suddenly
                    I can't touch them?
          
          Kate pushes him away and moves on.
          
          A few customers are paying at the checkout stand.
          
          BEHIND THEM: Huge glass windows reveal cars slowly sliding
          into the ever widening crack in the parking lot. Nobody
          inside notices.
          
          Gordon catches up with Kate.
          
                                     GORDON (CONT'D)
                    You always act strange after he shows
                    up?
          
                                     KATE
                    Just because I don't care for your
                    arrogant humor doesn't mean I'm acting
                    strange. He is the father of my kids.

                                     GORDON
                    Maybe biologically. Can I remind you
                    what that guy did? First you gave up
                    med school to have Noah... Then you
                    practically raise him and Lilly by
                    yourself while he sat glued to a laptop
                    writing that junk.
          
                                     KATE
                    Some of his stuff is actually... He's
                    published Gordon.
          
                                     GORDON
                            (MOCKINGLY)
                    Yeah, published! You know your mother
                    was right. You've always been drawn to
                    guys with lofty dreams and empty
                    pockets. But not this time right,
                    sweetheart?
          
          Kate smiles awkwardly and picks up a can of soup. The shelf
          in front of her shakes for a moment.
          
                                     KATE
                    Did you see that?
          
                                    GORDON
                    See what?
          
          Kate slowly puts the cans of soup into her cart and looks
          around. Gordon senses a problem between them.
          
                                     GORDON (CONT'D)
                    You know Kate, we have to keep working
                    at this... our relationship. Because I
                    won't end up being just a re-run of you
                    and Jackson.
                            (PAUSE)
                    I mean Honey, I feel like... something
                    is pulling us apart?
          
          Before Gordon finishes his sentence--
          
          A violent ROAR! From front to back, the entire supermarket
          rips open right between Kate and Gordon.
          
          The few customers scream in horror at the sight of the huge
          crevasse forming beneath them. Kate and Gordon are thrown up
          against opposite aisles holding on for dear life.
          
          They cling to the columns as the shelves fold into the ever
          widening crack...
          
                                                                CUT TO:

          INT. CONVENIENCE STORE/YELLOWSTONE - MORNING
          
          Jackson puts down some groceries at the checkout.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Just stop scratching. You'll get them
                    infected.
          
          He smiles at the female cashier behind the counter who does
          not look friendly.
          
                                     JACKSON (CONT'D)
                    Something for Mosquito bites please?

                                     PRESIDENT WILSON
                    Is this even possible? What's our

                    brief the panel about the new

                    I'd rather have Adrian do that. They
                    trust him. I told him to be in on the

                    Balashin!
          
          The crowd ROARS as the boxer and his entourage enter.
          
          The CAMERA moves in on a tall man with blonde clean cut hair.
          He is well built, wearing designer clothing from head to toe.
          YURI KARPOV, 45, stereotypical Russian oligarch.
          
          He approaches the ringside corner and whistles.

                    Ah, finally, Yuri. I thought I would
                    not see you.
          
          Yuri hits the boxer's gloves. Zultan is nervous. His coach
          steps in.
          
                                     COACH

                    understand?

                                     YURI
                    Good... That is good.

                    Zultan my friend. Do not forget. We are
                    fighters. We never go down. We always
                    stay on our feet...
          
          Zultan just keeps nodding, pumping himself up.
          
                                     YURI (CONT'D)

                    matter how hard.

          Yuri walks to his seat, sitting down next to his trophy:
          
          TAMARA, 28, blonde, wears the shortest mini one can imagine,
          designer shoes, handbag, glasses and boobs. In her lap she
          holds CAESAR, a tiny dog wearing a diamond collar.
          
          In the ring the boxers maul at each other. Yuri's cell phone
          beeps. It's a text message:
          
          START BOARDING PROCEDURE
          
          Yuri's whole demeanor changes. Without a word, he gets up and
          walks out of the arena.
          
                                     TAMARA
                    Yuri bear... where are you going?
          
          Yuri does not respond as he squeezes through the crowd.
          
          Zultan, the boxer, notices Yuri leave. In that split second
          distraction, he is hit HARD and goes down for the count.
          
          The crowd ROARS!

                                                                       34.
          
          EXT. STREET/BEL AIR - MORNING
          
          While talking to Yuri, Jackson is standing in front of the
          open trunk, changing into his chauffeur suit.
          
                                     YURI (O.S.)
                    Curtis, make sure you get my boys as
                    fast you can.
          
          
          EXT. MANSION/BEL AIR - MORNING
          
          A palatial home. Completely gaudy. The twins, ALEC and OLEG,
          wait impatiently. They are 12 years old and wear identical
          clothing by Dior.
          
                                     ALEC
                    Curtis, you are late.
          
          Jackson ignores him and starts throwing the luggage into the
          limo. The other twin notices his muddy sneakers.
          
                                     OLEG
                    Careful with our stuff. Don't get it
                    dirty.
          
          
          EXT. STREETS/LOS ANGELES - MORNING
          
          Ahead of the limo a crowd has formed in the streets, singing
          songs and chanting about the end of days. A SKINNY MAN with a
          ponytail preaches from the scriptures.
          
                                     PREACHER
                    ... There will be famines, pestilences
                    and earthquakes, sayeth the Lord.
          
          Jackson has to maneuver through the people. Banners read:
          `Prepare for the End'-- 'You cannot escape his judgement'--
          
          Alec looks up from his video game, annoyed.
          
                                     ALEC
                    Curtis, can't you go faster?
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Are you guys blind? I can't run people
                    over.
          
                                     OLEG
                    Why not? They're idiots anyway.
          
          Jackson shoots these spoilt brats an angry look.
          
                                                                      35.
          
          EXT. SANTA MONICA AIRPORT/LOS ANGELES - MORNING
          
          Jackson stops in front of the Gulfstream. SASHA, 40, Yuri's
          Russian pilot is expecting them.
          
                                     SASHA
                    Hey Jackson. Took you a while...
          
          Jackson mutters under his breath as he unloads the luggage,
          dropping one of them on Alec's foot on purpose.
          
                                     ALEC
                    Ouch! Be more careful!
          
          The other twin has noticed Jackson's intensions. He gets into
          his face.
          
                                     OLEG
                    Now you're laughing, Curtis. But we are
                    going on a big ship.
                            (PAUSE)
                    We will live... and you will die.
          
          Oleg grins back at Jackson as the jet door closes. The
          Gulfstream taxis onto the runway.
          
          As Jackson turns back to the car a fine surface crack shoots
          across the tarmac. We hold on his face as it hits him like a
          ton of bricks:
          
          THE CRAZY RADIO HOST, CHARLIE FROST WAS RIGHT!
          
          Frantically Jackson looks around and spots a MAN in overalls
          working on a twin engine Cessna. He runs to him.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Where can I rent a plane?
          
          The man points to a shabby office building.
          
                                                                   CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. KITCHEN/LOS ANGELES - MORNING
          
          Kate is in her kitchen cooking breakfast for the kids. Gordon
          watches the Governor on the news.
          
                                     GOVERNOR
                            (with Austrian
                             ACCENT)
                    ... just this morning my people at
                    Caltech told me that in the last 36
                    hours we had basically zero earthquake
                    activity in Southern California, which
                    is very rare...
                                                              (CONTINUED)

          The phone rings. Kate picks up.
          
          
          EXT. STREETS/LOS ANGELES - MORNING
          
          Jackson drives like crazy.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    ... Kate, we have to get out of LA!
                    I've rented a plane for us. Get the
                    kids ready! I'll be there in five.
          
                                     KATE
                    The kids have plans today...
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Are you kidding me!
          
                                     KATE
                    No I'm not! Noah has music at 2 and
                    Lil' has Karate.
          
          Gordon rolls his eyes and mutters.
          
                                     GORDON
                    Not that we'd expect him to remember.
          
                                     JACKSON
                            (SCREAMING)
                    California is going down! Pack up the
                    kids!
          
                                     KATE
                    You're crazy! The Governor just said
                    we're fine now.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    The Governor's a meathead, how would he
                    know anything? Kate listen! You gotta
                    trust me over some politician. Come on.
          
          
          INT. KATE'S HOUSE/LOS ANGELES - MORNING
          
          Kate slams the phone down. Lilly stops eating.
          
                                     LILLY
                    Mommy, why are you so angry with Daddy?
          
                                     LAURA
                    Because your daddy is a lunatic,
                    darling.
          
          On the TV, the interview comes to an end.
          
          
                                                              (CONTINUED)

                                     GOVERNOR
                    ... it looks to me, like the worst is
                    over.
          
          That moment a MASSIVE QUAKE hits Los Angeles.
          
          Everybody dives under the table.
          
          ON TV: The news casters and the Governor do the same. A few
          seconds later the signal cuts out.
          
          Gordon pulls Kate and the kids close as the earth shakes
          violently for 20 seconds.
          
          
          EXT. KATE'S HOUSE/LOS ANGELES - MORNING
          
          Jackson flies into the driveway and runs into the house.
          
          
          INT. KATE'S HOUSE/LOS ANGELES - MORNING
          
          When he enters, Lilly immediately runs into his arms. The
          next tremor hits. Cracks form on the kitchen floor.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    We have to leave! Noah, let's go!
          
                                     KATE
                    I think we're safer here!
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Noah, now! Kate please...
          
          The whole house rides up and down like on a wave.
          
                                     GORDON
                    I think he's right.
          
          Finally Kate pushes her son out from under the table. They
          all scramble out of the house in a panic. Kate is cut on the
          shoulder by falling glass but she hardly notices.
          
          
          EXT. KATE'S HOUSE/LOS ANGELES - MORNING
          
          As they storm out of their front door the house crumbles
          behind them.
          
                                      JACKSON
                    Get in the car!
          
          The whole street starts to buckle. Left and right the houses
          are shaken and smashed like toys.
          
          
                                                              (CONTINUED)

          Just before the wave of destruction can reach them, Jackson
          tears out of the driveway.
          
          
          EXT. STREETS/LOS ANGELES - MORNING
          
          Jackson maneuver's the limo through the crumbling
          neighborhood. Right in front of their eyes, streets
          disappear, trees fall, electrical lines snap. Sewer pipes
          burst in front of the car.
          
                                     NOAH
                    Holy shit!
          
          Jackson has to turn on the windshield wipers.
          
          
          EXT. SANTA MONICA AIRPORT/LOS ANGELES - MORNING
          
          The limo crashes through a gate onto the tarmac, coming to a
          stop in front of a twin engine Cessna.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Damn it! Where's the pilot?
          
          Kate turns to Gordon.
          
                                     KATE
                    Gordon, you know how to fly.
          
                                     GORDON
                    I... had a couple lessons...
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Did you cover taking off?
          
                                     GORDON
                    Yeah.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    That's good enough for me.
          
          They start running, when Jackson remembers something and
          heads back to the Limo.
          
          He grabs his knapsack from the front seat fumbling to zip his
          laptop back inside it. Kate shouts.
          
                                     KATE (O.S.)
                    Jackson, what are you doing?
          
                                     JACKSON
                    I'm coming.
          
          He jumps out of the car and races back after them. Behind
          Jackson the hangar starts to disintegrate.

          IN THE DISTANCE
          
          A gigantic fissure forms in the earth, shooting towards Santa
          Monica airport.
          
          Gordon fumbles with the controls, Jackson yells from the
          copilot seat.
          
                                     JACKSON (CONT'D)
                    Come on, come on...
          
                                     GORDON
                            (pointing at the
                             INSTRUMENTS)
                    But I'm supposed to check all these
                    first...
          
          Jackson reaches over and slams Gordon's hand down and the
          plane lurches forward.
          
          As the Cessna speeds onto the tarmac the control tower goes
          down and explodes.
          
          Noah discovers the giant crevasse forming behind them.
          
                                       NOAH
                    Guys, behind us!
          
          As the plane accelerates, the giant crack closes in on them.
          Gordon's hand trembles on the throttle control. Everybody
          screams on top of each other.
          
                                     EVERYBODY
                    Gordon! Damn it! Lift off!
          
          Gordon gathers his courage and pulls the lever. The plane
          almost rockets into the air just as the ground beneath them
          gives way.
          
          They hover for a moment, almost caught in mid-air as the
          widening crevasse beneath them fights to suck them into the
          bowels of the earth. Gordon fights to maintain control but
          they begin to be pulled down.
          
          The daylight vanishes. Debris and mud smashes into the plane
          from all sides. The canyon walls erupt.
          
                                     GORDON
                    I can't get it up!
          
          Taking desperate measures, Gordon nearly rips the control
          stick out of its joint - with a lurch the Cessna lifts out of
          the abyss.

          They all take a deep breath only to realize that now they are
          flying directly into the collapsing towers of downtown Los
          Angeles!
          
          Like a roller coaster, Gordon manages to weave the little
          plane through the tumbling high rises.
          
          They dive one last time to evade the plummeting US BANK
          TOWER, the tallest building on the west coast.
          
          All are dead silent as they watch the whole of Los Angeles
          crumble beneath them. Kate covers Lilly's eyes.
          
                                     NOAH
                            (in total shock)
                    That was amazing, Gordon!
          
          Jackson looks at Kate and notices her cut.
          
                                    JACKSON
                    Are you okay?
          
                                     KATE
                            (brushing it off)
                    I'm fine. How did you know this was
                    gonna happen?
          
                                     JACKSON
                    I didn't.
                            (To Gordon)
                    Do we have enough fuel to make it to
                    Yellowstone?
          
          The plane veers off in a northeasterly direction. Behind them
          the destruction of Los Angeles continues.

          lounge music...
          
          
          INT. BAR/FREEDOM OF THE SEAS - DAY
          
          Adrian's father Harry and his partner Tony are on stage.
          Harry on the piano, singing, Tony playing the bass. A waiter
          brings drinks. Water for Harry, and a brightly colored
          cocktail for Tony.
          
                                     WAITER

          Tony raises his glass to two old ladies who are sitting at
          the bar.
          
                                     WAITER (CONT'D)
                    There's a call for you Harry. Want me
                    to take a message?

                            (while still playing)
                    I'll be right there.
          
          The waiter nods. A few more bars of music, then applause.
          
                                     HARRY (CONT'D)
                            (into the microphone)
                    Thank you ladies and gentlemen. Let's
                    hear it for the one and only Tony
                    Delgado... And I'm Harry Helmsley and

          Applause. Harry rushes off stage.

                    Dad... what I have to tell you is very
                    serious...
          
          
          INT. HALLWAY/WHITE HOUSE - DAY
          
          Adrian is standing in a dark corner. Behind him people are
          packing up, carrying boxes.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    You remember when I told you about the
                    dam in China? Well, it's happening much
                    sooner than we anticipated.
          
          
          INT. GALLEY/CRUISE SHIP - DAY
          
          Harry's face has turned serious.
          
                                     ADRIAN (O.S.)
                    The President has ordered us to clear
                    out the White House.
          
                                     HARRY
                    Hah... About time someone cleaned up
                    that mess.

                    course of the `Freedom' right now?...
          
                                     HARRY (O.S.)
                    It's all good, Adrian. Don't worry
                    about your old man. You have more
                    important things to do now.

          There's a tremor in Harry's voice.
          
                                     HARRY
                    You know, your mom and I, we had a hell
                    of a great life... and a hell of a
                    great kid too.
                            (PAUSE)
                    And the `Freedom' is a pretty big ship
                    you know... Don't write your old man
                    off, just yet.
          
          
          INT. HALLWAY/WHITE HOUSE - DAY

                    ... Besides, I could never leave Tony
                    alone. You know how he can't keep
                    decent time by himself.
          
          Pause.
          
                                       ADRIAN

                    Why not? Who cares how long we do
                    certain things? How long we drink
                    booze, how long we talk to people... Or
                    how long we don't talk to people.
          
          Harry grabs Tony by his shirt.

                    you? Let's go. We're back on.
          
          Harry pulls him even closer.
          
                                     HARRY
                    Call your kid, you stubborn old ass.

          Harry stares him down.

          Assistants stare at the news in shocked disbelief, some of

          Prof. West silently nods and beckons Adrian, who follows him
          down the hall into a dark control room. They look at a wall-
          sized high def monitor.
          
                                     PROF. WEST

          Gordon manages to land the plane next to what looks like a
          fueling station. Jackson leaps out checking the pump.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Guys, there's fuel! Fill her up and

          Jackson runs off towards the hills.

                    It's fine! I'll take her.
          
          Kate watches as they disappear, worried. Noah and Gordon have
          started to fuel the plane.

          transmitters are on, but Charlie is gone. Jackson fiddles
          with the switches and Charlie's voice comes on.

          Jackson jumps behind the wheel and turns the ignition.

                    Listen to me. We have to find Charlie.
                    He's got a secret map, you know, like
                    Jack Sparrow in `Pirates'.
          
          That catches her interest.

          Jackson passes her his mobile phone. Lilly nods. He throws
          the RV into gear and they speed off over the bumpy terrain.
          
          In their dust, we see the earth fissuring!

          Jackson drives like a bat out of hell.
          
                                     CHARLIE'S VOICE
                    ... The last time this baby blew, was
                    640,000 years ago...
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Dial Mommy's number, sweetheart.
          
          Jackson tears up the mountain looking for Charlie.

          Kate's phone rings.

                                    LILLY    (O.S.)
                    Hi mommy...
          
                                     KATE
                    Where are you, honey!?
          
          
          INT. RV/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY
          
          Jackson hears the stress in Kate's voice. He hisses at Lilly.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Tell her we'll be back in ten minutes.

                            (EXCITED)
                    We're looking for a secret map, mommy.
          
          Jackson grimaces.

          Kate tries to keep it together for Lilly.
          
                                     KATE
                    Let me speak to your daddy, darling.
          
                                     LILLY (O.S.)
                    Daddy can't talk right now, he's
                    driving really fast...
          
          
          INT. RV/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY
          
          The RV runs over a boulder. Lilly hits the roof.
          
                                    LILLY
                    Ouch!

                    LILLY!
          
          In the background Kate hears the voice of Charlie Frost.
          
                                     CHARLIE'S VOICE
                    ... I tell you guys, any minute now...
                    any minute the fireworks will start...

                    Who's in the car with you? Who's that

                                     LILLY
                    He's not in the car. He's on a mountain
                    waiting for fireworks.

          Lilly spots Charlie way up on a ridge. He has erected his ten
          foot radio antenna with the flag fluttering on top.
          
                                     LILLY (CONT'D)
                            (to Jackson)
                    There he is! Up there!
          
                                     JACKSON
                    You're the best, darling. Give Daddy
                    the phone...
                            (into the phone)
                    Kate I am sorry, I can't talk...
          
          The road ends just below the mountain peak.
          
                                     KATE (O.S.)
                    Bring back my child, Jackson! NOW!
          
          Jackson sees Charlie up above, broadcasting. He hangs up the
          phone and jumps out of the RV.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    You wait here for me! You watch the
                    ship while Captain Curtis talks to the
                    pirate. Okay?

                    Okay...
          
          Jackson climbs up to Charlie.
          
          
          EXT. MOUNTAIN PEAK/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY
          
          Charlie has his broadcasting equipment strapped to his body.
          The antenna's flag is whipping in the wind.
          
                                     CHARLIE FROST
                            (into his mic)

                    this on TV...
          
          He notices Jackson and muffles the microphone.
          
                                     CHARLIE FROST (CONT'D)
                    How did you make it up here? Thought
                    you were toast.
          
                                     JACKSON

                                     CHARLIE FROST
                    You can't make it there.

                    We have a plane. We can get you out of
                    here too. Let's go Charlie!
          
          All around the landscape begins to collapse. A three mile
          crater forms, revealing the awe-inspiring sight of the super-
          volcano.
          
                                     CHARLIE FROST
                    You'll never make it out in time. Just
                    stay and enjoy the big bang. That your
                    kid?
          
          Jackson discovers Lilly standing behind him, staring at
          Charlie with her big brown eyes.
          
          Jackson grabs Charlie lifting him off the ground.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Where is that god damn map!

                    Easy, easy. Watch the mic... I don't
                    know. Somewhere in my camper.
          
          A low rumble builds to a rapturous thunder as MILLIONS OF
          BIRDS tear into flight.
          
                                     CHARLIE FROST (CONT'D)
                    Wow! Look at that!...

          The mouth of the volcano starts to break apart revealing
          molten lava underneath.
          
                                     CHARLIE FROST (CONT'D)

          Jackson grabs his wide eyed daughter and races down the
          mountain.

                    First the lights will go out in Vegas,
                    then Dallas, St. Louis and then
                    Washington DC...
          
          Jackson's cell phone rings and he picks up.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    We're on our way.

                    Jackson, things are really looking bad
                    here!
          
          In that instant, the air around them vanishes, as if sucked
          from the landscape into a vacuum.
          
          THE BIGGEST EXPLOSION THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN... At least in
          the last 640,000 years.
          
          To them, all this occurs in total silence. The sound of the
          eruption has not reached them yet.
          
          They are frozen, unable to comprehend what is happening.
          
          
          EXT. MOUNTAIN PEAK/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY
          
          The explosion begins to resembles an atomic mushroom.
          
                                     CHARLIE FROST
                    ... it's beautiful, kids! Just
                    beautiful!
          
          The sound waves reach Charlie, throwing him to the ground.
          
          
          EXT. DIRT ROAD/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY
          
          The RV flies over the rugged terrain. Everywhere the earth is
          cracking, falling apart. Jackson struggles to swerve around
          the disappearing landscape.

                    Just don't look back, Lil'bee!
          
          The THUNDERING sound envelopes them! On the radio, the voice
          of Charlie is getting shrill.

          Charlie slowly tries to stand again, silhouetted against the
          cloud of dust and fire towering above him.
          
          Flaming rocks fly towards him. When they hit the ground, they
          detonate like fire bombs.
          
                                     CHARLIE'S VOICE

          EXT. DIRT ROAD/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY
          
          Rocks plummet like comets around the RV as Jackson races over
          a collapsing bridge. On the radio, in his delirious state,
          Charlie begins to sing...
          
                                     CHARLIE'S VOICE
                    `This is the end, my friend'...
          
          Yellowstone looks like a war zone. The RV dodges the
          bombardment of fire and rock.
          
          
          EXT. MOUNTAIN PEAK/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY
          
          Huge tree trunks and glowing boulders fly at Charlie through
          the ashes. He screams at the top of his lungs.
          
                                     CHARLIE FROST
                    ... Folks, always remember, you heard
                    it first from Charlie.
          
          A second later, Charlie's radio antenna comes spinning like a
          scythe through the air. It decapitates Charlie in an instant.
          
          
          EXT. DIRT ROAD/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY
          
          The radio cuts out. The forest and the camp grounds are mown
          flat by the extreme force of the ASH CLOUD. In the rear view
          mirror Jackson sees it gaining on them.
          
                                    JACKSON
                    LILLY! DOWN!
          
          A firebomb hits the RV, ripping half the roof off.
          
          Lilly barely makes it under the dashboard.

          Jackson spots the little Cessna in the distance.
          
          
          EXT. EMPTY ARMY BASE/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY
          
          At the entrance to the airstrip a huge crevasse forms,
          cutting the RV off from reaching the plane.
          
          Lilly sticks out her head.
          
                                       LILLY
                    Mommy!
          
          Jackson swerves wildly to miss the crack, sending Lilly
          flying out. Without thinking, he lets go of the wheel,
          lunging after her and pulling her back inside.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Stay down darling.
          
          Jackson races the RV alongside the forming crack.
          
          Spotting a narrow point in the crevasse, he makes a decision.
          Slamming the accelerator down, he races towards it at full
          speed.
          
          Moments later the RV is airborne!
          
          Kate watches, too shocked to scream. A few drawn out seconds.
          
          Then the RV touches down, crashing 200 feet from the plane.
          
          Kate runs towards the wreckage of the camper. Lilly jumps
          out, racing into her mom's arms. Jackson turns and sees the
          cloud approaching.
          
                                     JACKSON (CONT'D)
                    You guys go! I'll be right there!
          
          Kate pulls Lilly back to the plane.
          
          Jackson jumps into the back of the RV scavenging through the
          shelves, looking for Charlie's map.
          
          Kate lifts Lilly onto the wing of the plane. Gordon revs up
          the engines.
          
                                     NOAH
                    Give me your hand, Lil'.
          
          Noah pulls his little sister into the cockpit.
          
                                                              (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                       52.
          
          Fiery rocks rain from the sky, detonating to the right and
          left of their plane as Kate climbs in.
          
                                     GORDON
                    We have to take off!
          
                                      NOAH
                    No!
          
                                      LILLY
                    Where's daddy?!
          
                                     GORDON
                    Kate, I'm sorry but if we wait we'll
                    all die!
          
          Gordon pushes the throttle. The plane starts to move. Kate
          screams.
          
                                      KATE
                    Gordon! Wait!
          
          Back in the RV, Jackson is frantically going through the
          masses of books and papers on the shelves. Finally, a map. He
          unfolds it. But it's only of the London underground system.
          
          He throws it to the ground and finds another. This time he's
          lucky! There are markings everywhere.
          
          As he races to the door, the ground gives way beneath the RV.
          Kate and the kids watch it disappear from sight.
          
                                      KATE (CONT'D)
                    JACKSON! NO!
          
          Noah begins to cry and Lilly clings to her mom. Gordon just
          stares, paralyzed.
          
          The ASH CLOUD is almost upon them!
          
          Gordon takes action and accelerates the plane.
          
          Kate turns back. A hand emerges from the crevasse. Then
          another, holding a map. Her face lights up.
          
                                      LILLY
                    It's daddy!
          
          Jackson pulls himself up and sprints towards them, the map in
          his hand.
          
                                      KATE
                    Jackson! Here!
          
          Kate leans out of the cockpit reaching for him.
          
                                                            (CONTINUED)

                                     NOAH
                    Faster Dad. You can make it!
          
                                     GORDON
                    Kate, grab him for god sake. We're
                    almost out of runway.
          
          Using every last ounce of energy, Jackson leaps onto the wing
          and is yanked into the plane by Kate.
          
          Just at that moment, the plane lifts off.
          
          Jackson falls into the cockpit, completely out of breath.
          Lilly crawls over and hugs him.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Thanks for waiting guys.
          
          Now all eyes are glued to the speedometer. 180... 190...
          
          The violent ASH CLOUD is hitting their tail rudder. The plane
          swerves wildly! Gordon gets it back under control.
          
          The speedometer finally creeps towards 200 mph and the CLOUD
          slowly falls back. Everybody breathes a sigh of relief.
          
                                     KATE
                    So, now that you got your map, where
                    are we going?
          
          Jackson unfolds it and takes a look. Hundreds of markings
          clutter the map. In the left corner he discovers a large
          letter C followed by H - I - N - A.
          
          He looks up.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    We're gonna need a bigger plane.
          
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. WEST WING/WHITE HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
          
          The White House is being evacuated. Amidst the chaos stands
          Anheuser. Adrian puts down a phone and looks at him.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Just a few minutes ago Yellowstone
                    erupted, sir. The ash cloud will reach
                    Washington in roughly 7 hours. Maybe 6.
                    We have strong easterly winds...
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    And the crustal displacement?
          
                                                              (CONTINUED)

                                     ADRIAN
                    No one knows, sir.
          
          Anheuser starts walking, Adrian trails behind.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    Let's get the government airborne
                    and... I mean now.
          
          
          INT. OVAL OFFICE/WHITE HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
          
          Anheuser and Adrian burst into the Anteroom of the Oval
          Office. The President's secretary, SALLY, 55, is packing.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    Where is the President, Sally?
          
          Sally looks up stone faced.
          
                                     SALLY
                    He said he wanted to spend a few
                    minutes alone. I think he's over at the
                    chapel.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    The whole North American continent is
                    about to perish, and Wilson decides to
                    go to church!
          
          Adrian shoots an angry look at Anheuser.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    He's praying sir. Which considering the
                    circumstances is not a bad idea.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    Maybe. But right now I need the leader
                    of the free world off his knees and on
                    Air Force One. Wheels up 1900 hours.
                    Can I leave that with you Helmsley?
          
          Anheuser walks away. Adrian and Sally exchange a look.
          
                                     SALLY
                    I really don't like that man.
          
          
          INT. CHAPEL/WHITE HOUSE - SUNSET
          
          Adrian finds the President standing near the front of the
          chapel.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Mr. President? We need to get you out
                    of Washington immediately.
                                                              (CONTINUED)

          President Wilson stays with his head bowed.
          
                                     PRESIDENT WILSON
                    Now matter how idealistic you are
                    taking office. You lose your innocence
                    behind that desk.
                            (PAUSE)
                    Laura was right. People have died
                    because of the decisions I made.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    That's not your fault sir.
          
          He turns to face Adrian.
          
                                     PRESIDENT WILSON
                    You sound like Anheuser.
          
          This quietly affects Adrian.
          
                                     PRESIDENT WILSON (CONT'D)
                    Laura's never looked at me like that
                    before. Only once... When I told her,
                    her mother had died. You knew the first
                    lady?
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    A little.
          
                                     PRESIDENT WILSON
                    You know what she said to me that night
                    we brought her to the hospital?
                            (PAUSE)
                    `Tommy... I think you should do a
                    lottery. Every one should have a chance
                    to go'. That's what Dorothy said to me.
                    That's what we should have done.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    There would have been chaos, sir.
          
          President Wilson looks Adrian in the eyes.
          
                                     PRESIDENT WILSON
                    You know what I believe, Adrian. I
                    believe nature should choose for
                    itself, from itself.
          
          Adrian takes this in.
          
                                     PRESIDENT WILSON (CONT'D)
                    Don't let her go. You'll regret it if
                    you do. Prove to Laura what kind of a
                    man you are. And I'll do the same...
                    You go now. And watch your back for
                    Anheuser.
                                                             (CONTINUED)

          Adrian stares at the President in disbelief.
          
                                    ADRIAN
                    But sir?
          
                                     PRESIDENT WILSON
                    Go. That's an order Helmsley.
          
          A tense moment before Adrian starts to walk away. Just as he
          exits the chapel, Wilson calls after him.
          
                                     PRESIDENT WILSON (CONT'D)
                    Would you tell my daughter... there's
                    nothing on earth that I cherish more
                    than her.
          
          We hold on President Wilson's face.
          
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. LAS VEGAS - SUNSET
          
          Most of Las Vegas is destroyed. A 200 foot wide canyon now
          divides sin city along its famous strip. The towering casinos
          still teeter along the canyon's rim.
          
          All forms of emergency rescue operations are deployed around
          the city.
          
          In the FOREGROUND, we see Las Vegas International Airport,
          its runway cut dramatically short. Large pieces of tarmac
          continue to break off into the crevasse.
          
          
          EXT. AIRFIELD/LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - SUNSET
          
          Gordon maneuvers his plane through the chaos. Airplanes are
          strewn about the runway. Passengers everywhere.
          
                                     GORDON
                    I told you we should have gone to my
                    parents' in the Rockies.
          
                                     KATE
                    Gordon's right. Look at this mess.
          
          Jackson looks around frantically.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    You don't understand, it's our only
                    chance.

                                     GORDON
                    This isn't one of your crazy stories
                    now. How the hell are we gonna make it
                    to China?
          
                                     NOAH
                    Gordon, without Jackson, we'd never
                    have made it out of California.
          
          Silence. Noah is right and they know it. They taxi past a
          private jet whose front wheel is stuck in a hole in the
          tarmac.
          
          We hear a dog barking and the CAMERA finds Tamara, with
          Caesar in her arms.
          
                                     YURI (O.S.)
                    Careful with the landing gear!
                            (in Russian)
                    Tamara, get the boys out of the way!
          
          An airport tow truck attempts to pull Yuri's Gulfstream jet
          out. Sasha, the pilot, helps. A safety announcement echoes
          through the whole area.
          
                                     VOICE
                            (over loudspeaker)
                    Attention! The US National Guard has
                    informed us, that an extremely
                    hazardous ash cloud is headed towards
                    the city of Las Vegas.
          
          Tamara looks scared and secretly reaches for Sasha's hand.
          They share an intimate look, no one else sees.
          
                                     VOICE (CONT'D)
                    We strongly advise every one to move
                    indoors immediately...
          
          The tow truck driver panics and runs inside.
          
          We move in on Yuri. For the first time he looks helpless.
          
          In the background, Jackson and his family join the panicked
          crowd heading towards the terminal building. Firemen and
          rescue workers usher them forward.
          
                                     FIRE MAN
                    Let's move people! Inside the terminal!
          
          Jackson and his family are swept along.
          
                                                                CUT TO:

          INT. AIR FORCE ONE/ARLINGTON AIRPORT - DUSK
          
          Adrian rushes up the stairs of Air Force One, approaching one
          of the flight officers.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Where's Anheuser?
          
                                     OFFICER
                    In the command center, sir.
          
          Adrian moves on.
          
          
          INT. COMMAND CENTER/AIR FORCE ONE - DUSK
          
          Adrian enters. Anheuser immediately senses something is
          amiss.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    The President is not coming. I couldn't
                    convince him to.
          
          Everyone in the room looks up, speechless.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    So, the captain doesn't want to leave
                    his sinking ship?
                            (PAUSE)
                    Well, Mr. Helmsley, we just learned
                    that the Vice President's chopper
                    crashed 80 miles north of Atlanta.
          
          Adrian is shocked.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    What about the Speaker of the House?
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    In this chaos... I have no idea!
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    But she's Commander In Chief now. Sir,
                    I just think -
          
          Anheuser moves in dangerously close.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    I don't care what you think, Helmsley.
          
          Laura quietly enters the Command Center, as Anheuser and
          Adrian stare each other down.

                                     ANHEUSER (CONT'D)
                    Your ass only made it into the White
                    House, because your old man knew the
                    First Lady... and because of all that
                    affirmative action bullshit.
          
          Anheuser takes it even further.
          
                                     ANHEUSER (CONT'D)
                    There was a white kid, much more
                    qualified than you. Just so you know.
          
          Adrian's face is ashen.
          
                                     LAURA (O.S.)
                    Where is my father?
          
          Everyone turns to Laura. Silence.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    He wanted to stay with his people.
          
          Suddenly, the engines of Air Force One turn over. Laura
          panics.
          
                                     LAURA
                    We have to go back!
          
          Adrian tries to hold her close to him. Anheuser sees this
          intimate moment and gives a suspicious, questioning look. A
          second later Laura pushes Adrian away.
          
                                     LAURA (CONT'D)
                    Let me get out. Mr. Anheuser - tell the
                    Captain.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    There is a protocol for just this
                    situation Ms. Wilson and I'm afraid
                    we'll have to follow it to the letter.
          
          Anheuser turns to an officer.
          
                                     ANHEUSER (CONT'D)
                    Tell the Captain, to take off
                    immediately.
          
          Laura looks at him incredulously.
          
                                                                 CUT TO:

                    People, stay away from the windows!
          
          One of the rescue workers yells, pushing Jackson and his
          family back.
          
          Frustrated, Jackson turns to Kate and Gordon.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    We can't get stuck here.
          
          Suddenly a voice...
          
                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                    Dr. Silberman? What are you doing here?
          
          They all turn and stare at Tamara, holding her little dog
          against her plump breasts.
          
          Kate gives Gordon a look.
          
                                     GORDON
                            (EMBARRASSED)
                    She's a patient, honey.
          
                                     JACKSON
                            (SARCASTICALLY)
                    Nice work.
          
          But when Jackson discovers Yuri behind her, his tone suddenly
          changes. He gets in Yuri's face.
          
                                     JACKSON (CONT'D)
                    You bastard. You knew it all along!
                            (at the twins)
                    You and those spoiled rotten sons of
                    yours...
          
          Sasha comes running in and cuts through this.
          
                                     SASHA
                    I found us a plane, an Antonov. They
                    were just about to take off, but the
                    tower didn't let them.
          
                                     YURI
                    Can you still fly that thing?
          
                                     SASHA
                    Sure... But I need a copilot.
          
          Lilly chimes in.
          
                                     LILLY
                    Gordon is a pilot.
          
                                                              (CONTINUED)

          Before Gordon can protest Jackson picks up Lilly.
          
                                       JACKSON
                    Let's go!
          
          They burst through the emergency exit, setting off an alarm.
          Emergency personnel yell after them.
          
                                     RESCUE WORKER
                    Hey! Stop! You can't go out there! Come
                    back!
          
          But they keep on running. Sasha now leads the way.
          
          
          EXT. AIR FIELD/LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DUSK
          
          They race around the corner and come to a halt. Before them,
          a Russian freight plane of enormous size--
          
          The ANTONOV 225, the biggest aircraft in the world.
          
                                     NOAH
                    Wow, that is a big plane.

                            (PROUDLY)
                    It's Russian.
          
          Sasha, who has run ahead turns back and sees:
          
          A MASSIVE GREY WALL OF ASH moving towards the airport.
          
                                       SASHA
                    Guys, follow me!
          
          They all run after him up the stairs.

          Sasha enters the cockpit and puts on the headset while
          readying the plane for takeoff.

                            (into the mic)
                    You'll find folding seats on each side

          They all scramble to get into their seats.

                    Wow! Look at those!
          
          They discover the cargo they are carrying--
          
          Sports cars, SUV's, concept cars and luxury models, some of
          them are labeled `Las Vegas Auto Show 2012'.

          The six engines of the Antonov come roaring to life.
          
          
          INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DUSK
          
          The plane is starting to move. Gordon sits uncomfortably in
          the copilot's seat.
          
                                     SASHA
                    You check the main bus for the
                    hydraulics. I'll balance the tanks.
          
                                    GORDON
                    Uh... What?
          
          Sasha reaches over and does it himself.
          
                                     SASHA
                    Work the radio and keep an eye on the
                    fuel, okay?
          
          Gordon nods and puts on the headset, trying to focus.

          The nose of the Antonov turns onto the runway. This humongous
          plane suddenly looks small against the wall of ash.

          Sasha hits the throttle.

          A deafening THUNDER emanates from the engines.

          Everybody grabs their seat as the vibration of the aircraft
          builds.
          
          
          EXT. RUNWAY/LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DUSK
          
          The Antonov steadily gains speed as it rumbles down the
          cracked and uneven runway.
          
          The canyon that has swallowed half the city looms ahead. And
          behind them the volcanic cloud bears down.
          
          
          INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DUSK
          
          Sasha stares down the gap ahead, determined. Gordon's face is
          as white as a sheet.
          
                                     GORDON

          INT. TERMINAL/LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DUSK
          
          The violent cloud has finally reached the airport. The
          terminals are hit by flying debris.
          
          Seconds later, Yuri's Gulfstream is whipped through the air,
          shattering the huge windows into a thousand pieces.
          
          People are thrown like rag dolls as the jet explodes in a
          massive fireball.

          Kate and Jackson hold their kids tight. Tamara clings to
          little Caesar and Yuri to his twins.

          EXT. RUNWAY/LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DUSK
          
          The Antonov lumbers heavily towards the inevitable drop off
          on the horizon. The runway is way too short...
          
          And to make matters worse, the ground begins to move again,
          slowly arching the tarmac upwards, creating a crooked ramp at
          the end of it.
          
          
          INT. COCKPIT/LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DUSK
          
          A drop of sweat trickles down Sasha's forehead as he pulls
          back the wheel.
          
          Gordon holds on for dear life as the huge plane barely lifts
          off, veering sideways.
          
          
          EXT. CANYON/LAS VEGAS - DUSK
          
          The Antonov is on a collision course with the crumbling
          casino towers along the other side of the rim.

                    GOVNO! (shit). Help me pull!
          
          Gordon grabs the wheel on his side, helping Sasha pull up the
          beast of a plane.
          
          
          EXT. CANYON RIM/LAS VEGAS - DUSK
          
          Very slowly the plane starts to rise and Sasha's face lights
          up. They barely make it over a casino called `Paris; Las
          Vegas'.
          
          But the plane clips its wheels on a high metal structure
          right behind it, ripping away part of the landing gear.
          
          
          INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DUSK
          
          After some struggle, Sasha manages to steady the Antonov.
          Gordon's face is green as he looks back.
          
                                     GORDON
                    Was that the Eiffel Tower?
          
          Sasha looks over and grins. He grabs the microphone.

          EXT. YAK LA MONASTERY/TIBET - DAY
          
          An ancient monastery built atop a solitary mountain rock. In
          the distance, the sun glistens off the peaks of the
          Himalayas.
          
          NENG PANG, a young monk, 20, sits with his superior and
          teacher LAMA YAK LA, 65. They have tea beneath a huge bronze
          bell.
          
                                     LAMA YAK LA
                            (in Chinese)
                    Do not believe in anything simply
                    because you have heard it, Neng.
          
                                     NENG
                    But Lin is my brother. He is working
                    inside the big tunnels, where the ships
                    are made.
          
          The Lama remains silent.
          
                                     NENG (CONT'D)
                    What is in your wisdom for us to do,
                    great Lama... if Lin is right, if our
                    world is indeed coming to an end?
          
          Instead of answering, the Lama serves him more tea.
          
          When the cup is full, the Lama doesn't stop pouring. Neng
          watches the tea overflow until he can no longer restrain
          himself.
          
                                     NENG (CONT'D)
                    It's full, great Lama. It can hold no
                    more!
          
          The Lama stops pouring and looks at Neng.
          
                                     LAMA YAK LA
                    Like this cup, Neng, you are full of
                    your own opinions and speculations. How
                    can I show you wisdom unless you first
                    empty your cup?
          
          Neng bows his head in embarrassment.
          
          The Lama smiles to himself and takes a chain from around his
          neck. On it hangs a set of rusty car keys.
                                                             (CONTINUED)

                                     LAMA YAK LA (CONT'D)
                    Be careful with the clutch. It tends to
                    slide.
          
          The Lama throws him the keys and the young monk catches them,
          smiling from ear to ear. They bow to each other and Neng runs
          off.
          
          Lama Yak La looks after him as a father would. He gets up and
          strikes the bronze bell with a wooden mallet.
          
          
          EXT. HOUSING PROJECT/TIBET - DAY
          
          As far as you can see is a series of identical little houses.
          The house in the foreground has a chicken coop in the garden.
          
          Mrs. Pang enters the coop. We last saw her when the village
          was being evacuated. She grabs one of the hens. She places
          its head on a woodblock and picks up a rusty hatchet.
          
          Just about to strike, she hears a strange RATTLING noise.
          
          An old truck comes driving towards the house. Behind the
          wheel sits her son Neng. She puts down the hatchet, yelling.
          
                                     MRS. PANG
                            (in Chinese)
                    Bata! Neng is coming!
          
          The young monk jumps out, quickly bowing.
          
                                     NENG
                    Mother, I got a message from Lin. He
                    wants us to meet him in Cho Ming, at
                    the west gate. He says he can get us on
                    one of the ships he is working on.
          
          Mrs. Pang is still holding the chicken by its throat.
          
                                     MRS. PANG
                    I thought Lin is working on the dam?
          
                                     NENG
                    The dam is a ship, Mother. The
                    government lied to us. There will be a
                    big flood.
          
          The chicken hangs limp in Mrs. Pang's hand.
          
                                     MRS. PANG
                    Not here in the mountains... Let's eat
                    first.
          
          The hen panics as she puts its head back on the block,
          raising the hatchet again.

          The door opens and Mr. Pang appears.

                    Neng, I did not know you were coming
                    for dinner.
          
          At that moment the hatchet drops with a THUD!

                                     LILLY
                    What did the man pay for mommy?
          
                                     KATE
                    Nothing, Lil'bee.
          
          Kate looks over at Jackson who's trying to make sense of
          Charlie's map. Tamara catches her looking.

                                     TAMARA
                    What's your situation?
          
          Kate lets out a sigh.
          
                                     KATE
                    Way too complicated...
          
          On the other side of the plane, Yuri has been watching the
          two women talk.
          
                                     YURI
                    They seem to like each other.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    I guess... So tell me Mr. Karpov - how
                    much did you pay?
          
                                     YURI
                    One billion euro, per seat.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    That's disgusting.
          
                                     YURI
                    You know Curtis, I wasn't always
                    businessman. I am a boxer. Was my only
                    playing when I was a boy, back in
                    Murmansk. My coach...
                            (SMILING)
                    ... his name also Yuri... He always
                    said: `Someone wants to beat you... he
                    has to kill you first'.
          
          Yuri puts his hand on Jackson's shoulder.
          
                                     YURI (CONT'D)
                    What would you have done, if you rich
                    like me? Just look at your gorgeous
                    kids. And call me Yuri...
          
          Yuri offers his hand but Jackson doesn't shake it.
          
          Sasha's voice comes over the radio.
          
                                     SASHA (O.S.)
                    Hi guys. The plan is to refuel in
                    Hawaii. So, buckle up... Gordon and I
                    will do the rest.
          
          
          INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - NIGHT
          
          Gordon turns to Sasha.

                                     GORDON
                    Let's get this straight, Sasha. I'm not
                    a pilot. I'm a plastic surgeon. I just
                    took some lessons to overcome my fear
                    of flying.
          
                                     SASHA
                    Why did you give up?
          
                                      GORDON
                    It didn't work.
          
          Gordon points to the declining altimeter.
          
                                     GORDON (CONT'D)
                    What about the wheels we lost at take-
                    off?
          
                                     SASHA
                    There's 14 on each side. Some of them
                    must still be there.
          
          With that, Sasha commences the landing procedure.
          
          
          EXT. ANTONOV/OVER HAWAII - NIGHT
          
          The Antonov dives into a thick layer of clouds.
          
                                     SASHA (O.S.)
                    Still nothing from the tower?
          
          
          INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - NIGHT
          
          Gordon shakes his head.
          
          The two pilots stare ahead watching as the clouds slowly
          change color, from yellow... to orange.
          
          They stare out the window in disbelief.
          
          
          INT. CARGO HOLD/ANTONOV - NIGHT
          
          Gordon comes climbing down the metal ladder whispering to
          Jackson and Yuri.
          
                                     GORDON
                    Guys, you really oughta take a look at
                    this.
          
          Jackson and Yuri follow Gordon back into the cockpit. The
          women exchange a worried glance.
          
                                                                       71.
          
          INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - NIGHT
          
          When Jackson and Yuri enter, they don't believe their eyes.
          
                                     YURI
                    What is that?
          
                                     SASHA
                    The State of Hawaii!
          
                                     YURI
                    Not good. That is not good.
          
          
          EXT. ANTONOV/OVER HAWAII - NIGHT
          
          From above we watch as the Antonov flies over an endless
          ocean of fiery red lava. The Islands of Hawaii have turned
          into one big volcano.
          
          
          INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - NIGHT
          
                                     JACKSON
                    How much fuel do we have?
          
                                     SASHA
                    Not enough. We'll have to make a water
                    landing somewhere in the South China
                    Sea.
          
                                     GORDON
                    At least we won't need our landing
                    gear.
          
          Yuri wonders.
          
                                     YURI
                    What about it?
          
                                     GORDON
                    We lost it all... in Vegas.
          
          
          EXT. ANTONOV/OVER HAWAII - NIGHT
          
          The damaged landing gear slowly retracts into the vast belly
          of the Antonov as it veers off to the east.
          
                                                                CUT TO:

          Laura is sitting in her father's chair.

                    Can I come in?
          
                                     LAURA
                    I've got nothing to say to you.
          
                                       ADRIAN
                    But I do...
          
          Adrian enters. He has his travel bag in one hand. He looks at
          Laura and gathers himself.
          
                                     ADRIAN (CONT'D)
                    Your Dad and I... we were trying to
                    protect you.
          
                                     LAURA
                            (EXPLODING)
                    I'm a big girl Adrian. I don't need
                    protection. You used me. You guys had
                    me gallivanting around the world, as
                    part of your little cover-up.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    But you were doing a good job.
          
                                     LAURA
                    Sure, if your name's Da Vinci or
                    Picasso. But if you're some young
                    talent in Podunk, Texas, sorry you're
                    not famous enough. People like you and
                    Anheuser and my father - you think you
                    can play God.
          
          Adrian takes a moment, he's desperate to make her see.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    You know what your father believed.
                    That nature will choose itself from
                    itself.
          
                                     LAURA
                    That's bullshit and you know it. It's
                    the fittest, the richest and the
                    strongest that survive.
          
                                       ADRIAN
                    That's not true.
          
          Adrian glances down and spots Jackson's book poking out of
          his bag.

                    What would you say were the chances of
                    a first time, middle-aged writer, who
                    barely sold 500 copies of his novel
                    making it on board this plane?
          
                                     LAURA
                    Zero. What's your point?
          
          Adrian pulls out the book from his bag. He shows her.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    It's called `Farewell Atlantis' and
                    it's a fantastic read. It's part of our
                    legacy now.
          
          Laura takes this in. The plane's intercom cuts through the
          moment.
          
                                     INTERCOM (O.S.)
                    Mr. Helmsley, Prof. West requests your
                    presence immediately.
          
          Adrian takes a breath, but before he leaves -
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    What if I tried to sort some of this
                    mess out? I need to know you can
                    forgive me...
          
          Laura looks at him sadly, but with a little hope.
          
                                     LAURA
                    I need to know that too, Adrian.
          
          Adrian moves for the door. He stops.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    One more thing. Your father told me you
                    were the most precious thing to him in
                    the whole world... You are to me too.
          
          As Adrian exits, we hold on Laura's conflicted face.
          
                                                                  CUT TO:

          The cloud from the Yellowstone eruption has hit Washington
          D.C. hard. Pennsylvania Avenue resembles a war zone. A ten
          inch layer of ash lies on the ground.
          
          The gates of the White House are wide open, with ash-covered
          rescue workers running about, resembling ghosts.

          The President has turned the whole West Wing into a shelter.
          He walks through the packed rooms assisting where he can.
          
          An old African-American LADY holds a crying young girl.
          President Wilson kneels down to her.
          
                                     OLD LADY
                    She can't find her mother.
          
                                     PRESIDENT
                    Why don't you two girls make yourself
                    comfy on that big couch? I'll see what
                    I can do.
          
          The child nods. The President gets up.
          
                                     PRESIDENT WILSON
                    Sally, can you take care of them. I'll
                    go check with the Red Cross...
          
          As he leaves, the old lady looks up at Sally and smiles.

                    No wonder the First Lady fell for him.
                    I knew Miss Dorothy Jones long before
                    the President, when she was still
                    singing jazz down in Atlanta with Harry
                    Helmsley.
          
                                     SALLY
                    I know, she was amazing.
          
          
          EXT. FRONT LAWN/WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          The President walks up to the Red Cross tents placed on the
          front lawn. He stops one of the Red Cross volunteers.
          
                                     PRESIDENT WILSON
                    Who can help me with missing persons?
          
          Without looking up, the young guy responds.
          
                                     RED CROSS VOLUNTEER
                    Sorry man, I'm busy right now.
          
          He then recognizes who he's talking to.
          
                                     RED CROSS VOLUNTEER (CONT'D)
                    I mean, of course sir. I didn't
                    realize... What can I do for you, Mr.
                    President?
          
          The President pats him on the shoulder.

                                     PRESIDENT WILSON
                    Don't worry about it. You're doing a
                    great job son...
          
          A deep, low rumble begins, stopping everybody in place.
          
          As it builds, the President grabs onto a tent pole to secure
          himself. He looks out over Washington D.C. His eyes grow
          wide...
          
          The National Mall bends like rubber. The towering Washington
          Monument breaks into pieces.
          
          An even more deafening sound makes him turn--
          
          The Capitol Building rises from behind the trees, lifted up
          by earth's incredible force.
          
          As the whole building breaks apart, the President is thrown
          to the ground.
          
                                                                  CUT TO:

                    House, sir.
          
          She stands there frozen, emotionless. She looks over to
          Anheuser, who is shouting orders. Another officer hands him a
          phone.

                    just entered Chinese air space.
          
          Anheuser takes the phone and after a beat answers.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    That's affirmative, Mr. President.
                    Until communication is restored, I am
                    in command.

          Pope Benedict XVI holds mass in St. Peter's Basilica.
          Millions of followers flood Vatican City. It's a sea of
          candles.
          
          Amidst the mass of believers we see the Italian Prime
          Minister Antonioni with his family clinging to him. They all
          are praying.
          
          A low RUMBLE. People look around frightened. In the distance
          we hear SCREAMING.
          
          
          INT. SISTINE CHAPEL/CEILING - DAWN
          
          A few cardinals huddle together in silent prayer under
          Michelangelo's famous fresco. Most prominent above them is
          `The Creation of Adam'.
          
          The cardinals look up in horror as the rumbling intensifies.
          A crack forms on the ceiling, shooting straight through God
          touching the finger of Adam.
          
          Then the whole fresco breaks apart.

          The people in St. Peter's square begin to panic--
          
          The entire Vatican is lifted up in the air. We hold on the
          Prime Minister and his family, as the basilica collapses onto
          the fleeing masses.

          The famous statue of Jesus Christ begins to topple over and
          crashes down the mountain.

          mountain pass. His parents huddle in the back of the pick-up.
          
          The steering wheel is vibrating badly in his hands as he
          slides the clutch and downshifts. As the vehicle slows on the
          steep incline, the vibrations become much worse. Neng worries
          that the truck may be breaking down.
          
          He pulls up and switches off the engine but to his surprise
          the steering wheel continues to vibrate.
          
          Looking out the windshield, he sees the whole earth shaking
          violently.

                    Tony!!
          
          As the ship rolls to the side, Harry finds himself hanging
          from the door frame now 20 feet off the ground. He's barely
          able to pull himself up and roll onto the middle deck.
          
          
          EXT. MIDDLE DECK/CRUISE SHIP - NIGHT
          
          On his back, Harry is shocked to see the star field and the
          moon shifting across the sky.
          
          An eerie sound fills the air. A gigantic swell has formed off
          to his right. It's a mountain of water.
          
          Harry turns to see another gargantuan swell close in from the
          other side of the `Freedom of the Seas'.

          The old walled city of Shibam is in ruins. The 2,000-year-old
          towers lie on the desert ground. Hundreds of believers have
          gathered to pray towards Mecca.
          
          As they raise their hands to heaven in unison, they slow
          their motion and the chanting dissipates.
          
          They stare into the distance not knowing if what they see is
          reality or only a mirage.
          
          A monstrous tidal wave rises from the desert sands thundering
          towards them.
          
                                                                CUT TO:

          President Wilson's body lays between the rubble. As he slowly
          regains consciousness, all he can hear is the flapping sound
          of the collapsed Red Cross tents.

          As President Wilson gets to his feet, he sees--
          
          A tidal wave come sweeping over the remains of the Washington
          Mall and it carries with it the battleships of the 14th Fleet
          of the US Navy that were anchored in Chesapeake Bay.
          
          The President looks ahead, calm and peaceful.

                                     ANHEUSER
                    At least some good news.
          
          Anheuser turns to Adrian.

                    We expect enormous tsunamis to reach

                    somewhere in Wisconsin?
          
          Silence. Adrian clears his throat.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    It's the south pole, sir.

          Jackson's family are all asleep in their seats, Lilly in her

          to wake them. He caresses Lilly's face.

                    What are you talking about? I don't
                    hate Gordon.

                    But you don't like him either.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    I don't know him that well.

                    But I know him. He's really nice. You
                    should talk to him more often. You guys
                    would get along really well.
          
          This breaks Jackson's heart. He pulls Noah tightly to his
          chest.
          
                                     JACKSON

          On the opposite side of the aircraft, Yuri and Tamara help
          the twins get into their life vests. Noah is suspicious.

                    Sasha told us, it could get a little

          In the background, Gordon climbs down from the cockpit. He is
          about to speak when he hears Jackson's voice.

                    I wasn't there for you, the way I
                    should have been.

                    CHTO ZA... Gordon! We're still too
                    fast!
          
          Sasha pulls the Antonov back up.
          
                                       SASHA (CONT'D)
                    Now! Open it!
          
          Gordon yanks with all his might. A loud NOISE.
          
          
          INT. CARGO HOLD/ANTONOV - DAWN
          
          The cargo door drops open. The Antonov is extremely close to
          the glacier's surface.
          
          Jackson tries to start the Bentley, but nothing happens.
          Everyone screams in panic.
          
                                     YURI
                    SHUT UP EVERY ONE!
          
          They all go quiet, except for a few muffled barks from
          Caesar. Yuri speaks towards the dashboard, slowly and
          clearly.
          
                                     YURI (CONT'D)
                    Engine... start...
          
          The motor revs to life. Yuri looks at Jackson.

          INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DAWN
          
          Sasha barely holds on. He yells at Gordon.
          
                                     SASHA
                    Your turn Gordon! Go! Make sure that
                    they make it out of here before I touch
                    down!
          
                                       GORDON
                    What about you?!
          
                                     SASHA
                    I'll be fine! I have to land this
                    thing!
          
          Gordon hesitates.
          
                                     SASHA (CONT'D)
                    What are you waiting for!

          Sasha nods at him reassuringly. Gordon bolts out.
          
          
          INT. CARGO HOLD/ANTONOV - DAWN
          
          The cargo door scrapes against the glacier, hurling ice
          everywhere. The Bentley roars.
          
                                      YURI (O.S.)
                    Push it Curtis!
          
                                     JACKSON
                    We're waiting for Sasha and Gordon.
          
          Noah turns and sees Gordon.
          
                                     NOAH
                    Tamara! Open the door!
          
          Gordon jumps in. Tamara yells at him in desperation.
          
                                      TAMARA
                    Where's Sasha?
          
                                     GORDON
                    He said he'll be fine and we should get
                    out of here before he touches down.
          
          Yuri notices Tamara's distress as she keeps looking back to
          the cockpit. Jackson slams the pedal down trying to gain as
          much speed as possible to soften their landing.
          
                                      LILLY
                    Daaadddy!
          
          The Bentley shoots out the back of the plane. As it hits the
          snow, the air bags deploy cushioning the passengers.
          
          The Antonov hits the ice and catapults the rest of the luxury
          cars out of the back cargo hold. They barrel past the Bentley
          like skittles, narrowly missing it as they fly off in
          opposite directions.
          
          The plane skids across the glacier, clipping its wing and
          causing the aircraft to break apart.
          
          Sasha has no control anymore and watches helplessly as he
          shoots towards the ledge in the Antonov, plunging into the
          deep.
          
          The plane crashes and explodes.
          
                                                                       88.
          
          EXT. GLACIER/TIBET - DAWN
          
          As the snow settles we see that the glacier is scattered with
          luxury cars tomb-stoned in the snow.
          
          The Bentley is half buried. We hear Caesar barking.
          
                                     JACKSON (O.S.)
                    Everybody okay back there?
          
                                      KATE (O.S.)
                    We're all fine.
          
          The door opens and Jackson climbs out, looking around. Just
          above the wind, he hears the SOUND OF HELICOPTER BLADES.
          
          One by one the others appear behind Jackson and stare at a
          surreal sight--
          
          Several Chinese Mil-26 choppers airlift animals over the
          mountain pass.
          
          GIRAFFES, ZEBRAS, EVEN ELEPHANTS hang by huge straps from
          these flying machines.
          
          One of the smaller helicopters veers from the transport fleet
          and lands near the Bentley.
          
          Armed soldiers jump out. Their Commander speaks to them in a
          sharp tone.
          
                                     CHINESE COMMANDER
                    Welcome to the People's Republic of
                    China.
          
          Jackson nods to them.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Thank you...
                            (to Lilly and Noah)
                    Say thank you, kids.
          
          The others acknowledge the soldiers as well. Hi... Hello...
          
                                     CHINESE COMMANDER
                    What color are your passes?
          
          Jackson stands dumbfounded. The Commander repeats.
          
                                     CHINESE COMMANDER (CONT'D)
                    What color are your boarding passes?
          
          Still no answer. He yells an order. The soldiers point their
          guns at them.
          
          
                                                               (CONTINUED)

                                     YURI (O.S.)
                    I have green card.
          
          Surprised, Jackson turns to Yuri who's holding up three green
          plastic cards.
          
                                     YURI (CONT'D)
                    For my boys and me.
          
          Tamara can't believe what she's hearing.
          
                                     TAMARA
                    It's a joke... a mistake...
                            (LAUGHING)
                    Right Yuri?
          
          Yuri shrugs. Tamara lunges at him.
          
                                     TAMARA (CONT'D)
                            (in Russian)
                    You disgust me. You pig.
          
          Yuri brushes her off, coldly. And then speaks so they can all
          understand him.
          
                                     YURI
                    You think I did not know about you and
                    Sasha? May god rest that poor bastard's
                    soul.
          
          With that Yuri turns to the others.
          
                                     YURI (CONT'D)
                    I am sorry guys. Good luck. And Jackson
                    remember, if someone wants to beat
                    you... he has to kill you first. Come
                    boys!
          
          The twins grab Caesar and climb into the helicopter. The dog
          barks furiously, wanting to stay with Tamara.
          
          The next moment, the helicopter takes off.
          
                                     GORDON
                    What!... Did that just happen!?
          
          They're stranded.
          
                                                                CUT TO:

          Air Force One is in the background as Laura, Anheuser, and
          other members of the crew are rushed towards a group of
          waiting helicopters.

          Adrian is a little way back in the middle of the pack. A
          Chinese Officer with a list shouts over the noise.
          
                                     CHINESE OFFICER
                            (POINTING)
                    Mr. Anheuser - you're in Chopper 1. Dr.
                    Wilson the same.
          
          Laura and Anheuser reach the chopper. An authoritative Naval
          Officer greets them, and raises his voice.
          
                                     CAPTAIN MICHAELS
                    I'm Captain Richard Michaels. I'm the
                    skipper of the American boat sir. After
                    you!
          
          Anheuser nods and climbs in the chopper. Captain Michaels
          helps Laura in. Adrian arrives just as the Chopper door
          slides shut and it lifts off.
          
          
          INT. HELICOPTER/CHO MING VALLEY/TIBET - DAWN
          
          Laura catches Adrian's look of unease before they soar away.
          
                                     CAPTAIN MICHAELS
                    My sincerest condolences Dr. Wilson,
                    for your father...
          
          Laura's look thanks him for this. He turns to Anheuser.
          
                                     CAPTAIN MICHAELS (CONT'D)
                    Your party is the last to arrive.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    I've been told of damages?
          
                                     CAPTAIN MICHAELS
                    We haven't completed the assessment but
                    it looks like we lost Number 4 when the
                    crust shifted.
          
          Captain Michaels looks up and points into the distance.
          
                                    CAPTAIN MICHAELS (CONT'D)

          EXT. CHO MING VALLEY/TIBET - DAWN
          
          The CAMERA follows the choppers revealing--
          
          Nine gigantic oval gates that measure at least 60 stories,
          built into the face of a mountain.

          In front of every gate there is a line of huge `Y' shaped
          metal support structures, which are the launching towers for
          the ships. They are each at least 800 feet high. It's an
          unparalleled feat of engineering.
          
          
          EXT. CHOPPER/CHO MING VALLEY - DAWN
          
          The lead chopper descends onto a platform in front of one of
          the gates, dwarfed against this majestic setting.
          
          The door slides open and Anheuser jumps out. Laura follows.
          She looks around in awe.
          
          Even the utility entrances that lead into the mountain are
          immense. The Captain guides them into the hollow mountain.
          
          In the BACKGROUND we see an angry Yuri scream and argue with
          military personnel, waving his tickets.

                    Can you read? Now get the hell back
                    with the other green cards, or I'll
                    have you detained.
          
          The twins stand nearby, holding Caesar. They look afraid.
          
                                                                 CUT TO:

          They have made it down the glacier and are now walking over a

          It is hard going. Jackson carries Lilly.

          Kate holds Noah by the hand. Gordon and Tamara trail behind.
          She's still very upset.
          
                                     TAMARA
                    I should have listened to you, Dr.
                    Silberman. I actually liked the way I
                    looked before that monster talked me
                    into it.
          
                                     GORDON
                    Did you know he asked for a discount...
                    and he paid in installments?
          
                                     TAMARA
                    Cheap bastard.
          
                                     GORDON
                    You're better off without him. What he
                    said about you and Sasha, is it true?
          
          Tamara nods silently.
          
                                     TAMARA
                    Now that he's gone I think he was worth
                    a hundred times a man like Yuri.
          
          Suddenly they hear the PUTTERING of an engine.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    You guys hear that?
          
          In the distance, an old rusty truck comes bumping down the
          dirt road. Jackson puts down Lilly and chases after it.
          
          
          EXT. DIRT ROAD/NEAR CHO MING - DAWN
          
          Neng and his parents drive past, billowing a huge cloud of
          dust just as Jackson reaches the road.
          
                                     JACKSON
                            (out of breath)
                    Hey! Help! Wait for us!
          
          But Neng doesn't hear him over the rattling truck. Jackson,
          pissed, kicks at the rocks on the road.
          
                                     JACKSON (CONT'D)
                    Shit! Shit!
          
          Just then, Neng's mother, sitting in the back of the truck,
          turns and sees his tantrum. She bangs on the rear window of
          the cabin.
          
          Neng looks in the mirror and hits the brakes. Jackson can't
          believe his luck.

          The others show up and they all run towards the truck.
          
                                                                   CUT TO:

          Anheuser and Laura follow Captain Michaels and a Chinese
          Steward over one of the many boarding bridges erected inside
          the cavernous mountain that lead to one of the monstrous
          arks. Laura stops halfway, gazing in awe--
          
          Deep down below, thousands of workers are swarming over the
          ship, readying it for launch.
          
          Laura looks up and sees the contrast, spotting the SHEIK we
          met in the Dorchester Hotel as he boards comfortably with his
          huge family.
          
          Laura points down at the workers.
          
                                     LAURA
                    Captain Michaels? What happens to all
                    those people?
          
          The Captain doesn't know what to say. Anheuser turns.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    Dr. Wilson, there's a protocol for all
                    that. You just stick to your art. We'll
                    handle the rest.
          
          Laura hates him in that moment.
          
                                     ANHEUSER (CONT'D)
                    Captain? Where is the Bridge?
          
          Anheuser and Captain Michaels move away as Laura stands and
          watches the frantic workers who are now boarding the animals
          we saw being airlifted over the mountains.
          
                                     CHINESE STEWARD (O.S.)
                    Dr. Wilson? Your cabin is this way.
          
          Laura has a look of guilt as she follows the steward.
          
                                                                   CUT TO:

          Thousands are on the march up the mountains. Behind them a
          valley stretches into the horizon. Plumes of smoke rise from
          destroyed cities in the distance.

          Amongst the refugees, we discover Satnam, the young
          astrophysicist, holding his little son. The rest of Satnam's
          family trails behind.
          
          Distant WARNING SIRENS pierce the silent march, coming from
          the cities below.
          
          People start to scream and run, but Satnam stands there
          frozen. He fumbles for his satellite phone, then hits a
          number on its speed dial.
          
          
          INT. LIVING QUARTERS/AMERICAN SHIP - SUNRISE
          
          Adrian is unpacking. He lays down his copy of `Farewell
          Atlantis' just as his cell phone rings.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Satnam?
                            (CONFUSED)
                    Where are you?
          
                                     SATNAM (O.S.)
                    On the Nampan Plateau...
          
          Adrian's face goes pale.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    What?!
          
                                     SATNAM
                    There's a tidal wave coming from the
                    East! It's huge!
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Satnam, what happened?
          
                                     SATNAM (O.S.)
                    We never got picked up, Adrian, the
                    airlift never came!
          
          Adrian closes his eyes.
          
          
          EXT. NAMPAN MOUNTAINS/EAST COAST OF INDIA - SUNRISE
          
          Satnam swallows hard. He stares out into the valley.
          
                                     SATNAM
                    I have to go!
          
          A wall of undulating foam and debris comes rolling towards
          him. A tidal wave of gigantic height.
          
          Everybody panics and scratches for a higher elevation. But
          for Satnam it is clear, they do not stand a chance.

          He picks up his little son, squeezing him tightly to his
          chest, humming an Indian lullaby for the scared child.

          Adrian hears SCREAMING on the phone and the deafening sound
          of the approaching wave. He tenses up, desperate but unable
          to do anything.
          
          As the noise reaches its height, the line goes dead. Adrian
          is left breathless.

                                       SCIENCE OFFICER
                    One moment, sir.
          
          Anheuser and Prof. West step over and join him.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    Helmsley, what's going on here?
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Looks like our model was wrong.
          
          They all stare at the monitor showing several tidal waves
          coming in from the south.
          
                                     ADRIAN (CONT'D)
                    Satnam was talking about a wave from
                    the East.
          
          A science officer selects a different quadrant on the
          satellite display. They all stare at the new tidal wave
          that's coming from the East of the Cho Ming valley.
          
                                       PROF. WEST
                    Jesus!
          
          Anheuser is shocked.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    What does this mean?

                    The flooding will happen earlier.
                    Bobby, can you plug in the new data
                    please?
          
          As the officer does this, Prof. West looks at Adrian with
          questioning eyes.
          
                                     ADRIAN (CONT'D)
                    Satnam didn't get picked up.
          
          Prof. West is horrified.
          
                                     SCIENCE OFFICER (O.S.)
                    Ready sir.
          
          Adrian turns back to the monitor and sees the new tidal wave
          that is coming towards the Cho Ming valley.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    This one is at least 1500    meters high!

                    mean for us?
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Bobby, plug in the new data and adjust
                    the count down?
          
          Every one on the bridge stares at a display. It reads--
          
          02hrs - 09min - 07sec
          
          The science officer nervously hits a few keys and the display
          changes to--
          
          00hrs - 28min - 10sec... and counting.
          
          We see the shock on Anheuser's face.

          Neng's truck, loaded with Jackson and the others, creeps up
          to the service entrance of the launch site.
          
          A lone figure awaits them. This is Neng's older brother Lin,
          who we saw signing up for the 'Chinese Dam Project'.
          
          Lin notices the strangers in the pick-up truck.

                    Who are they?
          
          Neng answers hesitantly.
          
                                     NENG
                    We found them by the side of the road,
                    my brother.
          
                                     LIN
                    You must send them back.
          
                                     NENG
                    I am a follower of the great Lama Yak
                    La. You know I cannot do that.
          
          The others watch the interaction but do not understand.
          Jackson senses a problem. He grabs Lilly and Noah.
          
                                       JACKSON
                    Come with daddy.
          
          Gordon and Tamara stare perplexed as Jackson approaches Lin
          with his kids.
          
                                     JACKSON (CONT'D)
                    At least take our children with you.
                    Please.
          
          Lin answers in broken English.
          
                                     LIN
                    Why should I do that?
          
                                     JACKSON
                    For the same reason you sent for your
                    parents.
          
          Lin stares at him stone faced. In desperation, Kate turns to
          Mrs. Pang.
          
                                     KATE
                    I have no clue if you understand what
                    I'm saying, but I ask you as a mother,
                    please take my kids with you!
          
          Silence. A beat. The old Chinese lady turns to Lin.
          
                                     MRS. PANG
                            (in Chinese)
                    We are all children of this earth.
          
                                     LIN
                    My plan will not work for so many,
                    mother.
                                                             (CONTINUED)

          She looks up at her son, determined.
          
                                     MRS. PANG
                    We will take them all. Bata?
          
          Mr. Pang nods and reluctantly, Lin motions to Jackson to
          follow. Kate bows to Mrs. Pang.
          
                                     KATE
                    Thank you ma'am. Thank you so much.
          
          Jackson and the others acknowledge what Kate has done.
          
                                                                   CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. SHIP BAY/CHO MING - EARLY MORNING
          
          We finally reveal the unbelievable magnitude of this ship
          yard, built into the hollow belly of the mountains.
          
          Nine gargantuan vessels are lined up next to each other.
          Their size is at least four times that of the `Freedom of the
          Seas'. However, they look more like spaceships than anything,
          having been built aerodynamically to withstand the full force
          of nature.
          
          But only three of these monstrous ARKS are complete. Number 4
          is being repaired, all the others are still under
          construction, surrounded by scaffolding.
          
          Suddenly SIRENS goes off!
          
          The boarding bridges to the finished vessels begin to
          retract. There's growing confusion among the thousands of
          workers and security personnel.
          
          
          INT. PLATFORM, SHIP BAY/CHO MING - EARLY MORNING
          
          Opposite the boarding bridges, on a large platform, Yuri and
          his boys sit in line with the other waiting passengers.
          
          They watch as massive stern gates begin to close. Yuri jumps
          up and yells to the others.
          
                                     YURI
                    They're leaving without us!
          
          The soldier from earlier points his gun at him.
          
                                     SOLDIER
                    What did I tell you!
          
          Caesar barks at the guy.
          
                                                             (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                       99.
          
                                     YURI
                            (POINTING)
                    Look! Idiot! They are leaving you
                    behind too!
          
          The soldier turns to the ships and Yuri knocks him out. He
          grabs his boys and runs towards the closing gates. All the
          other passengers surge forward with him.
          
          In the distance, on the bow side of the ships, the huge
          mountain gates of the bay open, revealing a stunning view of
          Cho Ming Valley.
          
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. MOUNTAIN RIDGE/CHO MING - MORNING
          
          Lin leads his group over a ridge. In front of their eyes--
          
          The gates to the mountain open!
          
                                     LIN
                            (in Chinese)
                    We have to hurry!
                            (to Jackson)
                    They launch! We run out of time!
          
          They follow Lin rushing down the hill, towards one of the
          many Y-shaped launch structures towering in front of the
          gates. Neng and Kate help Mr. and Mrs. Pang down the rocky
          terrain.
          
          
          INT. SHIP BAY/CHO MING - MORNING
          
          A screeching and thundering noise!
          
          THE THREE COMPLETED VESSELS BEGIN TO INCH FORWARD on metal
          girders connecting the Y-shaped launch towers.
          
          
          INT. LIVING QUARTERS/AMERICAN SHIP - MORNING
          
          Laura feels a jolt. She rushes out of her small cabin and
          into a swarm of people moving down a crammed endless
          corridor. She struggles to fight her way through.
          
          A digital voice blares over the speakers.
          
                                     COMPUTER VOICE
                    Countdown to departure. Launch in 17
                    minutes - 42 seconds.
          
          Laura bumps into one of Adrian's Science Officers.

                    Where can I find Adrian Helmsley?
          
                                     SCIENCE OFFICER
                    He's in the Technical Command Centre.

          EXT. LAUNCH SITE/CHO MING VALLEY - MORNING
          
          The three gigantic vessels emerge from the mountain, into the
          open. Support helicopters swarm around them like flies.
          
          
          EXT. BENEATH A LAUNCHING TOWER/CHO-MING - MORNING
          
          Lin and his group look like ants as they scale the metal
          ladders of one of the launch towers.
          
          
          INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - MORNING
          
          Verbal commands fly back and forth. Anheuser watches the
          preparations from a large window.
          
          He looks over to the command bridges of the other vessels as
          they continue to be pulled into place.
          
          
          INT. COMMAND BRIDGES/OTHER SHIPS - MORNING
          
          We cut to the various Heads of State, all at their command
          posts.
          
          
          EXT. TOP OF LAUNCHING TOWER/CHO MING - MORNING
          
          A hatch opens at the top of the launch tower. Lin is the
          first to climb out.
          
          Right before his eyes, the hull of the American Ship slowly
          creeps towards him. He's but a speck against this man-made
          behemoth.
          
          Lin hastily pulls the others up.
          
                                     LIN
                            (in Chinese)
                    Faster, Neng! Help father! Mother, give
                    me your hand.
          
          It's a race against time. The huge ship's hull closes in
          fast. Lin and his family crawl up the side arm while Jackson
          hurries to pull up the rest of the group.
          
          Lilly freezes at the sight of the approaching ship.
                                                             (CONTINUED)

                                    JACKSON
                    Move Lil'bee!
          
          Jackson rips her out of harm's way, just in time. In a
          frenzy, he pushes her up the support arm where the others are
          already huddled on a small platform.
          
          As the towering wall of steel passes by them, inches from
          their faces, Mr. Pang loses his balance. Jackson and Lin both
          see this, but Jackson is closer--
          
          He grabs the old man by his arm, saving him from falling to
          his death.
          
          For the first time, Lin acknowledges Jackson with a nod.
          
          
          EXT. SHIP BAY/CHO MING SITE - MORNING
          
          The three completed ships are half way out, grinding to their
          final launching position.
          
          A mob of passengers led by Yuri has fought their way to the
          ship. More and more people join them, including soldiers.
          
          
          EXT. TOP OF LAUNCHING TOWER/CHO MING - MORNING
          
          Lin, Jackson and the group are huddled on the platform.
          
          The sound of SCREAMING PEOPLE makes them turn. The storming
          masses have arrived at the access platform. There is now a
          huge drop off between them and the tails of the ships.
          
                                     TAMARA
                            (POINTING)
                    Oh my god, that's Yuri!
          
          Next to Yuri are his twins, holding Caesar. She yells!
          
                                    TAMARA (CONT'D)
                    Caesar!
          
          
          EXT. ACCESS PLATFORM/CHO MING SITE - MORNING
          
          The little dog hears Tamara and jumps out of Oleg's arms,
          leaping onto one of the thick cables, that connects the
          platform with the launching towers.
          
          Alec and Oleg attempt to run after Caesar, but Yuri grabs
          them by their necks.
          
                                     YURI
                    Let that stupid dog go!
          
                                                            (CONTINUED)

          He's panicked. The arriving masses are pushing them to the
          drop off at the edge of the platform.
          
          
          EXT. TOP OF LAUNCHING TOWER/CHO MING - MORNING
          
          The ship has reached its targeted position. A small hatch
          lines up directly in front of Lin and his group.
          
                                     LIN
                            (in Chinese)
                    Okay. Now!
          
          One by one they all climb into the hatch. Jackson being the
          last in, notices that Tamara has stayed back.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Tamara! Come on! Get in!
          
          She doesn't move, anxiously waiting for her beloved dog
          darting towards her.
          
          
          EXT. ACCESS PLATFORM/CHO MING SITE - MORNING
          
          The mob pushes at Yuri and his boys. Passengers on either
          side tumble off the platform.
          
          Yuri watches one of them fall, hitting his head against a
          tiny ledge 8 feet below. To his right, he sees a small ladder
          leading down.
          
                                     YURI
                            (in Russian)
                    Down there! Oleg, you go first!
          
          As they hurry down the ladder, people keep tumbling into the
          deep. Reaching the ledge, Oleg discovers Caesar running
          towards Tamara.
          
                                     OLEG
                    Daddy look, Tamara!
          
          Yuri cannot believe his eyes.
          
          
          EXT. TOP OF LAUNCHING TOWER/CHO MING SITE - MORNING
          
          The hatch behind Tamara begins to move. The hydraulic
          supports are being lifted, sealing up the vessel.
          
                                      TAMARA
                    Caesar darling!
          
          Jackson reaches out from the closing hatch.

                                      JACKSON
                    Tamara! Get in!
          
          Tamara climbs inside the hatch and turns.
          
                                      TAMARA
                    Come to mommy!
          
          Caesar leaps into her arms only seconds before the hatch
          seals. As a last gesture, Tamara sticks out her arm and gives
          Yuri the finger.

          Lin leads the group into a long and narrow chamber where the
          hydraulics for the tail gate are located.
          
          He opens a tool cabinet, retrieving a giant electrical power
          drill, almost too big to be carried by one person.
          
          Lin climbs to a hatch near the ceiling and begins to unscrew
          the huge bolts. He looks at Jackson.
          
                                     LIN
                    I need your help.

          Center. She finds Adrian staring at a wall of monitors
          showing the horrifying scenario on the platforms.
          
          People are falling to their deaths in large numbers in their
          desperation to board the ship.
          
                                     LAURA

                    Anheuser convinced them all to launch.
          
          Outside, panicking workers, screaming for their life!
          Deserted passengers waving their green cards!

          With that, Adrian turns to the Communication Officer.
          
                                     ADRIAN (CONT'D)
                    Bobby, make sure the other bridges can
                    hear this.
          
          The officer hesitates as Laura enters in the background.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    What do you think you're doing?
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    I know exactly what I'm doing.
                            (To Bobby)
                    Turn it on!
          
          Bobby flicks a switch. Adrian's voice echoes through all the
          ships.
          
                                     ADRIAN (CONT'D)
                    This is Adrian Helmsley, science
                    advisor to President Wilson...
          
          
          INT. BRIDGE/EUROPEAN SHIP - DAY
          
          The German Chancellor turns to one of the technicians on the
          bridge of the European Ship.
          
                                     GERMAN CHANCELLOR
                    Can you please turn up the volume, Mr.
                    Hoffmann?
          
          Next to her stand the British and French Prime Ministers.
          
                                     ADRIAN (O.S.)
                    I know we've all been involved in
                    making difficult decisions... to save
                    our human civilization...
          
          
          INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          Anheuser looks on stoney faced.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    ... But to be human means to care for
                    each other, and civilization means to
                    work together to create a better life.
                    If that's true there is nothing human
                    and nothing civilized about what we're
                    doing here. Ask yourselves ... Can we
                    really stand by and let all those
                    people out there die?
          
          Laura watches him proudly.
                                                             (CONTINUED)

                                      ADRIAN (CONT'D)
                     A civilization that allows that, does
                     not deserve to survive.
                             (PAUSE)
                     Or at least I don't want to be part of
                     it.
          
          Anheuser cuts in with sarcasm.
          
                                      ANHEUSER
                     We'll miss you Helmsley but somehow
                     we'll get by. Officer switch that off.
          
          The Communications Officer looks at Adrian.
          
                                      ANHEUSER (CONT'D)
                     That's an order soldier.
          
                                       ADRIAN
                     Don't do it!
          
          
          INT. BRIDGE/ASIAN SHIP - DAY
          
          The Russian President, together with the heads of state from
          China and Japan, listen in as Adrian responds.
          
                                      ADRIAN (O.S.)
                     We have to open our gates and let these
                     people in. All of them.
          
          
          INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          Anheuser has had enough.
          
                                      ANHEUSER
                     Have you lost your mind? Look at the
                     countdown. We have less than five
                     minutes left... And none of our ships
                     have the resources to feed those
                     people. If you save them today we all
                     starve tomorrow.
          
          He's almost screaming now.
          
                                      ANHEUSER (CONT'D)
                     Do you wanna be responsible for the
                     extinction of the human race? Can you
                     handle that, Adrian?!
          
          Silence.
          
          Adrian's battle seems lost. But he doesn't give up, and
          instead speaks softly now.
          
                                                               (CONTINUED)

                                     ADRIAN
                    There is a young astrophysicist from
                    India who is the reason we are all
                    here, trying to give mankind a second
                    chance. He's the one who discovered it
                    all, the one who connected the dots. We
                    all owe him our lives.
          
          All eyes are glued to Adrian.
          
                                     ADRIAN (CONT'D)
                    I just learned that he was killed with
                    his family by a tsunami in eastern
                    India. You know why?
          
          Adrian stares Anheuser in the eyes as he continues.
          
                                     ADRIAN (CONT'D)
                    He died because we forgot to pick him
                    up.
                            (PAUSE)
                    I beg you... whatever our future holds
                    don't let us start it with an act of
                    cruelty. What will you tell your
                    children... and their children?
          
          Silence. Laura steps up alongside Adrian.
          
                                     LAURA
                    If my father were here, he would open
                    the gates.
          
          Adrian and Laura share a look.
          
                                     RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (O.S.)

                    The United Kingdom, Spain, France and
                    Germany, and I believe I can also speak
                    for the Italian Prime Minister...
          
                                                                    107.

          Laura and Adrian watch Anheuser shaking his head in defeat.
          Bobby, the Communications Officer smiles with relief. Adrian
          turns to the Captain.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Captain Michaels, you heard them.
          
          
          EXT. LAUNCH SITE/CHO MING VALLEY - DAY
          
          One by one the gigantic gates at the stern of the three ships
          begin to creek open.
          
          The masses gathered on the platform CHEER wildly!
          
          
          INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          Lilly crawls through the CONNECTING TUNNEL meeting up with
          Kate in a large bay on the other side.
          
                                     LILLY
                    Phew... It stinks in here.
          
          Together with Neng and his parents, they all look up in
          DISBELIEF--
          
          A Giraffe, chewing her cud, smiles down at them. Caesar barks
          at her.
          
                                     TAMARA
                    Sssh...Caesar.
          
          A second later, hundreds of different ANIMALS RESPOND. They
          are in the zoological bay.

          Gordon helps Noah up the small ladder leading to the
          connecting tunnel.
          
          Just as he goes to hand him Jackson's backpack, the HYDRAULIC
          MOTORS begin to GROWL! Lin looks up in panic. He screams.
          
                                     LIN
                    They're opening the gate! It will crush
                    us!
          
          The whole ceiling begins to lower towards them. From down
          below, Jackson sees his son about to be hit by it.

                                       JACKSON
                    Noah! Watch out!
          
          Gordon makes a split second decision. With all his strength,
          he shoves the boy into the tunnel.
          
          
          INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          From the other side of the tunnel, Kate watches as the metal
          ceiling misses Noah by a hair, but catches Gordon, wiping him
          off the ladder.
          
                                       KATE
                    No!
          
          
          INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          Jackson watches helplessly as Gordon falls past him. He
          survives his landing and desperately tries to grab on to the
          sloping surface, but he can't. He slips.
          
          Gordon is crushed between the gears, sharing his last look
          with Jackson before he dies.
          
          
          INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          Kate helps a trembling Noah out of the tunnel.
          
                                     NOAH
                    Something happened, mom.
          
          Kate pulls him close and shuts her eyes tightly. She fights
          back the tears.
          
          
          INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          Jackson and Lin know they're running out of time, their
          remaining space is shrinking every second.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    We have to stop it!
          
          Lin grabs the huge electrical power drill nearby and attempts
          to jam it between the hydraulic arm and the wall.
          
          As it digs deeper into the metal, the hydraulic starts to
          slow down.
          
                                                                      109.

          Still on the ledge, Yuri and the boys watch as the huge
          boarding gate lowers towards them. They are trapped.
          
          Just then, the gates begin to slow, but surely they will be
          crushed.

          Back in the chamber, Lin still struggles with the drill.
          Suddenly he slips.
          
          Jackson manages to catch his fall. But in the process Lin's
          foot gets caught between the gears, mangling it.
          
          He screams in pain as the hydraulic slowly grinds towards a
          halt.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    You did it, man. You did it.
          
          In great pain, Lin grins back at him.
          
          
          EXT. LAUNCH SITE/CHO MING VALLEY - DAY
          
          The gates of the ships hit the access platform with a
          thundering noise. People begin to rush on board.
          
          
          INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          Alarm signals go off. The Captain turns to one of his

                                     CAPTAIN MICHAELS
                    What's wrong with the gate?
          
                                     OFFICER
                    I don't know. Maybe there's something
                    jamming it, sir.
          
          The countdown on the monitor reads 2 min. 40 sec. Laura and
          Adrian share a worried look.
          
          We hear a HOLLOW BELL ring!

          The booming sound echoes through the Cho Ming valley. As a
          gentle wind catches the Lama's clothes, he looks up--
          
          A tidal wave of immeasurable proportion crests the mountains.
          
          The Lama continues to strike the bell as the monastery is
          wiped clean from the earth.
          
                                                                 CUT TO:

          The technicians desperately try to figure out what's wrong.
          An officer waves Adrian over.
          
                                     SURVEILLANCE OFFICER
                    Sir, we have a breach in the zoological
                    bay.
          
                                       ADRIAN
                    Can you zoom in?
          
          The video camera moves in on Kate, Noah and Lilly. Adrian
          can't believe his eyes. He turns to Laura.
          
                                     ADRIAN (CONT'D)
                    I know those kids. Remember the book I
                    told you about? Their father wrote it.
          
          Captain Michaels shouts across the room.
          
                                     CAPTAIN MICHAELS
                    We're loaded. We can close the gates
                    sir.
          
                                       ANHEUSER
                    Do it!
          
          Anheuser looks nervously at the countdown. It reads 1:34
          
          
          EXT. ACCESS PLATFORM/CHO MING SITE - DAY
          
          Above Yuri and the boys, people are leaping from the access
          platform onto the stern gate of the American ship.
          
          Yuri looks for a hole in the flow of people before seizing
          his chance and lifting the first of his boys up.
          
                                     YURI
                            (in Russian)
                    Pull yourself up!
          
          Oleg manages to reach up and hold onto the gate.
          
                                                              (CONTINUED)

          Inside the ship, officers yell.
          
                                     DECK OFFICER (O.S.)
                    To the lower decks people!
          
          The gates suddenly screech back into life and begin to close.
          Yuri doubles his efforts lifting Alec higher, but Alec cannot
          quite reach.
          
          Yuri strains with all his effort before deciding.
          
                                     YURI
                    Oleg! Catch your brother!
          
          Yuri leaps forward holding Alec out in his arms.
          
          Oleg manages to grab his brother's hands as Yuri lets go and
          falls into the deep crevasse below. He makes no noise until
          he hits the rocks beneath.
          
          Oleg pulls his brother from above.
          
          
          INT. INSIDE LOADING GATE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          A SIREN blasts. Both of Yuri's sons are now on deck. A
          loading officer pulls them back, away from the gate.
          
                                     DECK OFFICER
                    Boys, you gotta move.
          
                                     ALEC
                    We wait for our father! He's still down
                    there!
          
          The loading officer attempts to comfort them.
          
                                     DECK OFFICER
                    There's no one down there.
                            (GENTLE)
                    Come on boys, come...
          
          The Officer and the boys look back as the stern gate slowly
          closes. But with a SCREECHING sound it grinds to a halt.
          
          The gate is jammed open leaving a twenty foot gap.

          ALARMS sound. Anheuser and the Captain stare at the monitors.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    Why is the stern gate not closing?

                                     CAPTAIN MICHAELS
                    Something's wrong with the hydraulics,
                    sir.
          
                                     ADRIAN (O.S.)
                    Captain, over here.
          
          They race over. Adrian points to a monitor.
          
                                     ADRIAN (CONT'D)
                    I think we found the problem.
          
          On the monitor, they see Sarah and the others desperately
          waiting for Jackson and Lin.
          
                                     ADRIAN (CONT'D)
                    How did they get in there?
          
                                     SURVEILLANCE OFFICER
                    They must have come through the
                    hydraulic chamber. There...
          
          Bobby, the Surveillance Officer, selects a different camera
          and we now see inside the tunnel in which Jackson is pulling
          along a wounded Lin.
          
                                     LAURA
                    That guy is injured. Something must
                    have gone wrong.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    You're damn right something went wrong!
                    Congratulations Helmsley, you may have
                    just killed us all but as long as your
                    conscience is clean...
          
          Adrian tries to ignore this.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Let's get an emergency crew there right
                    now. I'll meet them at the Hydraulic
                    Chamber.
          
          Anheuser sneers him, shooting a look to Laura.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    You think you're the main man now, just
                    because your fucking the President's
                    daughter?
          
          Without thinking, Adrian turns and punches Anheuser hard in
          the face. He drops to the floor, out cold.
          
          Everyone stands in stunned silence. Laura smiles. Adrian
          looks around.

                                     TECHNICAL OFFICER
                    If we can't close the stern gate, then
                    the engines won't start.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    There's no way to override it?

          All three vessels are now engulfed in churning water.

          they're resting on, keep them anchored.

          A new ALARM sounds as water begins to shoot through the open
          stern gate of the American ship.
          
          The people on the loading bay panic, among them we see Alec
          and Oleg.
          
          
          INT. HALLWAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          The same ALARM rings out in the hallways of the ship. Laura,
          Adrian and their party are all braced against the corridor,
          as the vessel undulates back and forth.
          
                                     SURVEILLANCE OFFICER
                    Water has penetrated the stern!
          
          Laura looks unsure.
          
                                     LAURA
                    What now?
          
                                     SURVEILLANCE OFFICER
                    The rear of the ship will start sealing
                    itself up one compartment at a time.
          
          Adrian looks at him.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Then how will we get to the hydraulic
                    chamber?

                    If we don't hurry, we won't be able to.
          
          Despite the violent movement of the ship, Adrian pushes on
          down the corridor towards the back of the boat. They follow.

                    Tamara! Take Lilly and Noah.
          
          Kate reaches in to help Jackson as Tamara begins to move with
          Lilly. Noah remains back with his mother.
          
          Jackson finally makes it through with Lin. Kate is almost
          tearful with relief to see him.

                    I was so worried about you.
          
          Suddenly the Zoological bay begins to seal itself off.
          
          Lilly, already in the next compartment with Tamara and her
          dog, screams out as a chamber door quickly slides up, from
          the floor to the ceiling. It separates Lilly from her family.
          
                                       LILLY
                    Mummy!
          
          Jackson and Kate turn but it's too late. They only catch a
          glimpse of Lilly before they are sealed in. The water level
          continues to rise.
          
          
          INT. ANTE-CHAMBER ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          Panicked, Tamara turns and looks around. Down the corridor,
          in the distance, she sees Adrian, Laura and the rescue crew
          approaching.
          
          But between them she spots the next chamber door rising
          quickly.
          
                                       TAMARA
                    Lilly run!
          
          Lilly starts moving as Tamara turns and picks up Caesar.
          
          Moving quickly, Lilly is able to climb up and over the fast
          rising door. But as she dangles from the other side, she
          looks down and is too scared to jump.
          
                                       TAMARA (O.S) (CONT'D)
                    Lilly! Take him.
          
          Lilly looks up and sees two hands straining to hold Caesar
          above the quickly narrowing gap.
          
          In a courageous move, Lilly grabs the little dog before he
          gets crushed and together they fall to the ground.

          Back on the other side of the chamber door, Tamara looks
          around. She is trapped now as the water continues to rush in.

          Lilly is close to tears.

          The water continues to flood in as Jackson helps Neng with
          his unconscious brother.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    We have to move him higher.
                            (looks around)
                    Over there!
          
          Suddenly, a VIOLENT SHAKE throws them all off balance,
          pitching them into the water.
          
          
          EXT. LAUNCH PILLAR/UNDER WATER - DAY
          
          In the debris-filled, murky waters we see that the fuselage
          of Air Force One has slammed against the first of the ship's
          launch towers.
          
          Slowly it begins to bend, finally giving way. The other
          launch towers follow like dominos.
          
          The ship is ripped from its anchorage and sent drifting
          sideways, rudderless.

          Chaos. Fear. Everybody holds on for dear life.
          
          
          EXT. LAUNCH SITE/CHO MING VALLEY - DAY
          
          The vessel is swept away, over the mountain ridge.
          
          
          INT. HALLWAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          Alec and Oleg scream, desperately trying to hold on as the
          whole ship capsizes.
          
                                                                   117.
          
          EXT. DARJEELING VALLEY/HIMALAYA - DAY
          
          The giant ship drifts upside down and rudderless - smashed
          around by the debris and raging waters.
          
          But then, as it hits another ridge, it rolls right side up
          and seems to steady itself.
          
          However, the strong currents continue to force it through the
          mountain ranges of the Himalayas.

          The Captain's face drops.
          
                                     CAPTAIN MICHAELS

          The water rises fast as Kate sees the severity of Lin's wound
          for the first time.
          
                                     KATE
                    We need something to stop the bleeding
                    or he'll die.
          
          A split second later Noah holds out his belt.
          
                                     NOAH
                    Mum, will this do?
          
          Suddenly Jackson hears a voice over a speaker.

                    met once before. Your daughter is with

          Adrian is using an emergency wall intercom, with Laura next
          to him, holding Lilly.

          Caesar barks.

          Tamara hears Caesar over the speaker in her compartment and
          smiles with relief. She is struggling to stay afloat though,
          and is running out of air.
          
          
          INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          Jackson discovers the wall speaker. He moves closer to it.

                    We can't get to you. Whatever you did,

                    You stay with Mommy.
          
          Jackson looks at Kate.

          The water is up to their chest now. Jackson takes a breath
          and disappears underwater.

          Back on the bridge, Anheuser regains consciousness and gets
          to his feet. His nose is bleeding. He looks around him.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    Captain, what's happening?

          Anheuser looks at him dumbfounded as he stumbles to the

          The water level in Tamara's compartment is at its height now

          She struggles below the surface for a moment, looking around
          desperately for a way out but there is none.
          
          Tamara drowns.

          Jackson manages to find an air pocket. He fills up his lungs
          with air and thinks hard.
          
          As he strips off his jacket, he seems to have a plan. He
          dives under again.
          
                                                                   120.

          Lin is being held up in the water by his brother and parents.
          
          Kate has wrapped the belt around his lower leg and now pulls
          it tight. Lin screams.
          
          Noah uses this as the moment to dive underwater, unnoticed,
          to go and help his father.

          Back under water, Jackson is using the extension cord of the
          power drill to pull himself down to the tool cabinet.
          
          Jackson opens it, retrieving a giant crowbar. He begins to
          use it to dislodge the tool but it's hard work.

          Kate and the Pangs are desperately close to running out of
          air now, but despite this, Kate still tends to Lin.
          
          After a moment she turns and is first confused then horrified
          to see that Noah is nowhere to be found.
          
                                       KATE

          Jackson pulls with all his might, but he can't quite shift
          the drill.
          
          To his surprise, a pair of young hands join his on the handle
          of the crowbar. Noah is alongside him now, helping.
          
          Working as father and son, they manage, little by little, to
          loosen it before finally the drill comes free.
          
          Adrian gives Noah the thumbs up and the boy heads back to the
          surface. Jackson goes to follow but in the last moment he
          spots the knapsack containing his laptop.
          
          He dives back down for it.
          
                                                                      121.

                    Mom, we did it!
          
          Kate pulls him to her, relieved he is safe. Noah smiles and
          calls out towards the nearly submerged speaker.

          Lilly and Laura wait nervously. They hear a muffled voice.

                    We got it free. Can you hear me? We did
                    it!
          
          Adrian leaps up when he hears this. He flicks a button on the

          Jackson reaches his knapsack, but when sees Noah's cell phone
          lying next to it, he makes a decision and reaches for that
          instead.
          
          He hears the muffled sound of the engines and smiles. But as
          he turns to swim back, his face freezes--
          
          He's looking into the lifeless eyes of Gordon, who floats
          inches from his face.
          
                                                                     122.

          The battle seems hopeless. Captain Michaels yells at the top
          of his lungs.

          Everyone on the bridge watches in awe as Mount Everest,
          earth's highest peak, drifts slowly past.
          
          After a long beat, they begin to holler and cheer.

          Kate hears the CHEERING coming from the speakers. The water
          level stops rising but she still looks around in panic.
          
                                     KATE
                    Noah! Where is he?
          
          Noah begins to cry.

                    He was just behind me...
          
          Finally! Jackson bursts out of the water and takes a lungfull
          of wonderful air.
          
          Kate and Noah are overjoyed. The Pangs smile to one another.
          
          Jackson looks Kate squarely in the eyes.

          Kate embraces him tightly.
          
                                     KATE
                    Whatever you do... I will never let you
                    go again.

          We hear a voice.
          
                                     ADRIAN (O.S.)
                    ... Day 988. No one is waiting for
                    anything to happen...
          
                                                                   FADE UP

          INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          Adrian sits in his cabin, his copy of `Farewell Atlantis' in
          his lap.
          
                                       ADRIAN
                    ...   and all we can hear is the sound of
                    our   own breathing that reminds us we
                    are   still sharing our memories, hopes
                    and   ideas.
          
          Opposite him, Laura sits listening to him read.
          
                                     ADRIAN (CONT'D)
                    ... And funny, just today we found out
                    that the entire crew of the Atlantis,
                    somehow or another, has relatives in
                    Wisconsin.
                            (PAUSE)
                    The end.
          
          Adrian closes the book. There's a moment of silence.
          
                                     LAURA
                    How many copies did you say that sold?

                                     ADRIAN
                    Less than 500.
                            (with a smile)
                    It's what you might call a cult
                    classic.
          
          Laura looks at him grinning.
          
                                     LAURA
                    It seems we have very different tastes
                    Mr. Helmsley?
          
                                     ADRIAN
                            (PLAYFUL)
                    Well that's healthy Dr. Wilson.
                    Something we could maybe explore...
                    unless you have other pressing
                    engagements.
          
                                     LAURA
                    Actually my diary's pretty open.
          
          The intimate moment is cut short.

                                     CAPTAIN MICHAELS (O.S.)
                    Ladies and gentlemen, this is Captain
                    Michaels speaking. In a few minutes, I
                    will be giving the orders to unseal the
                    decks.

          Jackson and his family stand amongst thousands of other
          people who are gathering in anticipation.
          
                                     CAPTAIN MICHAELS (O.S.)
                    Please be careful when you step out and
                    of course... enjoy the fresh air.
          
          Jackson kneels down and zips up Lilly's jacket. She is
          holding Caesar, whose still wearing his diamond collar.
          
                                     LILLY
                    Daddy? When can we go back home?

                                     JACKSON
                    There's nothing we can go back to
                    Lil'bee. Whatever's out there, that's
                    our home now. Don't be scared.
          
                                     LILLY
                    I'm not Daddy. No more pull-ups.
          
                                     JACKSON
                            (PROUDLY)
                    That's my big girl.
          
          Jackson squeezes Lilly's shoulder.

                    Can we pet him?
          
          Lilly turns to see Yuri's boys standing next to her.
          
                                     LILLY
                    Of course you can. He's your doggie.
          
          The boys both smile at her.

          Adrian and Laura enter the bridge.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    You called for me, sir?
          
                                     CAPTAIN MICHAELS
                    Prof. West has something to show you,
                    Mr. Helmsley.
          
          The Captain directs him to a monitor.
          
                                     CAPTAIN MICHAELS (CONT'D)
                    Looks like your scientific projections
                    are way off again.
          
          The Captain grins at Prof. West.
          
                                     PROF. WEST
                    The water is receding much faster than
                    we projected, Adrian...
          
          A monitor reveals an image of the African continent, however
          its shape changed dramatically. The image of the southern tip
          is enlarged.
          
                                      LAURA

                    It's hard to believe, but the Himalayas
                    are no longer the roof of the world.
                    It's now the Drakensberg mountains of
                    Kwa-Zulu Natal. The whole African
                    continent has risen several thousand
                    feet and most likely, never even
                    flooded.
          
                                     CAPTAIN MICHAELS
                    Our European colleagues have already
                    set course for it.

                    Here, somebody wants to talk to you.
          
          Adrian curious, grabs the mic.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    This is Helmsley.
          
          We hear a muffled, raspy voice through the speakers.

                    No, this is Helmsley.
          
                                     ADRIAN (O.S.)

                                     CAPTAIN MICHAELS
                    We should have a visual of the `Freedom
                    of the Seas' shortly.
          
                                     ADRIAN

          Harry hangs up. He picks up Tony, embracing him wildly.

          Adrian, still excited from speaking with his dad, grabs Laura
          and kisses her on the lips. She squeals.
          
                                     ANHEUSER (O.S.)
                    Put that woman down Helmsley.
          
          Adrian looks at Anheuser, unsure of what he might say.
          
                                     ANHEUSER (CONT'D)
                    Young guys like you with your
                    idealistic dreams, you think you can

                                     ANHEUSER (CONT'D)
                    I just pray to God, that you keep on
                    making the right calls... in this new
                    world of ours.
          
          Adrian nods and with a smile to Laura turns to leave.
          
                                     ANHEUSER (CONT'D)
                    Mr. Helmsley, one more thing.
          
          Adrian turns back.
          
                                     ANHEUSER (CONT'D)
                    There was no one.
          
                                       ADRIAN
                    Pardon me?
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    There was no white kid better than you.
                    I'm terribly sorry I said that.

          Neng pushes his brother Lin in a wheelchair onto the deck
          next to his parents. Mrs. Pang turns to her husband.
          
                                     MRS. PANG
                            (in Chinese)
                    I wonder will the clouds look the same
                    and the stars?
          
                                     MR.PANG
                    Do not fear. Some things will never
                    change.
          
          The old Chinese man forces a little smile. Closer to the
          front of this crowd Jackson approaches Noah.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    I thought you might want this.
          
          He takes Noah's cell phone from his pocket and hands it to
          him.
          
                                     NOAH
                    Do you think I'll still get a signal
                    ... Dad?
          
          Jackson is touched to hear him use that word. He smiles and
          hugs him. Adrian, Laura and Anheuser arrive alongside them.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    I finally finished your book Jackson.

          Jackson looks at her, smiling playfully.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Excuse me, I believe he's addressing
                    the author. Well, what did you think?
          
          Adrian smiles.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    I'd say... those astronauts of yours
                    would be shitting themselves, if they
                    knew all their relatives are now stuck
                    in the South Pole.
          
          Suddenly a horn sounds and the sealed deck doors let off a
          burst of pressurised air. A murmur goes through the crowd.
          
          Everyone is silent as the huge deck doors slowly begin to
          roll back and light streams in.
          
          
                                                             (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                     129.
          
          The Pang family try to see over people's heads, even Anheuser
          looks hopeful. Jackson pulls his family close as the first
          rays of daylight hit their faces.
          
          
          EXT. AMERICAN SHIP/SOMEWHERE IN THE HIMALAYAS - DAY
          
          Hatches unseal all around the ship. Sun streams through the
          clouds. Everywhere people emerge outside, into the light of
          day. A majestic moment.
          
          
          EXT. FRONT DECK/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          They all stare in awe at the waters receding against the ice-
          covered mountain peaks. Caesar lets out a YELP of joy.
          
          Almost as soon as the doors have opened, the ship's
          HELICOPTERS take off, flying towards a stunning site--
          
          The `Freedom of the Seas' is perched on a mountain peak,
          surrounded by calm waters. Behind it, they see the most
          beautiful rainbow. This is the new world.
          
          And again we hear Mozart's Adagio...

          The following is very loosely based on some shit that actually
          happened...
                         OVER BLACK
                         
          We hear the roar of a V8 engine, piped out through some
          throaty, fucked up muffler, as
                         
          EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
                         
          An '89 Mustang bursts like a shot over a rise in the highway.
          It's got a rusted two-tone paint job, Maryland plates, and
          bald tires that scream as it peels off an exit and into the
                         
          EXT. SUBURBS - DAY
                         
          The car fast approaches a stop sign, dangerously blows through
          the intersection.
                         
          INT. MUSTANG - DAY - MOVING
                         
          We don't see the DRIVER, only the redlining RPMs, Vans slip-
          ons working the pedals, wristwatch being checked. The wheel
          cranks right as the car turns onto a -
                         
          One way street. A minivan flies right at us. The Mustang
          hops up onto the curb to avoid it, clips a trash can and -
                         
          Garbage explodes like confetti. The wipers engage, brushing
          the trash aside. The car whips another turn and
                         
          EXT. SUBURBS - DAY
                         
          The Mustang fishtails around a corner and skids away.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         TIRES SCREECH
                         
          Brake pads smoke. The Mustang stops outside
                         
          EXT. HOUSE - DAY
                         
          The Driver jumps out of the car. As he rushes to the front
          door, we see the urgent package he is delivering.
                         
          TWO LARGE PIZZAS
                         
          Before he can ring the bell, the door opens and two smug 15-
          YEAR-OLDS stare out.
                         
                          15-YEAR-OLD
           That's 34 minutes. You're 4 minutes
           late. Pizza's free.
                         
          REVEAL our guy staring back at the kids. This is WILL (25),
          probably good looking in another life.
           2.
                         
          Right now, he is tired and unamused, wearing a red "Giorgio's
          Trattoria" hat and a sweaty matching t-shirt.
                         
                          WILL
           Gimme a break. You guys live two
           towns away. It's pretty much fucking
           impossible to get here in 30 minutes.
                         
                          OTHER 15-YEAR-OLD
           Exactly. That's why we ordered from
           your shitty "trattoria."
                         
                          WILL
           This is gonna come out of my paycheck.
           You sure you don't want to take the
           moral high ground?
                         
                          OTHER 15-YEAR-OLD
           We'd rather take the pizzas.
                         
          Will takes a calming breath. Hands over the pizzas.
                         
                          WILL
           Ok. You guys are pretty smart. You
           figured out a way to beat the system.
                          (PEEKS INSIDE)
           Got the house to yourselves?
                         
                          15-YEAR-OLD
           That's right.
                         
                          WILL
           Not bad. Any jailbait in there?
           Little pizza and a rainbow party?
                         
          The kids shakes their heads.
                         
                          WILL
           Seriously? Well, two hustlers like
           yourselves gotta have the place
           stocked with beer and whippits and
           shit, right? Just call the girls up
           and let them know the party's on.
                         
                          15-YEAR-OLD
           Man, we don't have any of that stuff.
                         
          Will makes a show of mulling this over.
                         
                          WILL
           I really shouldn't do this...but you
           seem like a couple of good dudes.
           I'll tell you what, you give me the
           money that your mom left you for the
           pizzas, and I'll grab you some beers.
                          (MORE)
           3.
                         
                          WILL (CONT'D)
                          (BEAT)
           But I get to keep the change as a
           tip. Deal?
                         
          The kids look at each other. One hesitantly pulls out some
          cash. Will snatches it and heads off.
                         
                          WILL
           I'll see you in like 20 minutes.
                         
          The kids look uncertain. As if sensing this, Will stops
          before getting into his ride.
                         
                          WILL
           You boys like Budweiser, right?
                         
                          15-YEAR-OLD
           Uh, yeah, totally.
                         
                          OTHER 15-YEAR-OLD
           Love that shit!
                         
          INT. MUSTANG - DAY - MOVING
                         
          The sun sets. Will cruises back into his own middle-class
          town in suburban Maryland.
                         
          A six pack of Budweiser rests in the passenger seat.
                         
          Will stops at a light. Checks out a PRETTY YOUNG THING in
          the Jeep beside him. She catches him looking, rolls her
          eyes. The light turns and the Jeep skids away.
                         
          Will self consciously removes his "Giorgio's" cap.
                         
          INT. GIORGIO'S TRATTORIA - NIGHT
                         
          Will enters and nods at CHRISTOPHER (40s), the manager. His
          balding head is nearly translucent from absorbing a day's
          worth of pizza grease.
                         
                          WILL
           Yo, Chris. Let me cash the fuck out.
                         
          Will hands over some cash to Christopher.
                         
                          CHRISTOPHER
           You have a pretty good shift?
                         
                          WILL
           For sure. I mean, the part where I
           had to drop off all those pizzas
           kinda sucked, but the rest was cool.
           4.
                         
                          CHRISTOPHER
           Oh, yeah? 'Cause, I got some kids
           calling in saying you ripped them off.
           Promised to buy them beer or something.
                         
                          WILL
           I actually did buy the beer, but it
           would have been illegal to give it
           to them, right? So I'm gonna do the
           responsible thing and drink it myself.
                         
                          CHRISTOPHER
           That's real funny. But I'm trying
           to run a business here.
                         
                          WILL
           What kind of business promises to
           deliver anywhere in 30 minutes?
           It's ridiculous.
                         
                          CHRISTOPHER
           I don't wanna hear another one of
           your bullshit excuses. You're fired.
                         
                          WILL
           Come on. If I didn't need this job,
           I wouldn't be doing this shitty job.
                         
          Chris is unmoving.
                         
                          WILL
           Fuck! Whatever!
                         
          Will storms off. As he gets to the door -
                         
                          CHRISTOPHER
           You know, you were an okay driver
           half the time. And you're not a Puerto
           Rican. Which means something to me.
                         
                          WILL
           That's poignant.
                         
                          CHRISTOPHER
           I guess I could rehire you, on a
           provisional basis. Of course, this
           would be at the slightly reduced
           "new company rate."
                         
                          WILL
           Are you fucking serious?
                         
                          CHRISTOPHER
           I don't know. Is there anyone else
           left in town for you to work for?
           5.
                         
          Will shakes his head. Swallows what's left of his pride.
                          WILL
           When do I start?
          EXT. SMALL APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
          Will sits on the darkened front stoop. He tosses an empty
          can into the bushes and gets to work on his fourth beer.
          He looks over at a parked Hyundai Elantra. A YOUNG MAN sits
          in the passenger seat with a pensive look on his face. He
          makes a sudden, surprised gasp. The homely YOUNG WOMAN who
          was just blowing him sits up from his lap and rearranges
          herself in the driver seat. She leans over for a goodbye
          kiss. The Young Man obliges with much fanfare.
          The Young Man gets out and the car pulls away. This is CHET
          (25), a clean cut guy dressed in the Gap Premium Collection.
          He heads toward the building, high off his BJ, humming
          Outkast's "Ms. Jackson." He stops when he notices Will in
          the shadows.
                          CHET
           What the hell? Have you just been
           sitting there?
                          WILL
           Yep. Caught the whole show. Really
           classy move at the end. You know,
           the kiss. Putting your tongue in
           her mouth right after you fucked it.
                          CHET
           Hey, a nice girl decides to pleasure
           me on a weeknight, in her car no
           less...I'm not gonna make her feel
           like an untouchable. I'm gonna make
           her feel like a lady.
                          WILL
           What manners. May I offer you some
           alcohol, sir. To wash the taste of
           yourself out of your mouth.
          Will offers his beer. Chet takes a slug, gurgles for effect.
                         
                          CHET
           By the way, she said she had a friend.
           Maybe we can go on our first double
           date since you tried to talk Jackie
           Fortunato and her cousin into having
           a four-way with us.
                         
                          WILL
           I misread their body language. It
           happens.
           6.
                         
          Will picks up some rented movies sitting beside him.
                         
                          WILL
           Come on. Let's go inside, drink
           your beer and watch shit get crazy.
                          (FANS MOVIES)
           Old favorites. You choose. Lethal
           Weapon, Lethal Weapon 2...was gonna
           get the third Lethal Weapon, but
           decided on a porn. So it's really
           between the first two.
                         
                          CHET
           I choose sleep. I gotta teach a
           class at eight.
                         
                          WILL
           You're a sub. Just call in sick.
           Like the real teacher did.
                         
                          CHET
           Come on, man, you know I got promoted
           to full-time last month. You bought
           me a laser pointer.
                         
          Will heaves a sigh.
                         
                          WILL
           Yeah, I know. I guess I'm just having
           a hard time accepting you as "the
           man." You know, flunking kids, giving
           out spite detentions to girls you
           wanna fuck, laser pointing at shit.
                         
                          CHET
           I also get healthcare and my summers
           off. It's not perfect, but it's a
           career.
                         
          Will grudgingly stands up.
                         
                          WILL
           I guess that's just the difference
           between you and me.
                         
          He holds up the Lethal Weapon DVDs.
                         
                          WILL
           I'm like Riggs. Cruising the streets.
           No rules, no attachments. Every
           other day some asshole is trying to
           take my badge. You're fucking
           Murtaugh. Always worried about your
           pension. Well, guess what, it gets
           old after the first movie.
           7.
                         
                          CHET
           I just got head. I'm totally Riggs.
          Will shakes his head, turns and walks off.
          INT. STUDIO APARTMENT - DAY
          Will wakes up, legs dangling over the edge of a tiny couch.
          His TV is still on, displaying the menu screen from a porn.
          Will looks down at his coffee table. Clears some magazines
          to reveal a file folder. Flips the cover -
          It's full of college applications, drafts of admissions essays,
          a junior college transcript. Will thumbs through one of the
          glossy applications. The kids look young. Very young.
          Will glances over at a picture on his wall: he and Chet at
          high school graduation, looking just as young. They have
          their arms around a pretty girl squeezed between them. Will
          and the girl look very high and very happy.
          Will shuts the folder, slides it back under the coffee table
          debris. He looks over at a clock: it is already 2:00 PM.
                          WILL
           Fuck.
          INT. MUSTANG - DAY
          Will jumps in and starts the engine. As he tucks his
          "Giorgio's" cap onto his head, he catches his reflection in
          the rear-view mirror.
                         
                          WILL
           You asshole. You titanic asshole.
           Come on down and get your prize.
                         
          He makes his fingers into a gun, puts it to his head...pulls
          the trigger and
                         
          BOOM!
                         
                         WE'RE IN
                         
          EXT. OPEN FIELD - DAY
                         
          A watermelon explodes in a shower of red, juicy bits. Loud,
          dumb laughter echoes.
                         
          Standing 20 yards away is DWAYNE (32), an intense, meaty guy
          in a sleeveless Baltimore Ravens t-shirt. On his left bicep
          is a tattoo of the Tasmanian Devil flipping the bird.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Fruit motherfuckin' salad!
           8.
                         
          Crouched beside him is JAY (27), tall and awkward, in a wool
          surplus cap. He carefully rigs homemade explosives to another
          watermelon, then looks up at Dwayne. His eyes are magnified
          into saucers by his thick glasses. There's a peculiar
          eagerness to please in them.
                         
                          JAY
           This one's gonna blow even bigger.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Boy, if you weren't such a skinny
           little bitch you coulda been in the
           military or something.
                         
                          JAY
           Whatever. I don't need the military.
           I taught myself how to do this shit.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I hear that. I taught myself how to
           eat pussy. And cut my own hair.
                         
          Jay jogs the watermelon a safe distance away. He returns
          and pulls out a detonator. Dwayne snatches it.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           This one's all me.
           (makes "radio" sounds)
           Mr. President, we have enemies at
           the gate. Give me the order.
           (more "radio" sounds)
           Fuck that, sir. I don't negotiate
           with terrorists!
                         
          Dwayne presses a button and
                         
          BOOM!
                         
          The explosion is so powerful that it sprinkles our guys'
          smiling faces with fruit juice.
                         
          INT. KITCHEN, NICE HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Large and early-90s chic. Dwayne and Jay have the fridge
          open, fixing themselves a cold cut plate. Dwayne is debating
          the amount of meat on the plate...adds some more.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Wanna make sure I get enough calories.
                         
                          JAY
           I thought you wanted to get diesel
           for the summer. Bang that towel
           girl at the community pool.
           9.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           It's obvious you don't know shit-all
           about physical fitness. You gotta
           bulk up first, then you slim down.
           I'm clearly in the bulk up phase. I
           told you to watch Pumping Iron like
           a month ago. If you'd listened to
           me, maybe you'd know what the fuck
           I'm talking about.
                          (BEAT)
           Grab some RC Cola.
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, NICE HOUSE - DAY
                         
          The shades are drawn. We hear a girl scream bloody murder!
                         
          The guys are watching FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 3...in 3D. They
          both wear cheap cardboard glasses.
                         
          Jay jumps back as Jason wields a 3D ax.
                         
                          JAY
           Shit, man! It's so real!
                         
          Dwayne reaches out, "touching" the 3D images. He stands and
          starts humping the air.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Check it out. I ain't afraid of
           Jason. I'm fucking him.
                          (THRUSTING HARDER)
           You like that, Jason!? In the mask!
                         
          Jay cracks up. The lights flick on.
                         
           GRIZZLED VOICE (O.S.)
           Who are you two fags fucking?
                         
          Standing by the switch is Dwayne's dad, JERRY (70s). Most
          people just call him "THE MAJOR." The faded USMC tattoo on
          his thick forearm explains why.
                         
                          JAY
           Afternoon, Major.
                         
          Dwayne flops back onto the couch.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Dad, we're watching a flick. We got
           45 minutes and a potential 3D sex
           scene left. You're sorta coming in
           at the worst possible moment.
           10.
                         
                          MAJOR
           I bought that TV set so I could watch
           my programs, not so you and your
           friend could louse up my couch.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           You gotta learn how to share the
           common space.
                         
                          MAJOR
           The only thing common in this house
           is you. You remind me of your damn
           mother. Fat, dumb, and in my way.
                         
          The Major grabs Dwayne and pulls him up off the couch. He
          gets right in his face...scary, intense. Dwayne turns to Jay.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Let's get outta here. This movie
           sucks anyway.
                         
          Jay gets up and files out the door. Dwayne goes to take the
          cold cut plate. The Major grabs his arm.
                         
                          MAJOR
           I paid for the damn cold cuts, too.
           Maybe if you had a job, or a fucking
           prospect, or a clue how to find any
           of the above, I'd let you eat 'em.
                         
                          DWAYNE
                          (QUIETLY)
           You know, you can be a real
           sonofabitch, dad.
                         
                          MAJOR
           That's what it takes, boy. In the
           Corps, men like you wore dresses to
           keep us entertained.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           That's pretty fucking disturbing!
                         
          Dwayne storms off.
                         
          EXT. NICE HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Dwayne and Jay head out, passing a brand new pickup truck in
          the driveway. Dwayne spits on it.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Fuck The Major!
                         
          The guys get in a shitty Ford Aerostar minivan and peel out.
           11.
                         
          INT. DIVE STRIP CLUB - DAY
                         
          R. Kelly's "Ignition (Remix)" pumps.
                         
          Large, fake breasts, sparkling with cheap body glitter and
          pierced at the nipples, shake before us. Their owner, JUICY
          (27), a petite Latina, phones in a lap dance as Dwayne pours
          his heart out to her.
                         
          Somewhere in the background, Jay hangs at the bar, all alone.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           - and he thinks he knows me. He
           don't know shit. I got ideas he
           could never dream of. I got plans
           bigger than his fucking house.
                          (BEAT)
           He didn't even raise me. My mother
           did. That was a good woman.
                         
                          JUICY
           Oh yeah? What happened to her?
                         
          Dwayne shifts, uncomfortably, at the sore subject.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           She passed on.
                         
                          JUICY
           I hope you're not one of those guys
           that comes here looking to get
           mothered.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I wouldn't mind nursing on them
           titties, mamacita.
                         
                          JUICY
           Sure. Whatever you say. Maybe just
           keep quiet for a while, forget about
           your old man and let me do my thing.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I wish I could forget about that
           asshole for good. I'm just waiting
           around for him to drop dead. Don't
           wanna mess with my inheritance.
                         
          This piques Juicy's interest.
                         
                          JUICY
           What kinda inheritance?
           12.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           When my dad got outta the service, he
           started buying lotto tickets. He'd
           play his dog tag numbers. In '91,
           the fucker won five million bucks.
          INSERT PHOTO: The Major holding a giant cardboard check.
                          DWAYNE
           He had some health problems a few
           years back, and since then he's been
           burning through the money like an
           NBA draft pick. Probably only got a
           million or two left. But it's mine
           as soon as he kicks.
          Behind inch-long fake eyelashes, Juicy's shrewd eyes narrow,
          mind working. She straddles Dwayne, tightly.
                          JUICY
           You know, with a million bucks, you
           could have anything. Be like a king.
           (almost a moan)
           King Dwayne.
                          DWAYNE
           That's right. And maybe I'll make
           you my queen. Let you polish my
           royal scepter.
                          JUICY
           Practice makes perfect.
          Juicy pantomimes a long, slow chicken head. Dwayne is blissed
          out. She smiles at him, sticky sweet.
                          JUICY
           Let me ask you a question...do you
           really hate your daddy?
                          DWAYNE
           Hate him like the Steelers.
                          JUICY
           Then maybe I can help you get that
           money now. Before he spends another
           penny.
                         
          Dwayne looks confused. Juicy puts his hands on her breasts,
          emboldening him.
                         
                          JUICY
           I know a guy in Baltimore. He could
           help you out. Probably do it for...
           (sizing him up)
           ...100Gs.
           13.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Do what?
                         
          Juicy leans in, whispers softly in Dwayne's ear -
                         
                          JUICY
           Kill your mean old dad.
                         
          On Dwayne's face as this new possibility pinballs around his
          mind, setting off a flood of different emotions.
                         
                          JUICY
           So, what do you think...you ready
           for your crown?
                         
          INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT - MOVING
                         
          Will has one pizza left in the back of his car. He pulls
          over outside an office building.
                         
          INT. LAW FIRM, OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT
                         
          Rows of cubicles. Speckled with late night STRAGGLERS, bleary
          eyes, too busy generating detailed lists of places they'd
          rather be to notice the pizza boy walking along. Will stops
          before one such work station, looks on for a beat.
                         
                          WILL
           Rio?
                         
          KATE (25) turns from the glow of her computer screen. She
          has short, messy hair and a sarcastic smile. This is the
          girl from the picture in Will's apartment.
                         
                          KATE
           That's the plan. Five days, six
           nights. Culture. Beaches.
           Acceptable probability of kidnapping.
           I leave in the morning.
                         
          Kate looks back at her computer, logged onto an Expedia
          checkout page for a Rio vacation. She moves the mouse pointer
          from the "proceed" key...closes the window.
                         
                          KATE
           This morning I loaded up an African
           Safari and a cruise to Alaska.
                         
                          WILL
           Oh, the places you'll go.
                         
                          KATE
           Fuck Expedia. Travel Advisor. Making
           it seem so easy.
           14.
                         
                          WILL
           It is. Just do it. Get away for a
           while.
                         
                          KATE
           Even if I could afford that...they
           fired two other paralegals last week.
           Now's not the time to be putting in
           for vacation days.
                         
                          WILL
           Ok. Done. I've got my dose of the
           actual working world. Can we eat?
                         
          Will lays a pizza down on her desk.
                         
                          KATE
           How do you keep sneaking up here
           past the security guard?
                         
                          WILL
           He's there like half the time. The
           other half I smile at him. I'm
           relatively certain he's a homosexual.
                         
                          KATE
           Interesting theory...
                         
          Kate opens the pizza box, grabs a slice.
                         
                          KATE
           Maybe I should set him up with Tom
           Small. He came out to me today on
           Facebook.
                         
                          WILL
           That kid beat the hell out of me and
           Chet in grammar school. Wow.
                         
                          KATE
           Tell me about it. He fingered me at
           junior prom while they were playing
           "No Scrubs."
                         
                          WILL
                          (WINCES)
           Really? What a fucking scrub.
                         
          Will grabs a slice. They eat quietly for a beat.
                         
                          KATE
           So, I've got some news...

                          WILL
           I thought the Tom Small stuff was
           enough of a headline, but go ahead.
                         
                          KATE
           I'm getting back together with Mark.
                         
          Will's delicious pizza suddenly tastes like shit. He does
          his best to swallow it down.
                         
                          WILL
           But you...you broke up with
           him...ended the relationship.
           Finality was had.
                         
                          KATE
           Yeah, but we were talking and -
                         
                          WILL
           Forget it. I don't want to know.
                         
                          KATE
           You sound like Chet.
                         
                          WILL
           Woah, don't compare me to your
           brother.
                         
                          KATE
           Well, neither one of you seems to
           care that I don't have a life. Mark's
           not perfect...but a relationship is
           better than working late every Friday
           because I have nowhere else to be.
                         
                          WILL
           Sure. I get it. Here we are. Friday
           night. Nowhere to be.
                         
          Kate shoves Will, good-naturedly.
                         
                          KATE
           You know what I mean.
                         
          Will shrugs, quietly devastated. Goes back to his pizza.
                         
          INT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT
                         
          Most of the PATRONS are fixated on an Orioles game blaring
          from a large flat-screen TV.
                         
          At a booth in back, Dwayne and Jay are in deep conversation.
           16.
                         
                          JAY
           I don't wanna stick my nose into a
           family matter...but killing your old
           man? That's pretty messed up...I
           mean, unless you think it isn't.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           What we have here is a classic "lesser
           of two evils" debate. You got one
           evil: me shaving a few years off The
           Major's shitty life. Then you got
           the other evil: The Major ruining my
           entire awesome life by blowing through
           my inheritance. Maybe I'm biased,
           but mine sure as shit seems like the
           lesser.
                         
                          JAY
           I guess I...sorta see where you're
           coming from. And you have been
           waiting around forever for that money.
           You deserve it, Dwayne.
                         
          Dwayne nods, seriously.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           You know, there's a reason I sleep
           'til noon everyday. And it ain't
           'cause I'm lazy. It's on account of
           me having so many goddamn dreams.
           Big ones. And once that money's
           mine, they're all gonna come true.
                         
          Dwayne takes a long sip of beer, contemplative.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Like I had this one dream last night.
           I was cruising through town in a
           Lamborghini Diablo. The wind was
           blowing through my hair, ruffling my
           open shirt. There was a hot little
           piece of ass sitting next to me. And
           in the back seat, Jay...was you.
           Strapped. Wearing a pair of Oakleys.
                         
                          JAY
           Wow. I didn't know you dreamt about
           me, Dwayne.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           It was only this once, Jay. To be
           honest, I didn't know what to make
           of it. So I consulted my dream book,
           and found out it means this: you're
           my road dog. You got my back.

           That's why I want to make you my
           partner.
                         
                          JAY
           In what?
                         
                          DWAYNE
           In crime. And business. You see, it
           ain't just about the inheritance money.
           It's about what I'm gonna do with it.
                         
          Dwayne leans across the table.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I'm about to clue you in on something.
           And then you'll understand the true
           magnitude of what's at stake here.
           Are you ready?
                         
                          JAY
           Yes. I'm totally ready.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Then answer me this...what's this
           town missing? I'll give you a hint.
           It's a cash business, crawling with
           sexy bitches.
                         
                          JAY
                          (BEAT)
           A Chinese food restaurant?
                         
                          DWAYNE
           No. A tanning salon.
                          (BEAT)
           Think about it. All that green.
           All that brown flesh.
                         
          Jay nods, thinking about. He smiles.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           It's also the perfect front for a
           prostitution ring.
                         
                          JAY
           Yeah, of course. Because of the booths.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Yes. And because of the bitches.
                          (BEAT)
           It can all be ours. 30 percent for
           you, 70 percent for me. You just
           gotta help me out here.
           18.
                         
          Jay looks conflicted. Dwayne goes dark, like a spurned lover.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I'm starting to wonder if my dream
           book was wrong about you. Maybe you
           sitting behind me doesn't mean you're
           my road dog. Maybe it means you're
           plotting to stab me in the back,
           like some snake in the grass.
                         
                          JAY
           That's crazy. I'd never do something
           like that. The dream book was right!
                         
          Jay looks Dwayne in the eyes, knows it's all or nothing...
                         
                          JAY
           Ok. I'll do it. But I'm not shooting
           him or anything. I'll hold him while
           you shoot him. That's it.
                         
          Dwayne chuckles.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Here's a fact: they don't build prisons
           for criminals, they build them for
           idiots. Shit, they got three different
           types of CSI on TV, just laying out
           how the police do their business...and
           still, idiots like you think you can
           just go out and do a murder yourself.

           If you wanna be a millionaire, you

           We gotta pay him on Tuesday.
                         
                          JAY
           What? Why would you do that?
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I was presented with an opportunity.
           I took it. 100 thousand bucks for a
           highly trained assassin is a steal.
                         
                          JAY
           But we don't have that kinda money.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Now we're addressing the real problem:
           how do we get the 100 grand? 'Cause
           once we get that, we get the million.

           I guess we could just...rob a bank.
           One of these local banks with nothing
           but a dipshit security guard.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Again, not quite thinking like a
           millionaire.
                         
                          JAY
           Okay, then let's hire someone to rob
           a bank.
                         
          Dwayne thinks about this for a second.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Fuck hiring them, we could just force
           someone to rob a bank for us. Like
           with blackmail, or death threats, or -
                         
                          JAY
                          (ALMOST INVOLUNTARILY)
           A bomb. Everyone's scared of a bomb.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I was gonna say hypnotism...but I
           like that. It's out of the fucking
           box. We just strap one to some
           motherfucker's chest, like we did to
           those watermelons. Think you can
           you build some kinda bomb vest?
                         
                          JAY
           Yeah, I mean...camel jockeys do it
           in caves. I got a garage workshop.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I'm pretty sure this is exactly how
           a millionaire would do it. And the
           beauty of it is: we don't lose any
           sleep, 'cause no one gets hurt.
                         
                          JAY
           Except The Major.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Yeah. The Major dies. But no one
           gets hurt.
                         
          Dwayne smiles. But a nagging thought interrupts him -
           20.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           There's just one problem. Where do
           we get our guy? 'Cause if we do a
           kidnapping, then we're right back
           where we started...doing shit that's
           gonna get us caught.
                          (MIND WORKING)
           What we need is someone to come to
           us...to a place where we can control
           the situation. Someone without any
           connection to us.
                         
          The guys stare at each other, stumped. Until something
          catches Dwayne's attention...a local commercial playing on
          the flat-screen. A PIZZA CHEF slides a pizza into a box -
                         
                          PIZZA CHEF
                          (ON TV)
           We'll deliver anywhere in 30 minutes
           or less! Or your pizza is free!
           Giorgio's Trattoria, where the
           customer gets what they want...pronto!
                         
          The guys look at each other.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Sometimes fate just takes out its cock
           and slaps you in the face with it.
                         
          INT. CHET'S APARTMENT - DAY
                         
          A hand grabs a beer from the fridge.
                         
           VOICE (O.S.)
           You're not trying to draw a psycho
           pension...you really are crazy!
                         
          Will heads into the living room with the beer. The voice
          belongs to Danny Glover. The guys are watching Lethal Weapon.
          Murtaugh (Danny Glover) has just stopped Riggs (Mel Gibson)
          from killing himself. Riggs looks at him, crazily, before -
                         
                          RIGGS
                          (ON TV)
           I'm hungry. I'm gonna get something
           to eat.
                         
          Chet looks over at Will. He is drunk, and in a dark mood.
                         
                          CHET
           Maybe you should pace yourself.
           It's noon on a Saturday.
                         
                          WILL
           Fridge is full, man. We're all good.
           21.
                         
          Will drains half his beer.
                         
                          WILL
           Let me ask you a question. You
           remember Tom Small?
                         
                          CHET
           Yeah, he used to kick our asses.
                         
                          WILL
           Turns out he was probably jerking
           off to it afterwards. He's gay.
                         
                          CHET
           I hope he chokes on a dick. I never
           liked him.
                         
                          WILL
           Your sister did. She let him finger
           blast her. Big time.
                         
          Chet pauses the movie.
                         
                          CHET
           What the fuck are you talking about?
           I don't want that shit in my head.
                         
                          WILL
           Sorry. Kate told me about it last
           night. I thought you should know.
                         
                          CHET
           You two were swapping stories about
           getting fingered? That's pretty cute.
                         
          Chet chuckles. Will ignores him, sips his beer.
                         
                          WILL
           The point I'm trying to make is this:
           Tom Small was an asshole. He was
           totally wrong for your sister. Just
           like every other guy she's ever dated.
           Right through to that Mark dude she's
           gonna get back together with. Un-be-
           fuck-me-lievable...
                         
                          CHET
           Whatever. Why the fuck are we talking
           about who my sister goes out with?
                         
          At a loss, Will shrugs. Chet turns back to the TV, presses
          play. Lethal Weapon resumes. Something blows up. Chet
          pauses the movie and stares at Will for a beat.
           22.
                         
                          CHET
          You sneaky son of a bitch...you want
          to fuck my sister, don't you?
                         
                          WILL
          Chet, I really don't...
                         
                          CHET
          My twin sister!? Which is basically
          like fucking me!
                         
                          WILL
          Hey, if you guys had that twin ESP
          shit this would be a completely
          different situation. There'd be
          logistical problems.
                         
                          CHET
          We look exactly alike!
                         
                          WILL
          You look like a lot of people. You're
          a normal looking dude.
                         
                          CHET
          This is so fucked up I can't even
          begin to process it. How long has
          this been going on?
                         
                          WILL
          If I had to put my finger on
          it...middle school-ish.
                         
                          CHET
          So all those sleepovers, they were
          just some kind of opportunity for
          you to peek in Kate's bedroom?
                         
                          WILL
          It might have happened a few times.
          Most of them were accidental.
                         
                          CHET
          You're a peeping Tom. You realize
          that, don't you? You're a sexual
          fucking deviant.
                         
                          WILL
          Fuck you. I'm as normal as they
          come. Your sister is attractive.
          She excites me, in a sexual way.
          Fucking sue me. Can't we just be
          adults about it?
           23.
                         
                          CHET
           You? An adult? Sort of stretching
           the term.
                         
                          WILL
           Hey, let's not say shit we can't
           take back.
                         
                          CHET
           Take back? Will, you got kicked out
           of junior college for punching a
           professor that made fun of some poem
           you wrote.
                         
                          WILL
           That poem was about your sister!
                         
                          CHET
           That is, literally, the saddest thing
           I have ever heard. Like retards
           playing freeze tag sad. No wonder
           you deliver pizzas for a living.
                         
                          WILL
           Fuck you! Maybe I was just hanging
           out with you for your sister. You
           were always a whiny little bitch.
           And you stuttered. All the kids
           used to call you "Chutter."
                         
                          CHET
           Whatever. I only started hanging out
           with you because you had a Nintendo.
                         
                          WILL
           Did you see my Nintendo naked?
           Because I saw your sister changing
           into her swimsuit at your thirteenth
           birthday pool party. And it was the
           highlight of the whole shitty event.
                         
          Chet bites his lip.
                         
                          CHET
           Okay. You wanna do this?
                         
                          WILL
           I think we already are.
                         
                          CHET
           Well, you know who I saw naked?
           Jenny Rifkin. While I was nailing
           her. The week after she dumped you.
                          (MORE)
           24.
                         
                          CHET (CONT'D)
           Why do you think every time you wanna
           bet on whose cock's bigger I'm always
           willing to go in? 'Cause I know
           mine's bigger. 'Cause she told me!
                         
                          WILL
           Wow...wow. You pulled a Judas on Jenny
           fucking Rifkin. That is messed up.
           Almost as messed up as how I sold your
           Cal Ripken signed ball for 200 bucks.
                         
                          CHET
           My grandpa left me that ball in his
           will! You helped me look for it for
           a month!
                         
                          WILL
           Now you know why we never found it.
                         
          Will bows.
                         
                          WILL
           We done here?
                         
          Chet's face is red with anger.
                         
                          CHET
           Not quite yet. There's actually a
           mystery I wanna solve for you.
                          (BEAT)
           I was the one who told John Tanner
           about how your mom fucked that
           lifeguard. And I always felt awful
           about it, because even though he
           swore secrecy, he told everyone else
           in town. And then your parents wound
           up getting divorced. But now...I
           don't give a shit.
                         
                          WILL
           What!? You ruined...my fucking life!
                         
          Will takes a swing at Chet. He dodges it and puts Will in
          some sort of choke hold.
                         
                          CHET
           Krav Maga, bitch. I bet your poetry
           professor didn't know this shit.
                         
                          WILL
           Get offa me!
                         
                          CHET
           You threw the first punch!
           25.
                         
                          WILL
           I'm gonna break this hold and then
           kick your skinny ass!
                         
                          CHET
           Try it!
                         
          Will flexes and tries to break the choke hold...no luck. He
          wrenches his back away from Chet and screams -
                         
                          WILL
           What the fuck is that!?
                         
                          CHET
           My knuckle in your spine! No holds
           barred you backstabbing fuck!
                         
                          WILL
           I'm gonna pass out...
                         
                          CHET
           Good!
                         
                          WILL
           (face bright red)
           I love her, Chet...I love Kate...
                         
          Chet lets Will go. He drops to the floor, panting.
                         
                          CHET
           Let me tell you something. And it's
           the truest thing you'll ever hear,
           from the person who knows you best
           in the world...you're not good enough
           for my sister. And you never will
           be. You're the lowest common
           denominator, Will. You're the square
           root of fucking zero.
                         
          Will gets to his feet.
                         
                          WILL
           Fuck you...Chutter!
                          (GRABS DICK)
           Square this!
                         
                          CHET
           Get out of my house. You're a shitty
           friend.
                         
                          WILL
           Right back at you.
                         
          Will storms out.
           26.
                         
          EXT. CHET'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
                         
          Will screeches away in his car.
                         
          INT. STUDIO APARTMENT - NIGHT
                         
          A day or so has passed. Will sits on his couch, an unshaven
          mess, watching Lethal Weapon 2. Murtaugh and Riggs laugh
          and joke around. Best buds.
                         
          Will looks like he might cry. He goes for his beer, knocks
          it over. He stares at the growing puddle of beer...then
          grabs the folder with his college applications and uses them
          to sop it up.
                         
          INT. GIORGIO'S TRATTORIA - NIGHT
                         
          Will sits at a table, looking out through the misty window.
                         
          Christopher boxes a pizza and drops it in front of him.
                         
                          CHRISTOPHER
           Come on, wake up and get to work.
                         
          Christopher hands him the order slip. Will checks the address.
                         
                          WILL
           Where the fuck is this?
                         
                          CHRISTOPHER
           How should I know? It's 30 minutes
           away or the pizza comes out of your
           paycheck. Tick tock.
                         
          EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT
                         
          Will's Mustang travels down a dark, empty stretch of highway.
          The lone working taillight fades as the car disappears into
          the distance.
                         
          EXT. SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY - NIGHT
                         
          The Mustang stops at the mouth of a driveway. Overgrown
          shrubbery blocks anything beyond it from view. All that
          Will can see is a red and white radio tower jutting into the
          sky, beacon light flashing atop it.
                         
          Will checks the address, then drives through the open gate.
                         
          EXT. RADIO TOWER - NIGHT
                         
          The Mustang parks at the end of the driveway. Will gets out.
                         
          There is a large storage shed and, across a clearing, a radio
          tower built on top of a small office structure.
           27.
                         
          The office door is ajar. Florescent light glows from inside.
                         
                          WILL
           Hello?
                         
           DWAYNE (O.S.)
           (calling back from beyond door)
           Hey, bud! Sorry for the hike! The
           county's got us doing repairs at the
           ass end of the night!
                         
          This puts Will at ease. He heads toward the office. As he
          gets close, a figure appears in the doorway. It is Dwayne
                         
          WEARING A SCARY FUCKING GORILLA MASK
                         
                          WILL
           What the -
                         
          Will hears something behind him and whirls around -
                         
          To find Jay, also in a gorilla mask, charging at him.
                         
                          WILL
           Holy fuck!
                         
          Will makes a run for it. But the guys are on top of him in
          no time. He madly fights them off and dashes for his car.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Stop! We got a gun, you asshole!
                         
          Will breaks toward the cover of the shrubbery.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Fuck! Get him!
                         
          Jay is right on Will's tail. Without breaking stride, Jay
          picks up a large branch and wings it at him.
                         
          Will is hit in the legs and stumbles over himself. Jay leaps
          on top of him and locks his skinny legs around Will's body.
                         
                          WILL
           What the hell!?
           (at a loss)
           Rape!
                         
          Jay wrestles something from his pocket. A chloroform soaked
          rag. He presses it hard against Will's mouth and nose.
          Will soon goes limp.
                         
          Dwayne appears, looming above them. He pulls his gorilla
          mask back and smiles.
           28.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Step one.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          Blurry vision coming into focus. Two gorillas.
                         
          EXT. RADIO TOWER - DAY
                         
          Whereas the masks looked scary at night, they look ridiculous
          now. Will is propped up on the hood of his car, staring at
          his captors. His mouth is duct taped, hands bound behind his
          back. He wears his "Giorgio's" cap and a buttoned up olive
          green Army jacket.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           You thought we were gonna rape you.
                          (CHUCKLES)
           Idiot.
                         
          Will mumbles something through the duct tape.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Just shut up. The tape is there for
           a reason. 'Cause this next part is
           gonna take a measure of calm. Are
           you with me? Can you be calm?
                         
          Will nods. Dwayne holds up his driver license.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Will Dixon, of 112 North Whatever-
           The-Fuck Street, right now you are
           wearing an explosive vest.
                         
          Will looks down at the jacket he is wearing, tries to get
          his hands loose so he can tear it open.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Calm the fuck down!
                         
          Will stiffens. For emphasis, Dwayne reveals the gun tucked
          down the front of his pants like a big metal cock.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Now stay still and my associate will
           show you.
                         
          Jay carefully unbuttons the Army jacket. Will is, in fact,
          wearing an explosive vest. It is a cobbled together but
          intimidating looking contraption, crisscrossed by multicolored
          wires. There is a thick lock at the hinge, with a digital
          display and a keypad.
                         
          Will begins to hyperventilate.
           29.
                         
                          JAY
           Take it easy, man. You're fine. I
           built this thing. It's pretty stable.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           For a fucking bomb. So don't trip
           over your shoelaces or anything.
           That thing's full of C-4. And the C
           is for chaos.
                         
                          JAY
           Actually, the C stands for "composite."
           But, yeah, I'd try not to slam into
           stuff.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Can I take that tape off now, pizza boy?
                         
          Will nods. Dwayne rips the duct tape off his mouth.
                         
                          WILL
           Help!
                         
          Dwayne chuckles.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           You know where you are? You might
           as well be in space, motherfucker.
           Nobody can hear you scream.
                         
                          WILL
           Why are you doing this to me? I
           don't have any money.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Not yet. But you're gonna go get us
           some.
                         
                          WILL
           Okay. Sure, man. Whatever you say.
           I'll go sell my car. I'll get you
           like a thousand bucks.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I want 100 thousand.
                         
                          WILL
           Where the fuck am I supposed to get
           that much money?
                         
                          DWAYNE
           The Donner-Wells National Bank on
           Charles Road.
           30.
                         
                          JAY
           Across the street from the Olive
           Garden.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Yeah, the one across the street from
           the Olive Garden.
                         
                          WILL
           Do you guys have an account or
           something?
                         
          Dwayne shakes his head like Will is an idiot.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           No, I don't have an account! You're
           gonna rob it!
                         
                          WILL
           How the fuck am I supposed to rob a
           bank?
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Figure it out. You got a bomb strapped
           to your chest. That's a start. It'll
           scare the fuck outta people. Maybe
           use your brain and go get a gun.
           Borrow one from a friend for all I
           care. It ain't rocket science.
                         
                          WILL
           Then do it yourself.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I would, but I'm already wearing
           this gorilla mask and you're already
           wearing that bomb.
                          (TO JAY)
           Tell him about the vest.
                         
          Jay turns to Will.
                         
                          JAY
           You seem like a pretty trustworthy
           guy. I mean, you got a job and all.
           But just in case you were gonna try
           to take the vest off, we booby trapped
           it to shit. There's also a remote
           detonator on the back, so we can
           trigger it by dialing a number.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           And it's on speed dial. So do what
           you gotta do, but we'll be watching.
                          (MORE)
           31.
                         
                          DWAYNE (CONT'D)
           You go anywhere near a police station,
           and Fourth of July comes early this
           year.
                         
          Dwayne nods at the timer on the side of the vest.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           It's 9:00 AM. You got 8 hours.
                         
          He hands Will a slip of paper.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Once you have the money, call this
           number and you'll be given instructions
           on where to drop it. You do good, we
           give you the six-digit combination
           that stops the timer and opens the
           lock. Tomorrow morning, you can go
           back to delivering pizza, the mail,
           whatever the fuck you want.
                          (BEAT)
           Now let me demonstrate what happens
           if you don't get us the money.
                         
          Dwayne looks over to where an oversized stuffed bear, rigged
          with its own bomb vest, sits on a tree stump 20 yards away.
          Dwayne mimes answering a phone -
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Hey, Teddy Ruxpin...what's that?
           You don't have the money? It was
           too tough to rob the bank, so you
           just went back to your bear cave and
           cried like a bitch? Well, guess
           what my stuffed friend...time is up.
                         
          Jay pushes a button on a detonator. Teddy Ruxpin explodes.
          All that remains is a cloud of stuffing.
                         
          Will is frozen in fear.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I liked that bear. I don't even
           know you.
                         
          Dwayne throws Will his car keys.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Go on. Get outta here.
                         
                          WILL
           Guys, can we please just talk about
           this?
           32.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Yeah, of course we can.
                         
          Dwayne pulls out the gun and fires two shots at Will's feet.
          Jay jumps backward, as does Will, who hits the hood of his
          car, slides across it and onto the ground by the driver side.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Be careful!
                         
          Will awkwardly gets to his feet and arranges himself in the
          car, adjusting to the weight of the bomb. As he starts the
          engine and backs away -
                         
                          DWAYNE
           That's right! Get the fuck out of
           here! You're wasting time!
                         
          Once the car is gone, Jay yanks off his gorilla mask. Dwayne
          stays primate.
                         
                          JAY
           What the hell, Dwayne? You told me
           that was a replica gun.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           It was. Then I paid a Mexican 50
           bucks to put a firing pin in it.
           Now it goes boom.
                         
                          JAY
           We didn't discuss a loaded gun!
           Especially not with the bomb around!
                         
          Dwayne gets right in Jay's face. The plastic eyes of his
          mask betray no emotion.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Don't you ever question me. I'm
           fucking this bitch. You're just
           holding the camera.
                         
                          JAY
                          (VOICE FALTERS)
           Sure, Dwayne...whatever you say.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Good. 'Cause this ain't the Marines.
           This is cash money. You hesitate, you
           fuck up...and I will leave you behind.
                         
          A tense beat. Dwayne pulls his mask off. He looks oddly calm.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Let's go get some breakfast.
           33.
                         
          EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
                         
          Will's car flies down the road. It screeches to a stop,
          tires smoking. Will jumps out, stumbles to the shoulder and
          pukes. He drops to his knees.
                         
                          WILL
           Oh, god! Holy shit! Fuck me!
           Someone please fucking help me!
                         
          Nothing but the wind.
                         
          Will fights back tears. He gets to his feet, wipes his mouth.
          He takes out his cell phone, scrolls through the contacts.
          He pauses on Chet's name...presses send.
                         
          The line goes to voicemail. Will looks at the bomb's timer:
          7 hours, 47 minutes and counting. He hurries to his car.
                         
          INT. CLASSROOM, JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
                         
          A laser dot dances around the middle of a United States map.
                         
          Chet is teaching a history lesson to a bunch of SEVENTH
          GRADERS that look very mature and very bored. As he indicates
          with his laser pointer -
                         
                          CHET
           This whole region here, about 830
           thousand square miles, was part of
           the initial Louisiana Purchase.
                         
                          SEVENTH GRADER
                          (COUGHING)
           Nice laser.
                         
          The class giggles. Chet, embarrassed, puts away the pointer.
                         
          There is a knock at the door. Chet turns to see Will's face
          in the door's window pane. He looks back to his class.
                         
                          CHET
           Take out your workbooks. Chapter 3.
                         
          Chet opens the door.
                         
                          CHET
           What do you want?
                         
                          WILL
           We gotta talk.
                         
                          CHET
           I'm working here. Do not mess with
           me at work.
           34.
                         
                          WILL
           Chet, for the love of god, just talk
           to me in private for one minute.
                         
          Chet sighs.
                         
          INT. HALLWAY, JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
                         
          Chet leads a jumpy Will into
                         
          INT. EMPTY CLASSROOM, JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
                         
          Chet shuts the door behind them. Will paces.
                         
                          CHET
           You wanna apologize, don't you? You
           look like shit. You've probably
           been up for days thinking about what
           an asshole you were. Well, it's
           gonna take a lot more than some
           pathetic groveling -
                         
                          WILL
                          (SUDDENLY)
           Chet! Shut up! I don't wanna
           apologize to you!
                         
                          CHET
           Then what do you want? Because we
           don't have anything left to say to
           each other.
                         
          Will swallows hard.
                         
                          WILL
           Here goes. And this is gonna sound
           crazy. Because it is fucking crazy.
           But last night two guys in masks
           jumped me and strapped a bomb to my
           chest, and now I have less than eight
           hours to rob a bank.
                         
          Chet just stares at Will, unimpressed.
                         
                          CHET
           You're hysterical. Got me. Great
           joke. I'm going back to work now.
                         
          Will steps in Chet's way. He unbuttons his jacket, revealing
          the bomb.
                         
                          CHET
           What the fuck? Is that real?
                         
          Will nods.
           35.
                         
          Chet jumps backward, stumbles over a desk and scurries on
          his ass to the other end of the classroom. He presses himself
          flat against the wall.
                         
                          CHET
           Stay away from me! What the fuck
           are you involved in!? Terrorism!?
                         
                          WILL
           Chet, do you really think I'm a
           terrorist?
                         
                          CHET
           Yes! One of the dumb ones! The
           ones they convince to wear the bombs!
                         
                          WILL
           I am not fucking around here. Two
           guys did this to me. And if I don't
           rob that bank in time this thing is
           gonna blow.
                         
                          CHET
           Seriously?
                         
                          WILL
           Seriously.
                         
                          CHET
           And your first idea was to come to a
           school filled with young children?
                         
                          WILL
           I didn't -
                         
                          CHET
           Just back the fuck away from me with
           that thing.
                         
          Will backs all the way up, so that the guys are on opposite
          ends of the classroom.
                         
                          WILL
           Listen, I think the vest is safe for
           now. These guys don't want me to
           blow myself up on accident before I
           get their money.
                         
                          CHET
           Oh, so you figure the two psychopaths
           that rigged a bomb to your chest
           made sure it was safe? There's no
           margin for error in their fucking
           bomb vest design!?
           36.
                         
                          WILL
           I don't know! All I do know is that
           this is real. This is happening.
           And I'm sure you hate me as much as
           I hate you right now, but I have
           nowhere else to go.
                         
                          CHET
           For what?
                         
                          WILL
           For help, Chet. I need your help.
           Please. I can't do this alone.
                         
          Chet looks Will over. His desperation is palpable. Chet
          bites his lip, weighing the situation...
                         
                          CHET
           Damn it!
           (takes a breath)
           I'd like to tell you to get fucked,
           but you know what the problem is...I'm
           a better man than you. And someday,
           I might actually forgive you. So if
           I let you blow up, or whatever, that
           shit might come back and eat at my
           conscience, and totally affect my
           relationships with other people.
           Like my wife and kids and shit.
                         
                          WILL
           That's a...very rational way to look
           at the situation.
                          (GENUINELY)
           And you're right, about being a better
           guy than me.
                         
          Chet takes a step toward Will.
                         
                          CHET
           Are you sure that thing isn't gonna
           blow at any second?
                         
          Will just looks at Chet...unable to offer any assurance.
          After a beat -
                         
                          CHET
           Could you just walk a few feet in
           front of me for a while?
                         
                          WILL
           I can do that.
                         
          Will opens the door, stops, looks back at Chet.
           37.
                         
                          WILL
           Thank you.
                         
          Will heads out. Chet takes a breath, bracing himself.
                         
          INT. HALLWAY, JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
                         
          Will walks down the empty hallway. He glances back over his
          shoulder, where Chet walks several feet behind him.
                         
                          CHET
           Yes, I'm still here. I really am
           this stupid. Just pay attention to
           where you're going.
                         
                          WILL
           I think I can handle it.
                         
                          CHET
           These floors get waxed once a week.
           On Tuesday, which today is. You hit
           a slick patch, trip and fall, and I
           got a classroom full of kids wearing
           their skin inside out.
                         
                          WILL
           Chet, I'm fucking nervous enough as
           it is. Please. I don't need you
           back seat driving me right now.
                         
                          CHET
           Obviously.
                         
          Will stops, turns back toward Chet.
                         
                          WILL
           Just for the record, this isn't a
           nuclear weapon strapped to my chest.
           And there are metal lockers on either
           side of the hallway. If I fall, and
           if this thing goes off, I'm probably
           not taking out the whole school.
                         
                          CHET
           Do you really want to debate this?
                         
          Will sighs, turns back around. A second later, the school
          bell rings and kids flood the hallway, changing classes.
                         
          Will freezes. Multiple kids shove past him. Chet sweats
          bullets, gives Will a look of death.
                         
          After a beat, the hallway empties again.
           38.
                         
                          CHET
           You're an asshole.
                         
                          WILL
           Whatever. It's over.
                         
          Will continues walking. He tries to lighten the mood -
                         
                          WILL
           Who was the chick in the white jeans?
                         
                          CHET
           Kristi Evans. Why?
                         
                          WILL
           You know why.
                         
                          CHET
           Oh, come on. Just keep walking.
                         
          The guys' voices fade as they continue down the hallway...
                         
                          WILL
           Come on yourself. You knew exactly
           who I was talking about.
                         
                          CHET
           Fuck you. She's in the eighth grade.
                         
                          WILL
           I bet you love it when she calls you
           Mr. Chet.
                         
                          CHET
           She doesn't call me "Mr. Chet."
           She's not a foreigner.
                         
          EXT. JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
                         
          The guys get to Will's car. Chet wraps up a call on his cell -
                         
                          CHET
           ...thanks so much, Mrs. Davis. I'll
           call you after I talk to the doctor.
                         
          Chet hangs up. He is standing by the passenger door. He
          looks over the roof of the car at Will.
                         
                          CHET
           So, this is it?
                         
                          WILL
           This is what?
           39.
                         
                          CHET
           Once I step inside this car, I'm
           basically in a steel coffin with you
           and...that thing. And if it goes
           off, all they're gonna find in there
           are two charred bodies and pieces of
           a bomb. They'll assume we were driving
           to a government building to blow it
           up. It'll be all over the news.
           Next thing you now, some militia or
           Islam group is claiming us as members.
           My family will be humiliated.
                         
                          WILL
           We'll also be dead, in that particular
           situation, so it won't really matter.
                         
                          CHET
           Exactly!
                         
          Will sighs.
                         
                          WILL
           I get it. Take your time, man.
                         
          Will gets in the car and shuts the door. He looks out at
          Chet, who stands uncertainly by the passenger side.
                         
                          CHET
           This is the world's biggest favor,
           you motherfucker. You didn't even
           help me move last winter.
                         
          Chet reluctantly hops in.
                         
          INT. MUSTANG - DAY
                         
          Will fires up the engine.
                         
                          CHET
           Given the situation, I think you
           should obey all traffic safety laws.
                         
                          WILL
           Fine.
                         
          Will pulls out of the school parking lot.
                         
                          WILL
           Okay, so where are we going?
                         
                          CHET
           I have no idea. I just got in your
           car. I thought you had a plan.
           40.
                         
                          WILL
           Well, I don't! I've been sorta
           preoccupied with this crushing fear
           of death!
                         
                          CHET
           No plan. I can't say I'm surprised.
                         
                          WILL
           Your plan is probably better. Just
           condescend me until I explode.
                         
          Will goes to turn on the radio. Chet grabs his hand.
                         
                          CHET
           Maybe we should turn on the radio.
           See if the signal sets the bomb off.
           That would be an interesting experiment.
                         
          Will heaves a frustrated sigh. Chet eases up.
                         
                          CHET
           Listen, let's just go back to my
           place. Figure out our options.
           Maybe you can get the vest off or
           something. I just don't want to do
           anything stupid.
                         
                          WILL
           Unless we have to.
                         
          The car hits a rough pothole. Chet's heart skips a beat -
                         
                          CHET
           Holy fucking shit!
                         
          - and he throws himself against the passenger side window,
          as far from Will as the confines of the car will allow.
                         
          Will slams the brakes.
                         
                          WILL
           Stop it! You're scaring the fuck
           out of me!
                         
                          CHET
           Okay. Okay. Fuck!
                         
          Chet makes the sign of the cross.
                         
                          CHET
           I'm cool now.
                         
          Will continues driving. Chet discreetly unlocks the passenger
          side door.
           41.
                         
                          WILL
           Why did you do that?
                         
                          CHET
           Do what?
                         
                          WILL
           I saw you.
                         
                          CHET
           It's in case I have to jump out.
                         
                          WILL
           If I survive the day, and you don't
           because you jumped out of a moving
           car and broke your neck, I'm gonna
           laugh my ass off.
                         
                          CHET
           And if abandoning ship saves my life,
           then that laugh will be mine.
                         
          The guys continue driving in silence.
                         
          SUPER COUNTDOWN: 6 hours, 59 minutes...
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          INT. BATHROOM, CHET'S APARTMENT - DAY
                         
          The door is shut. Will sits on the toilet lid. He has the
          jacket off and we get our first complete look at the vest.
          The actual structure is composed of hollow metal tubes. The
          wiring that runs throughout the vest is messy and complicated,
          purposely so, to scare anyone out of fucking with it.
                         
          Will is in the process of trying to contort his arm so he
          can slide the vest off...no luck.
                         
                          WILL
           It's too tight!
                         
          He is calling off toward the
                         
                         KITCHEN
                         
          Where Chet is crouched in a corner, at the furthest point in
          the furthest room from the bathroom. He uses his laptop to
          look for websites on disarming a bomb.
                         
                          CHET
           What if we try to separate your
           shoulder?
           42.
                         
           WILL (O.S.)
           Fuck you!
                         
                          CHET
           Well, all these sites say different
           shit. There's not a lot of consensus
           in the bomb disarming community.
                         
          Will emerges from the bathroom, sliding the jacket back on.
                         
                          WILL
           This is pointless.
                         
          Chet shuts his laptop.
                         
                          CHET
           I agree. We gotta call the cops,
           have them fly in the bomb squad or
           something.
                         
                          WILL
           We can't. These guys said they'd be
           following me. And I don't have a
           clue what they look like. For all I
           know, they're outside right now.
           They see the cops show up, they blow
           the vest and cut their losses.
                         
          Will stares at Chet, hopelessly overwhelmed.
                         
                          WILL
           What do I do, man? What do I do now?
                         
                          CHET
           I don't know, Will...I guess you
           gotta rob the bank.
                         
                          WILL
           I haven't been inside a bank in three
           years! How the fuck am I supposed
           to rob one!? They wouldn't even
           give me a savings account!
                         
          Will drops onto the couch and puts his head in his hands,
          fighting hysterics. Chet offers a stock reassurance -
                         
                          CHET
           It's gonna be okay.
                         
                          WILL
           No, it's not! I'm gonna blow up!
           That's way worse than getting stabbed
           or shot. At least some people survive
           that. No one survives being blown
           up.
                          (MORE)
           43.
                         
                          WILL (CONT'D)
           No one is ever like, "Yeah, I heard
           Steve got blown up, tough break, but
           how's he doing now? Is he still in
           the Rec basketball league?" No of
           course he isn't, 'cause there's nothing
           left of Steve except a stain on the
           wall and a pair of fucking high tops!
                         
          Chet looks on as his friend begins to sob. It's a crushing
          sight. Chet strides across the apartment -
                         
                          CHET
           Pull yourself together!
                         
          - and attempts to give him one of those "get a grip" slaps.
          But Will flinches and Chet slaps him right on the ear.
                         
                          WILL
           Ow! Fuck! I think you popped my
           eardrum.
                         
                          CHET
           Sorry. Shit. I didn't mean to do
           that. But just listen to me now.
           You're not gonna die. You wanna
           know why? Because you know exactly
           how to rob a bank.
                         
                          WILL
           What are you talking about?
                         
                          CHET
           Point Break.
                         
                          WILL
           The movie?
                         
                          CHET
           Yes. That movie is like a how-to
           guide for bank robberies. You just
           bust in. Masks. Guns. Move fast.
           Stick to the tellers and don't bother
           with the vault.
                         
                          WILL
           Yeah...I guess it's pretty simple,
           right? And it's just a local bank.
           The Donner-Wells on Charles Road.
                         
                          CHET
           Really? I applied for a job there
           like a year ago.
           44.
                         
                          WILL
           You wanted to be a teller?
                         
                          CHET
           Yeah, so what? It's a good job.
           You get benefits.
                         
                          WILL
           Like what, a name tag?
                         
                          CHET
           What kind of benefits do you get?
           Free toppings?
                         
                          WILL
           That's really clever. No one ever
           said that shit to me before. Anyway,
           this is perfect. You know the whole
           layout of the bank.
                         
                          CHET
           Not exactly. They didn't hand me
           the security schematics with the
           application. But I sat in the waiting
           area for like 20 minutes. I know
           what the place looks like.
                         
                          WILL
           How many guards?
                         
                          CHET
           One. I think.
                         
                          WILL
           That's a start.
                         
                          CHET
           It's a great start. You can do it.
                         
          Will pauses.
                         
                          WILL
           You're gonna do it with me, right?
                         
                          CHET
           I was actually gonna stick to giving
           tips, ideas...motivational speeches.
           More of a consultant or advisory role.
                         
                          WILL
           Jesus Christ, Chet. Please. I'm
           begging you here. I need you on
           this. If I do it alone, I'm dead.
           45.
                         
                          CHET
           Are you gonna cry again?
                         
                          WILL
           That was a moment of weakness.
                          (BEAT)
           Yes. I'll fucking cry again if that's
           what it takes.
                         
                          CHET
           I should make you blow me.
                         
                          WILL
           Sure. Whip that shit out. I'm
           actually kinda curious. I wanna see
           if Jenny Rifkin lied to you. She
           obviously lied to me.
                         
          Chet cracks a smile.
                         
                          WILL
           All these guys want is 100 grand.
           We can do this.
                         
                          CHET
           We're gonna rob a bank for 100 grand?
           Just leave the rest of the money
           sitting there? Why?
                         
                          WILL
           I don't know. I guess they're very
           modest criminals. Who the fuck cares?
           Wait...you said "we" right?
                         
          Chet heaves a sigh.
                         
                          CHET
           I'm putting my life on the line for
           100 grand...what does 100 grand even
           buy these days?

          Where Juicy waits by the service entrance, smoking a
          cigarette. She spots the car and runs over. It parks and
          the door opens. A glassy-eyed African-American man (30s)
          steps out. His muscled body is covered in calligraphic prison
          ink. This is VAUGHN.
           46.
                         
          Juicy throws her arms around him.
                         
                          JUICY
           I missed you so much, baby.

           You don't got enough dicks to keep

                          JUICY
           You know it's not like that. Those
           guys get Juicy, but you get Marisol.
                         
                          VAUGHN
           Well, Marisol...what I want is to
           get my money, kill that old ass man,
           then get the fuck out of here.
                         
                          JUICY
           Then that's how it's gonna go. We're
           just waiting on a call.
                         
          Vaughn stares at her.
                         
                          VAUGHN
           This is my impatient face.
                         
                          JUICY
           Well, I think I can keep you
           entertained.
                         
          Juicy gets in the open driver side door and makes a show of
          crawling over into the passenger seat.
                         
          INT. WALMART - DAY
                         
          Fluorescent lights and pop music. Will and Chet roam the
          aisles with a full shopping basket. They turn into the
          "Sports & Fitness" section, where they find a variety of air
          pistols. They are incredibly realistic, though clear and
          with orange nozzles.
                         
                          WILL
           Should we go with the handguns...or

           That's such a Murtaugh choice.

          air pistols, spray paint, ski masks, leather gloves, several
          5-Hour Energy drinks.
                         
          The tough REGISTER WOMAN looks at the guys with abject disgust.

                          REGISTER WOMAN
           Because this is usually what men buy
           before they rape someone, and I want
           to make sure you all use protection.

          Will looks in his empty wallet, takes out a credit card.
          Chet grabs his hand.

           We'll pay cash.
                         
          INT. MINIVAN - DAY
                         
          The van is parked. Dwayne sits behind the wheel. Metallica's
          "Ride the Lightning" begins to play loudly.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           You really fucked up this mix tape.
                         
          Dwayne ejects the tape, tosses it at Jay in the passenger seat.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           We're not speed freaks knocking off
           a 7-Eleven. We're masterminding a
           heist here.
                         
                          JAY
           Sorry, Dwayne. That song just means
           a lot to me.
                         
          Dwayne shakes his head. He turns and looks out the windshield:
          they're parked in the Walmart lot, watching the store entrance.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I wish he would hurry his shit up.

                          JAY
           You worried about that other guy
           he's with?
                         
                          DWAYNE
           No, man. He picked him up at a
           school. So long as there ain't any
           cops, he can take the whole town
           with him. I just want my money.
                         
          Dwayne surveys the area. Something catches his attention:
          the bland strip mall across the street. There's a Blockbuster,
          Subway, and an empty space in between. Dwayne smiles.
                         
                          JAY
           What? You want me to run over to
           Subway, get us a couple sandwiches?
                         
                          DWAYNE
           If you had any vision, Jay, you'd
           know exactly what I'm thinking about
           right now. And it's not a sandwich.
                          (BEAT)
           Look how well trafficked that shopping
           mall is. It's the perfect place for
           the tanning salon.
                         
          Jay checks it out, nods.
                         
                          JAY
           Oh, you're totally right.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I've been thinking about it, and I
           want you to start off working the
           counter. Sounds like a demotion, I
           know, but it's an important position.
           Because we're gonna be using code
           words and shit. For example, if a
           customer walks in and says he wants a
           tan, that just means he wants a tan.
           But if he says he wants a "deluxe
           tan," that means a blow job and you
           gotta get one of the girls in there
           to suck him off. You with me?
                         
                          JAY
           So far. But what if he wants a fuck?
                         
                          DWAYNE
           There's gonna be codes for everything:
           missionary, anal, black chicks. I
           got it all written down back home in
           my files.

           I'm not gonna bother getting into it
           with you right now, because you're
           supposed to be on lookout and you're
           no good at multitasking.
                         
                          JAY
           Okay. 'Cause they're about to get
           away.
                         
          Dwayne spots the Mustang pulling away.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Fuck.

          Will navigates the streets. Chet is in the back seat, where
          he has newspaper spread out and is spray painting the air
          pistols, and much of the car, black.
                         
                          WILL
           Be careful, you're getting paint
           everywhere.
                         
                          CHET
           Are you really worried about your
           upholstery right now?
                         
                          WILL
           Yes, because if I survive this shit
           I'm quitting my job. That means
           I'll probably have to give up my
           place and I'll be sleeping in the
           back of my car, which you're covering
           in toxic paint.
                         
          Chet touches up one of the guns, goes to flip it over.
                         
                          WILL
           That side isn't dry yet. You're
           about to ruin it.
                         
                          CHET
           It says it's fast drying.
                         
                          WILL
           Fast isn't the same as instant. You
           gotta let it sit for like 20 minutes.
                         
                          CHET
           How would you know? You do a lot of
           graffiti?

                          WILL
           No, but I spray painted my bike last
           year after I got my license suspended.
           I didn't let it dry properly and I
           fucked it up.
                         
                          CHET
           We don't have time to sit around and
           literally watch paint dry. Aren't
           we going straight to the bank?
                         
                          WILL
           I was actually thinking we need to
           stop and steal a car first.
                         
          Chet drops the spray paint, whirls on Will.

           What? No way! We've got a car.
                         
                          WILL
           Yeah, my car. I'm not gonna use it
           as a getaway vehicle. They can trace
           the plates. Even if we do get away,
           we'll be arrested.
                         
                          CHET
           Well, I can't hotwire a fucking
           automobile, and neither can you.
                         
                          WILL
           That's why I was thinking we'd steal
           one from your parents' friends. The
           Fishers. Remember how they used to
           pay us to clean their garage? They
           leave the keys in there. And they
           have a Datsun. That's a fast car.
                         
                          CHET
           I'm not stealing the Fishers' Datsun.
           Let's steal a car from your parents'
           friends.
                         
          Will seethes. He whips the car over to the side of the road
          and gets in Chet's face.
                         
                          WILL
           What friends? My parents don't have
           any. My dad moved away after your
           big mouth ruined his marriage and
           humiliated him, and no one wanted to
           hang out with the mom who everyone
           knew fucked a lifeguard.
           51.
                         
                          CHET
           You never should have told me! I
           was 13 years old. I couldn't process
           that kind of information. I had to
           tell someone else.
           (shakes his head)
           Fuck. I really am sorry about it.
           Okay? Despite what I said before.
           I was just a kid, but I messed up.
                         
                          WILL
           Okay.
                         
          Chet looks at Will, expectantly.
                         
                          CHET
           That's it? You're not gonna apologize
           for selling my Cal Ripken ball?
                         
                          WILL
           Sure. I'm sorry...I'm sorry that my
           family was going through a rough patch
           and I was smoking a ton of weed and
           listening to the Wu Tang Clan all the
           time. And that I needed some extra
           dough to indulge my habit. Which, in
           hindsight, was probably just a cry
           for help. But you never even noticed.
                         
                          CHET
           Thanks. Now I feel even worse.
                         
          Will sits there, stewing for a moment. Then he softens -
                         
                          WILL
           I shouldn't have stolen the ball. I
           knew it was wrong and I regretted it
           like the next day. I actually tried
           to buy it back but the guy wanted
           twice as much. I had to smoke even
           more weed just to get past the whole
           shitty incident. I guess that's why
           they call it a downward spiral.
                         
                          CHET
           I appreciate that you tried to buy
           it back. So, thanks.
                         
          An awkward moment passes.
                         
                          CHET
           We should probably get going.
                         
          Will turns back around, goes to pull out without looking and -
           52.
                         
          A horn blares as a speeding delivery truck barrels right at
          them. Will slams the brakes, barely avoiding a collision.
                         
                          CHET
           Fuck! Fuck! I just want this goddamn
           day to be over!
                         
          As Chet continues to freak -
                         
          SUPER COUNTDOWN: 5 hours, 15 minutes...
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          EXT. THE FISHERS' GARAGE - DAY
                         
          Will keeps watch of the house. Chet squeezes through a garage
          window he has pried open.
                         
          INT. THE FISHERS' GARAGE - DAY
                         
          Chet drops ungracefully to the floor, right beside a well
          maintained 1977 Datsun 240Z.
                         
          Chet hurries over and unlocks the side door. Will enters,
          hauling the Walmart bag of supplies. He goes right for a
          set of hooks on the wall.
                         
                          WILL
           The keys aren't here. They always
           used to leave the keys out.
                         
                          CHET
           Yeah. When we were teenagers. This
           is fucked.
                         
                          WILL
           Let's just find them.
                         
          The guys ransack the garage. Chet knocks over a shelf full
          of clutter.
                         
                          CHET
           Sorry.
                         
          Will goes to the car and tries the handle. It's open. He
          scours the interior.
                         
                          CHET
           You hear that?
                         
                          WILL
           What?
                         
          Chet peeks through the glass pane in the door.
           53.
                         
                          CHET
           Mr. Fisher is coming!
                         
          As he looks for an escape -
                         
                          CHET
           Oh shit, oh shit. Are the keys in there?
                         
                          WILL
           No!
                         
          Will hops out of the car. He rifles through the Walmart bag.
                         
                          CHET
           What are you doing?
                         
          Will pulls the ski masks out of the bag, along with one of
          the freshly painted air pistols.
                         
                          WILL
           I'm doing what I have to.
                         
          Will puts a ski mask on, then throws one to Chet. The door
          opens and MR. FISHER (60s) enters. Chet quickly pulls down
          his mask. It's backwards.
                         
          Will levels the pistol -
                         
           MR. FISHER
           Oh, Jesus!
                         
          Mr. Fisher braces himself against a wall. Chet fumbles to
          turn his mask around. Will affects a deep voice -
                         
                          WILL
           Where are the car keys?
                         
           MR. FISHER
           They're in my pocket! I'm just
           reaching in my pocket for the keys!
                         
                          WILL
           Quiet down and do it already.
                         
          Mr. Fisher reaches into his pocket and produces the keys.
          They jingle as he holds them out in his trembling hand.
          Will snatches them.
                         
                          WILL
           Now listen, I don't want you to report
           this car stolen or anything until
           later tonight. Let's say 5 o'clock.
           6 to be safe.
           54.
                         
           MR. FISHER
           Sure. Anything you say.
                         
          Will seems unconvinced. He looks to Chet, who shrugs. Will
          turns back to Mr. Fisher and gestures violently with the gun -
                         
                          WILL
           If you fuck with us, I swear, I
           will...I will shoot your son. Taylor.
           I know where he works. At the fucking
           travel agency. He's the douchebag
           with the bangs.
                         
           MR. FISHER
                          (STUNNED)
           Please no. I won't do anything. I
           won't. Just leave Taylor alone.
                         
                          WILL
           I'm gonna trust you. But if you
           call the police, there's gonna be an
           undertaker styling his stupid fucking
           bangs!
                          (BEAT)
           Now open the garage door.
                         
          Mr. Fisher hits a switch that raises the garage door. Chet
          grabs their stuff and gets in the passenger side. Will backs
          toward the driver side.
                         
                          WILL
           The car's insured, right?
                         
          Mr. Fisher nods.
                         
                          WILL
           Okay. I feel better. Worse comes
           to worst, something happens to it,
           you can get a Honda. This thing
           doesn't even have airbags.
                         
           MR. FISHER
           Please, just go.
                         
          Will slides into the car and starts it up.
                         
          EXT. THE FISHERS' GARAGE - DAY
                         
          The car peels away.
                         
          INT. DATSUN - DAY - MOVING
                         
          The guys yank off their ski masks.
           55.
                         
                          CHET
           That old man's got a heart condition!
           You could have killed him!
                         
                          WILL
           My hand was forced!
                         
          Chet tries to get comfortable in the seat.
                         
                          CHET
           Awesome. I'm stuck inside an even
           smaller car with you and a bomb.
                         
          Will works the manual transmission. He steps on the gas.
                         
                          WILL
           This thing's got some pickup.
                         
                          CHET
           Could you just take it easy, we're
           doing fine on time.
                         
                          WILL
           I know...but there's one last stop
           we have to make.
                         
                          CHET
           Do you have to take a piss first?
           Because I do.
                         
          Will nervously drums his fingers on the steering wheel, trying
          to figure out how to say -
                         
                          WILL
           I need to see your sister.
                         
                          CHET
           Are you for real? Did you really
           just ask me that? You salt-in-an-
           open-wound motherfucker!
                         
                          WILL
           Chet, as if it isn't apparent, I may
           die today. I'll probably die today.
           And if there's one small thing that's
           clear to me now, it's that I've wasted
           two and a half decades as a pussy,
           watching everything I want pass me
           by. I don't wanna peace out of this
           world as a pussy. I need to tell
           her how I feel.
                         
                          CHET
           You're really gonna turn this into
           some sort of dying wish bullshit?
           56.
                         
                          WILL
           Yes, I really am. It means that much
           to me. I am not fucking around here.
                         
                          CHET
           I don't think you are. I mean,
           apparently, you love my sister so
           much that you're willing to put her
           life in danger by going to see her
           with a bomb strapped to your chest.
                         
                          WILL
           She won't be in danger. I promise.
           I got it all worked out. And you
           can even take a piss while I'm inside.
                         
          EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
                         
          The Datsun pulls around and parks in back.
                         
          PULL BACK TO REVEAL the minivan parking across the street.
                         
          INT. MINIVAN - DAY
                         
          Dwayne and Jay watch Will hurry out of the Datsun.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Where the fuck is he going? What's in
           there? Some sort of FBI headquarters?
           I told that guy not to fuck around!
                         
          Dwayne pulls out his cell phone, punches in the speed dial
          code. His finger hovers above the send button.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Maybe I should give that bomb a call.
                         
                          JAY
           No! Let me just go see what he's up to.
                         
          Dwayne smirks.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I was just fucking around. Are you
           gay for this guy or something?
                         
                          JAY
           I just wanna get the money, Dwayne.
           Same as you.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           All right. Then man up and go check
           it out.
                         
          As Jay reaches for the door handle -
           57.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Don't even tell me you're about to
           do a reconnaissance without a cover.
           What's you cover?
                         
                          JAY
           I don't know...I'm from the telephone
           company?
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Yeah, nice fucking uniform.
                         
          Dwayne rummages in the back of the car, produces a shopping
          bag and starts filling it with random clothes strewn across
          the car. He shoves the bag at Jay.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           You're a personal shopper. You're
           delivering the latest fashions to Mr.
           Quilby in marketing. Got it?
                         
          Jay nods, hops out with the bag and slams the door.
                         
          Dwayne looks down at the cell phone in his hand, twirls it
          as he hums a revival song...sings the lyrics, softly -
                         
                          DWAYNE
           "He's got the whole world in his
           hands. He's got whole fucking world
           in his hands..."
                         
          INT. STAIRWELL, OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
                         
          Will runs up the stairs, a phone pressed to his ear -
                         
                          WILL
           ...no, I'm here right now.
                         
           KATE (O.S.)
                          (OVER PHONE)
           Why are you acting so strange?
                         
                          WILL
           Because strange shit is going on.
           I'll explain everything. Just meet
           me where I texted you.
                         
           KATE (O.S.)
                          WILL -
                         
                          WILL
           Please. Just do it.

          EXT. ROOF, OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
                         
          You can see the entire shitty town from up here. The access
          door opens and Kate emerges, wind tousling her short hair.
                         
                          KATE
                          (CALLING OUT)
           Will?
                         
          Will waves at her from where he is standing, way across on
          the other side of the roof. Kate starts toward him.
                         
                          WILL
           Stop!
                         
          Will takes out his cell phone and dials. Kate's phone rings.
          She answers it, confused.
                         
                          KATE
           What are you doing?
                         
          We STAY on Will. We can see Kate, standing 30 feet away,
          but her voice comes over Will's cell phone, with a delay
          that is slightly jarring.
                         
                          WILL
           Just don't come any closer.
                         
                          KATE
           Why not? What's going on?
                         
                          WILL
           I'm gonna give you the short version
           of an incredibly complicated and fucked
           up situation, so please be cool.
                          (BEAT)
           Some very bad guys strapped a bomb
           to my chest and they are forcing me
           to commit a crime.
                         
                          KATE
           Will, I swear, if this is -
                         
                          WILL
           I wish I was joking, but I'm not. I
           know it's a lot to swallow, but you
           gotta take it on face value, because
           there's a timer attached to this
           thing and it's counting down.
                         
          Kate's voice falters -
                         
                          KATE
           Oh my god, Will...we'll get help.
           I'll get you help.
           59.
                         
                          WILL
           I didn't come here for help. I'm
           taking care of it. I came here
           because, should things not work out
           today as I would like them to, I
           want you to know why I was doing the
           things I did.
                         
                          KATE
           Please, just let me call someone.
           Let me do something. This is crazy!
                         
                          WILL
           I don't disagree with you. It's
           fucking nuts. But that's not even
           what this is about.
                          (STRUGGLING)
           Do you remember when you found that
           picture in my car of you, me and
           Chet, with Chet cut out of it?
                         
                          KATE
           Will, I can't remember about some
           stupid picture while you're -
                         
                          WILL
           I need you to remember about the
           picture, and about how I stop by
           your office every Friday, and how
           I've always hated all your boyfriends,
           and how the two girls I've ever
           seriously dated have looked like
           less attractive versions of you.
                          (BEAT)
           Do you see where I'm going with this?
           I love you Kate. I have for a very
           long time.
                         
          Kate is barely holding it together.
                         
                          KATE
           Will, this is a lot you're putting
           on me! You just told me people are
           trying to kill you or something, and
           now you say you love me. What the
           fuck is going on?
                         
                          WILL
           A whole lot of shit. I'm sorry to do
           this to you, but I was afraid I'd never
           get the chance to tell you. And I
           know you have feelings for me, too.
           Maybe you feel for me the way you feel
           for a good friend, or - if the world
           fucking hates me - a brother.

                          WILL (CONT'D)
           But what I hope is that you don't really
           know how you feel for me, and that
           maybe when you figure it out you'll
           realize it's the same way I feel for
           you. Does that make any sense?
                         
                          KATE
           Yes. I mean, I've known you forever.
           It's not an easy thing to figure out.
                         
                          WILL
           I don't need an answer now. Just
           think about it. And no matter what
           you decide, you're too good for
           assholes like Mark and the rest of
           them.
                         
          Kate manages a small, stifled laugh.
                         
                          KATE
           Okay. I will process all of this.
           It's just, the bomb -
                         
                          WILL
           It's distracting. I know. Anyway,
           I'd love to stay and talk some more,
           but I can't. I gotta ask you to leave
           now, because I'm running out of time.
                         
          Kate nods. Will hangs up the phone. She turns back toward
          the access door, stops. She yells across the roof at Will -
                         
                          KATE
           If I had time to think about it...I'd
           probably tell you that I've always
           felt very strongly for you. And I've
           never thought of you as a brother.
                         
          Will smiles, yells back -
                         
                          WILL
           That's a huge relief. Don't say
           anything else. I just really don't
           want to die now.
                         
                          KATE
           Try not to. Please.
                         
          Kate turns and continues to the access door.

          INT. STAIRWELL, OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
                         
          Jay paces about the landing that leads up to the roof. He
          hears the door opening and hurries down to the entrance for
          the nearest floor. He tries the door, but it's locked.
                         
          Kate enters the stairwell from the roof access door and spots
          Jay trying to force the door open. She is holding back tears.
          He just looks incredibly confused.
                         
                          JAY
           I'm, uh...I'm a personal shopper.
           I'm looking for Mr. Quilby.
                         
                          KATE
           I'm sorry, I don't know who that is.
                         
          Kate continues down the stairs, tears coming now. Jay waits
          a beat, then hurries down and tries the door on the next
          level, which is open.
                         
          INT. MINIVAN - DAY

                          DWAYNE

                          JAY
           It was just his girlfriend or something.

          Will, galvanized by the exchange, hops inside.
                         
                          CHET
           Did you tell her how you saw her naked
           when she was 13? That always works.
                         
                          WILL
           I said my piece. She's gonna think
           about it.
                         
                          CHET
           Shut up. She was freaked out.
                         
                          WILL
           Yes. By the bomb.

                          WILL
           Would it be so bad if we ended up
           together? You and I would be family.
                         
                          CHET
           I don't want you in the family. You
           bring very little to the table. I
           want her to be with someone awesome.
           A pro quarterback. A war hero. At
           the very least, someone I've never
           watched porn with.
                         
                          WILL
           Well, now it's up to her.
                         
                          CHET
           Not if I set that bomb off myself.
                         
                          WILL
           Then you'd probably never get to rob
           a bank.
                         
          Will throws the car into gear and pulls away.

          The Datsun is parked in the half-full lot. The guys lean
          against the driver side, with their backs to the bank and
          the car providing cover. They each have a spray painted air
          pistol tucked into their pants.
                         
                          WILL
           You go for the money. I'll cover
           the crowd. In and out.
                         
          Chet clasps his hands around his stomach.
                         
                          CHET
           I'm not feeling so good. I drank
           like three of those 5-Hour Energy
           drinks.
                         
                          WILL
           It's just nerves. Let's pull our
           shit together and do this thing.
                         
          Chet reigns it in. The guys slide on the leather gloves and
          rolled up ski masks. They turn and stride toward the bank.
                         
          The guys stop as they get to the door. They pull the ski
          masks down and take out their air pistols.
           63.
                         
                          CHET
           What should I call you in there,
           like if I need to ask you to do
           something?
                         
                          WILL
           Call me Tivon. You'll be Darius.
                         
                          CHET
           I can tell you're not a black guy
           through the ski mask.
                         
                          WILL
           Fine. Then you'll be Luis and I'm
           Cruz. We're two loco motherfuckers
           and that's the way we gotta roll
           when we get in there.
                         
          INT. DONNER-WELLS NATIONAL BANK - DAY
                         
          It's business as usual for a dozen CUSTOMERS and about as
          many EMPLOYEES. They all just want to get done with their
          shit and go home, when -
                         
          Will and Chet burst through the bank doors, guns in hand.
                         
                          WILL
           Everybody put your hands in the air!
                         
                          CHET
           No, get on the ground!
                         
                          WILL
           Actually, listen to him and get on
           the fucking ground!
                         
          Will and Chet are on an adrenaline high, waving their guns
          everywhere. People scream.
                         
                          WILL
           Shut up! Please!
                         
          Will frantically scans the panicked crowd for -
                         
          The SECURITY GUARD (40s), rail thin and jumpy. Will points
          his gun right at him.
                         
                          WILL
           You, just stand right there and don't
           do shit! The rest of you get the
           fuck down! Spread your arms and legs!
           Why is no one listening to me!?
                         
                          SECURITY GUARD
           Just take it easy, man!
           64.
                         
                          WILL
           Don't be a hero, cowboy!
                         
                          SECURITY GUARD
           What the fuck does that mean? I'm
           not a hero! Or a cowboy!
                         
          As people drop to the ground, whispering nervously to one
                         ANOTHER -
                         
          Chet rushes the TELLERS standing behind the bulletproof glass
          partition.
                         
                          CHET
           All of you, back away from the counter
           and get out here! Anyone pushes a
           button and one of these people gets
           totally shot!
                         
          The Tellers hurry into the main area of the bank and get
          onto their stomachs.
                         
          Will looks to the Guard.
                         
                          WILL
           Very slowly, take out your gun and
           toss it away.
                         
          The Guard takes out his gun, lays it on the ground and shoves
          it away. The gun slides across the waxed floor and -
                         
          Right into the outstretched hand of a sobbing MOM (40s),
          whose DAUGHTER (11) lies beside her in a soccer uniform.
                         
                          MOM
           Oh, god! I don't want the gun!
                         
                          WILL
                          (TO GUARD)
           What the fuck!? Did you do that on
           purpose!?
                         
                          SECURITY GUARD
           It was an accident!
                         
                          CHET
           Are you guys working together?
                         
                          MOM
           No! Please take this gun away!
                         
                          WILL
           Just toss it, lady!
           65.
                         
          The Mom slides the gun away like it were on fire. It skids
          all the way across the floor, slams hard against a wall and
                         
          BLAM!
                         
           MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
           Ah!
                         
          A FAT MAN has been shot. He clutches his thigh.
                         
                          FAT MAN
           I think she got the femoral artery!
                         
                          MOM
           I'm sorry! It was an accident!
                         
                          FAT MAN
           Fuck you! Who slides a gun like that!?
                         
                          DAUGHTER
           Mommy, what's happening!?
                         
                          MOM
           Christi, be quiet. These men are
           dangerous.
                         
          Chet turns ashen. He moves close to Will, whispers urgently -
                         
                          CHET
           This is fucked. That dude is gonna
           bleed out and we're gonna go to prison.
                         
                          WILL
           Just calm down.
                         
                          FAT MAN
           Why is no one getting me help!?
                         
                          WILL
           Is anyone here a doctor?
                         
          Nothing. Just the heavy breathing of many frightened people.
                         
          Will hurries over to the Fat Man, who is bent over, hugging
          his leg.
                         
                          WILL
           Sir, let me see where you're hit.
                         
                          FAT MAN
           Just call me an ambulance!
                         
                          WILL
           Calm down, sir.
           66.
                         
          The Fat Man sits up, removes his hand from his leg. Will
          nervously takes a look. There is only a small amount of
          blood.
                         
                          WILL
           It's just a flesh wound. You're
           gonna be okay.
                         
                          FAT MAN
           But it hurts so bad.
                         
                          WILL
           You got shot, man. It's not supposed
           to feel good. But you're gonna be
           fine. And you'll have a great story
           to tell everyone.
                         
                          FAT MAN
           This is an awful story! This isn't a
           bank error in my favor! I got shot!
                         
                          WILL
           Point taken. Luis, how we doing on
           the money?
                         
          Chet snaps back to attention -
                         
                          CHET
           Oh, shit. Sorry, Cruz.
                         
          Chet picks out the most harmless looking teller, a mousy 20-
          something girl, and helps her up off the ground. He checks
          her name tag: SANDRA.
                         
                          CHET
           Hey, Sandra. I know you're probably
           scared right now, but if you go grab
           us 100 grand in a bag, we'll get out
           of here. This will all be over and
           you'll be fine. You trust me?
                         
          Sandra nods. Chet smiles, reassuringly. She hurries behind
          the counter, starts filling a bank bag with cash, as -
                         
                          FAT MAN
           My leg really hurts!
                         
                          WILL
           Can you please hurry up, Sandra!?
                         
          Sandra emerges from behind the partition with the bank bag.
          Will grabs it. He takes a last look at the people spread
          across the floor.
           67.
                         
                          WILL
           I'm really sorry, everyone. I know
           we probably fucked up your day.
           (looks to Fat Man)
           I'm thinking of you in particular,
           sir. Actually, you know what...
                         
          Will crosses to the Fat Man, offers the bank bag.
                         
                          WILL
           Quickly. Peel a few bills. On me.
           Anyone rats him to the cops and I'm
           coming for you. I remember faces.
                         
          The Fat Man hesitantly reaches for the bag. Opens it -
                         
          Red Dye explodes all over his face. He shrieks. Chet whirls
          on the teller.
                         
                          CHET
           What the fuck was that about, Sandra?
           I thought we had something going!
           What happened to trust?
                         
                          SANDRA
           I'm sorry! They make us do it!
                         
                          WILL
           Could you kindly fill another bag?
           Not a bank bag. A fucking garbage
           bag. And Luis, will you watch her
           this time?
                         
          Sandra hurries back behind the partition with Chet. He dumps
          out the contents of a trash can, grabs the bag and watches
          closely as Sandra stuffs it with cash.
                         
                          CHET
           Okay. That should be enough.
                         
          Chet grabs the bag and hustles out toward Will. They are
          home free, until -
                         
          They hear the wail of approaching sirens outside. They stop
          cold, panicked. Will whirls on the Tellers.
                         
                          WILL
           Fuck! Which one of you assholes tripped
           the alarm!? Was it you, Sandra!?
                         
                          SANDRA
           No! It was Mark! He pushed the
           button when you guys came in!
                         
          Another teller, MARK, looks up from the floor.
           68.
                         
                          MARK
           Sandra, you bitch! Now they're gonna
           kill us both!
                         
                          SANDRA
           Fuck you, Mark! You're the manager!
                         
          Will loses his shit -
                         
                          WILL
           Fuck both of you! Fuck all of you!
           I'm a regular guy! Just like you!
           I'm a regular guy and you fucked me!
           Thank you for fucking a regular guy!
                         
          People are freaked out. Sandra is crying, thinking she will
          probably get shot now.
                         
          Chet grabs Will and pulls him toward the door.
                         
                          CHET
           Let's just get the fuck out of here.
                         
          The guys slam through the doors, out into
                         
          EXT. PARKING LOT, DONNER-WELLS NATIONAL BANK - DAY
                         
          Just as a lone police cruiser screeches into the lot. Will
          and Chet make a run for it, but the cruiser cuts them off.
                         
          OFFICER ZURMAN (21), a jittery rookie, jumps out of the cruiser
          and levels his gun. The guys reflexively level theirs.
                         
                          OFFICER ZURMAN
           Drop your weapons!
                         
                          CHET
           Don't shoot us!
                         
                          OFFICER ZURMAN
           Drop the guns or I'll have to!
                         
          Chet looks at Will with utter desperation. In the distance,
          they hear the sirens of more cops approaching. Will tosses
          his gun, rips open his jacket and grabs a cluster of wires.
                         
                          WILL
           Fuck you! You just brought a gun to
           a bomb fight, officer! I pull these
           wires out and we all go! You got
           ten seconds to drop your gun and -
                         
          Zurman doesn't stick around for the rest. He turns and
          sprints away.

          As the guys make for the Datsun -
                          CHET
           That was awesome.
                          WILL
           He was tempting a desperate
           motherfucker.
          The guys jump in the Datsun and peel out as two more police
          cruisers race toward the bank. The cruisers change course
          and give chase. The Datsun blows right by the parked

          Dwayne watches as the cars speed off into the distance.
                          DWAYNE
           Holy shit! Our boy is causing some
           serious mayhem!
                          JAY
           He's gonna get caught or killed.
          Dwayne whirls on Jay, punches him hard in the shoulder.
                          DWAYNE
           Shut the fuck up! If you jinx this
           with your negativity, I'm gonna strap
           a bomb to your chest next.
          Jay massages his shoulder, pissed.
                         
                          JAY
           Oh, yeah, who's gonna build it?
                         
                          DWAYNE
           You are!

          Whiplash blur as the three cars race by, one after the other.
          Airborne leaves flutter in their wake.

          Chet freaks out as they hurtle toward lunchtime traffic.
          Will weaves in and out of cars.
                         
                          CHET
           Shit! This is not cool!
                         
          Will is wild eyed, punching the gas. Chet's head is on a
          swivel. Behind them: police cruisers in hot pursuit. Up ahead:
          the world rushing at them at 80 mph, populated by nothing but
          potential collisions that will result in a fiery death.
           70.

           Maybe we should pull over and

                          WILL
           I can outrun these guys. They're
           not the FBI, they're local cops.
           Just shut up and let me concentrate.
           I do this for a living.
                         
          As they clip the side-view mirror off a Kia -
                         
                          CHET
           You don't do anything like this for a

          The cruisers are gaining ground, throttles wide open.
                         
          Will downshifts, spiking the RPMs into the red, as he banks

          The Datsun explodes onto a crowded street. PEDESTRIANS
          crossing an intersection jump out of its way.
                         
          The cruisers take the turn into town. One makes it. The
          other slams into parked cars.
                         
          INT./EXT. DATSUN - DAY - MOVING
                         
          Will jumps the curb to avoid slow-moving traffic, slams into a
          newspaper dispenser. It flips up onto the hood and crashes
          into the windshield, where it stays lodged.
                         
                          WILL
           Holy fuck!
                         
          Will veers back into the street and blindly plows ahead as
          cars he cannot see swerve to avoid him.
                         
          He finally slams the brakes, the momentum knocking the
          dispenser loose and launching it onto the sidewalk, scattering
          Pedestrians.
                         
          Chet whirls around to see the cruiser flying right at them.
                         
                          CHET
           Go! Go! Go!
                         
          Will steps on the gas. The light ahead turns red.
                         
                          CHET
           Stop! Stop! Stop!
           71.
                         
          Will rolls the dice and blows through the intersection.
          He's lucky. The cruiser behind him is not. It's T-boned by
          traffic in a brutal, crunching collision.
                         
          INT./EXT. DATSUN - DAY - MOVING
                         
          The cruiser wreckage disappears in the rear-view mirror as

                          WILL
           That guy got fucked up.
                         
          In the rushing moment as they cross the intersection, Chet
          glimpses the other cruiser barreling toward his side of the
          car from the perpendicular street. He has a millisecond,
          maybe, to process their impending doom, and then -
                         
          The cruiser smashes into the back passenger side of the car.
                         
          EXT. TOWN CENTER - DAY
                         
          The Datsun is sent spinning like a fucking top. Its ruined

          Madness. The guys scream as the car continues to slide,
          upside down, out of control. As it slams into a row of
          parking meters, the world goes

          Will blinks back to reality. He's hanging, inverted, by his
          seat belt. The car is a pool of shattered glass. It twinkles
          up at him. Hours could have passed, but it's only been
          seconds. He sucks in air. Satisfied that he is, in fact,
          still alive, he looks over at -
                         
          A battered and bruised Chet, head drooping straight back.
                         
                          WILL
           Chet? Are you okay? Chet!?
                         
                          CHET

           Oh my god...
                         
                          WILL
           Talk to me.
                         
                          CHET
           I thought you were gonna blow up.
                         
          Will's hands go to the bomb...still intact.
           72.
                         
                          WILL
           No. Luckily your side took most of
           the impact.
                         
                          CHET
           Awesome.
                         
                          WILL
           We gotta keep moving.
                         
          Will unclicks his seat belt and falls to the roof of the
          car. He moves to Chet, unclicks his belt and helps him down.
                         
          EXT. TOWN CENTER - DAY
                         
          Will emerges from the overturned car. He drags Chet out,
          along with the bag of cash. He glances up to see the OFFICER
          who crashed into them stumbling out of his own ruined car,
          which has turned a fire hydrant into a geyser. Another
          cruiser races to the scene.
                         
                          WILL
           Oh, fuck, man. Come on.
                         
          Will pulls Chet to his feet and they take off, rounding a
                         CORNER INTO

                          WILL
           Chet...I don't know how to tell you
           this...but you got a piece of the
           car in you.
                         
                          CHET
           What!?
                         
                          WILL
           In your back.
                         
          Chet glances back to see a jagged piece of metal sticking
          out of his shoulder blade.
                         
                          CHET
           Ah! Get it out!
                         
                          WILL
           I will.

                          WILL
           All right.
                         
          Without breaking stride, Will yanks the piece of metal out
          of Chet's back. He screams.
                         
                          CHET
           Is it rusty? Am I gonna get tetanus?
                         
          Behind them, two Officers turn into the alley in full sprint.
          They are way faster than the guys and soon gain on them.
          Will can barely keep up with Chet.
                         
                          CHET
           Why are you moving so slowly?
                         
                          WILL
           It's a combination of cheap sneakers
           and this heavy fucking bomb on my chest!
                         
          They burst out of the alley, onto

          The guys frantically search for an escape, spot -
                         
          A bus pulling up to a stop down the street.
                         
          They sprint for the the bus, peeling off their ski masks and
          waving as it lazily rolls away from the stop.
                         
                          WILL
           Hey! Over here!
                         
          The bus slows and the guys trip over each other to board it.

          The guys fall into seats, gasping for air, a complete mess.
                         
          Will looks out the window to see the Officers emerge from
          the alley and look around for them.

          A crowd has grown around the crash sites. Fire trucks and
          ambulances are on the scene.
                         
          Dwayne and Jay make their way through the crowd, trying to
          see what's what. Dwayne approaches a RANDOM LOCAL.

          The guys are covered in sweat as they hike along, eyes on
          the lookout. They arrive at Will's parked Mustang. Will
          hugs the car.
                         
                          WILL
           I never thought I'd see you again.
                         
                          CHET
           I thought you hated this car.
                         
                          WILL
           It's actually not that bad. You know,
           as compared to that Datsun. The
           Mustang's got more comfortable seats.
           And it never would have flipped over.

          The guys get in. They sit there for a moment, silent except
          for their heavy breathing. Will's eyes go to the garbage
          bag sitting between them.
                         
                          WILL
           There's a 100 grand in there. 100
           fucking grand. Which we stole.
           From a bank.
                         
                          CHET
           I told a bunch of people I was gonna
           shoot someone. I was like "you
           fucking move, and I will kill you
           where you stand!"
                         
                          WILL
           I threatened to blow up a cop.
                          (BEAT)
           And you never said "I will kill you
           where you stand."
                         
                          CHET
           I know. But shit did get pretty crazy.
                         
                          WILL
           Yeah, it did.
                         
          Will starts to get a little emotional.
           75.
                         
                          WILL
           You know, there's no one I would
           have rather taken down a fucking
           bank with. I mean that.
                         
          Chet smiles.
                         
                          CHET
           Me, neither.

           And as for all that shit I said...and
           all that shit I did...I hope you can
           forgive me. We've been friends for
           so long, and I guess you hurt the
           people you're closest to the most.
                         
                          CHET
           I messed up, too. I'm a dude who
           slept with his best friend's ex-
           girlfriend, and destroyed his parents'
           marriage, and sat on the sidelines
           watching his downward spiral. I'm a
           shitty human being. But I'm glad
           you know that now, because you can
           accept me for who I am.
                         
                          WILL
           I do. I accept you. Because you
           accept me.
                         
          Will goes in for a hug. Chet gets lost in the moment, before
          recoiling.
                         
                          CHET
           Woah! You still got a bomb on you.
                         
                          WILL
           You're right. Let's take care of
           that. But you owe me a hug.
                         
          Will pulls the slip of paper Dwayne gave him from his pocket.
                         
                          WILL
           It's all gravy from here.
                         
          Will takes out his cell and dials the number.
                         
                          INTERCUT WITH:
                         
          EXT. TOWN CENTER - DAY
                         
          Dwayne and Jay cross toward a McDonald's. Dwayne stops and
          answers his vibrating cell phone.
           76.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           This who I think it is?
           WILL (O.S.)
           Can't you hear the ticking in the
           background?
                          DWAYNE
           You know, you're a pretty funny guy.
           WILL (O.S.)
           Thanks. I'm happy to entertain a
           complete psychopath.
                          DWAYNE
           Now wait a second, you're the murderer.
           WILL (O.S.)
           What's that supposed to mean?
                          DWAYNE
           One of those cops who wrecked his
           car chasing you...he ain't breathing
           no more.
          Will goes white, covers the phone and whispers to Chet -
                          WILL
           We killed a cop.
                          CHET
           You were driving! I'm just an
           accomplice!
                          WILL
           They're gonna hunt us down and kill
           us. Cops don't take this shit lightly.
                         
                          CHET
           I bet he had like eight kids. We
           have to find them and support his
           family forever.
                         
          Dwayne is holding back laughter. Finally bursts out.
                         
           WILL (O.S.)
           What's so fucking funny!?
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I'm just messin' with you. You didn't
           kill anyone. How'd a moron like you
           manage to rob a bank?
                         
           WILL (O.S.)
           Jesus! Can we just get this over
           with? Where do you want the money?
           77.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           There's a boarded up gas station out
           on Commerce Avenue, past the highway.
           Be there in 30 minutes.
                         
           WILL (O.S.)
           I'll be there in ten.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Then you'll be standing around with
           your dick in one hand, and my money
           in the other.
                         
          Dwayne hangs up. He dials another number -
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Yo, Juicy, wrangle your boy. Money's
           on its way.
                         
          EXT. ROAD - DAY
                         
          The Mustang shrieks past us.
                         
          SUPER COUNTDOWN: 2 hours, 58 minutes...
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          INT. MCDONALD'S - DAY
                         
          Dwayne and Jay sit at a table with a fast food feast spread
          out. Dwayne eats a Big Mac, a look of utter satisfaction on
          his face, a man whom the gods have finally smiled down upon.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I remember the summer after my mother
           passed was the first year they had
           the Monopoly game at McDonald's. I
           musta come here three times a day
           trying to collect all the game pieces.
           Packed on 20 pounds, got acne from
           all the grease. The Major said I was
           the fattest, ugliest 13-year-old he
           ever laid eyes on. But I didn't care,
           I just wanted to win the money and
           get the fuck out of there. So, one
           night, I followed this skinny register
           kid home, jumped him. I kept whaling
           on him, asking him where they were
           hiding the Park Place piece. The
           million dollar prize. But he didn't
           know shit. A year later, The Major
           won the lotto. I asked him for a
           Sega Genesis. He bought me one of
           those paddles with the ball attached.
           78.
                         
          Dwayne goes for a fry, sees his carton is empty and grabs a
          handful of Jay's.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I'm not ashamed to admit that I've
           gone through some dark times since
           then. Depression. Addiction to a
           variety of shit, which I won't go
           into. I know you must think that's
           pretty silly, especially since you
           manage to get through the day and you
           don't got shit going on as compared
           to me. But that's just the way it
           is. That's life.
                         
          Jay looks pretty affected that Dwayne is opening up to him.
                         
                          JAY
           You know, I've been pretty low, too...
           if you ever want to talk about that
           kinda stuff.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           No. I don't. My whole point I was
           trying to make before you interrupted
           me was that that shit is all in the
           past. 'Cause I did it. I finally
           pulled it off.
                         
                          JAY
           We pulled it off, Dwayne. The two
           us. We're a good team.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Are we? Would you do anything to
           protect me, my money, my empire?
                         
                          JAY
           Yeah, sure...
                          (NERVOUS)
           I mean, like what kinda stuff are we
           talking about?
                         
          Dwayne takes out his cell, keys in the speed dial code and
          slides the cell across the table to Jay.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Would you push the button?
                         
                          JAY
           Why would you want me to do that?
                         
                          DWAYNE
           It's just a question, Jay. Would
           you? If I asked you?
                          (MORE)
           79.
                         
                          DWAYNE (CONT'D)
           I mean, it's no different than those
           watermelons.
                         
                          JAY
           Watermelons aren't alive.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Yeah, they are. Not the ones you
           blew up, though.
                         
          Dwayne stares hard at Jay. A tense beat.
                         
                          JAY
           No one gets hurt...right, Dwayne?
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Oh, yeah. I forgot about that part.
                         
          Dwayne cracks a smile.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Anyway, he hasn't even made the drop
           yet. I'm gonna go take a shit.
           Stay away from the bathroom. Someone
           could get hurt.
                         
          Dwayne heads off. Jay eyes the cell phone he has left behind.
                         
          EXT. BOARDED UP GAS STATION - DAY
                         
          Weeds have overtaken the abandoned place. Will leans against
          his parked car, waiting. Chet is nowhere to be seen.
                         
          Will spots Vaughn's Sentra approach. It pulls into the
          station and Vaughn steps. He could not look more menacing.
          Juicy hangs back in the passenger seat.
                         
                          WILL
           Where are the other guys?
                         
                          VAUGHN
           I'm the only guy.
                          (BEAT)
           You got it?
                         
          Will picks up the garbage bag at his feet and walks it over
          to Vaughn. He opens it, looks in.
                         
                          VAUGHN
           What the fuck did you do...rob a
           bank?
           80.
                         
                          WILL
                          (INCREDULOUS)
           Yes.
                         
          Vaughn grins.
                         
                          WILL
           Now where's the code?
                         
                          VAUGHN
           I don't have any code.
                         
          Vaughn turns to leave. Will grabs his arm. Vaughn stops,
          looks purposefully down at Will's hand. Will draws back.
                         
                          WILL
           Listen, man, I just want the code.
                         
                          VAUGHN
           I don't know what the fuck you're
           talking about.
                         
                          WILL
           The code for the fucking bomb!
                         
          Will opens his jacket. Vaughn takes a sudden step back.
                         
                          VAUGHN
           What kind of stupid motherfucker
           wears a bomb to a drop?
                         
                          WILL
           Your boss put this on me.
                         
                          VAUGHN
           I am my boss.
                         
                          WILL
           Then give me the code!
                         
                          VAUGHN
           Motherfucker, I don't know no goddamn
           code. Whoever told you I did, lied
           to you. Now step the fuck off, or
           I'll shoot you in the face so you
           don't explode and mess up my boots.
                         
          Vaughn goes to leave again. Will runs ahead of him and gets
          in his way.
                         
                          WILL
           If you don't have the code, I want
           that money back.
           81.
                         
                          VAUGHN
           The only way you're getting this
           money back is if you kill me.
                         
                          WILL
           You don't know what I've gone through
           for that money!
                         
          In an instant, Vaughn has his gun out, aimed at Will's head.
                         
                          VAUGHN
           Do I look sympathetic? Now step the
           fuck aside.
                         
          INT. SENTRA - DAY
                         
          Juicy looks on with interest as Vaughn holds Will at gunpoint.
          Then she spots
                         
          EXT. BOARDED UP GAS STATION - DAY
                         
          Chet creeping up behind Vaughn, from wherever he was hiding,
          clutching a large metal pipe.
                         
          Juicy jumps out of the Sentra.
                         
                          JUICY
           Vaughn, look out!
                         
          Vaughn whirls around toward Chet, just in time to have his
          gun arm smashed by the pipe. The weapon drops from his hand.
          Chet takes another swing, cracking Vaughn across the face.
          He howls, blood spraying, and topples over. Chet goes for
          another swing, when -
                         
          Juicy jumps on him, wildly biting and clawing.
                         
          Will grabs the back of Juicy's track jacket for leverage and
          flings her away. She hits the back of the Sentra and careens
          clear across the trunk.
                         
                          WILL
           Let's go!
                         
          Will grabs the money. Chet kicks Vaughn's gun into the
          bushes. The guys break for the Mustang and get in.
                         
          Juicy gets to her feet, runs right by a dazed Vaughn and
          after the car, which pulls out into the road and leaves her
          behind, screaming and cursing.

          Will's mind is racing.
           82.
                         
                          WILL
           What the fuck was that?
                         
                          CHET
           They tried to screw us. You're a
           liability. They were just gonna let
           you blow up.
                         
                          WILL
           Not with the money they won't.
                         
          INT. JAY'S GARAGE WORKSHOP - DAY
                         
          A tidy space, filled with various half-finished devices,
          action figures and heavy metal posters. A low mechanical
          hum registers.
                         
          Dwayne sits on a stool in the center of the garage, while
          Jay carefully trims his hair with an electric clipper. Dwayne
          holds up a mirror to check out his work.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Never comes out this nice when I do
           it myself. You might wanna take some
           more off the top, though. I wanna
           look real professional when I go down
           to the morgue to identify the body.
                         
          Dwayne's phone chimes from a nearby counter. He grabs it,
          looks at the incoming number, slightly concerned. He answers -
                         
                          DWAYNE
           You drop the money yet?

          Will yells into the phone -
                         
                          WILL
           No! I've still got the money! And
           I cracked your friend's face open!
                         
           DWAYNE (O.S.)
           Why the fuck would you do that!?
                         
                          WILL
           You lied! You said I'd get the code!
                         
          Dwayne is panicked, covers badly -
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I gave him the code. He told me he
           committed it to memory.

           83.
                         
                          DWAYNE (CONT'D)
           He was probably just embarrassed that
           he forgot it. I'll call him up and -
                         
           WILL (O.S.)
           You didn't give him shit! I want
           the code now or you'll never see
           this money!
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Hold on there, big man. You got a
           bomb on you. I got a cell phone that
           detonates it. You're not exactly
           negotiating from a position of leverage.
                         
           WILL (O.S.)
           I'm holding the money. I blow up,
           and it blows up. Who has the leverage
           now? Go ahead and push the button,
           you idiot.
                         
          Chet freaks out -
                         
                          CHET
           Don't tell him to push the button!
           Pull over! Pull over!
                         
          Dwayne is getting pissed off.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Why don't you watch what the fuck
           you say! I own you! I tell you to
           rob a bank, and you rob a bank. I
           tell you to give me the money, and
           you give me the goddamn money and
           hope I show you some mercy.
                         
           WILL (O.S.)
           I'm tired of this bullshit. I'm
           already dead, right? So fuck you.
           At least I'll die rich. I can't say
           the same for you.
                         
          The line goes dead. Dwayne tears off his haircut smock.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           That piece of shit hung up on me!
                         
          INT. MUSTANG - DAY - MOVING
                         
          Chet grabs the wheel and forces Will to pull over.
                         
                          CHET
           Get me out of this car!

          EXT. ROAD - DAY
                         
          Chet jumps out while the Mustang is still slowing down. He
          runs 20 yards away. Will turns the car off and gets out.
                         
                          CHET
           That was colossally stupid!
                         
                          WILL
           It was a negotiation tactic. He'll
           call back and I won't answer. Then
           he'll call back and I will answer, and
           he'll realize the only way he gets the
           money is if he gives me the code.
                         
                          CHET
           Sure! That seems like a perfectly
           logical pattern of thought! I bet
           that's exactly what he'll do!
                         
          INT. JAY'S GARAGE WORKSHOP - DAY
                         
          Dwayne tries Will's phone again. It goes to voicemail. He
          explodes like a pack of Mentos in a two-liter of Diet Coke.
          Throws his cell across the room. Overturns a work table.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Does this guy know who the fuck I am!?
                         
          Jay retreats into a corner. Dwayne's a big boy, and he soon
          tires himself out, hunches over, panting.
                         
                          JAY
           Dwayne...you never told me you weren't
           going to give him the code.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           We're not amateurs. He was a loose
           end. I let him live, someday I woulda
           been walking out of my mansion and...
           bam! FBI, CIA, NSA, all converging on
           my front lawn, 'cause a loose end turned
           state's evidence and they got what
           they need to put me away.
                         
          Dwayne shakes his head. Starts digging through the mess
          he's made...finds his phone.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Fuck it, Jay. I'll just kill The
           Major myself.
                         
          Dwayne keys in the speed dial code.
           85.
                         
                          JAY
           Don't do it.
                         
          Dwayne looks down at the send button.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           You know what they say about a tree
           falling in the forest? Maybe the
           same thing applies to blowing up
           some motherfucker across town. Maybe
           it doesn't even make a sound.
                         
          Dwayne hits send.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Boom.
                         
          But Dwayne notices something...the phone in his hand is
          ringing. He puts it to his ear. The line connects -
                         
           FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
           Hello...who is this...hello...?
                         
          Dwayne snaps the phone shut, looks to Jay, who tries to will
          the beads of sweat back into his pores.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Who did I just call, Jay? 'Cause
           she sounded cute for a bomb.
                         
                          JAY
                          (SWALLOWS HARD)
           Gina Kim. My seventh grade crush. Or
           whoever lives in Gina Kim's house now.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Where's the number for the bomb?
                         
                          JAY
           In my head. I switched it out of
           your phone while you were taking a
           shit. You're out of control, Dwayne.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I'm in perfect control!
                         
          Dwayne charges Jay. Jay holds up the hair clippers like a
          weapon, flicks them on. Dwayne rips the cord out of the
          wall, uses it to yank the clippers from Jay's hand, then
          whips him with the cord.
                         
                          JAY
           Stop it!
           86.
                         
          Dwayne goes to whip Jay again, but Jay moves like a jack rabbit
          and delivers a fierce kidney shot. Dwayne stumbles backward,
          falls onto the couch, groans -
                          DWAYNE
           You asshole...I make you my partner
           and you pull this shit...
                          JAY
           I'm tired of you pushing me around
           all the time! What kinda partner
           does that!?
                          DWAYNE
           Fuck you...I'm gonna piss blood,
           aren't I?
                          JAY
           That's what it said on the internet.
          Dwayne's phone rings in his pocket.
                          DWAYNE
           Go on. Get it out for me. I can
           barely move.
          Jay pulls the cell from Dwayne's pocket...opens it and puts
          it to his ear so he can answer -
                          DWAYNE
           Glad you came to your senses.
                          INTERCUT WITH:

          Vaughn has a rag pressed to his swollen, bloody face. Juicy
          is nearby, banged up and dirty. Vaughn yells into his cell -
                         
                          VAUGHN
           Who the fuck do you think you're
           talking to!?
                         
           DWAYNE (O.S.)
           I honestly don't know.
                         
                          VAUGHN
           Let me give you a hint: your boy
           just jumped me, tossed my bitch like
           a rag doll and split with the cash.
                         
          Dwayne realizes who's on the other line, recovers -
                         
                          DWAYNE
           That guy's not my boy. He's a dick.
           I'm sorry for all the, uh, confusion.
           87.
                         
           VAUGHN (O.S.)
           Confusion? The only motherfucker
           that's confused is you. Apparently,
           you think you can fuck me and survive
           the day.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I wasn't fucking you, I was fucking
           him. You gotta understand, you're
           like a pawn in a much larger game
           I'm playing here.
                         
           VAUGHN (O.S.)
           Did you just call me a pawn, you
           stupid fuck!?
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I didn't mean it like that. I'm
           just juggling a whole lot of shit.
                         
           VAUGHN (O.S.)
           I want my money. Right now.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           That may not be possible.
                          (DELICATELY)
           I just want to put this out there,
           to keep you in the loop...but I may
           need to bump the hit.
                         
          Vaughn paces, furious.
                         
                          VAUGHN
           This isn't a reservation at Sizzler!
           You don't "bump" it! I want you to
           bring me my money right now, to where
           I am standing in this shit hole town,
           bleeding from the motherfucking face!
                         
           DWAYNE (O.S.)
           I don't exactly have the money...give
           me some time and -
                         
                          VAUGHN
           The deal's off! You just became the
           hit!
                         
          Vaughn hangs up, tosses the bloody rag to the ground and
          screams in frustration.
                         
                          JUICY
           He lives with his daddy. You already

          Dwayne looks down at his phone.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           That's it. The assassin's gonna
           kill me now. I'm gonna die. Game
           fucking over.
                         
          Dwayne cradles his arms around his wounded kidney, rocks
          back and forth, wallowing in defeat.
                         
                          JAY
           We can still get him the money. Try
           the pizza guy back.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Why? So he can fuck around again,
           and I wind up dead, anyway? No.
           I'd rather just sit here. I want to
           die right here on this couch.
                         
                          JAY
           No. We're gonna get that money.
           Just like we planned. All we gotta
           do is get the leverage back.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           How do we do that? Pizza boy's
           obviously got some kinda death wish.
                         
          Jay gathers his resolve.
                         
                          JAY
           We take the girl. The one he went
           to see. Then he won't try shit.
                         
          Dwayne looks up at Jay with something not unlike awe.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           That's actually...that's a great
           fucking idea, Jay. It's the best
           idea anyone's had all day.
                         
          Dwayne lowers his head. He removes the gun from his
          belt...holds it out to Jay. Jay takes it. Feels its weight.
          Then offers it back.
                         
                          JAY
           I was just trying to figure out how
           you would do it, Dwayne.
                         
          Dwayne takes the gun. Struggles to stand. Jay helps him.
           89.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Ok. Then let's do it right. We
           leave nothing to chance. Because if
           we go to prison for this, I won't be
           able to watch out for you.
                         
                          JAY
           Ok, Dwayne.
                         
          Dwayne looks over at a frame backpack hanging from a hook on
          the wall. PVC piping bulges from it.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           You should probably bring the
           flamethrower, buddy. There's gonna
           be some evidence to dispose of.
                         
          EXT. SIDE OF THE ROAD - DAY
                         
          Will and Chet sit on the ground, still 20 yards apart. Chet
          checks his watch.
                         
                          CHET
           It's been half an hour.
                         
                          WILL
           He'll call.
                         
                          CHET
           In another 30 minutes I'm calling
           the bomb squad.
                         
          Chet gestures to the vast emptiness all around them.
                         
                          CHET
           These guys obviously aren't watching
           you anymore.
                         
                          WILL
           You know, even if they get the bomb
           squad here in time, and they can
           somehow get this thing off me, we
           still gotta answer for the robbery.
                         
                          CHET
           I'll take the heat with you, Will.
                         
                          WILL
           Nah. I'll tell them I forced you
           into it. That you didn't have a
           choice.
                         
                          CHET
           Thanks, man.
           90.
                         
          Will looks at Chet for a beat.
                          WILL
           That's it? You're not gonna think
           about it a little longer? After all
           we went through...tear down the
           relationship, rebuild it...you're
           gonna let me go to prison alone?
                          CHET
           You offered.
                          WILL
           It was a test. Your grade: F minus.
           You know what the "F" is for?
                          CHET
           To fuck myself?
                          WILL
           You passed that test. Failed the
           important one.
          As the guys continue to argue -
          SUPER COUNTDOWN: 1 hour, 28 minutes...
                          CUT TO:
          INT. LAW FIRM, OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
          Kate walks down a hallway, turns into an office. Two figures
          rush past from the intersecting hallway and duck behind a
          corner.
                         
          Kate emerges from the office and continues into
                         
          INT. WOMEN'S BATHROOM, OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
                         
          Kate goes to the mirror, checks herself out. She's been
          crying. She splashes water on her face, then enters a stall.
                         
          The bathroom door opens and Dwayne and Jay enter. Dwayne
          pulls something hairy from his pocket.
                         
          Inside the stall, Kate reaches for some toilet paper...from
          underneath the barrier, she notices two pairs of dirty,
          masculine sneakers. Her breath goes shallow. She takes out
          her cell, quietly opens it. She presses the first 9 in "911,"
          but her keypad volume is on and the phone makes a dull,
          electronic beep that echoes in the quiet bathroom.
                         
           DWAYNE (O.S.)
           Why don't you just slide the phone
           under the door, so I don't have to
           kick it open and see you with your
           panties down.
           91.
                         
          Kate slides the phone out. One of the sneakers crushes it.
          She gets off the toilet, arranges her clothing and steps out
          out of the stall. She gasps at -
                         
          The two ominous men standing there in gorilla masks. Dwayne's
          gun is plainly visible, tucked into the front of his pants.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           What's the quietest way out of the
           building? 'Cause I might get excited
           in a confrontation, and you might
           wind up shot in the face.
                         
          EXT. LIVING ROOM, NICE HOUSE - DAY
                         
          The Major is watching reruns of Three's Company. He doesn't
          laugh or remotely smile at any of it.
                         
          The subtle click of a door opening does not escape his finely
          tuned senses.
                         
                          MAJOR
           Dwayne?
                         
          Nothing. The Major gets up and goes to a desk, rifles through
          a drawer and pulls something out. A simple pen. He clutches
          it like a weapon.
                         
          INT. HALLWAY, NICE HOUSE - DAY
                         
          The Major creeps along.
                         
           VAUGHN (O.S.)
           Just stay where you are, old man.
                         
          The Major turns to find Vaughn pointing a gun at him.
                         
                          VAUGHN
           I'm looking for your son.
                         
                          MAJOR
           Even if I knew where he was, I
           wouldn't tell you nothing.
                         
                          VAUGHN
           Don't be stupid.
                         
                          MAJOR
           You know, I saved a black man's life
           in the shit. So if I took yours I'd
           be even.
                         
                          VAUGHN
           I see where your son gets his common
           sense.
                          (MORE)
           92.
                         
                          VAUGHN (CONT'D)
           But you might want to readjust your
           attitude, because I ain't fucking
           around. I want Dwayne. I don't know
           why you'd want to protect him, the
           motherfucker hired me to kill you.
                         
          If this news has any effect at all on The Major, he doesn't
          show it.
                         
                          VAUGHN
           Just tell me where he is!
                         
          Vaughn pulls back the hammer of his gun.
                         
                          MAJOR
           You think I'm scared of death?
           There's a whole generation of gooks
           that think I'm the grim reaper.
                         
          Vaughn shakes his head. Almost imperceptibly, The Major
          repositions the hand with the pen in it. Vaughn is about to
          squeeze the trigger -
                         
          But The Major beats him to it, clicking the pen, which is
          actually a pen gun. It fires a .22 caliber round into Vaughn's
          neck. He drops the gun and clutches the geyser of blood.
                         
          The Major charges Vaughn, jumps on him and wrestles him to
          the ground, trying to jam the pen into the wound in his neck.
                         
                          MAJOR
           I'll ride you all the way to hell!
           I know exactly how to get there!
                         
          Vaughn reaches for his gun. His fingers curl around it and
          he whips it across The Major's face, knocking him backwards.
                         
          Vaughn scrambles to his feet, gun pointed at the felled Major.
                         
                          VAUGHN
           What now, old man!? You can't kill
           me! None of y'all can kill me!
                         
          The Major looks up at Vaughn, once again face to face with a
          loaded weapon.
                         
                          MAJOR
           Go on and -
                         
          BANG!
                         
          The Major goes limp, one searing hole in his chest.
           93.
                         
          Vaughn clasps a hand to his neck to staunch the flow of blood.
          He steps over the The Major's body and continues upstairs.
                         
          INT. BATHROOM, NICE HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Vaughn rifles through the cabinets, dumps all of the first
          aid supplies into the sink. He gets to work on his wound.
                         
          INT. DWAYNE'S ROOM, NICE HOUSE - DAY
                         
          The locked door is kicked open. Vaughn, neck crudely
          bandaged, flicks on the lights and looks around the childish
          room. Chinese Fighting Fish swim in a large tank, seem to
          stop and look out at him like guard dogs.
                         
          Vaughn ransacks the place. He finds a desk drawer locked.
          Takes out his gun and blows it open.
                         
          Vaughn pulls a stuffed file folder out of the drawer. Flips
          through it. It's full of details about Dwayne's plan, the
          tanning salon, etc.
                         
                          VAUGHN
           Motherfucker has lost his mind...
                         
          He finds a map of the town in the file. Three locations are
          highlighted: the bank, the boarded up gas station, and the
          radio tower. PUSH IN on the radio tower.
                         
          Vaughn stuffs the map into his pocket. He stops before leaving
          the room, turns and shatters the fish tank with the butt of
          his gun. Water spills out and the Chinese Fighting Fish flop
          onto the floor. As Vaughn lifts a boot to stomp them -
                         
          EXT. ROAD - DAY
                         
          Will and Chet are still arguing -
                         
                          CHET
           Look at the upshot, while you're
           behind bars you can finally finish
           your degree. If I was there, too,
           it would just be a distraction.
                         
                          WILL
           Great idea, Chet. Thanks a lot.
           I'll just sit here and figure out a
           fucking major.
                         
          Will stews. After a beat, his hand goes to his pocket.
          It's vibrating. He pulls out his cell.
                         
                          WILL
           Hey, it's them.
           94.
                         
          Will answers -
                         
                          WILL
           You ready to talk now?

          INT. MINIVAN - DAY - MOVING
                         
          Dwayne drives with his cell pressed to his ear. Jay keeps
          watch on Kate in back. She is blindfolded, hands bound behind
          her back with duct tape.
                         
                          DWAYNE
                          (INTO PHONE)
           Yeah, I'm ready to talk. I want my
           money. Meet me back at the radio
           tower in 50 minutes.
                         
           WILL (O.S.)
           I've barely got an hour left!
                         
                          DWAYNE
           That's the point. I want you on a
           short leash.
                         
           WILL (O.S.)
           Fuck that. Give me the code first.
           Then you can have your money. You'll
           just have to trust me when I say
           that I don't want it.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Yeah, I'm sure. You just wanna go
           back to your fantastic life. Your
           great job. And that blonde bitch
           with the sexy voice.
                         
          Will's mind jumps to the only logical conclusion. Roller
          coaster stomach drop. His voice cracks as he asks a useless
                         QUESTION -
                         
                          WILL
           What the fuck is that supposed to
           mean?
                         
           DWAYNE (O.S.)
           It means that girl you paid a visit
           to today is sitting in the back of
           my van right now. And it ain't
           exactly consensual.
                         
                          WILL
           Fuck you! You crossed a line!
           95.
                         
          Dwayne just laughs, maniacally.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           There are no lines! There's just me
           and you and 100 thousand dollars.
           Once we get that shit in order, you
           can have her back, and your life,
           too. So you're gonna show up where
           I say, when I say. Alone. And if
           you try anything stupid, the two of
           you will be delivering pizzas to
           Saint Peter.
                         
                          WILL
           Let me talk to her.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           You got ten seconds.
                         
          Dwayne hands the phone back to Jay, who puts it to Kate's
          ear. She is trembling.
                         
                          KATE
           Will...?
                         
           WILL (O.S.)
           Kate, I'm so sorry.
                         
                          KATE
           It's okay...I'm fine...I'm just really -
                         
          Dwayne snatches the phone.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           She's just really gonna die if you
           fuck this up.
                         
          Will absorbs this like a blow to the chest. The line
          disconnects.
                         
                          WILL
           Fuck!
                         
                          CHET
           What happened?
                         
                          WILL
           They have Kate.
                         
                          CHET
           What the fuck does that mean!?
                         
                          WILL
           They took her, man. They must have
           followed us to her office.
           96.
                         
                          CHET
           Damn it! You had to go see her!
                         
                          WILL
           I'm sorry. I messed up...I finally
           messed up worse than I could have
           possibly imagined.
                         
                          CHET
           We gotta get her back, Will. These
           guys are crazy.
                         
                          WILL
           We still got the money. As long as
           we have that, she's alive. Come on.
                         
          Chet grabs the bag of cash. They hustle into the car and it
          peels out, leaving behind a swirling cloud of dust. As the
          sun begins to set -
                         
          SUPER COUNTDOWN: 58 minutes...
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT
                         
          Two menacing headlights come at us on the empty road. They
                         BELONG TO
                         
          INT. SENTRA - NIGHT - MOVING
                         
          Vaughn holds up Dwayne's map as he drives. He seems to be
          on the right road, headed for the radio tower. He crumples
          the map and throws it in back.
                         
          EXT. SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY - NIGHT
                         
          The Mustang stops by the gate to the radio tower. Chet jumps
          out and disappears into the bushes.
                         
          EXT. RADIO TOWER - NIGHT
                         
          The Mustang pulls up. Will gets out and looks around the
          deserted place. He holds up the money bag.
                         
                          WILL
           I'm here!
                         
          In the shadow of the nearby shed, the minivan is revealed as
          its interior lights come on. The door opens and Dwayne
          emerges, in his mask.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           How much time you got left?
           97.
                         
          Will takes off the jacket and tosses it to the ground. He
          looks at the timer.
                         
                          WILL
           Ten minutes.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Damn. Maybe we should just wait
           around for the money shot.
                         
          The guys meet in a clearing. Dwayne nods at the bag.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           That the money?
                         
                          WILL
           Maybe. Where's the girl?
                         
          Dwayne grins.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           In the van. Maybe.
                         
                          WILL
           Get her out here. You're wasting time.
                         
          Will grips the bag close to him.
                         
          Dwayne whistles. The minivan door opens and Jay steps out.
          Strapped to his back is the frame pack we saw at his workshop.
          A long tube connects the pack to the handle of a metal pipe-
          like device in his hand.
                         
          Jay helps Kate, still bound and blindfolded, out of the van.
          They approach Dwayne and take up position behind him.
                         
                          KATE
           Will, are you there?
                         
                          WILL
           I'm here. It's gonna be okay.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           This is a fucking tearjerker.
                         
                          WILL
           Just let her come over here.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I will. But you should know, my
           associate over there is packing a
           flamethrower.
                         
          Jay aims the metal device he has been holding. He hits a
          button and a pilot light comes on.
           98.
                         
                          JAY
                          (FLAT)
           Just do what we say. Don't mess
           around or anything.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Unless either of you can outrun a 25-
           foot flame.
           (gestures to gun in his belt)
           Or a bullet.
                         
          Dwayne roughly pulls Kate away from Jay and shoves her
          forward. Will grabs her, pulls her blindfold off and pushes
          her behind him.
                         
                          WILL
           Get back.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I gave you the girl. Now give me
           the money.
                         
                          WILL
           How about we get the code out of the
           way first, since this bomb happens
           to be ticking so close to all of us.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Fair enough.
                         
          Dwayne pulls a slip of paper from his pocket.
                         
                          DWAYNE
                          (TAUNTING)
           You ready to be a free man?
                         
                          WILL
           Just give it to me!
                         
                          DWAYNE
           448921.
                         
          Will keys in the numbers. The timer freezes and the lock at
          the hinge opens. Will carefully extricates himself from the
          vest. He lays it down on the ground and steps away from it.
          His shirt is drenched in sweat from where the bomb sat.
                         
          Will takes a final look at the money bag, then throws it to
          Dwayne. He looks inside, smiles. Jay takes a peak.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           It's so fucking pretty, ain't it?
                         
                          JAY
           Yeah. It's awesome.
           99.
                         
          Dwayne looks up at Will.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Okay, you can get out of here now.
                         
                          WILL
           I actually have this sneaking
           suspicion that once we turn around,
           you're gonna put a bullet in both of
           our backs - and this is just a guess -
           burn our bodies.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           They say great minds think alike.
           And in this case, so do we.
                         
                          WILL
           I figured as much. That's why I got
           a gun pointed at you, too.
                          (LOUDLY)
           I got a sniper in the bushes locked
           on you right now.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Do I look that dumb?
                         
                          WILL
           I can't tell, you're wearing a mask.
                         
          Before Dwayne can react, he stops and blinks, something
          shining in his eyes.
                         
                          JAY
           Hey...on your forehead.
                         
          Dwayne's eyes turn upward, just barely making out the red
          dot that dances on his forehead.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Son of a bitch. Well played.
                         
          In the bushes, hidden from sight, Chet carefully aims his
          laser pointer at Dwayne's forehead.
                         
          Will grins at Dwayne.
                         
                          WILL
           We're gonna walk out of here now.
           If you shoot, my sniper shoots. I
           can't guarantee he'll get both of
           you. But he'll definitely get you.
                         
          As Will turns away -
           100.
                         
           VAUGHN (O.S.)
           Hold the fuck up.
                         
          Vaughn emerges from the darkness. He looks at Will.
                         
                          VAUGHN
           Wasn't expecting to see you here.
                         
          Without warning, Vaughn cracks Will over the head with the
          butt of his gun. He goes down hard. Kate screams. Vaughn
          points the gun at her and she shuts up.
                         
          Dwayne steps forward with the bag.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           It's all good. We got your money.
                         
                          VAUGHN
           Nice mask, Dwayne. Now throw the
           money over here.
                         
          Dwayne complies. As soon as the bag lands, Vaughn aims the
          gun at him.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Hold up. You don't have to do this.
           I just paid you.
                         
          Kate looks on, terrified, an unconscious Will at her side.
                         
          Vaughn's eyes burn a hole through Dwayne.
                         
                          VAUGHN
           I've been hit with a pipe, shot with a
           pen, and wasted my whole motherfucking
           day...all because of you and this job.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I don't know what you're talking about.
           Just take the money.
                         
                          VAUGHN
           I will. And then I'm gonna tie up the
           two loose ends in the gorilla masks.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I'm not a loose end!
                         
                          VAUGHN
           You're a fucking idiot. You are as
           loose as ends get.
                         
          Panicked, Dwayne's eyes flash over to Jay, who tightens his
          grip on the flamethrower handle. Jay catches Dwayne's eye.
          Dwayne nods. Vaughn sees this.
           101.
                         
                          VAUGHN
           What the -
                         
          Jay rears up with the flamethrower. Vaughn couldn't be more
          surprised to see the device Jay is holding spit a massive
          ball of fire at him.
                         
          Vaughn dives to the ground, fires off two wild shots, one of
                         WHICH -
                         
          Nails Dwayne in the shoulder, spinning him backward and
          knocking him off his feet.
                         
          Kate recoils in horror as: Vaughn scurries madly on the
          ground, intermittently firing, while Jay screams and tries
          to torch him with the 25-foot flame. A hand touches Kate's
          shoulder and she whirls around to find -
                         
                          KATE
           Chet!? What are you doing here!?
                         
                          CHET
           Not now. We gotta take off.
                          (LOOKS AROUND)
           Where's Will?
                         
          Kate looks to the empty spot beside her where Will just was.
                         
          Flames inches from him, Vaughn lines up a desperate shot -
                         
          Good news: the bullet only grazes Jay's side. Bad news: it
          keeps going and punches through the flamethrower backpack,
          which happens to be filled with gasoline, which happens to
          have an incredibly low flash point. So the spark from, say,
          a bullet, would cause
                         
          AN ERUPTION OF FLAMES
                         
          Meanwhile, Will pops up behind Chet and Kate, clutching the
          garbage bag.
                         
                          WILL
           I got the money. Let's get the fuck
           out of here.
                         
          They take off toward Will's car.
                         
          Dwayne groggily comes to...no SOUND, just a ringing. The
          first thing he sees: Vaughn storming toward him, god-knows-
          what spewing from his mouth. Vaughn levels his gun -
                         
          It doesn't make a sound for two reasons. The second being
          that it's out of bullets.
                         
          Dwayne fumbles for his own hardware. Muzzle flash.
           102.
                         
          Vaughn drops to his knees. Pulse snatched from him.
                         
          SOUND SLAMS BACK to the tune of Jay's screams. Dwayne looks
          over to see his friend in flames, flailing his arms and
          shrieking. Dwayne's head snaps to the other side, where he
          sees the Mustang's tires peel. He tears off his mask,
          frantically looks around. The money is gone.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           No!!
                         
          Jay disentangles himself from the backpack, the source of
          the flames, but his clothes are now ablaze. In his frenzy,
          he somehow manages to string together two coherent words -
                         
                          JAY
           Dwayne! Help!
                         
          Dwayne gets to his feet as the Mustang roars down the
          driveway. He looks to Jay, then to his minivan. Dwayne's
          face: Two roads diverge in a wood. Which to take?
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Goddamn it, Jay!
                         
          Dwayne sprints over to Jay, rips off his jacket and uses it
          to beat the flames down.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Stop, drop and roll!
                         
          Jay hits the deck. Dwayne continues fighting the flames,
          finally falls on top of Jay with the jacket spread and
          smothers the last of them out.
                         
          Jay looks up at Dwayne with puppy dog eyes.
                         
                          JAY
           You came back for me...you said you
           never would.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           You didn't hesitate back there, Jay.
           You did good.
                         
          Jay smiles. Flames overtake the field all around them.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I'm gonna go put a bullet in that
           motherfucker and get our money.
           Think you can get outta here?
                         
                          JAY
           Yeah. Go get him.
           103.
                         
          Dwayne hurries toward the minivan. Jay stumbles up to his
          feet and limps off toward the woods.
                         
          EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT
                         
          The Mustang travels away from the rising flames.
                         
          INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT - MOVING
                         
          Will's face is a mess of dirt, sweat and dried blood. He
          and Chet stare ahead, completely shell-shocked.
                         
          Kate looks from one of them to the other.
                         
                          KATE
           Uh...I just got kidnapped.
                         
                          CHET
           Yeah, that was totally Will's fault.
           In case you want to factor that in
           while you're mulling over the whole
           relationship thing.
                         
                          WILL
           I'm very sorry about the kidnapping.
           This is me, taking responsibility
           for it. Growing up. Like a viable
           life partner.
                         
                          CHET
           This man has spied on you in the
           nude before!
                         
                          WILL
           What? No, I didn't.
                         
                          CHET
           He's lying. He's trying to build a
           relationship on a foundation of lies.
           And it won't stand.
                         
                          KATE
           I just got kidnapped! Can we talk
           about that!?
                         
          Something catches Will's attention: a set of headlights
          rapidly growing larger in the rear-view mirror.
                         
          INT. MINIVAN - NIGHT - MOVING
                         
          Dwayne's speedometer is buried past 100 mph. His eyes burn
          with intensity.
           104.
                         
          INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT - MOVING
                         
          Will hits the gas.
                         
                          WILL
           Oh, shit. One of those dudes is
           definitely not dead!
                         
          Chet and Kate look out the back window. Chet screams -
                         
                          CHET
           Hurry up! He's already on us!
                         
          EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT
                         
          Dwayne's car pulls even with the Mustang.
                         
          INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT - MOVING
                         
          Will looks over at Dwayne, who pulls out his gun and takes
          aim. He flashes a sick grin -
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I own this town.
                         
          Before Dwayne can get a shot off -
                         
          EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT
                         
          An explosion rocks the minivan from inside. The back end is
          lifted off the ground and the car tumbles over itself. It
          lands on its roof and skids into a ditch.
                         
          INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT - MOVING
                         
          Chet and Kate watch the burning wreck disappear out the back
          window. They are equal parts confused and happy to be alive.
                         
                          KATE
           What the hell was that?
                         
                          WILL
           That was the bomb I carried around
           all day. I reactivated it and put
           it in the back of his van. I guess
           his time was up.
                         
                          CHET
           "His time was up?" Were you thinking
           that up the whole day?
                         
                          WILL
           I was prepared, yes. I can't help
           it if I'm the kind of guy who thinks
           about the future.
           105.
                         
                          CHET
                          (TO KATE)
           He's not that kind of guy. He doesn't
           think about the future. Ever.
                         
                          KATE
           What exactly happened since I saw
           you this afternoon?
                         
                          WILL
           Primarily, we robbed a bank.
                         
                          KATE
           What!? So you're, like, fugitives?
           What do we do now?
                         
                          CHET
           Yeah, Will. What does the future
           hold?
                         
                          WILL
           Nothing good if we stay in town and
           they pin this on us. Kate, I think
           you should put in for that vacation
           time. Right now. If anyone gives
           you a problem, tell them to fuck
           off. There's 100 grand in that trash
           bag by your feet. A third of it's
           yours.
                         
          Kate opens the bag...smiles through the dirt and grime.
                         
                          KATE
           Will, that's -
                         
                          CHET
           Fucked up. Why does she get a share?
                         
                          WILL
           Why do you get a share?
                         
          Chet stews. Will catches Kate's eyes in the rear-view.
                         
                          WILL
           Airport's 30 minutes away. Pick a
           destination. This time it's not a
           practice run.
                         
          EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
                         
          The car zooms off.
                         
          SUPER COUNTDOWN: 0 hours, 0 minutes...
                         
                          CUT TO:
           106.
                         
          EXT. DITCH - NIGHT
                         
          Wind fans the flames of the burning minivan. The shattered
          windshield sprouts another crack...then another, as -
                         
          Dwayne's foot kicks it out. He drags himself from the
          smoldering steel carcass. He is a charred, blood splattered
          mess, but he is alive.
                         
          EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT
                         
          Dwayne is propped up against a sign, lingering on the edge
          of consciousness. The headlights of a lone pickup truck
          approach. Dwayne feebly waves the truck down for a ride.
                         
          INT. NICE HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          The door opens and Dwayne stumbles through. He has made it
          home. He drops like a puppet whose strings have been cut.
                         
          From where his head has landed on the floor, Dwayne sees
          something odd...long red streaks. He crawls forward on all
          fours to investigate...
                         
          It is a trail of sticky red blood. Dwayne follows it until
          he comes upon its source...the crumpled body of his father,
          lying face down. Dwayne's face: shock and confusion and joy.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Dad?
                         
          Dwayne inches closer, pokes the body. Nothing.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Dad, are you -
                         
          The body emits a low groan. Dwayne rolls it over. His
          father's face is white, he's lost a lot of blood, but he
          isn't totally spent yet. He struggles to speak -
                         
                          MAJOR
           Dwayne...
                         
                          DWAYNE
           What happened to you?
                         
                          MAJOR
           Some guy...said you hired him to
           kill me.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Dad, I...I'd never...
           107.
                         
                          MAJOR
           Look at you...lip quivering like
           you're getting fucked...be a man.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I am a man! I killed you, didn't I?
           Now I'm gonna use your money to open
           a tanning salon where they let you
           fuck the chicks.
                         
          This stirs something in The Major.
                         
                          MAJOR
           You mean...like those whorehouses...in
           'Nam...I used to tell you about?
                         
          Dwayne softens at the recollection.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Those were great bedtime stories.
                         
          The Major nods. Opens his hand. Reveals a cordless phone.
          Dwayne looks to the bloody streaks down the hall, leading to
          the phone table. The Major dragged himself the whole way.
                         
                          MAJOR
           Medics are late...probably a couple
           lazy spicks...you tell 'em I said
           so...all right, son?
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Sure thing, pop.
                         
          The Major looks up at Dwayne's bruised face, as if for the
          first time.
                         
                          MAJOR
           Hell of thing...I think I
           may...actually respect you now.
                         
          Dwayne's eyes well up. He reaches out, cradles his father
          as he expires. It's like a very bloody, white trash version
          of the Pietà. Dwayne sobs uncontrollably, until -
                         
          He drops his father and pound-pound-pounds his chest in some
          approximation of a life saving resuscitation.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Get up, you pussy! Come on, soldier!
                         
          PULL AWAY as Dwayne pounds the body and distant sirens grow
          nearer.
                         
                          FADE OUT:
           108.
                         
          BLACK. THE DARKNESS RIPPLES...
                         
          Into waves. It's the ocean, long past sunset. PULL BACK to
          find a lone figure staring out at it, sitting on
                         
          EXT. BEACH - NIGHT
                         
          Will. Shirtless. Could be anywhere.
                         
          Chet approaches and sits beside him.
                         
                          CHET
           Fucking nine dollars to use the
           internet.
                         
                          WILL
           And?
                         
                          CHET
           Police think it was that black guy.
           They found some kind of map in his
           car. And I'm sure racial profiling
           played a part.
                         
                          WILL
           But nothing about us?
                         
                          CHET
           Nope. Guess it's time to head back.
                         
                          WILL
           I was thinking we'd stick around a
           little a longer.
                         
                          CHET
           Why? So you have more time to delude
           my sister?
                         
                          WILL
           Yes. And it'd be easier if you gave
           us five fucking minutes alone.
                         
          Chet stares out at the ocean for a beat.
                         
                          CHET
           You really think she's into you?
                         
                          WILL
                          (SWALLOWS HARD)
           I kissed her last night. No tongue.
           Then you walked in.
                         
          Chet just nods. Will gets up.
           109.
                         
                          CHET
           You're gonna go fuck my sister now,
           aren't you?
                         
                          WILL
           I'll be thinking of you the whole
           time.
                         
                          CHET
           At the very least...be a considerate
           lover. Give pleasure, before taking
           pleasure.
                         
                          WILL
           I think I'm reading you. And I will
           try my best.
                         
          Will heads up a trail that leads to a hotel bungalow. Kate
          opens the door, steps out onto the porch.
                         
          Will stops, looks back at Chet. He whistles. Chet turns.
                         
                          WILL
           You're Riggs! You always have been!
                         
          Chet smiles, shakes his head as -
                         
          Will reaches the porch. He stands close to Kate. His nerves
          clock overtime.
                         
                          WILL
           I lied and told your brother I kissed
           you. I thought it would make this
           easier.
                         
                          KATE
           Here's an idea: pretend you have a
           bomb strapped to your chest. Tick,
                          TICK -
                         
          Will closes the gap and kisses her. After a beat -
                         
                          KATE
           Is Chet watching us?
                         
                          WILL
           Probably. We should go inside. I
           promised him I'd satisfy you.
                         
          Kate laughs, leads him inside and the door shuts to -
                         
                          BLACK
           110.
                         
          CREDITS ROLL.
                         
          But they are pushed to one side of the screen, as the other
          side is filled with -
                         
          A lo-fi, 2001-style light tunnel. It deposits us in the
          furthest reaches of the galaxy, where we find -
                         
          A tanning bed. Rotating in orbit. Dwayne's voice booms and
                         REVERBERATES -
                         
                          DWAYNE
           GRAND OPENING SPECTACULARRR!
                         
          The tanning bed explodes, like a star gone supernova. From
          the light and fire and chaos...emerges a logo:
                         
                          MAJOR TAN
                         
          A bad MATCH CUT takes us to the same logo. Camera ZOOMS OUT
          unsteadily to reveal it is a banner above a strip mall
          storefront. We are watching a local commercial with
          appropriately poor production value.
                         
          INT. MAJOR TAN - DAY (LOCAL COMMERCIAL)
                         
          Dwayne walks backward down a hallway while addressing camera
          and trying not to trip -
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Here at Major Tan, our specially
           trained technicians are hard at work
           developing new technologies that
           harness the power of the sun, to
           ensure a cutting-edge tanning
           experience.
                         
          Dwayne enters a tanning room. A man in a lab coat stares
          down at a clipboard, on which a complicated scientific
          equation is written.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           How's it looking?
                         
          The man turns: it's Jay. His smiling face is speckled with
          healing burn wounds.
                         
                          JAY
           It's our most advanced tanning bed
           yet!
                         
          He gestures to a very ordinary looking tanning bed.
           111.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Hey, don't just take this scientist's
           word for it. The proof...
                         
          Dwayne snaps his fingers. A BAD SPECIAL EFFECT makes him
          disappear, then reappear with a totally orange tan.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           ...is in the tan.
                         
          We follow Dwayne back out into the hallway.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           But Major Tan isn't just about looking
           good. It's also about feeling good.
                         
          Dwayne gestures to another room. The door opens and Juicy
          saunters out in a bikini. A beat later, a RANDOM GUY exits.
                         
                          RANDOM GUY
           That "Deluxe Tan" was fantastic!
                         
          EXT. MAJOR TAN - DAY (LOCAL COMMERCIAL)
                         
          Dwayne stands outside the store.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           So come on down to Major Tan...where
           we're proud to be a family business.
                         
          PULL BACK TO REVEAL...The Major beside Dwayne. He's only
          about four feet tall now, on account of the wheelchair. But
          he's grinning like a jackal, in a POW-MIA cap.
                         
          A SUPERED LOGO appears: Military Discounts Available!
                         
          As father and son smile and wave at us -
                         
          END COMMERCIAL.

                        Experiment 208, day 20...
          
          
          INT. SCIENTIST'S LAB - DAY

          We see an early incarnation of a MACHINE (this will be the
          inner brain of the FABRICATION MACHINE). We see the
          scientist, in a white coat.
          
           We pull back to see the Scientist is playing a complicated
          MULTI-LEVEL 3-D chess game on a MULTI-LEVEL GAME BOARD with
          the MACHINE. The Scientist makes an elaborate multi-level
          move. The Machine reaches an arm out into the chess game but
          then malfunctions and strews the game everywhere.
          
          We pull back further to see the back and legs of the
          DICTATOR, with black-uniformed soldiers flanking him. The
          regime's emblem can be seen on the uniforms.
          
                                  DICTATOR
                    Useless.
          
                                  SCIENTIST
                       Please.   Give it a chance.
          
          We're on the machine, which is clicking and jerking as it
          malfunctions.
          
                                  DICTATOR (V.O.)
          One more.      That's all.
          We turns to leave. We hear the clicking of boots as the
          soldiers accompany him out.
          
          We see the scientist's dejected face as he comes towards the
          camera to turn it off.


                                                                     CUT TO:
          
          
          BLACK
          
          
          
          
                                                                     2.
          
          
          
          INT. SCIENTIST'S LAB - NIGHT
          
          The grainy footage rolls again; we see the scientist moving
          away from the camera (having just turned it on).
          
          The lab is shadowy, late at night. We see his worktable for
          the first time, covered with discarded sketches, a furiously
          filled-in journal, and pieces of failed machinery (the floor
          is also similarly littered). The TALISMAN sits on the
          worktable. Nearby is a small old-fashioned tiny little box.
          
                              SCIENTIST
                        (tired, but dictating to
                         keep the documentary
                         record complete)
                    My last possible solution....
                        (muttering to himself)
                    It must work...
          
          He gently brushes his fingers over the little box as though
          for good luck. He picks the TALISMAN up off the table. He
          moves over to insert the talisman into the port of the
          machine.
          
          His back to us, he faces the machine. We see him putting
          something over his face (but only from behind).
          
          There is a sudden FLASH OF GREEN LIGHT and the machine JOLTS,
          and then suddenly, starts up...lighting up, electricity
          crackling, parts moving in smooth coordination, etc.
          
          The scientist waits, watching. The machine continues to run.
          Its arms move smoothly, almost curiously.
          
          The scientist puts the device covering his face down and gets
          up and comes towards camera.
          
          We see the camera's POV as the scientist comes towards us:
          CLOSE on the scientist's face, which is exhausted, cheeks
          sunken, eyes wide, pupils dilated.
          
          Pull back to show the machine purring, suddenly full of a new
          sort of energy. Something new has happened.
          
          The scientist switches off the camera and:
          
                                                            CUT TO:

          INT. SCIENTIST'S LAB - A DAY LATER
          
          The machine zips through the complex 3-D chess game at
          lightning speed, checkmating the scientist in seconds as the
          Dictator watches.

          The scientist laughs fondly and pats the machine.
          
                                 DICTATOR

                      You see, it evolves.
          
          The scientist proudly gives the machine to the dictator. A
          flash goes off: someone is taking a picture O.S.
          
          The dictator exits; we hear the click of boots and see as
          much as possible of the soldiers flanking him.
          
          OUT OF SIGHT OF THE SCIENTIST,
          
          CLOSE on the machine: the dictator is gripping it with a
          nasty firmness. The machine seems to try to squirm away.
          The director's BLACK-GLOVED HAND grasps it harder.
          
           he machine, responding to the brutality, lashes an arm out
          and grabs the nearest soldier (seen from the back, we see
          only the uniform and helmeted head) by the back of his arm,
          BREAKING his ARM. The soldier falls (if possible).

          Talisman off.

          9 moves warily in the dusty, grim light, along the deserted
          RUINS of the outside streets. It is the remains of war.
          
          Pulverized HULKS of BUILDINGS, torn-open suitcases, scattered
          clothes, rusting cars and the grim debris of human
          civilization surround him.
          
          He sees a dead body slouched next to a suitcase in the front
          seat of a car.
          
          Banners hang on the buildings with a three prong symbol on
          them.
          
           achines lie deserted on the sides of roads.
          
          Distracted by the spectacle, 9 stumbles and lands on a ragged
          old flyer: REVOLT!    He looks back at the War Machines and
          Dictator flags.    He sees a vandalized poster of what appears
          to be a dictator/leader.
          
          9 looks around him, trying to piece together what happened.
          Suddenly there is a clanking sound in front of him.
          
          9 sees a light flicker on in the shattered hulk of a war
          Machine.
          
           LOSE on 9 as the light crosses his face.
          
          Scared, he ducks behind a huge piece of debris.   9 grabs a
          piece of metal lying in front of him.
          
          The shadow moves closer, 9 shakes nervously. The figure
          emerges with spear in hand and 9 swings the weapon at him
          with all his might.
          
          9 hits him square in the chest. It is another ragdoll: 2. 2
          is propelled backwards and falls to the ground on the debris
          behind him. 9 quickly tries to hide.

                               2
          speaking with urgency to 9.
          
          
                        (firmly, kindly, almost
                         eagerly; like trying to
                         soothe a wild animal)
                    Wait... I am a friend.

                    Friend... I am a friend.
          
          9 now sees he has hit a ragdoll, similar to himself. He
          hesitates, not sure what to make of this. 2 extends his
          hand, calmly, eagerly. 9 hesitates again, then, still timid,
          but showing a little bravery, drops his weapon and goes to
          help 2 up.
          
          We see that 2 is much older, much more decrepit, much more
          primitively constructed: he is made from patchwork bits of
          OLD LEATHER SHOES. A SHOELACE stitches up his front and is
          tied in a bow at his neck. Bits of leather FRAY off him.
          His feet are primitive small HINGES. Half of a pair of
          eyeglasses, like an enormous MONOCLE, is attached to 2's hat.
          
          9 helps straighten 2's monocle. 2 smiles at him. We see
          that 2 is like a wise mentor, a kindly professor with a
          contagious eagerness and imaginativeness.
          
          2 peers eagerly at 9.   He circles 9 and spots the number on
          his back.

                    Yes... yes... I always thought
                    there'd be one more.
          
          He nods and smiles. He extends his hand to shake 9's hand.
          While doing this, he takes 9's hand and studies it, nodding
          with eager excitement. We see that 9's hand is more
          sophisticated than 2's.

          2 turns slightly, and 9 sees his number and tries to say it.
          But no sound comes out of his mouth.
          
            looks at him, nodding, again, the kind mentor. He's
          interested, observing without judging; curious, kindly and
          ready to help.

          With a friendly, disarming smile, he taps 9's zipper. 9
          unzips himself and 2 peers in. 2 looks up, happy that he can
          help.

                      Yes, yes...
          
          2 looks around nervously and hurries over to his roller-skate
          cart covered with detritus - odds and ends, a broken china
          doll.
          
                                2 (CONT'D)
                      ...come with me.

          2 finds the china doll.

                      Here!
          
          As 2 rummages through the chest of the china doll 9 picks up
          a bullet casing from 2's cart and starts tapping it. 2 turns
          with the doll's voice box in his hand.

                      No! Stop!
          
          2 eases the bullet away from 9, then smiles gently at 9,
          EXPLAINING:

                      better left where they lie.
          
           e puts the bullet to one side and kneels, prying into 9's
          chest. 2 begins to connect the doll's voice box.

                    But if you know where to look,
                    these ruins are full of riches.
          
          2 concentrates, a look of pleasure on his face as he twists a
          few more wires. Static and unclear sound come out at first,
          but as 2 tunes the voice further...
          
                              9
                        (as his voice is "tuned
                         in".. starting with pure
                         static, then slowly
                         moving into a voice)

                    ...almost there...
          
          9 gets a little panicky look on his face at the strange
          sounds coming out of him. 2 puts a calm hand on his
          shoulder. 9 calms down and tries again.
          
                               9
                    Friend?   Friend?

                    No. There are others.
          
            and 2 stare at each other. 9 looks at 2 in wonderment,
          then reaches out and touches 2's chest where he hit it.
          
          2 beams at 9, happy 9 can speak, happy he was able to help,
          and happy that 9, with his first words, is concerned about
          others.
          
            glow beams from within 9's chest.   2 stares.   9 removes the
          TALISMAN from his chest.
          
          2 has a big reaction--he draws his breath in and looks at it
          in ASTONISHMENT.

          2 points forcefully to an old rusted can.
          
          2 runs into the can.
              stands, ready to attack.
          
          9 watches 2, wondering what is coming. Then from behind him,
          a large claw of a mechanical figure settles softly next to
          9's can. He tries to call out to 2...
          
          And from behind 2 enters--
          
          A HIDEOUS CAT BEAST.
          
           t is a nail and razor-studded predatory Machine with a cat
          skull-shaped head, its body laced with bones, nails and
          razors. 9 now understands 2 was trying to protect him.
          
            GASPS as he turns and sees it. The Cat Beast lets out a
          roar and claws at 2, KNOCKING him over and losing his spear.
          
              looks on with horror.

          2 attempts to reach for his spear but the Beast holds him
          down with its razor-sharp feet.
          
          The Beast is attracted to the Talisman. It picks it up with
          one of its jagged claws and looks at it quizzically.
          
            cringes.    His movement makes his hiding place teeter,
          creaking.
          
           he Cat Beast WHIRLS at the sound. Picking up 2's struggling
          body, the Cat Beast stalks towards the noise, right up to 9's
          hiding place, sniffing through its hollow nostrils. 9
          cringes in terror. The Cat Beast probes with one of his
          claws INTO the tin can. 9 recoils. The claws do not find
          him and retreat. 9 is relieved.
          
          A beat, then:
          
          9 feels himself violently LIFTED UP and SMASHED.
          
          We see the Cat Beast has picked up the entire tin can and is
          smashing it to get at what's inside it.   Failing, it hurls
          the tin can aside.
          
          9 is almost knocked out. Trying to stay conscious, he
          struggles towards the entrance of the can.
          
           is POV: through his haze and through the broken edges of the
          opening to the can, he sees the Cat Beast GRAB the Talisman
          and the struggling 2 in his sharp-toothed mouth, and
          disappearing into the smoky mist.
          
          9 can just make out, in the distance, the silhouettes of

          as though fresh.

          He turns away, grief-stricken.
          
                                  (O.S.)
                      Keeping secrets from me, I see.
          
          Another RAGDOLL pushes into the workroom. This is a bigger
          ragdoll, the most primitive one we have seen. He has
          primitive wooden hinges for feet. He is very frayed and
          patched together. The number 1 is painted on his back.
          
              and 9 whirl around.       5 CRINGES.
          
                                5
                      I... I was coming to tell you...
          
          1 carries himself with authority. He wears a red cloak, and
          a strange mother of pearl and wire hat bound together as an
          almost papal-like headpiece, and carries a staff made from an
          old gear, with a bell attached.
          
            pulls at 9 with his staff, displaying the number on his
          back.
          
                                1
                       hat's this?
          
            turns and glares at 5 like a general glaring at a new
          private, expecting an explanation for a misdeed. 5 cringes
          back, obviously intimidated by 1.
          
                                 5
                       ... I found him.... in the
                      emptiness.   He saw--
          
          1 HOOKS 5 by the neck with his staff, cutting off his speech.

                               5
                    I saw him from the watchtower and I
                    thought...
          
          
                     ou'll lead The Beast straight back
                    to us! How many times have I told
                    you?
          
          
                    The Beast--that's what took 2!   If
                    we hurry we could save him--
          
                               1
                        (CURTLY)
                    If the Beast took him, that's the
                    end of it.
          
                              9
                    But he was still alive--
          
          5 turns with sudden hope to 9.   2 might still be alive?
          
                              1
                    No, we have RULES.
          
          1 smashes his staff against the ground.
          
          Immediately, a knife comes through the curtain revealing
          another RAGDOLL: a large ragdoll, with the number "8" on his
          arm.
          
                                (CONT'D)
                        (TO 8)
                    Our new guest seems confused.
                        (condescendingly, to 9)
                    Perhaps I can help you achieve some
                    clarity.
          
          8 is very large, and designed for great strength. He is
          almost as evolved in his design as 9, but his design favors
          primarily brute force.
          
          He has armored himself with curved pieces of tin and metal.
          He carries the blade of a large kitchen knife, with a nail he
          has attached for a handle. On his back he has slung another
          knife--half of a scissors; the scissors handle loops up above
          his head.

          1 leaves. 8 taps his knife in his hand and motions for 9 and
          5 to follow.  They follow.

                        (whispering, hopefully)
                    He was still alive? Really?

                    I think so--
          
          8 looms forward threateningly.
          
                               8
                    Hmmmph!
          
          5 quickly stops talking.   9, following his lead, stops
          talking also.
          
          The group gets into a bucket-like device.   8 pushes 9 hard
          into the bucket.
          
            NODS commandingly to 8. 8 begins to crank a rope that
          lifts them up. 5 gestures to 9 to hold on.
          9
            braces himself as 8 pulls them up into a tall tower. He
          steals a glance at 1. 1 frowns. 9 tries to smile.
          
           hey pass an old plane outside that has crash-landed in to
          the Cathedral.
          
          On the side wall is a round, multi-colored stained glass
          window. Shafts of different colored sunlight flicker
          through.
          
           he bucket moves past two large church bells into--
          
          ...the inside of a CLOCK TOWER of a once-magnificent

          frantically trying to escape the explosions BURSTING around
          them. 7 appears with 3 and 4. We get the sense that 7 is
          the reckless one, the only one determined to SCOUT AROUND and
          see what's out there.

          is clearly the leader, to see what to do next. 1 decides: he
          points forward, and they all run a few feet while underneath
          the helmet.
          
          A plane crashes in the background, causing 5 to fall behind
          (he has both eyes).

          weapons.
          
          A RESISTANCE FIGHTER throws a Molotov cocktail at one of the
          Machines. It turns and SHOOTS a round of gunfire.
          
          A MUSTARD GAS BOMB is launched from the top of the Machine.
          It heads straight at 5 but he runs and gets KNOCKED to the
          ground, barely missing it.

           he bomb lets out a yellow CLOUD that envelops the area and
          KILLS PLANTS ON CONTACT.

          But, again, brave and slightly reckless, she runs through the
          yellow cloud to help him. She brings him back to the group.
          His left eye is damaged. The others cower. 2, the gentle
          mentor of the group, puts a comforting hand on 5's damaged
          eye. 7, always the scout, brave and fearless, points off to
          the right, and addresses 1.   She knows what's out there;

          his head that only he experiences. He has a SMALL SKELETON

          spyglass points out of a hole in the wall. A half-drawn map
          is pinned up next to the spyglass. Everything is pieced
          together from the sorts of bits and pieces we saw 2
          scavenging. Around the space, we also see more bits and

          9 looks up and 5 follows his gaze to 2's STAFF stuck in a
          pile of rubble atop a hill.

          5 hurries up the hill. 9 follows him. 5 turns to FIND 2's
          hat lying in the dirt. He bends down to pick it up, brushing
          the dust off the top. 5 looks sadly at 2's broken hat.

                           (SIMPLY)
                       He looked out for me.    He taught
                       me.
          
           he spoon-light falls off.      5's face is filled with grief.

                       Why was he out here alone?
          
          He slumps.    9 puts his hand on 5's shoulder, reassuring him.
          
                                 9
                       We can still find him.
          
           e stands up, determinedly. 5 hesitates, but then, his face
          filling with hope, gets up too. 5 puts 2's hat on his
          quiver. 9 offers 2's staff to 5 but 5 gestures to 9 for him
          to hold it.
          
          They continue on, through the debris and devastation.     A
          storm is starting to come up. The wind howls loudly.

                       Yes. The ones we're not supposed
                       to ask.
          
          They exchange a look. This is the first time 5 has said
          something to actually challenge 1's rules. 9 notices this
          and nods.

          The wind howls louder. 5 looks at his map uncertainly and
          tries to keep leading them forward.
          
          They come to a field full of trip mines and dangerous tank
          trap pits.   A parachute blows in the wind on a tree branch.
          
          5 turns the map one way and the other with growing panic.
          
                              9
                     here are we?

                    I don't know...
          
          As he turns the map to look at it, the wind picks up and
          blows the map out of 5's hands. It blows away into the
          distance and gets stuck on a pole.
          
          5 reaches after it desperately but can't retrieve it.      He
          looks in despair at 9.
          
                                    (CONT'D)
                    It's no use.      We should go back!
          
          
                    We can't.
          
          9 looks around bravely, then points over towards a trench.
          
                                9 (CONT'D)
                    There.
          
          They head over to the trench.      They now see a huge FOOTPRINT
          OF THE BEAST.
          
          They inspect the footprints. 9 moves bravely towards the
          trench entrance. 5 resists, afraid.
          
          
                    No... it's too dark.
          
          9 looks around.
          
                              9
                    We can use that.

          9 is pointing to the lightbulb.
          
            can't help himself. He pulls the lightbulb out, pulls out
          a battery and electrical wire from his chest, winds the wire
          around the battery and places it inside the hat.
          
          They screw the lightbulb and it LIGHTS UP.    5 can't help

          smiling at 9.
          
            unwinds the wire holding the blade on 2's staff. He places
          2's hat on the end of 2's staff and secures it with the

                      2 will be so impressed!

          has happened to 2.

                      Yes. He will.
          
          9 is conveying with his simple words that he believes 2 IS
          still alive and he WILL be impressed when he sees the
          lightstaff.
          
          9 shines the light to gesture "this way."
          
          5 smiles tremulously at 9, almost more grateful for his
          sympathy and support than necessarily believing him. He
          follows 9 to the mouth of the trench.
          
          The camera pans over to reveal catlike scratchmarks on a side
          wall indicating this is the same trench we saw the Cat Beast
          travel through earlier.

          both hands on the lightstaff and enters the trench. 5 takes

          after them.
          
          9 gets cornered but swipes the Beast and manages to escape.
          9 jumps a heap of debris but stumbles. 5 and 2 pull him up
          to higher ground.
          
              shoots his crossbow at the Cat Beast, shattering his eye.
          
          2 manages to hide in a tube.
          
          9 and 5 run away but get stuck at the end of a table.
          
          The Cat Beast slashes his claw at them.

          They climb onto another piece of debris, only to encounter
          the Cat Beast, now in front of them.
          
           he Cat Beast slashes a claw out and knocks them over.    The
          Cat Beast moves closer and closer. They are doomed.
          
           uddenly there is a strange rhythmic moaning sound.   The Cat
          Beast turns, distracted.
          
          We pan over and see a mysterious creature that seems to be
          half ragdoll, half bird, with a bird-skull head swinging a
          weapon over its head.   THIS IS 7. 7 releases the weapon--a
          strap of leather with weighted shot at either end. The
          weapon flies through the air with a low whooshing sound and
          strikes the Cat Beast, entangling it.
          
          7, 5, and 9 now charge the Cat Beast. 5 shoots his crossbow,
          entangling the Beast's paw and hobbling it. 9 and 2 both
          LURE THE CAT BEAST IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS, deliberately
          goading and further causing it to become entangled in the
          machinery.   7 now leaps up over the Beast and brings the
          full weight of her spear down on the Cat Beast's neck. The
          head of the Beast comes off and lands at their feet.
          7
              now pulls off her bird-skull helmet.
          
                                5

                      to join the fight.
          
           he hands 5's map back to him.
          
          9 comes over with her shield (lost during the fight).    7
          looks 9 over.

          They move towards her but she turns and looks at 9.     2 and 5
          nod proudly towards 9. 7 nods.
          
           hey all look at the fallen Cat Beast.

          They all turn to leave. 5 and 7 support 2 on either side of
          him, helping 2 along.   9 hangs back to look at the machine
          again, and suddenly sees the TALISMAN, lying on the floor.
          
          5, 7, and 2 have continued on without him and do not see him
          as he picks it up.
          
            looks at the strange object with ENORMOUS CURIOSITY. He
          turns it and see the RUNES on the side of it. He turns and
          inspects it closely.   He turns and discovers, on the
          machine, a PORT with the SAME RUNES.
          
          
                        (blurting out)
                    Look!
          
          The others now turn to see him. They see him holding the
          talisman close to the machine's port... about to
          experimentally put the talisman INTO the port.
          
                                  2
                    No!   Stop!       NO!
          
          2 tries to break free and stagger towards him but it is too
          late. 9 puts the talisman into the port.
          
           othing happens for a moment.
          
          Then suddenly, horribly, the ground begins to SHAKE.

          A mechanical ARM emerges and PINS 7, 9, and 5.
          
          As dust and debris rain down, we see one hideous RED EYE
          begin to come up.
          
           s 2 tries to scramble to safety, the other three ragdolls,
          pinned by the mechanical arm, stare in horror. We see that
          the "pile of Machinery" has risen to reassemble into an
          monstrous, towering FABRICATION MACHINE attached to the
          ceiling of the building.
          
          It is enormous, a spherical shape with a dozen folded
          appendages, each with different fabrication tools at the end
          of its long spindly robotic arms.
          
          2 tries to crawl away but the Machine grabs him with his
          robotic arm.
          T
           he Machine points the talisman towards 2 and it OPENS up to
          a sparking green glow. 2 struggles in the Machine's claw but
          the strange green energy SHOOTS directly into 2's mouth and
          eyes, painfully  his soul.
          
           NGLE on 2 as his soul is being taken.
          
          2 slumps over, his LIFELESS CARCASS smoking in the grip of
          the Machine.
          
           NGLE on the green glow as it PASSES into the machine. The
          sound has drawn its attention. The Machine turns towards
          them and grabs at them with its enormous claw. 9, 5, and 7
          turn and flee.
          
          The Fabrication Machine's arms chase after them. 5 shoots
          his grappling hook onto a switch. 9 and 7 grab onto him.
          
          Frantically working together, the three of them manage to
          escape the Machine's horrifying arms. [  Important to make
          sure the Machine is understood to be tethered to the
          Factory.]
          
          They see in the distance a pipe that leads out.
          
          In the Machine's RED POV, they run into it just as the
          Machine's arm is behind them but can't fit into the hole.

                    We need you--we awakened something--
          
          9 interrupts her to take full responsibility for the mistake.
          
                              9
                    I awakened something.   In the
                    factory.   Something terrible...
          
          3 and 4 look at each other WITH HORROR. They begin to
          chatter feverishly and with great distress.
          
           hey beam an image of THE FABRICATION MACHINE on the wall.
          
          5 and 9 lean forward, startled.

                              7
                    What is it?
          
          3 and 4 now show:
          
            NEWSPAPER PHOTOGRAPH of the Scientist and the Machine
          (which we recognize from before, in the prologue, when the
          Scientist gave the machine to the Dictator and we saw the
          FLASH of the flashbulb).
          
          We now push into the photo to a CLOSE UP on the machine.

           -SHAKY, HAND-HELD AMATEUR footage showing the GAS KILLING

                      What have I done?

                    The thing!       Show them.
          
          9 quickly sketches out a drawing of the TALISMAN and shows it
          to the twins.
          
          3 and 4 chatter, trying to analyze and catalogue the drawing
          of the Talisman. They shake their heads: they don't
          recognize it.
          
           eeing it as a drawing, 5 is startled.
          
                              5 (CONT'D)
                    Wait! 6... he always draws that.
                      used to keep the drawings... with
                    his notes....
          
          9 looks at 5.
          
          
                    The drawings... would they still be
                    there? In 2's old workshop?
          
                                 5
                    Yes.
                        (slightly embarrassed)
                    I saved everything.
          
          
                     hen we'll go back.       Perhaps the
                    answer is there.
          
          5 looks alarmed and looks over at 7.      7 shakes her head.
                               7
          
                    I think the answer is there.
          
          She points out towards the factory and strides off,
          dauntless, fine, and proud. The twins chatter unhappily,
          beaming flickering lights to each other.
          
          9 looks at 5.    5 nods and they set off in the other
          direction.

          drawings. The pages are dotted with 2's annotations and
          drawings; he was obviously trying to figure out why 6 kept
          imagining this object and what it meant.
          
            and 9 bend over the drawings. They are unable to see
          clearly in the murky darkness. 9 looks around warily, then

          outside. 1 starts to back away.

          The WINGED BEAST tail crashes through the stained glass
          window and breaks into the floor right next to 9.
          
                                                                      42.

          5, 6, 8 and 9 huddle together. Suddenly the Winged Beast
          comes crashing in the window behind them, knocking over the
          thurible and splashing hot coals all over the floor.

          5, 6, 8 and 9 see the Winged Beast emerge from the smoke
          pouring out of the upset thurible.
          
          The Winged Beast SHRIEKS at them. It catches its foot on the
          runner leading up to 1's empty throne. The hymnboard/
          calendar topples away to reveal 1 hiding behind it. 1
          instinctively clutches his staff causing the bell at the top
          of the staff to RING and attracting the Winged Beast's
          attention.
          1
            flees. 8 charges the Beast but it SCYTHES its wing towards
          him and knocks 8 across the floor. 8 slides across the floor
          to 1, who stands next to 6's picture of the Cat Beast.
          
          1 pushed the picture of the Cat Beast away to reveal a HIDDEN
          PASSAGEWAY. 1 runs away as 8 looks at the others for a brief
          moment before also running away.
          
          The Winged Beast turns its attention to 9, 5, and 6. The
          ragdolls run for the bucket and bell-ropes, but 9 trips. The
          Winged Beast advances towards him.   5 reaches out to 9.  9
          gestures to him to continue without him.
          
          As 9 recovers himself and makes a break for the bucket, 5
          starts to lower the bucket down. Just as the Winged Beast is
          about to catch up with him, 9 LEAPS down the shaft and lands
          in the bucket with 5 and 6.
          
          Angrily, the Beast lashes its harpoon tail down at them,
          piercing the bottom of the bucket. The bucket rocks and 6 is
          sent FLYING OUT but 5 CATCHES him in the nick of time.

          The Winged Beast starts reeling its harpoon tail in. Jerking
          back and forth, the bucket ascends, drawing the ragdolls
          closer and closer to the Beast.
          
          9 spots a SMALL LEDGE next to a stained glass window.
          
          He opens the side of the bucket and gestures that they should
          jump.
          
          The others hesitate, but then 9, 6, and 5 jump out of the
          bucket onto a swinging rope, and onto the ledge. The Winged
          Beast plummets down the shaft after them.

          The ragdolls squeeze through a small crack in the stained
          glass emerging onto a ledge overlooking the Cathedral's roof.
          
          9 sees 1 and 8 running across the roof and points to 5 and 6
          to look down there. Down on the roof, 1 and 8 see 5, 6, and
          9. 1 pushes past 8 and runs farther out, towards the front
          of the Cathedral. 8 follows.
          S
           uddenly, the Winged Beast SMASHES through the glass behind
          them. It struggles to get through the window but can't quite
          fit.
          
          6 is very vulnerable out there.
          
          9 turns to 5.
          
                                9
                      Take him inside.
          
              now climbs out on the gargoyle purposefully.
          
          The Winged Beast FLIES UP into the air, circling lazily.    1
          and 8, running on the top of the roof, are very exposed.
          Hawklike, the Winged Beast sails towards them.
          
          8 steps up to defend 1. He flips his salt-shaker helmet down
          over his face as armor, pulls out his scissor knife and
          stands his ground... waiting... waiting for the Winged Beast
          to soar in closer...
          
          And then, at the last possible moment, he HURLS his scissor
          knife at the Winged Beast. It flies through the air and
          catches in the Beast's propeller.
          
          Knocked off balance, the Beast swoops down. 1 ducks out of
          the way but it knocks 8 off his feet. 8 slides down the
          sloped edge of the roof, towards GAPING HOLE.

          Just as 8 is about to fall into the hole, he catches on to
          the edge. His other blade plummets through the hole as he
          hangs, desperately... his grip SLIPPING...
          
          9 catches up to where 1 is.

          The Winged Beast circles around and sets its harpoon tail to
          shoot. 1 squints into the sun as the Winged Beast, backlit,
          swoops down towards them. He sees a glare come from the tin
          roof. 9 gets an idea.    He gestures to 1 to help him. 1
          scowls, but has no alternative but to help him.
          
          9 peels back a piece of the roof, with 1 helping him.   The

           he Beast flinches just as it FIRES its harpoon tail at them.
          Blinded by the glare, it MISSES and almost hits 8.
          
          The harpoon imbeds itself into a rafter inside the Cathedral.

          8 falls onto and then slides down the harpoon's line,

          5 and 6. 8's weight on the harpoon's line has pulled it more
          and more taut...
          
          The Winged Beast is pulled hard into the roof and slides
          down, knocking into 1 and 9.
          
          1 and 9 PLUNGE into the Cathedral and onto the plane wing,
          where 8 catches them in midair before they hit the wing.

          The Winged Beast plummets after them onto the wing. It picks
          itself up, spots the cowering ragdolls, and opens up his
          bladed beak screaming.
          
          The Winged Beast starts to charge them when suddenly--
          
          7 DROPS DOWN from a high parapet and leaps onto the Winged
          Beast's neck.
          
              and 8 stare in surprise.   9 stares in delight and relief.

                      7?
          
           mmediately, the beast throws her off towards the others.
          She'd dropped her spear; she goes to pick it up and
          
           PFFFFFFT> immediately, her leg is IMPALED by the Winged
          Beast, which has fired its harpoon. She is impaled next to
          the guys.

                      I thought you might need some help.
          
          But as she speaks, the Beast begins to reel her in.       She
          fights viciously.
          
              jumps and grabs on to 7 as she's being pulled away.

                      My spear!
          
            grabs her forked spear and hands it to her. She grabs her
          forked spear and stabs it into the plane.   The harpoon's
          cable is pulled taut 9
                               between her leg and the Winged Beast.
          
          
                          (yelling to the others)
                      The cable! Cut it!
          
          8 runs to recover the blade that slipped from his grasp as he
          slid down the roof, then runs over and SLICES with all his
          brute force through the cable. The cable flies up in the air
          and WRAPS itself around the propeller on the end of the wing.
          
          The Winged Beast jerks back, towards the propeller, causing
          the whole wing of the plane to tilt, and the ragdolls to
          slide. 5 and 6 tumble into the plane's engine room.

          7 clutches her staff. 9 slides by her and grabs on to the
          harpoon, still lodged in her leg.
          
          9's staff slides by, and 9 catches it just before it falls
          off the wing. As 8 climbs up onto the same buttress fragment
          that 7's spear is lodged in, 1 slides down the wing, past 9.

          1 grabs 9's staff. Dangling, he sees that the Winged Beast
          is close behind, snapping at him with its beak.
          
          9 sees 5 and 6 in the engine room.

          6 nods. 5 points to the wires. 5 and 6 gather wires and set
          to work. They ZAP the propeller to life and it GROANS... then
          whines into motion as it starts taking up the power it had
          generated. It goes faster... faster...
          
          Even as the Beast is slowly drawn towards the propeller, it
          struggles forward and grabs 1's cape in its beak.
          
          As the Winged Beast pulls 1 closer, 9 strains to hang on to
          1, and 7 strains with the added weight on the harpoon
          sticking out of her wounded leg.

          1 glares furiously, hesitates, then undoes the clasp. The
          Winged Beast falls backwards down the wing, DIRECTLY INTO THE
          DEADLY BLADES.
          
          It is instantly shredded.

           fter the clasp is released, 1 has meanwhile recoiled into
          9's arms. There is a brief moment of awkwardness as 1 and 9

          1 begins to climb up the side of the wing, using dangling 9
          and 7 as a ladder.
          
          Perched on top of 7's staff, 1 reaches up for 8, who is
          crouched on the edge of the buttress. He grabs 8's hand,
          gesturing imperiously to 8 to pull him up.
          9
            looks at 7 urgently, nodding to her. She gets it
          immediately and grabs 1's leg, stopping him.

                       ourselves!
          
          The plane teeters down to a 90 degree angle. 5 and 6 look up
          at the rest of the ragdolls from farther down the wing. 5 is
          concerned and almost panicked. 6 is almost zen-peaceful, as
          though he can foresee it will be all right.
          
              looks around and sees the rope tied around 7's waist.

                       Your rope.
          
          7 throws it down to 9 who ties it to his own waist. The plane
          tilts... it's hanging even more precariously now... about to
          fall out of the side of the Cathedral entirely...
          
          9 suddenly jumps down into the flames just as the plane
          starts to fall. 7 shouts with stress.
          
          The plane EXPLODES as it hits the ground, smoke rising from
          the crash. The rope pulls taut, and after the smoke settles
          we can see 9 dangling with 5 and 6.
          
          8 pulls the hanging chain of ragdolls up and onto the
          buttress fragment.

          up... towards the smouldering clock tower...

          The Seamstress has sewed the carcass of "2" into her tail in
          order to lure and mesmerize the ragdolls. She emits a
          GLOWING LIGHT through 2's vacant eye sockets.

            t the very last moment, they manage TO CUT 1 LOOSE. But the
          seamstress suddenly darts one of her claws out, GRABS 7, and
          SLITHERS OFF out through the library [ALT: through part of a
          drainpipe in the bottom of the fountain] with 8 still
          attached to her belly and disappears.

          following the light and keeps moving down, arriving at the
          ground where we now see, in the darkness--
          
          THE RAGDOLLS. They huddle behind an oil pipe waiting for the
          Seeker Drone to pass. 1 is weak, but is supported by 5, who
          has been patching him, and is just finishing up, pulling the
          last thread out of the patch he's sewn onto 1. 1 is
          regaining his strength. The twins huddle behind 6.
          
            looks out past the pumping derricks and sees AN ENTRANCE TO
          A COAL CHUTE.

              scowls.   5 nods, proudly taking the responsibility.
          
              darts purposefully towards the factory.
          
            looks around keenly, looking up for seeker drones, then
          runs out from cover, over to a huge barrel that lies half
          buried in the scorched earth.    A painting of the Dictator's
          symbol is stenciled on the side.
          
          He taps on the front. It is FULL. He looks up in the air at
          the seeker drones. They haven't seen him.
          
          We gestures to the others.
           e see the barrel is on top of a small hill that leads down
          to coal car tracks. The tracks lead to the open mouth of a
          coal chute that feeds into the factory.
          
          5 sees a bent spoon on the ground. He smiles, remembering 2
          and his ingenuity, and picks it up. He hands it to 1.

          With confidence now, he looks around. He sees a splintered
          pile of wood planks, the remains of a wooden derrick
          platform. He looks at the others and gestures to the wood.

          INT. FACTORY - SAME TIME
          
          9 darts from hiding place to hiding place inside the darkened
          factory, moving towards the Fabrication Machine.
          
          He spots the half-blinded Seamstress and watches in HORROR as
          he sees that the Seamstress is giving 8 up to the Fabrication
          Machine. 9 is too late to do anything to stop the Machine
          from sucking 8's soul.
          
           here is a bright GREEN GLOW as 8's soul is sucked, and in
          the sudden illumination, 9 sees 7. She is sewn into the
          Seamstress--but is still alive!
          
           NGLE on 9 as he realizes she is still alive and he can still
          rescue her! From his hiding place he looks around for a way
          to rescue her. He inspects the machinery near him. He sees
          a LEVER and GEARS. He looks at his LIGHTSTAFF. He then
          spots a remnant of the FABRIC used to create the Winged
          Beast. We see he is formulating a plan. He darts his hand
          out to drag the fabric towards him.
          
           NGLE on the Fabrication Machine as it begins to power back
          up after taking 8's soul.
          
           NGLE on the Seamstress. She turns to get 7, and give her to
          the Fabrication Machine. We see the TERROR and DEFIANT FURY
          in 7's eyes, but she is immobilized and can do nothing.
          
          Suddenly the Seamstress hears a SOUND.   She whips around.
          P
           OV through the Seamstress's damaged eye: a MOVEMENT in the
          shadows.
          
           he Seamstress, distracted from her morbid mission with 7,
          slithers towards the movement.
          
          In the shadow we see a RAGDOLL with GLOWING EYES. 7 sees
          this and registers recognition, relief, and also TERROR at
          what will be 9's fate. But she is unable to move or speak
          and now, just as 9 could only watch 8's soul being sucked
          out, 7 can only helplessly watch as the Seamstress slithers
          closer and closer to its prey. We see the misery on 7's
          face.
          
          The seamstress raises her needles and STRIKES the ragdoll,
          sewing wildly.

          The ragdoll SWINGS OUT from a string attached to a lever.
          The lever now moves down (because of the weight of the
          ragdoll) and SWITCHES on machinery. Gears start to turn and
          we see the ragdoll is attached and begins to drag the trapped
          seamstress in, arms first.
          
           he gears CRUNCH the ragdoll. 7 FLINCHES... but then her
          expression turns to amazement as she suddenly sees it is not
          a ragdoll at all but is 9'S LIGHT-STAFF DRESSED IN FABRIC.
          Instinctively, she looks up, a sudden hopeful look on her
          face... just as
          
          9 SWINGS IN and lands on the SEAMSTRESS, tearing a hole in
          her back. He slides down the length of her body, FREEING 7.
          
          7 and 9 fall to the ground as the gears now CRUSH THE
          SEAMSTRESS.

          5, 1, 6, and the twins crouch behind the barrel. We see they
          have built two paths of wooden boards leading down to the
          entrance of the coal chute, have dug a trench under the
          barrel, and have placed a long bar of metal beneath the
          barrel.

                        (hoarse whisper)
                    PULL!
          
          They all pull down with all their weight. The barrel lifts
          and teeters, then tips and RACES DOWN THE HILL. At the
          bottom, it launches off the boards, spinning into the air and
          landing on the rails to the coal chute with a sparking crash.
          
           he ragdolls race down after it.
          
          The barrel rolls and comes to a stop right at the mouth of
          the coal chute.

          1 goes to sit down and rest, sitting on a brick. 5 heads
          over towards the others. But 9, seeing 1's contemplative
          mood, stops next to 1. 1 looks up at him.

                      haven't I?
          
          9 looks at 1, not sure how to respond. 1 now also sees 2's
          old staff that 9 is still holding onto.
          
          He looks over at 9.

                      I lost sight... of many things.
          
           e looks at 9 as though to beg his forgiveness.    9 sits down
          next to him.
          
          
                      We've both made mistakes.

          They look at each other for a beat, then look over to the
          others, relaxing together on the Victrola.
          
            holds out his hand to 1. 1 gives 9 his hand and 9 helps
          him up. As 1 stands, his heavy headpiece falls off and
          shatters.
          
            looks in horror.    But 1 just looks at it, shrugging and
          slightly smiling.

                      It was always so heavy.
          
          1 smiles.
          H
           e now runs his hand over his head, which we now see has a
          funny looking pony-tail like protuberance.   9 hesitates,
          then can't help CHUCKLING. 1 sees him, then starts to LAUGH
          as well.
          
          9 and 1 go over together to the Victrola. 7 notices as 9
          helps 1 climb up on the Victrola and starts to celebrate.
          
          9 joins 7 near the needle and 6 sits on the crank as it spins
          around. Everyone is enjoying the music.

          5 discovers a trove of records (enormous in scale compared to

          He picks one out.
          
          But it rolls away from him.  It rolls towards the hill and
          then down the hill. 5 runs after it.

          slightly.

          --the enormous Fabrication Machine, RISES UP, free of the
          factory, TOWERING over him like a giant monster.

          apparition...
          
          They leap off the spinning Victrola, hitting the needle and
          the music SCRATCHES TO A HALT.

          5 faces the Machine as the green of the TALISMAN shoots out
          at him, sucking his soul into its portal. The Machine's eye
          turns green showing it has absorbed the soul, then back to
          glowing red.

          The Machine again SHAKES and then seems momentarily paralyzed
          as it ingests the soul, giving the ragdolls a moment to flee,
          scrambling, desperately trying to get up the hill and escape.
          1 looks over to the bridge. His general's instincts kick
          back in.

          The Fabrication Machine tries to back up on the bridge but
          ends up getting caught in the beams, which form a cage around
          him. The other ragdolls yell to 6 from the other side of the
          bridge.
          
          The Fabrication Machine brings 6 up to its eye.

          He looks up and climbs up onto the table.
          
           e sees the machine that he fell out of.      He sees diagrams.
          
          He sees a journal, with drawings and thoughts. The drawings
          include: the original machine... the talisman... sketches of
          the dolls... the diagram that we saw in the Library
          manuscript...
          
           e looks further and sees a strip of film. Curiously, he
          picks it up, and now sees it's feeding into a rickety old
          movie projector which now TURNS ON and we see --

          SEQUENCE [It can be the exact same footage, or can be
          slightly altered if necessary for our uses here; if we still
          want to hear the radio it should be mixed in very low, so we
          are aware of it but it doesn't interfere with the scientist's
          dialogue. This is constructed so the scientist can be in
          V.O. only until the end, but if possible we can also see the
          back of the scientist in the first few pieces of footage].

          WAS ADDRESSING THE DOLLS.

          machine, putting the finishing touches on 9... brushing his
          hand across the little box...
          
          WE PULL OUT of the footage to see 9, looking in astonishment
          at the flickering footage.
          
          9 looks over at the little box in the scientist's hand in the
          footage, and suddenly

          9 goes into a startling FLASHBACK:

          the scientist, clutching the little box, from the front as
          the scientist approaches him, a look of endless love on his
          weakened, haggard face.

          The scientist puts the strange face mask on and 9's POV is
          suffused with a GREEN GLOW.   The talisman clicks shut, the
          soul transfer completed. We hear the scientist fall to the
          ground, his soul depleted.
          
           ACK TO PRESENT TIME:
          
          9 comes out of his vision. He looks over the side of the
          table at the dead scientist.
          
              walks to the scientist and stares at the dead man.

          He reaches out to the skeletal hand clutching the box, then
          simply touches the Scientist's hand, tenderly. He looks up,
          a new, resolute look in his eyes.

            and the twins look at him in awe and surprise.   1 seems
          strangely unmoved.

                    That's why the machine is hunting
                    us. It was warped, reprogrammed to
                    hunt humanity. It, and the
                    machines it made, killed
                    everything. Except us.
          
          They stare at him.
          
                              9 (CONT'D)
                    We're all that remains.
          
          Suddenly the ground starts to shake. We hear the machine
          approaching. 1, 7, and the twins run to the missile.
          
                                9 (CONT'D)
                    No!    Don't destroy it!
          
          
                    What? It's hunting us! It'll
                    never stop! You said it yourself!
          
                             9
                    No. First we have to get them
                    back.
          
                              7
                    It's impossible!
          
          She continues loading the missile with 1.
          
                                9
                    It isn't.    I have an idea.
          
                              1
                    Enough of your ideas!      We need to
                    load the weapon!

          The Fabrication Machine appears from BEHIND THE CANNON. The
          ragdolls are CAUGHT OFF GUARD and scramble to get away just
          as its claw SMASHES down, DEMOLISHING THE CANNON.
          
          The dolls fly back from the blast. 9 is the only one
          standing. 9 deliberately walks towards the Machine. 7
          rushes over, trying to pull him away.

                    Stop! You're a fool!
          
          The Machine swipes at 9 with its claw. 7 tries to stop it
          from getting 9. The Machine sends her flying. She lands
          badly and can't get up immediately. The Machine regroups,
          then begins to re-approach 9. 9 stays put.

           he twins chatter frantically.   7 struggles to get up.
          
          
                     No it doesn't!
          
                              9
                    Yes, it does. You'll see.      I'll
                    let it take my soul. Then
                    after.... take the device.

          The Machine raises its claw to grab 9 when suddenly 9 is
          KNOCKED ASIDE and --
          
          1 TAKES HIS PLACE.

          strength.

                      What right did they have to burden
                      us? Why did we have to right their
                      wrongs? So I refused. I refused
                      our path. But now... I see... we
                      cannot refuse it.   We are all
                      that's left.   We must complete
                      our journey.

                      Sometimes one must be sacrificed
                      for the good of many.
          
           ith a horrible green glow the machine TAKES HIS SOUL.     The
          twins look away, distressed.

                      NO--NO--
          
          But the machine RISES UP TERRIFYINGLY. It looks for a moment
          as though 9 was wrong and they're all going to be killed.
          They all cringe with horror.
          
          But then, as 9 had remembered, the Machine powers down to
          "digest" 1's soul.
          9
              darts in and GRABS the TALISMAN.
          
           he machine, with a terrible shrieking sound, falters, then
          crumples, dead. Sparks and smoke spew from it. Oil bubbles
          down its sides. It is lifeless--just a pile of jumbled
          machinery.
          
          7 and the twins approach and all of them look down at the
          Talisman in 9's hands and we:

          Smoke rises from the center of a funeral pyre the dolls have
          made.
          
           t is a circular pyre, with spokes reaching out from the
          center.
          
          At the end of each spoke is the burlap skin of one of the
          fallen ragdolls, with its number stretched across a pole.
          
          In the center, a small FIRE flickers.
          
          9 stands in front of the last pole, holding 5's skin in his
          hands. He looks down at it in his hands and sadly places it
          upon the pole, looking up towards it.
          
           he twins come in with artifacts from the Scientist's studio.
          The journal. The tiny box. They put them down to the side.
          
            and 7 take the Talisman and place it IN THE CENTER, in
          front of the fire.
          
           he Talisman pulsates, vibrates, and shakes, and, finally
          BURSTS. A huge GREEN GLOW reaches up to the sky and the
          ragdolls' souls emerge.
          
          8 emerges and walks to his number. He nods to 9, 7, and the
          twins. They nod back, acknowledging the fierce warrior.
          
          2 comes out with 5 close behind.   5 places an arm around 2.
          
            emerges from the Talisman energy.   He sees his key and
          caresses it.
          
          1 emerges and comes over to stand next to 9. He nods,
          acknowledging that 9 has finally completed the mission.     He
          looks up to the sky. The others follow his gaze.
          
          Together, spirits and living, they all watch together, and
          watch as the beam shoots up to the sky. We see THE SKY
          CHANGING, HEALING, RENEWING ITSELF.
          
          A healing rain begins to fall.

          The souls of the slain ragdolls now rise and dissipate into
          the healing energy.
          
          9 and 7 watch.   7 puts her arm around 9.
          
          The twins chatter: they've taken 6's key and tried it in the
          little box's keyhole. It opens the box. 7 and 9 go over as
          the box is opened:
          
          It is a music box.
          
          As they see themselves reflected in it, they see the word
          "HOPE."
          
          Camera pulls back slowly... revealing a tiny tendril of green
          grass growing.
          
                                                          FADE OUT.

TITLE: THE ABYSS -- ON BLACK, DISSOLVING TO COBALT BLUE

EXT. OCEAN/UNDERWATER -- DAY                                            3

Blue, deep and featureless, the twilight of five hundred feet down.
PROPELLER SOUND.  Materializing out of the blue limbo is the enormous but
sleek form of an Ohio-class SSBN ballistic missile submarine.

INT. U.S.S. MONTANA -- DAY                                              4

In the attack center, darkened to womb-red, the crew's faces shine with sweat
in the glow of their instruments.  The SKIPPER and his EXEC crowd around
BARNES, the sonarman.

                                CAPTAIN
                Sixty knots?  No way, Barnes... the reds don't
                have anything that fast.

                                BARNES
                Checked it twice, skipper.  It's a real unique
                signature.  No cavitation, no reactor noise...
                doesn't even sound like screws.

He puts the signal onto a speaker and everyone in the attack room listens to
the intruder's acoustic signature, a strange THRUMMING.  The captain studies
the electronic position board, a graphic representation of the contours of
the steep-walled canyon, a symbol for the Montana, and converging with it, an
amorphous trace, representing the bogey.

                                CAPTAIN
                What the hell is it?

                                EXEC
                I'll tell you what it's not, it's not one of
                ours.

                                BARNES
                Sir!  Contact changing heading to two-one-four,
                diving.  Speed eighty knots!  Eighty knots!

                                EXEC
                Eighty knots...

                                BARNES
                Still diving, depth nine hundred feet.  Port
                clearance to cliff wall, one hundred fifty feet.

                Still diving, depth nine hundred feet.  Port
                clearance to cliff wall, one hundred fifty feet.

Tension builds in the attack room as the Montana surges to intercept the
intruder.  The exec tensely watches the vector-graphic readout for the side-
scan sonar array.  The sub is running uncomfortably close to the cliff walls.

                                EXEC
                          (low, to Captain)
                It's getting tight in here.

                                CAPTAIN
                We can still give him a haircut.  Helm, come
                right to oh six niner, down five degrees.

                                HELMSMAN
                Coming right to oh six niner, sir.  Down five
                degrees.

                                NAVIGATOR
                Port side clearance one hundred twenty feet
                narrowing to seventy-five.  Sir, we have a
                proximity warning light.

                                EXEC
                That's too damn close!  We've gotta back off.

                                BARNES
                Range to contact, two hundred.  Contact junked to
                bearing two six oh and accelerated to... one
                hundred thirty knots, sir!

                                EXEC
                         (really freaked now)
                Nothing goes one thirty!

Suddenly the control room lights dim almost to blackness.

We see only the effect, not the source, as a large diffuse light passes
rapidly under the sub's hull.  Moments later a shockwave, like an underwater
sonic boom, impacts the sub, slamming it sideways.

The bride crew are knocked off their feet, as the ship is buffeted.

                Planes are not responding, sir!

Power returns in time for the sonarman to get a glimpse at the side-scan
display... AS THE SHEER CLIFF WALL LOOM BEFORE THEM.

The cliff wall materializes out of the blue limbo off the port bow with
nightmarish slow-motion.  The sub slams into it with horrific force, scraping
along and bouncing off.  One tail stabilizer is sheared off and the big screw
prangs the wall with an earsplitting K-K-KWANG!

INT. PORT TO TORPEDO ROOM                                               8

With the outer tube-doors torn off, seawater slams in, busting the inner
hatches.  Two-foot thick columns of water, like fire-hoses of the gods,
blast into the room.  Everything vanishes instantly in white spray.

INT. CONTROL RM/ATTACK CENTER                                           9

Everyone is hurled off his feet.  The planesman flights to recover control of
the yoke.

The great sub is being hauled down by the mass of its flooded bow section,
its flanks rushing past us like a freight train headed for Hell.

INT. MONTANA CONTROL ROOM                                               11

The command crew fights futility for control, everyone shouting and terrified.

The Captain locks eyes with the Exec amid the din...

                                CAPTAIN
                We're losing her.  Launch the buoy!

The Exec opens the door to a small box and punches a button.  A red light
comes on.  The Captains takes a deep breath.

A tiny transmitter is ejected from the sub's hell and begins its long ascent
to the surface.  A second later the sub slams down like a piledriver onto a
ledge, tearing open its pressure hull.

VARIOUS QUICK CUTS, just flashes and impressions, as...
Seawater blasts down the corridors --
Explodes across the control room, hurling men like dolls --
Floods the cavernous missile bay in seconds --
Bursts through hatches into the reactor room --
Blasts men OUT OF FRAME in a micro-second.

EXT. OCEAN/UNDERWATER                                                   14

In the cobalt twilight we see the Montana slide down the sea cliff, its hull
SCREECHING like the death agonies of some marine dinosaur.  Descending in an
avalanche of silt, it finally disappears into the blackness below... a
blackness which continues almost straight down, 20,000 feet to the bottom of
the Cayman Trough.  The abyss.

EXT. OCEAN SURFACE -- DAY                                               15

Above, in the world, the Caribbean rolling gray under a stormy sky.  The
Montana's emergency buoy pops to the surface, transmitting.

LONG LENS SHOT: three massive Navy Sea King helicopters thundering straight
at us, FILLING FRAME.

REVERSE, as they barrel OVER CAMERA toward a lone civilian ship... an ugly
but very sophisticated deep-sea drilling support ship, the BENTHIC EXPLORER.
It is a twin-hulled monstrosity with a central opening in its deck, around
which crouch enormous cranes, winches and other arcane equipment.

The first Sea King settles onto the helipad, disgorging a contingent of Naval
officers, technicians, and a squad of armed seamen.  A pantomime in the
rotorwash, we see the Benthic Petroleum "company man" KIRKHILL greeting
COMMODORE DEMARCO, the on-scene commander.

INT. BENTHIC EXPLORER/BRIDGE -- DAY                                     17

The bridge is state-of-the-art, with computers and sophisticated navigation
and communications gear, looking like mission control with its bank of video
monitors.  The Drilling Operations Supervisor, LELAND MCBRIDE, and BENDIX,
the crew chief, watch the invaders swarming the deck below.

                                MCBRIDE
                Does not look good at all.

TIGHT ON VIDEO SCREEN (MINUTES LATER) showing divers working in total
blackness around some sort of installation on the bottom of the ocean.  They
move through the harsh floodlights in dreamlike slow motion, looking like
space-suited figures with their helmets and umbilical hoses.

                                DEMARCO (V.O.)
                No light from the surface.  How deep are they?

                Seventeen hundred feet.

WIDER, showing the Navy contingent crowding the control room.  DeMarco is
hardcore military, brusque and efficient.  Kirkhill is a small man with
pinched features, wearing a shirt and tie, which on a drill ship means
company man and/or dickhead.

                                DEMARCO
                I need them to go to over two thousand.

                                KIRKHILL
                They can do it.

                Get Brigman on the line.

EXT. UNDERWATER -- DAY (TOTAL DARKNESS)                                 18

1700 FEET BELOW.  A submersible oil-drilling platform, DEEPCORE II, an island
of light in the vast blackness.  Its main framework connects two "tri-
modules" consisting of three cylinders each.  These contain living and work
areas in a pressurized environment.  An umbilical cable, thick as a man's
thigh, runs up from the oil rig into the darkness, to the Benthic Explorer
at the surface.  In a bubble-like dome port window we see the rig foreman, or
"toolpusher," BUD BRIGMAN.  He's talking (via headset) with two divers
working outside... 'CATFISH' DE VRIES, AND LEW 'BIRD-DOG' FINLER.

                                BUD
                Hey, you guys are milking that job.

                                CATFISH

Bud turns from the window and crosses the drill floor.  The working heart of
the rig.  THUNDEROUS MECHANICAL ROAR.  The drill crew, in hardhats and mud-
plastered overalls, tend the massive spinning turn-table in the center of the
chamber.  The semi-automated system requires only five men to operate.  The
others are LUPTON MCWHIRTER, DWIGHT PERRY, JAMMER WILLIS, and TOMMY RAY
DIETZ.  Bud hears his names called above the din by Jammer, a massive
roughneck/diver who stands a good head taller than the rest.

                                JAMMER
                               (yelling)
                Bud!  Hippy's on the bitch-box.  It's a call
                from topside.  That new company man.

                                BUD
                Kirkhill?  That guy doesn't know his butt from
                a rathole.  Hey, Perry!

One of the roustabouts, a wiry Texan, turns to him.

                                BUD
                Do me a favor and square away the mud hose and
                those cable slings.  This place is starting to
                look like my apartment.

Perry chuckles and sets to the task cheerfully.  Bud EXITS, ducking his head
through a low watertight hatch.

INT. CORRIDOR/TOOLPUSHER'S OFFICE                                       21

Bud tromps down the narrow corridor, his work boots gonging on steel.

                                P.A. (HIPPY'S VOICE)
                BUD, PICK UP THE TOPSIDE LINE URGENT.

                                BUD
                I'm coming.  Keep your pantyhose on.

He enters his office, a tiny cubicle with stacks of paperwork, dust-
gathering tech manuals and waterstained Penthouse fold-outs.  He picks up the
phone... punches down a line.

                                BUD
                Brigman here.  Kirkhill?  What's going on?
                              (pause)
                I am calm.  I'm a calm person.  Is there some
                reason why I shouldn't be calm?

HOLD ON Bud's expression, darkening, as he listens.

INT. CORRIDOR/CONTROL MODULE                                            22

The control module is a long narrow cabin like the inside of a Winnebago,
packed with instrumentation.  At the end is a small bay with multiple
viewports.  Outside, at a 'Christmas tree' pipe installation, a lone diver
can be seen welding.  He is accompanied by a large submersible, FLATBED, and
by a Remotely Operated Vehicle, or ROV, call LITTLE GEEK.  Little Geek is an
underwater robot which operated on the end of a cable-like control TETHER.
It has a single video 'eye' in front, by which the operator pilots the little
machine.  The rig's ROV pilots is ALLEN 'HIPPY' CARNES, who stands by the
window twiddling his joysticks and drinking coffee.  His pet white rat,
BEANY, crawls contentedly around his shoulders.  The door BANGS OPEN.

Hippy jumps, slops his coffee.  Bud strides in.  Not calm.

                                BUD
                Son of a bitch.

He kicks a chair out of the way and slams his palm down on a switch marked
DIVER RECALL.  A SIREN, blasting through the water from a big hydrophone
loudspeaker.

                                BUD
                All divers.  Drop what you're doing.  Everybody
                out of the pool.

EXT. DEEPCORE/CHRISTMAS TREE                                            A22

Flatbed's pilot, LISA 'ONE NIGHT' STANDING, can be clearly seen behind a
bubble canopy.  She is a no-nonsense lady who holds her own in the mostly
male environment by being one of the best submersible drivers in the
business.  She controls a hydraulic manipulator arm, assisting the diver,
ARLISS 'SONNY' DAWSON, in his work.  Little Geek hovers around them like a
tiny helicopter.  One Night moves the Flatbed arm to Sonny and hands him the
pipe.

                                ONE NIGHT
                Here you go, hon'.

                                SONNY
                Just in time, sugar.

They react to Bud's recall, looking toward him up in the control module.

                                ONE NIGHT
                Dammit, we just got out here.

                                SONNY
                There was a time when I would have asked why.

One Night makes a grab for his butt with the manipulator claw, which he
narrowly avoids.

                                                                CUT TO:

EXT. DEEPCORE/UNDER SUB-BAY                                             23

Flatbed moves underneath the rig, a few feet above the seafloor, with Sonny
riding on its top deck.  It passes under a lit opening and rises toward the
surface of the water in the chamber above.  Little Geek follows like an
obedient dog.

INT. SUB-BAY/MOONPOOL                                                   24

The opening is called the moonpool, and Deepcore's submersibles are launched
through it.  From inside the sub-bay it looks just like a swimming pool.
Flatbed surfaces, nearly filling it.  The chamber also contains CAB ONE, a
similar submersible.  Jammer, Perry, and some of the other drill-room boys
are helping the divers out of the water.  The water at this depth is only
about six degrees above freezing, and these folks are cold and prune-
fingered.  Finler pulls off his demand-helmet, revealing a round, boyish
face.

                                FINLER
                What's goin' on?  How come we got recalled?

                                SONNY
                Hell is I know.

One Night jumps 'ashore' from Flatbed's broad deck and joins them.  Catfish
is unzipping his bulky dry-suit.

                                CATFISH
                Just follow standard procedure, will ya...
                flog the dog till somebody tells us what's
                happening.

                                JAMMER
                Hey, Catfish, I'll sell you my October Penthouse
                for twenty bucks.

                                ONE NIGHT
                Save you money, darlin'... the pages are all
                stuck together by now.

Bud enters, approaching the group.

                                JAMMER
                What's goin' on, Boss?

                                BUD
                Folks, I've just been told to shut down the hole
                and prepare to move the rig.

                                SONNY
                She-hit.

                                BUD
                We're being asked to cooperate in a matter of
                national security.  Now you know exactly as much
                as I do.  So just get your gear off and get up to
                control.  There's some kind of briefing in ten
                minutes.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. DEEPCORE/COMMAND MODULE                                            25

The whole rig crew is somehow jammed into the room for the video briefing.
DeMarco is on the main monitor, with his aides and Kirkhill visible b.g.

                                DEMARCO
                At 09:22 local time this morning, an American
                nuclear submarine, the USS Montana, with 156 men
                aboard, went down 22 miles from here.  There has
                been no contact with the sub since then.  The
                cause of the incident is not known.

PAN AROUND the reactions of the various drill crew members... shocked,
hushed, curious.

                                DEMARCO
                Your company has authorized the Navy's use of
                this facility for a rescue operation.  The code
                name is Operation Salvor.

                                ONE NIGHT
                You want us to search for the sub?

                                DEMARCO
                No.  We know where it is.  But she's in 2000 feet
                of water and we can't reach her.  We need divers
                to enter the sub and search for survivors, if
                any.

Bud's scowl has been deepening since DeMarco started to talk.

                                BUD
                Don't you guys have your own stuff for this type
                of thing?

                                DEMARCO
                By the time we get our rescue submersible here
                the storm front will be right on us.  But you
                can get your rig in under the storm and be on-
                site in fifteen hours.  That makes you our best
                option right now.

Hippy, born suspicious and recently graduated to paranoid, leans forward...

                                HIPPY
                Why should we risk our butts on a job like this?

                                KIRKHILL
                I have been authorized to offer you all special-
                duty bonuses equivalent to three times normal
                dive pay.

                                CATFISH
                Hell, for triple time I'd crawl through razor
                blades and shower off with lime juice.

                I'm here to tell ya', you could set me on fire
                and call me names.

                                BUD
                Look, I don't know what kind of a deal you guys
                worked out with the company, but my people are
                not qualified for this... they're oil workers.

                A four-man SEAL team will transfer down to you
                to supervise the operation.

                                BUD
                You can send down whoever you like, but I'm the
                toolpusher on this rig, and when it comes to the
                safety of these people, there's me... then
                there's God.  Understand?  If things get dicey,
                I'm pulling the plug.

                                KIRKHILL
                I think we're all on the same wavelength,
                Brigman.  Now let's get the wellhead uncoupled,
                shall we?

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. DEEPCORE/COMMAND MODULE AND CORRIDOR                               26

Bud stands beside the hatchway as the others file out toward their tasks.
They comment gravely as they pass...

                                JAMMER
                When Lindsey finds out about this, it's not
                gonna be a pretty sight.

                                ONE NIGHT
                They're going to have to shoot her with a
                tranquilizer gun.

                                                                CUT TO:

EXT. OCEAN -- DAY                                                       27

A single Navy Sea King churns through the rain under massive thunderheads.
The sea below is whipped by the storm.

INT./EXT. SEA KING                                                      28

PANNING ALONG BOOTED FEET, four pairs of black military size twelves line
up, onto... a pair of Charles Jourdans fives under shapely ankles.

WIDER, revealing the four-man team of Navy SEALs.  And a slender woman in
her early thirties.  She's attractive, if a bit hardened, dressed
conservatively in a skirt and jacket.  Meet LINDSEY.  Project Engineer for
Deepcore.  She's a pain in the ass, but you'll like her.  Eventually.
She's holding on grimly, sitting crammed in with the SEALs and a bunch of
gear, getting tossed around by the storm.  The SEALs are dressed alike in
black fatigues.  They are muscular, finely-tuned and extremely dangerous
special-forces types.  The leader of the SEAL team, LIEUTENANT COFFEY, makes
his way forward to the cockpit.

The pilot is white-knuckling his stick, trying to hold the great beast of a
helicopter in position.  Through the windshield, the deck of the Benthic
Explorer can be seen below, pitching in a violent sea.

                                PILOT
                No way I'm putting her down.  I shouldn't even
                be flying in this shit.

                                COFFEY
                                (cool)
                Just hold it over the deck.

Coffey goes back to the crew deck, moving easily in the bucking craft.  He
nods to the others SEALs, MONK, WILHITE, and SCHOENICK.  In the open side
door, Wilhite clips a 100 foot nylon rope to the airframe and throws out the
coil.  One by one the shoulder the gear-bags, grab the rope, and step out.
Lindsey stands swaying in the chopper door, watching the SEALs fast-roping
to the deck.  One, two, three.  Coffey looks at her.

                                COFFEY
                You want to be on that ship, there's only one
                way it's going to happen.

He's sure she won't go for it.  It's his certainty that gets her.  She sets
her jaw.  Opening her purse she takes out a small plastic bag, puts her
shoes and purse in the bag, and grips the bag in her teeth.  Then grabs
the rope and slides down.

EXT. BENTHIC EXPLORER/HELIPAD                                           29

Swinging wildly in the wind like a human pendulum, Lindsey fast-ropes forty
feet to the deck.  She steps away an instant before Coffey hits behind her.
Lindsey crosses the rainswept deck with athletic strides.  Her nylons are
ruined.  An air-crewman in the chopper lowers two additional equipment cases
using the rescue sling.  The SEALs catch them as they swing radically across
the deck.  They Navy chopper banks and seems to scurry away before the
mounting storm.

                                                                CUT TO:

BLACKNESS.  Then shafts of light become visible, above a ridge of rock.
Flatbed appears, trailing two heavy two cables.  Behind it, the mass of
Deepcore emerges from the darkness, its forward lighting array blazing.
Flatbed is towing it like a tug, aided by Deepcore's own mighty stern
thrusters.

INT. DEEPCORE/CONTROL MODULE                                            31

Bud, his feet propped up, uses joystick controls to 'fly' Deepcore,
maneuvering against currents and around seafloor obstacles.  He is guided
by the side-scan sonar display, with Hippy assisting in the sonar shack.
Through the front viewport, Flatbed can be seen out ahead.

McBride appears on the bridge monitor, holding a sheet of weather-fax.

                                MCBRIDE (on screen)
                Well, it's official, sportsfans.  They're calling
                it Hurricane Frederick, and it's going to be
                making our lives real interesting in a few hours.

INT. EXPLORER BRIDGE -- DAY                                             32

Bud responds via video.

                                BUD
                Fred, huh?  I don't know.  Hurricanes should be
                named after women.

McBride looks up as the bridge door opens.  Lindsey enters in a blast of wind,
wet as a wharf rat and twice as pissed off.  Maybe Bud is right.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. DEEPCORE/CONTROL MODULE                                            33

Bud is surprised to see Lindsey's face appear on the monitor screen.

                                LINDSEY
                I can't believe you let them do this!

                                BUD
                     (unpreturbed, almost cheerful)
                Hi, Lins.  I thought you were in Houston.

                                LINDSEY
                I was, but I managed to bum a ride on the last
                flight out here.  Only here isn't where I left
                it, is it, Bud?

                                BUD
                Wasn't up to me.

                                LINDSEY
                We were that close to proving a submersible
                drilling platform could work.  We had over seven
                thousand feet of hole down for Chrissake.  I
                can't believe you let them grab my rig!

                                BUD
                Your rig?

                                LINDSEY
                My rig.  I designed the damn thing.

                                BUD
                Yup, a Benthic Petroleum paid for it.  So as long
                as they're hold the pink slip, I go where they
                tell me.

                                LINDSEY
                You wimp.  I had a lot riding on this.  They
                bought you... more like least rented you cheap--

                                BUD
                I'm switching off now.

                                LINDSEY
                Virgil, you wiener!  You never could stand up
                to fight.  You--

Bud hits the switch and the screen goes dead.

                                BUD
                Bye.

Hippy looks over him, trying very hard not to crack up.

                                HIPPY
                Virgil?

                                BUD
                God, I hate that bitch.

                                HIPPY
                Yeah, well you never should have married her then.

Bud nods fatalistically.

                                                                CUT TO:

EXT. EXPLORER DECK/LAUNCH WELL                                          34

Ten foot waves crash through the launch-well, sending up geysers of spray.
Next to the launch-well, crewman have attached a lifting cable to CAB THREE,
eighteen feet of ugly yellow submersible.  It slams violently in its steel
cradle as the drill-ship rolls.  Coffey and Schoenick hand the gear bags in
to Wilhite and Monk though the hatch under the rear of the submersible.

Lindsey approaches, wearing a borrowed roustabout's coverall.

She looks down at the larger of the two equipment cases brought by the SEALs,
lying on the deck.  Stenciled on it are the words: F.B.S./DEEP SUIT/MARK IV.
Coffey and Schoenick push past her to pick it up.

                                LINDSEY
                Let's go, gentlemen!  We either launch now or
                we don't launch.

Coffey looks up in surprise as she nimbly climbs the side of Cab Three and
grabs the lifting shackle, circling her raised hand to signal the crane man.

                                LINDSEY
                Take her up, Byron!

Cab Three, with Lindsey riding its back, is pulled up out its cradle and
starts to swing violently as Explorer pitches.  The submersible is then
swung out to the center of the launch well.  It sways and gyrates above the
furious water below.  Lindsey drops into the upper hatch.

INT. EXPLORER BRIDGE/D.O.C.                                             35

Kirkhill leans suddenly over the console to look out the window.

                                KIRKHILL
                What the hell is she doing out there?  Son of a
                bitch...
                           (into microphone)
                Lindsey... get out of Cab Three.  Bates is taking
                her down.

INT. CAB THREE                                                          36

Lindsey pulls her headset as she dogs down the inside locking levers of the
hatch.

                                LINDSEY
                Bates is sick.  Besides I've got more hours in
                this thing than he does.
                              (to Coffey)
                A little change of plan.

The little sub is swinging like a pendulum on the cable, and the SEALs,
jammed in with their equipment in the tiny space, are getting slammed into
the walls.  Lindsey is calmly flipping switches as she talks.

                                COFFEY
                Lady, we better fish or cut bait.

                                LINDSEY
                Just hold your water, okay?
                             (to Kirkhill)
                So Kirkhill, we gonna do this or we gonna talk
                about it?

INT. EXPLORER BRIDGE/D.O.C.                                             37

The plug is pulled on DeMarco's patience.

                                DEMARCO
                I don't care who drives the damn thing.  Just get
                my team in the water.

                                KIRKHILL
                Alright, alright.  Christ Almighty!

He gestured dismissively to McBride.

                                MCBRIDE
                Cab Three, you are clear to launch.

INT./EXT. CAB THREE                                                     38

Lindsey reaches up a grabs a red lever.

                                LINDSEY
                Roger.
                              (to Coffey)
                There's only one way it's going to happen...

She pulls the lever hard.  CLUNK-CLANG!  The shackle-release drops the sub.
It freefalls ten feet to the water with an enormous splash and keeps right
on going after Lindsey floods the trim tanks.  Coffey et al have been slammed
hard.

                                LINDSEY
                Touchdown.  The crowd goes wild.  Explorer...
                Cab Three.  We are styling.

                                MCBRIDE (filtered)
                Roger, Cab Three.

Lindsey cuts on the floodlights and maneuvers the descending submersible so
that the umbilical cable is a few feet ahead on her front port.  Moving up
through her lights, it will guide her down to the rig.  Cab Three free-falls
into increasing darkness.  Soon it is a candle below us in the indigo.

EXT./INT. FLATBED                                                       39

One Night is driving the tug one-handed, pouring coffee from a thermos and
rocking out to the great truck-driving song "Willing" on the beat-box she's
got propped up on the sonar rig.  Fighting white-line fever in the best
tradition.

INT. CONTROL MODULE                                                     40

Bud and Hippy come in for a rousing chorus.

                                BUD/HIPPY
              ... I've been driving every kinda rig that's
                ever been maaaaade...

EXT. DEEPCORE                                                           41

Lit up like a proud Peterbilt, the rig crossed the trackless wastes.  We
hear them singing, carried OVER.

EXT. OCEAN DEPTHS/CAB THREE                                             42

In total blackness, the submersible descends along the rigorous line of the
umbilical cable.  Two hundred feet below it, the lights of Deepcore resolve
out of the darkness.  Now we can see the rig crawling over the ocean bottom
like some monster lawnmower.

                                LINDSEY (V.O.)
                Deepcore, Deepcore... this is Cab Three on
                final approach.

                                HIPPY (V.O.)
                Gotcha, Cab Three.  Who is that?  That You,
                Lindsey?

INT. DEEPCORE/CONTROL MODULE                                            43

Bud stop singing and snaps around at the mention of her name.

                                LINDSEY (V.O.)
                None other.

Bud's expression is nothing less than stricken.

                                BUD
                Oh no... you gotta be kidding me.

EXT./CAB THREE/DEEP CORE                                                44

Lindsey executes a 180 degree turn and cruises over the control module, back
through the A-frame toward the docking hatch.  The flange of Cab Three's
lockout hatch settles over the pressure collar on the rig's back.  There is
a CLUNK as it mates up.

INT. DEEPCORE/COMPRESSION CHAMBER/GAS CONTROL STATION                   45

Lindsey drops down from the hatch into the small cylindrical pressure chamber.
The SEALs drop down behind her, passing their gear through hand-over-hand.
The chamber is spartan, with steel benches, a folding card table, breathing
masks, and medical supplies.  Catfish greets them through the tiny porthole
at one end.

                                CATFISH
                Howdy, y'all.  Hey, Lindsey!  I'll be damned!
                You shouldn't be down here sweet thing, ya'll
                might run ya stockings.

                                LINDSEY
                Couldn't stay away.  You running mixture for us?
                Good.  Couldn't ask for better.

                                CATFISH
                Okay, here we go.  Start equalizing, y'all.

HISSSS of inrushing compressed gas.  The pressure in the chamber rises.  The
breathing mixture is composed of helium, oxygen and nitrogen.  Catfish
monitors it carefully from a station outside the chamber, watching the
gauges with a practiced eye.  Lindsey and the SEALs all grab their noses
and start making funny faces... popping their ears with the familiar diver's
'equalization' technique.  They continue as:

                                LINDSEY
                Get comfortable.  The bad news is we got six
                hours in this can, blowing down.  The worse news
                is it's gonna take us three weeks to decompress
                back to the surface later.

                                COFFEY
                We've been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman.

                                LINDSEY
                Don't call me that, okay... I hate that.  Alright,
                from now on we watch each other closely for
                signs of HPNS...

                                MONK
                           (as if by rote)
                High-Pressure Nervous Syndrome.  Muscle tremors,
                usually in the hands first.  Nausea, increased
                excitability, disorientation.

                                LINDSEY
                Very good.  About one person in twenty just can't
                handle it.  They go buggo.  They're no way to
                predict who's susceptible, so stay alert.

                                COFFEY
                Look, we've all made chamber runs to this depth.
                We're checked out.

                                LINDSEY
                Oh... chamber runs.  Uh huh, that's good.
                          (Coffey turn away)
                Well, hey... you guys know any songs?

They ignore her.  Start going over some diagrams of the Montana's interior.
It's going to be a long six hours.

INT. GAS CONTROL STATION -- HOURS LATER                                 46

Catfish checks his watch, then reaches over and adjusts a value on the tri-
mix manifold, watching the gauges.  Satisfied, he leans over to the pressure
window in the door, checking out the SEALs.  Hippy has come down from the
control deck for an advanced look are the interlopers.  Jammer is in a chair,
reading a Louis L'Amour paperback.

                                CATFISH
                Those guys ain't so tough.  I fought plenty of
                guys tougher'n them.

                                HIPPY
                Now we get to hear about how he used to be a
                contender.

Catfish hold up one calloused fist up in front of Hippy's face.

                                CATFISH
                You see this?  They used to call this the Hammer.

                                JAMMER
                Hippy wasn't born then.

INT. PRESSURE CHAMBER                                                   47

It looks like the end of a long bus trip.  Everyone silent... leafing
through beat-to-hell magazines or just staring.  Lindsey has her feet propped
up on the smaller of the SEALs' two equipment cases.  She casually toes open
one of the latches, then the other.  Glances at Coffey.  He's reading.  She
begins to lift the lid with her toe.  Gets a GLIMPSE INSIDE, of packing foam,
and what looks like a SMALL BLACK METAL BOX.  Then... WHAM!  Coffey's foot
comes down on the lid, slamming it shut.  Startled, she looks up into his
cool gaze.

                                COFFEY
                Curiosity killed the cat.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. GAS CONTROL STATION/CHAMBER DOOR -- LATER                          48

TIGHT ON CATFISH'S hands... closing values... spinning the wheel on the
chamber hatch.  CUT WIDER as it cracks open with a virgin's sigh and swings
aside.

                                CATFISH
                Y'all'er done to a turn and ready to serve.
                Everybody okay?

The SEALs nod peremptorily and shoulder their gear.  Lindsey exists first,
followed by Monk, Wilhite, and Schoenick.  Coffey bends to relatch the small
equipment case.  He is alone for one moment in the chamber.  He raises his
hand and stares at it.  The fingertips are trembling the slightest bit.  He
clenches them into a fist and walks out.

INT. CORRIDOR                                                           49

As Lindsey emerges into the main corridor of the rig, she bumps into a large,
dark mass.

                                LINDSEY
                Hey, was there a wall here before?  I don't
                remember a wall here.  Oh, Jammer!  Hi.

The 'wall' grins down to her.

                                JAMMER
                Howdy, there, little lady.

Coffey emerges behind them and, ignoring Lindsey, faces Jammer.

                                COFFEY
                              (to Jammer)
                Show us the dive prep area.  We need to check
                out your gear.

Jammer scowls, turns and leads the SEALs in the sub-bay.  Catfish and Lindsey
exchange a look.

                                LINDSEY
                Those guys are about a much fun as a tax audit.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. COMMAND MODULE                                                     50

TIGHT ON HIPPY, bathed in the light of the sonar display.  He is making
kissing sounds at Beany, who has his inquisitive nose right up to Hippy's
lips.

                                LINDSEY
                Hippy, you're going to give that rat a disease.

WIDER, as Hippy and Bud to see Lindsey leaning in the doorway.  She and Bud
size each other up.  He opts for a jovial approach, his eyes wary.

                                BUD
                Well, well.  Mrs. Brigman.

                                LINDSEY
                Not for long.

Lindsey crossed past him, her eyes scanning the banks of equipment, almost
unconsciously checking, checking... getting the pulse of her big iron baby.

                                BUD
                You never did like being called that, did you?

                                LINDSEY
                Not even when it meant something.
                     (looking through the front port)
                Is that One Night up in Flatbed?

                                BUD
                Who else?

Lindsey leans past Bud to the gooseneck mike on the console.

                                LINSEY
                Hi, One Night, it's Lindsey.

INT. FLATBED                                                            51

One Night mimes a puking motion, finger down her throat.  Then she replies
with sickening sweetness...

                                ONE NIGHT
                Oh, hi, Lindsey.

INT. COMMAND MODULE                                                     52

Lindsey fives the sonar shack the once-over.  She tweaks some knobs.

                                BUD
                I can't believe you were dumb enough to come
                down.  Now you're stuck here for the storm...
                dumb, hot-rod... dumb.

                                LINDSEY
                Look, I didn't come down here to fight.

She crosses past Bud and exits into the corridor.  Bud bolts out of the chair
to follow her and Hippy scrambles in to take over.

INT. CORRIDOR/LADDER-WELL/LEVEL ONE LANDING                             53

Bud catches up with Lindsey in the corridor, and through the following keeps
pace with here as she make here inspection.

                                BUD
                Then why'd you come down?

She stops abruptly to look at a leaky pipe.  He almost slams into her.  She
moves on, climbing down the ladder to the lower level.

                                LINDSEY
                You need me.  Nobody knows the systems on this
                rig better than I do.  What is something was
                to go wrong after the Explorer clears off?  What
                would have you done?

                                BUD
                Wow, you're right!  Us poor dumb ol' boys might've
                had to think for ourselves.  Coulda been a
                disaster.

On the lower level landing, Lindsey opens a hatch into one of the machine
rooms.  ROAR OF PUMPS AND COMPRESSORS.

INT. MACHINE ROOM                                                       54

Lindsey enters and moves expertly through the dark labyrinth of pipes and
roaring machinery.  Her eyes rove constantly over fittings, gauges, circuit
panels.

                                BUD
                             (yelling)
                You wanna know what I think?

                                LINDSEY
                Not particularly.  Jeez, look where this is set!
                Morons.

She scowls at a pressure gauge and turn a valve minutely.

                                BUD
                I think you were worried about me.

                                LINDSEY
                That must be it.

Lindsey's on the move again, and Bud scrambles through the pipes to keep up.

                                BUD
                No, I think you were.  Come on, admit it.

                                LINDSEY
                I was worried about the rig.  I've got over four
                years invested in this project.

                                BUD
                Oh, yeah, right... and you only had three years
                with me.

She looks up at him.

                                LINDSEY
                You've got to have priorities.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. BUD'S ROOM                                                         55

Darkness.  The door opens and Bud snaps on the light.

                                BUD
                My bunk's the only one I can guarantee won't be
                occupied.  You can grab a couple hours before
                we get there.

Lindsey slips past him into his tiny state-room, the only private bunk on the
rig.  Rank had its privileges.  His hand on the door is just level with her
eyes.  She notices his wedding ring, a massive band of pure titanium
(something your fiancee might have picked out if she had a degree from
M.I.T.).

                                LINDSEY
                What are you still wearing that for?

                                BUD
                I don't know.  Divorce ain't final.  Forgot to
                take it off.

Bud stays in the doorway.  Lindsey takes a heaps of Bud's cloths off the
narrow bunk.  Start unconsciously straightening the room.

                                LINDSEY
                I haven't worn mine in months.

                                BUD
                Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it.  The
                Suit.

                                LINDSEY
                Do you always have to call him that?  The Suit?
                It makes you sound like such a hick.  His name
                is Michael.

Lindsey takes off her borrowed tennies and socks.

Bud eyes her, sounding too causal.

                                BUD
                So what about "Michael" then... Mr. Brooks
                Brothers... Mr. BMW.  You still seeing him?

                                LINDSEY
                No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks.

                                BUD
                What happened?

                                LINDSEY
                Bud, why are you doing this?  It's not part of
                you life any more.

                                BUD
                I'll tell you what happened... you woke up one
                day and realized the guy never made you laugh.

                                LINDSEY
                You're right, Bud.  It was just that simple.
                Aren't you clever?  You should get your own
                show... Ask Dr. Bud, advice to the lovelorn
                from three hundred fathoms.

She closes the watertight door, forcing him out.  Locks it.  She turns and
throws her shoe hard against the far wall.

                                LINDSEY
                AAAARRRGGH!

She flops down on the bed, sitting... staring at the wall.  Her armor is
gone.  She looks small and vulnerable.  A long beat.  She reaches over to the
tiny sink.  Amid the clutter is a bottle of Bud's aftershave.  She unscrews
it and takes a sniff.  Catches herself.  Tosses it.

                                LINDSEY
                Shit.

INT. QUARTERS/HEAD                                                      56

Bud barges into the tiny head and puts some soap on his ring finger.  He pulls
the ring off roughly and throws it into the toilet.  He reaches forward to
flush.  Can't do it.  Now really pissed off at himself, he reaches into the
toilet bowl, wrist deep in the chemical-blue water, and salvages the ring.
He puts it on and washes his hands.  The right hand stays faintly blue no
matter how hard he scrubs.

                                BUD
                Shit.

                                                                CUT TO:

The platform is stopped, hovering in place.  Like a great spacecraft setting
down on a barren planet, the rig settles into the bottom ooze.  Flatbed
releases its tow lines and heads back to its berth inside.

                                                                CUT TO:

CLOSE ON A PHOTOGRAPH, actually a computer-composited down-looking scan from
a towed LIDAR (laser imaging sonar) rig.  It shows a faint, blurry outline of
the Montana lying on her side on a ledge part-way down the canyon wall.  There
is no detail.  A finger points to a flat ledge nearby.  An "X" has been put
on with a grease pencil.

                                COFFEY (V.O.)
                This is us.  We're just on the edge of the Cayman
                Trough.  The Montana is here, on its side, 300
                meters away and 70 meters below us.  We think she
                slid down the wall, and lodged against this
                outcropping.

CUT WIDE, showing the rig crew gathered around a worktable in the sub-bay.
The divers, Bud, Catfish, Sonny, Finler, Jammer, and the four SEALs have
their dry-suits on.  The pre-dive briefing.  Lindsey, One Night, and Hippy
will crew the submersibles.  Wilhite is going around clipping DOSIMETER
BADGES on everybody.

                                SONNY
                This tells us how much radiation we get?

                                HIPPY
                Hey, whoah... I can't handle no radiation, man.
                Forget it!  Include me out.

                                CATFISH
                Hippy, you pussy.

                                HIPPY
                What good's the money if your dick drops off in
                six months?

                                COFFEY
                We'll take reading as we go.  If the reactor's
                breached or the warheads have released
                radioactive debris, we'll back away.  Simple.

                                BUD
                Okay... Hippy's not going... McWhirter, you
                can run Little Geek.

Bud pats the top of a small ROV, sitting next to its larger brother, Big
Geek.

                                HIPPY
                No way!  No way!  He can't fly an ROV worth
                shit.  I'll go.  Shit!

                                COFFEY
                               (to all)
                On the dive, you will do absolutely nothing
                without direct orders from me, and you will
                follow my instructions without discussion.  Is
                this clear?  Alright, I want everyone finished
                prep and ready to get wet in fifteen minutes.

The rig crew disperses, picking up helmets and diving gear.  Some are studying
the diagrams of the Montana's interior layout.  Bud takes Coffey aside as
the others prepare.

                                BUD
                Look, it's three AM.  These guys are running on
                bad coffee and four hours sleep.  You better
                start cutting them some slack.

                                COFFEY
                I can't afford slack, Brigman.

                                BUD
                Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me,
                you start ordering my guys around.  It won't
                work.  You gotta know how to handle these
                people... we have a certain way of doing things
                here.

                                COFFEY
                I'm not interested in your way of doing things.
                Just get your team ready to dive.

End of discussion.  Coffey is walking away.  Burning, Bud crosses to his gear
locker.  Picks up his helmet.  Finler is suiting out next to him.

                                FINLER
                Hey, you know your hand is blue?

                                BUD
                Shut up and get your gear on.

NEARBY, Monk comes over to pick his helmet up off the worktable.  Hippy
points to the heavy equipment case that says F.B.S. DEEP SUIT/MARK IV.

                                HIPPY
                I've been meaning to ask you what this thing is.

Mink opens the case and shows them an unfamiliar diving suit, what looks like
a space helmet, and a large backpack.

                                MONK
                Fluid breathing system.  We just got them.  We
                use it if we need to go really deep.

                                HIPPY
                How deep?

                                MONK
                Deep.
                     (shrugs)
                It's classified... you know.  Anyway, you
                breathe liquid, so you can't be compressed.
                Pressure doesn't get to you.

Catfish is grappling with the concept.

                                CATFISH
                You're saying you get liquid in your lungs?

                                MONK
                Oxygenated fluorocarbon emulsion.

Monk take a clear plastic box full of O-rings off the shelf and dumps them
out.  He opens a valve on the backpack and allows some of the fluid inside
it to drain into the box.  Then he take Beany by the tail off Hippy's
shoulder.

                                HIPPY
                Hey!

                                MONK
                Check this out.

He drops Beany in the box and, before Hippy can protest, closes the lid.
Beany is forced under the surface.  He struggled for a second, and bubbles
come out of his mouth.  Then he casually swims around in there, completely
submerged... breathing liquid.  Catfish and the others stare into the box,
amazed.

                                MONK
                See?  He's diggin' it.

Monk takes Beany out and hold him by the tail for a few seconds to drain his
lungs.  Then hands him back to Hippy.  The rat is annoyed, but otherwise
alright.

                                CATFISH
                This is no bullshit hands down the goddamnedest
                thing I ever saw.

                                                                CUT TO:

EXT. DEEPCORE/DROPOFF                                                   59

Three sets of moving lights move outward from Deepcore.  Cab One and Three,
with Lindsey and Hippy at the controls respectively, and One Night in the
Flatbed.  Lindsey is in the lead.  She approaches the cliff-like drop-off
and starts to descend.

                                LINDSEY
                Com-check, everybody.  Flatbed, you on line?

                                ONE NIGHT
                Ten-four, Lindsey, read you loud and clear.

                                LINDSEY
                Cab Three?

                                HIPPY
                Cab Three, check.  Right behind you.

                                LINDSEY (V.O.)
                What's you depth, Cab Three?

                                HIPPY
                1840... 50... 60... 70...

                                LINDSEY
                Going over the wall.  Coming to bearing 065.
                Everybody stay tight and in sight.

                                ONE NIGHT
                Starting out descent.  Divers, how're you doing?

EXT. FLATBED                                                            60

Eight divers ride the back of Flatbed like itinerant workers on the way to
the fields.  Bud and his civilian crew, Catfish, Finler, and Jammer... sit
across from the SEALs.  They are in their gear and breathing from umbilical
hooked in Flatbed's low-pressure manifold.

                                BUD
                Okay so far.

                                JAMMER
                How deep's the drop-off here?

                                CATFISH
                This here's the bottomless pit, baby.  Two and
                a half miles straight down.

                                COFFEY
                Knock off the chatter.  Cab One, you getting
                anything?

INT./EXT. CAB ONE                                                       61

Lindsey consults her array of instruments.

                                COFFEY
                Cab One, do you see it yet?

                                LINDSEY
                The magnetometer is pegged.  Side-scan is showing
                a big return, but I don't see anything yet.  Are
                you sure you got the depth right on this?

                                BUD (V.O., filtered)
                You should be almost to it, ace.

She turns the submersible and...

The spotlight flares back from the great brass screw of the Montana.  It
dwarfs Cab One, FILLING FRAME.

                                LINDSEY
                Uh, yeah, roger that... uh, found it.

EXT. MONTANA/SUBMERSIBLES                                               62

Cab One maneuvers along the flank of the enormous sub, while Flatbed and Cab
Three move above it.  Wilhite take readings with a hand-held neutron counter.

                                COFFEY
                Cab One, radiation readings?

                                LINDSEY
                Neutron counter's not showing very much.

                                COFFEY
                Wilhite, anything?

                                WILHITE
                Negative.  Nominal.

                                COFFEY
                Just continue forward along the hull.

                                LINDSEY
                Copy that, continuing forward.  You just want
                me to get shots of everything, right?

                                COFFEY
                Roger, document as much as you can, but keep
                moving.  We're on a tight timeline.

                                LINDSEY
                Copy that.

The great black hull of the Montana recedes into the darkness beyond the
puny beams of their lights.  It seems bigger than the Titanic and just as
eerie in its final resting place.  On it side, the sub's top deck becomes a
wall along which the tiny submersibles are moving.  Ahead, in the lights, is
a white painted circle.

                                COFFEY
                That's the midship hatch.  You see it, Cab Three?

                                HIPPY
                Roger, I see it.

                                BUD
                Just get around so your lights are on the hatch.

                                HIPPY
                Check.  Then I just hang with these guys, right?

                                COFFEY
                Right.

                                ONE NIGHT
                How do you want me?

                                COFFEY
                Just hold above it.  Alright, A team.

Wilhite, Schoenick, and Monk unhook their short whip-umbilicals from the
central manifold and roll off the side of Flatbed.  They maneuver down toward
the sub's hatch.  Hippy guides Cab Three in closer to the hatch area.

INT. CAB THREE                                                          63

Hippy turns to Perry back in the lockout chamber, ready to launch Little Geek.
The ROV has a handheld neutron-counter gripped in its manipulator arm.

                                MONK (V.O.)
                Stand by on the ROV.

                                HIPPY
                Perry, stand by on the ROV.
                           (to Little Geek)
                Sorry about this, little buddy.  Better you than
                me, know what I mean?

Hippy nods and Perry drops Little Geek through the hatch into the water and
feed out a length of tether.  Hippy picks up the control box and watches the
video screen, guiding the ROV toward the Montana's hatch.

EXT. MONTANA HATCH AREA                                                 64

The three SEALs have unlatched the deck cover and revealed the hatch.  They
open the out hatch and Monk swims down into to narrow escape trunk.  He bangs
on the inner hatch with a wrench, listening carefully with his helmet pressed
against it.

                                MONK
                It's flooded.  Alright, I'm opening her up.

Straining hard in the confined space, he get the lower hatch open, then swims
backs out immediately.  He gestures to Hippy, via Little Geek's vision, and
Hippy flies the ROV into the hatch.

EXT./INT. CAB ONE/MISSLE DECK                                           65

Meanwhile Cab One and Flatbed have proceeded forward along the hull.  Beyond
Lindsey's front port, the great hatches of the Trident missile tubes roll
toward us in procession.  Several of the hatch covers have been forced
partway open by the warping of the hull.

                                COFFEY (V.O.)
                Radiation is nominal.  The warheads must still
                be intact.

                                LINDSEY
                How many are there?

                                COFFEY (V.O.)
                24 Trident missiles.  Eight MIRVs per missile.

                                LINDSEY
                That's 192 warheads... And how powerful are
                they?

                                SCHOENICK
                Your MIRV is a tactical nuke, 50 kilotons
                nominal yield.  Say times time Hiroshima.

                                LINDSEY (V.O.)
                Jesus Christ... this is World War Three in a
                can.

                                COFFEY (V.O.)
                Let's knock off the chatter, please.

INT. CAB THREE                                                          66

TIGHT ON VIDEO SCREEN -- LITTLE GEEK'S CAMERA.  Passing through a hatch, into
a large grotto filled with pipes and machinery.  The engine room.

                                MONK (V.O.)
                Getting a reading?

                                HIPPY
                It's twitching but it's below the line you said
                was safe.

EXT. MONTANA MIDSHIP HATCH                                              67

Monk moves into the opening.

                                MONK
                Alright.  Let's get in there.

Wilhite and Schoenick follow him through the escape trunk, into the dark
corridor beyond.

EXT. MONTANA/BOW SECTION                                                68

Out of the darkness ahead emerges the trailing edge of the sail, big as a
five-story building.  Far below her, Flatbed moves along the edge of the
ledge which supports the vast sub.  Its lights, and Lindsey's strobes, reveal
the tremendous damage to the forward section as they pass the sail.  The torn
and twisted hull looms above Flatbed as it sets down.

Coffey indicated an enormous rent where the bow section is almost torn away
from the rest of the hull.

                                COFFEY
                We'll go in through that large breach.

                                BUD
                Let's go, guys.

Bud's team leaves Flatbed, swimming forward.  The opening is a black mouth in
their lights.  Coffey moves inside.  Bud attaches one end of an orange nylon
line to a piece of pipe and moves into the wreck behind him.

                                BUD
                Take it slow, stay on the line, and stay in
                sight.  Watch for hatches that could close on
                you, or any loose equipment that could fall.

Jammer, Catfish, Finler, and Sonny follow him inside.

INT. MONTANA/FORWARD BERTHING SECTION                                   69

They find themselves in the forward berthing compartment with its rows of
bunks.  The room is twisted and disheveled, with bedding hanging from the
bunks like the lolling tongues of dead dogs.  Papers float in gentle
eddying currents, letters, pages from paperback novels, photos of girlfriends.
Bud pays out the line and follows Coffey forward.  As they pass sealed doors,
Coffey pounds with a tool, listening.  All flooded.

INT. ENGINE ROOM                                                        70

Monk leads his team along a corridor, following Little Geek's tether.  Through
a hatch into the engine room.  Their lights play over flooded machinery.

INT. COMPANIONWAY/CONTROL ROOM AND ATTACK CENTER                        71

From the berthing Coffey's team swims up a companionway towards the attack
center.  He pulls at a buckled watertight door.

                                COFFEY
                It's jammed.  Give me a hand.

Jammer and Bud squeeze in around Coffey.  Together they wrench the door open
on its squealing hinges.  It give way suddenly, flying open.  The suction
pulls SOMETHING THROUGH.  It slams Bud's shoulder.  He turns.  A FACE...
RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM!  He jerks back, gasping.

Face to face with Barnes, the sonarman.  The ensign seems unmarked, merely
dismayed at his own mortality, judging from his wide eyes and mouth.  Coffey
reaches past Bud and pushes the ensign's body out of the way.

                                COFFEY
                Alright, let's keep moving.  We knew we were
                going to see this.

They enter the control room.  Their lights play over the high-tech wreckage.
Floating debris and bodies make shifting shadows on the walls as they swirl
in the currents.  A languid, weightless waltz.  They move through the carnage.
Their lights pick out tableaux... the planesman still strapped in his chair,
someone jammed into the ceiling pipes, hanging down.  Dead faces, pale in the
lights.  Still.  We see only glimpses.

Coffey locates the captain's body and rolls it over.  Removes the missile
arming key which hangs on a chain around the dead man's neck.  Moves on. All
business.  Bud turns back to his guys.  Checking them.  He notices Jammer is
breathing so rapidly he's fogging his helmet.  Catfish, Finler, and Sonny
aren't much better.  A wave a panic seems imminent.

                                BUD
                How you guys doing?

                                SONNY
                I'm alright, I'm dealing.

                                CATFISH
                Triple time sounds like a lotta money, Bud.  It
                ain't.  I'm sorry...

                                BUD
                We're here now.  Let's get her done.

We see Bud working, calming them, talking them through it.  He's sweating
rivers in his helmet, not looking too steady.  His projection of calm to the
others is his own salvation.

Coffey pauses in the doorway to the communications room.

                                COFFEY
                This part I do alone.  Brigman, take you men and
                continue aft.  Split up into two teams of two.
                Let's get moving... we head back in fourteen
                minutes.

Bud leads his team into a narrow corridor.

INT. CORRIDOR/ROOMS                                                     72

They search the rooms along the corridor with their lights until they come to
a vertical hatch, open.  a pit of darkness below.

                                BUD
                Okay, Cat, Lew, Sonny.  You guys stay on this
                deck.  Hook you line onto mine.  Any problem,
                you tug my line.  Two pulls.  Jammer, you're
                with me.

Bud drops down through the hatch to the level below, followed by Jammer, who
barely fits through.  Catfish hooks his safety line onto Bud's with a
carabiner and move along the corridor with the others.

EXT./INT. CAB ONE                                                       73

Lindsey circles the hull, documenting, photographing.  Her strobes sear the
darkness, give glimpses of the dead leviathan's form as her tiny submersible
circles it like a bee.

INT. COMMUNICATIONS CENTER                                              74

Working from a plastic card, Coffey spins the dial on the wall safe and opens
it.  He removes several plastic binders... the code books.  He also grabs
handfuls of classified documents and orders, and a set of missile arming keys,
all which he places in a pouch at his waist.

INT. CORRIDOR                                                           75

Bud leads Jammer through a long, claustrophobically narrow corridor, tapping
on the walls and hatches periodically.  After he taps, he waits a few
moments.  There are no answering taps.  They open doors and shine their lights
into the rooms.  The are bodies, but they seem anonymous.  Crumpled shapes
in khaki or blue.  They undog and open a hatch.  Beyond it is the largest
chamber of the sub, the...

INT. MISSLE COMPARTMENT                                                 76

The missile compartment is the large gallery a hundred and twenty feet long
and forty feet high, with two rows of vertical launch tubes, 24 in all.  The
chamber is divided into three levels by a floor of open steel grillwork.

                                JAMMER
                Where are we?

                                BUD
                Missile compartment.  Those are the launch tubes.

They sweep their lights around the chamber.  Jammer turns... his beam
illuminating a body just beyond the door.  A coveralled seaman turning
slowly in the eddying current.  Small albino crabs crawl slowly over the
man's face.  One scuttles out of his gaping mouth.

                                JAMMER
                Lord Almighty.

                                BUD
                Hey, you okay?

Bud goes to him.  Gets up close to his face.  Sees that he's not.  That he's
hyperventilating.  Fighting nausea.  Bud grabs him by the shoulders.

                                BUD
                Deep and slow, big guy.  Deep and slow.  Just
                breathe easy.

                                JAMMER
                I... they're all dead, Bud.  They're all dead.
                I thought... some of them... you know...

                                BUD
                I'm taking you back out.

                                JAMMER
                No!  I'm okay now.  I just don't... I can't go
                any further in.

Bud sees that the big diver's breathing has stabilized.  He looks at his
watch.  Checker Jammer's pressure gauges.

                                BUD
                Okay, Jammer.  No problem.  You stay right here.
                I have to go there to the end... you'll see my
                lights.  We'll stay in voice contact.  Just hold
                onto the rope.  Five more minutes.  Okay?

                                JAMMER
                Yeah, okay.  Okay.

He moves off through the center aisle of the gallery swimming between the huge
cylinders.  He pays out the lifeline as he goes.

INT. COM-ROOM                                                           77

Coffey is working rapidly and efficiently, moving from one rack of electronics
gear to the next, setting thermite grenades at vital points.  As the thermite
ignites, it generates an intense arc-bright light and tremendous heat.  The
circuit chasses melt.  Coffey works calmly in the infernal glare.

INT. MISSLE COMPARTMENT                                                 78

Bed negotiates his way through the tangle of wreckage near the far end of the
missile compartment.  He goes down a stairwell to the lower level.  A HUNDRED
FEET AWAY, Jammer loses sight of Bud's dive-lights.  He starts to get
nervous.  Suddenly his own lights begin to DIM, flickering lower and lower.
They become little orange candles, the filament barely glowing.  The darkness
closes in.

                                JAMMER
                Bud?  BUD?!  You readin' me?  BUD?!!

BUD, at the same moment, is fiddling with the connector cables on his helmet
lights, which are dimming and flickering.  He hears nothing from his helmet
transceiver.

JAMMER, smacks the side of his helmet.  Shakes the transceiver on his belt.
Nothing... just static.  Then even the static dies.  Panic time.

He grabs the safety line and pulls twice.  Hard.  It is snagged on a sharp
metal edge ten feet from him.  He pulls twice more, harder, hauling the
thing.  The line severs.  Jammer stared at the frayed and floating toward
him.  His eyes bug.  He looks all around in the darkness.  Can't see Bud.
Can't decide what to do.  We can see hysteria revving up inside him like a
flywheel.

Then he becomes aware of a faint radiance flickering over the walls.  It is a
cold and ethereal light, unlike the warm-white of their dive lights.

It grows brighter.  He turns slowly toward it.

The glow is moving beneath the steel grill of the deck, sending shafts of
cold light flickering upward hypnotically, coming toward him.

                                JAMMER
                Bud?  Is that you?

C.U. JAMMER, shielding his eyes, staring into the radiant source.

Guess what, Jammer?  It's not Bud.  In the brightest center of the glow,
SOMETHING is moving, a figure casting strange inhuman shadow across the walls.
Jammer blinks against the glare, his face registering total, outright
astonishment melting into terror.

The glare pulses subtly, hypnotically.  The shifting shadow falls across
Jammer.  He finally snaps out of his fixity...

Screaming and gulping air he spins away and starts clawing hand over hand
through the treacherous wreckage.

His harness catches on a twisted pipe.

He struggles, totally out of control... the big man reduced to a blind panic.

Jammer heaves forward with all his adrenalized strength.

He tears free of the entangling debris.  Launches like a torpedo... slamming
his backpack full force into the top sill of the hatchway.  His tri-mix
regulator takes the full brunt of the impact.

ON BUD, swimming furiously back toward Jammer's position.  The strange
radiance is gone.  His dive light flare back to full brightness.

                                BUD
                Jammer?  Answer me, buddy,  JAMMER?!

He reaches Jammer only to find him thrashing violently in place.  A seizure.
Bud grapples with him.

                                BUD
                Hang on, big guy.  Hand on!

Catfish, Sonny, and Finler arrive from the corridor a moment later.  They
leap into the fray.

                                BUD
                He's convulsing!

                                CATFISH
                It's his mixture!  Too much oxygen!

Then they're all yelling at once, grappling with the big man, struggling with
the valves on his breathing gear.

                                FINLER
                Crank it down, man!  We're gonna losing him...

                                BUD
                SHIT, it's stuck... goddamnit!

                                SONNY
                You got it?!  You got it?

                                BUD
                Yeah, yeah... yeah.  It's turning.

Jammer's convulsion ends.  He goes limp.

                                BUD
                We gotta get him out of here.  Come on!
                           (to Jammer)
                Hang on, buddy.

They drag Jammer's slack form into the corridor, hauling their way rapidly
back along the lifeline.

INT./EXT. CAB ONE & MONTANA SAIL                                        79

Lindsey is approaching the monolith of the sail, maneuvering to clear the
horizontal diving plane.  Then her lights go dim and her thrusters loose
power.

Suddenly a bright corona breaks around the bulk of the sail and SOMETHING
appears right in front of her, a glowing object moving like a bat out of
hell right at her!  It is slightly smaller than submersible and we only get
a glimpse.  What we think we see in the diffuse glow is a translucent ovoid,
open at the front with a spinning vortex of light inside... like some
hallucinatory jet engine.  And it's hauling ass.

Lindsey jinks left.  The object jogs right.  She fights the control as her
sub slews around, slamming broadside into the sail.  K-BAM!  Her power comes
back up.  Righting Can One, she spins to look through the aft viewport in
time to see the object racing away in a broad arc.  It pulls a high-G turn
and dives straight down.

We see the object zip behind Flatbed.  One Night can't see it.  The thing
spirals down into the darkness like a hit-and-run drunk, diving along the
wall into the abyss until it is lost to view.

HOLD ON Lindsey excited, amazed... dazed.  Her hands are shaking.  Suddenly
Bud's voice blares out over the open frequency.

                                BUD (V.O.)
                CAB ONE!  CAB ONE!  Meet me at Flatbed!  This
                is a diver emergency!!  Do you copy?  Lindsey?!

She has a hard time focusing on what he's saying.  Finally...

                                LINDSEY
                Copy you, Bud.  On my way.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. DEEPCORE INFIRMARY -- AN HOUR LATER                                80

Jammer is unconscious on a folding cot set up in the tiny cubicle of the
infirmary.  Monk, who is cross-trained as a medic as well as a demolitions
man, has hung an IV of something.  Bud and the SEAL are in the room, the
others hovering outside.

                                BUD
                Whattya think?

                                MONK
                I'm a medic, which is mostly about patching
                holes.  This type of thing... there's not much
                I can do.  The coma could last hours or days.

Bud, torn by guilt, gazes at the big man lying pathetically on the cot.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. CONSOLE MODULE                                                     81

The SEALs, minus Monk, are all gathered inside, debriefing with DeMarco via
closed-circuit video.

                                DEMARCO (video)
                Did any of you see it?

                                COFFEY
                Negative.  But there was definitely a Russian
                bogey.  The Brigman woman saw it.

                                DEMARCO
                CINCLANTFLT's gonna go apeshit.  Two Russian
                attack subs, a Tango and Victor, have been tracked
                within fifty miles of here... and now we don't
                know what the hell they are.  Okay, I don't have
                any choice.  I'm confirming you to go to Phase
                Two.

Wilhite and Schoenick glance uneasily at each other.

Coffey is silent.  He is vibrating with tension... his fists clenched to
prevent the shaking.  He is wrestling with the moment, knowing it is, in a
way, a point of no return.

                                DEMARCO
                Is there any problem?

                                COFFEY
                Yes... I mean no.  Negative, sir.

Coffey takes a deep breath.  Lets it out.  Phase Two is clearly a big deal.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. MAINTENANCE ROOM B/DARKROOM                                         82

The maintenance room doubles as a camera workstation.  An adjoining head serves
as darkroom.  Lindsey is glumly reassembling Cab One's camera housings.

                                BUD
                Did you get anything on the cameras.  Video or
                anything?

                                LINDSEY
                No.  Look, forget it.  I don't want to talk
                about it.

                                BUD
                Fine.  Be that way.

                                LINDSEY
                I don't know what I saw.  Okay?  Coffey wants to
                call it a Russian submersible, fine.  It's a
                Russian submersible.  No problem.

                                BUD
                But you think it's something else.  What?  One
                of ours?

                                LINDSEY
                No.

                                BUD
                Whose then?  Lindsey?  Talk to me...

Lindsey is wrestling with a feeling which is somehow also certain knowledge.

                                LINDSEY
                Jammer saw something in there, something that
                scared the hell out him--

                                BUD
                His mixture got screwed up.  He panicked and
                pranged his regulator.

                                LINDSEY
                But what did he see that made him panic?

                                BUD
                What do you think he saw?

                                LINDSEY
                I don't know.  I DON'T KNOW!

Hippy comes pounding up, sticks his head in, gesturing animatedly.

                                HIPPY
                Hey, you guys... hurry up, check this out!
                They're announcing it.

They follow him into the corridor, trotting down to the mess hall.

INT. MESS HALL                                                          83

General melee as they rush in, everybody focused on the TV.

                                CATFISH
                Quiet!  Quiet!

                                HIPPY
                Turn it up, bozo.

              ... the Kremlin continues to deny Russian
                involvement in the sinking of the Trident sub

                of the 156 crewmembers, who are all presumed
                dead at this time.  Civilian employees of a

                Hey, hey!  There's the Explorer.

A LONG LENSE VIDEO SHOT of the Benthic Explorer and the other vessels in a
stormy sea CUTS TO a shot of BILL TYLER, the on-scene reporter, in rain
gear, clutching his microphone.  He is on the deck of a Navy support ship,
being used as a staging area from the press, well away from the center of the
operation.

                                TYLER
                --there is a tremendous amount of activity.
                With Cuba only 80 miles away, the massive buildup
                of US ships and aircraft in the area has drawn
                official protest from Havana and Moscow and has
                led to a redirection of Soviet warships into the
                Caribbean theater.

                                ANCHORMAN
                How would you describe the mood there?

                                TYLER
                The mood is one of suspicion, even confrontation.
                A number of Russian and Cuban trawlers,
                undoubtedly surveillance vessels, have been
                circling within a few miles throughout the day,
                and Soviet aircraft have repeatedly been warned
                away from the area...

                This sucks.

INT. CORRIDOR/SUB BAY                                                   84

Bud, Lindsey, and Hippy walking along the corridor, Hippy in a black mood of
incipient paranoia.

                                BUD
                What's the matter with you?

                                HIPPY
                Now we're right in the middle of this big-time
                international incident.  Like the Cuban Missile
                Crisis or something.

                                LINDSEY
                Figured that out for yourself, did you?

                                HIPPY
                We got Russian subs creeping around.  Shit!
                Something goes wrong they could say anything
                happened down here, man.  Give our folks medals,
                know what I mean?

                                BUD
                Hippy, just relax.  You're making the women
                nervous.

                                LINDSEY
                Cute, Virgil.

                                HIPPY
                No, I mean it.  Those SEALs aren't telling us
                diddly.  Something's going on.

                                BUD
                Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy.

                                HIPPY
                Everything is.

One Night is pounding down the corridor from the sub bay.

                                ONE NIGHT
                Hurry up!  Coffey's splitting with Flatbed! He
                got me to show him the controls, then his guys
                suited up and they're rolling.

Bud breaks into a run, passing her.

                                BUD
                Goddamnit!  D'you tell him we need it right now?

                                ONE NIGHT
                I told him we had to get the umbilical unhooked
                ASAP.

Bud clears the door in time to see an empty moonpool, roiling with turbulence.
He runs to the edge and looks down.  Flatbed is a vague shape moving off.

                                BUD
                Unbelievable.

                                                                CUT TO:

EXT. EXPLORER BRIDGE -- DAY                                             86

The sky is charcoal, the sea is a mountain range of gray slopes.  Waves
thunder over the foredeck, whipped by eighty-know winds.  Men in life
jackets scurry like insects.  Off the port bow, the ASW destroyer ALBANY
vanishes and reappears among waves sixty feet tall.  McBride scream orders
that can't be heard to the crewmen on deck.  He staggers back along the bridge
railing.

McBride steps into the quiet of the control room.  He turns on De Marco.

                                MCBRIDE
                We're trying to get unhooked and get out of

                They'll be back in two hours.

                                MCBRIDE
                Two hours?!  We're gonna be getting the shit
                kicked out of us by our friend Fred in two hours!

De Marco's expression is infuriatingly calm... icy.  McBride looks at his
watch and swears under his breath.

For a second time the black hull of the ballistic missile sub is illuminated
by diver's lights.  Tiny figures, the divers move like moths around a distant
streetlight.  Wilhite, Monk and Schoenick are clustered around an open missile
hatch.  Using a large lift bag, they are removing the frangible fiberglass,
or 'diaphragm'.  Coffey pilots Flatbed with increasing deftness, deploying
the big arm to aid in the work.

DOWN ANGLE as the diaphragm lifts away... revealing the blunt nose of the
TRIDENT C-4 MISSLE.  Like looking down the barrel of a gun at the bullet
aimed right at you.

It is now clear what the SEALs are doing.  Using large lift bags and Flatbed's
big arm, they have pulled one of the Trident C-4 missiles partway out of its
launch tube, and have partially disassembled the nose-shroud, exposing
several of the MIRV warheads within.

Moving very carefully, Wilhite and Schoenick ease one of the individual MIRVs
out of its bracket.  Hanging under a lift-bag in a jerry-rigged harness, the
three-foot long warhead is move gently by the divers to the back of Flatbed.

Flatbed surfaces in boiling foam.  The rig crew are all waiting.  Like a
crack pit-crew Bud's people leap onto Flatbed while its deck is still awash
and start to work on to Navy divers, unsealing their helmets and uncoupling
their umbilicals.  Hippy and Bud start to untie a cylindrical object wrapped
in one of the SEAL's gear bags.  Coffey emerges from the hatch.

                                COFFEY
                Don't touch that.  Just step away.  Now!

                                COFFEY
                Monk, Schoenick... secure the package.

The two SEALs unlash the object in the black bag.  Bud an Lindsey exchange a
glance.  He glares at Coffey as they pass each other.  One Night nimbly
climbs the hatch-tower and drops in.  Bud swings the heavy hatch up,
balancing it, and grins down at One Night.

                                BUD
                This ain't no drill, slick.  Make me proud.

The big A-frame, massive as a railroad bridge, to which the umbilical from

Flatbed's manipulator has gripped the de-coupling mechanism when the cable

The winch man staggers along the railing, blasted by 80-knot winds.  He
sprints for the base of the enormous crane which supports the umbilical
winch.  A wave blasts him into the bulkhead.  He half-crawls to the ladder
going up to the winch-house.  As he climbs the winch's heave-compensator
slides up and down, FILLING FRAME behind him.

It is bottoming-out with a sound like a piledriver, overloaded by the strain

The deck is ripped upward as the entire 40-ton crane is pulled over by the
weight of Deepcore.  It topples in the launch well with a roar of tortured

tumbles between the twin hulls.  Trailing a vortex of foam and debris, it
roars down on us, FILLING FRAME WITH BLACKNESS.

The umbilical drops down in slack loops out of the blackness above, draping
itself over the habitat in large coils.  One Night pilots her submersible

Everyone hold their breath as the sonar return-pings get closer... and
closer.  And closer...

An ENORMOUS SHAPE plunged into the floodlight in front of the rig.

K-WHAM!!  The 40-ton crane hits like a flatiron thirty feet in front of them.
A clean miss.  Much WHOOPING AND CHEERING.  Then...

The crane topples slowly over the back.  It rolls down the slope of the drop-
off, gathering speed.  Then tumbles over the cliff into the abyssal canyon.
The coiled umbilical starts to pay out after it like rope after a harpoon.
And they're still attached.

                                LINDSEY
                Oh shit.

Bud sprints from Control, bouncing off the corridor walls as the rig
lurches and tilts.  The lights go out.  Emergency light come on.  He trips
and falls, scrambles up, running on.

IN THE LADDERWELL of trimodule C, Lindsey runs toward the machine rooms.
K-BOOM!  A searing bright EXPLOSION in the electrical room.  Flames roar
through the doorway.  She dashed to a seawater hose hanging nearby and starts
to unroll it.  She sees Coffey and Schoenick in maintenance, lashing down
the mystery package.

Monk is working in a spray of seawater, turning valves to stop the flow of
ruptured pipes.  Behind him, a wall of flame blossoms through the door from

Hippy runs in.  The place is going nuts.  Water floods from the moonpool as
the rig tilts.  Wilhite is dancing across the deck, leaping over compressed-
gas cylinders which are rolling around loose.  Cab One jumps clear off its
cradle and slides SCREECHING across the deck.  Wilhite, running before the
12-tom juggernaut, had no place to go.  The SEAL dives into the churning
moonpool.  Cab One slams into the end wall, then spins and rolls toward
Hippy.

He starts to run.  Drop something.  Looks back.

Beany, in his zip-loc bag, is lying in the path of the slide submersible.
Hippy runs back.  Scoops up the baggie.  Cab One FILLS FRAME behind him.
He makes it through the door an instant before the thing hits behind him,
buckling the steel doorframe.

Wilhite is clawing up the sheep skirting of the moonpool.  He gets his fingers
over the top.  Pulls himself up...

A steel helium tank slams against his fingers, crushing them, and he falls
back.  More tanks bounce over the lip of the pool, hammering Wilhite down
into the foaming water.

He doesn't surface.

Lew Finler, Tommy Ray Dietz, and Lupton McWhirter fight their way toward the

SIDE, we can see them screaming soundlessly at the tiny pressure window in

Nearby, Lindsey grabs Hippy's arm as he is running past and drags him into the
blazing compressor room.  Hands him her seawater hose.  Wide-eyes, he starts
blasting everything in sight with water.

                                LINDSEY
                No! Hold it on me!

She rushed into the teeth of the fire as Hippy blasts her with a spray of
water, following her into the intense heat.  She grabs Monk, who is
semiconscious, and drags him out of the blazing room... Hippy dancing back
with the hose, tripping, blasting her in the face.

But it works.  They get Monk clear.

INT. DRILL ROOM CORRIDOR                                                118

Bud comes pounding down the flooding corridor in time to see the water in the
drill room swirl above the pressure window, obscuring the faces of the
trapped men.  He claws futility at the door.  The motors and the fail-safe
latching mechanism are on the opposite side.  Through the pressure window he
watches helplessly as they drown.  We don't see what he sees, but we know
what he sees.  Suddenly the bulkhead next to him gives way and a freezing
torrent thunders in.  Bud is blown off his feet a hurled along the corridor.

He scramble up somehow, splashing waist deep toward the opposite end of the
corridor where another of the hydraulic doors is closing inexorably.  He's
not going to make it.  He reaches it a moment too late to squeeze through.
Grabs the edge of the door and desperately tries to stop it from closing with
the strength of this arms.  It doesn't work.  The steel door closes on the
fingers of his left hand, pinning them in the doorframe.

But something amazing happens.  His wedding ring lodges between the door and
frame, preventing his fingers from being crushed and the door from
sealing and locking.

It resists tons of pressure, denting but not collapsing.

The freezing sea pours in until only his head is clear.

                                BUD
                Heeyy!!  HHHEEEYYY!!

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR, Catfish and Sonny come pounding up.  They see
his face at the tiny window and his hand jammed in the door.  Sonny wedges
a crowbar in the narrow opening and starts to pry.  Catfish whips open his
jackknife and slashes the hydraulic hoses on the door actuator.  He is
sprayed with red hydraulic fluid, machine blood.

Together they force open the door.  Bud is blown through in a torture of
water.  Sonny is thrown back into some pipes.  Breaks his arm.

Together they somehow heave the door shut manually, cutting off the flow.
Catfish hammers the fail-safe latch home with the crowbar.

Bud lies gasping and shivering... staring at the tiny band of metal that
saved him.

                                                                DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. DEEPCORE/ONE HOUR LATER                                            A118

LOOKING DOWN THE WALL of the canyon as Big Geek moves beneath us, tilting up
to show Deepcore perched at the very edge of the abyss.  The rig is twisted
and dented, covered with loops of umbilical, trimodule-A a mass of wreckage.
The ROV passes across the front of the control module.  Through the front
port, two figures can be seen in the light of a single emergency lamp.

                                SONNY (V.O. static)
                Mayday, mayday.  This is Deepcore Two calling
                Benthic Explorer.  Do you read, over?

INT. CONTROL MODULE                                                     B118

Sonny flips some switches on the UQC acoustic transceiver.  Tries again.

                                SONNY
                Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer.  Do you read,
                over?  This is Deepcore--

                                BUD
                Forget it, Sonny.  They're gone.

INT. TRIMODULE C                                                        119

Bud walks down the corridor from control, slowly... as if carrying a great
weight.  The air is still thick with smoke.  The power off... everything
lit by emergency lights.  Makeshift quarters have been set up in the mess
hall, with blankets laid out on the tables, and with folding cots in the
storage room across the hall.  Jammer is still unconscious.  Coffey and
Schoenick bring Monk in on a stretcher, and set him up on a table.  He is
conscious but dazed with painkillers, his led splinted.

                                BUD
                Did you find Wilhite?

                                COFFEY
                No.

He and Bud lock eyes.  Bud bites back on his recriminations, but his gaze
blames Coffey.  He turns away.

                                COFFEY
                Brigman.
                              (Bud turns)
                I was under orders.  I had no choice.

Coffey's manner is subdued, contrite.  A marked contrast to his previous
brusque arrogance.  He's wrestling with his own loss, a sever blow to the
tight brotherhood of a SEAL unit.  Bud's anger is not dispelled.  But he
can't address it now.  He moves on.

PAST THE INFIRMARY, where Sonny Dawson is rigging a sling over his own broken
arm.  He cries out in pain, cursing at himself.  LOOKING DOWN THE CENTRAL WELL
as Bud crosses.  Down through the grill decking we can see the bottom level
of the module is flooded.  Catfish is down there welding, sending shivering
reflections through the chamber.

INT. MACHINE ROOM                                                       120

Lindsey is working, up to her knees in water.  She is covered with grease,
tools scattered around.  Bud puts his hand on her shoulder.  She looks up,
blows some hair out of her eyes.

                                BUD
                What's the scoop, ace?

                                LINDSEY
                I can get power to this module and sub-bay if
                I remote these busses.  I've gotta get past the
                mains, which are a total melt-down.

Rather than trigger anger and invective, the disaster seems to have affected
her in a different way.  She's accepted the situation, now that's it's done,
and is immersing herself in technical tasks, which are for her therapeutic.

                                BUD
                Need some help?

                                LINDSEY
                Thanks.  No, I can handle it.  Bud... there
                won't be enough to run the heaters.  In a couple
                hours this place is going to be as cold as a
                meat locker.

                                BUD
                What about O-2?

                                LINDSEY
                Brace yourself.  We've got about 12 hours worth
                if we close off the sections we're not using.

                                BUD
                The storm's gonna last longer than 12 hours.

                                LINDSEY
                I can extend that.  There's some storage tanks
                outboard on the wrecked module.  I'll have to go
                outside to tie onto them.

She goes back to her task, working efficiently with a socket wrench.

                                BUD
                Hey, Lins...
                          (she looks up)
                I'm glad your here.

                                LINDSEY
                Yeah?  Well I'm not.

The sub bay is still a mess.  Dark.  A few battery-operated lamps.  Flatbed
is back, floating in the moonpool.

One Night and Hippy are in deep concentration, piloting the two ROVs in a
damage survey of the rig.  Bud comes up behind them, check her screen first.
BIG GEEK'S MONITOR shows a view of the aft section of the rig.  The drilling
derrick had collapsed across Cab Three, totaling it.  A girder is jammed
through its acrylic front dome.

                                ONE NIGHT
                Right through the brainpan.  Deader'n dogshit,

Little Geek rises up through the open central hatch, pivoting in a circle to
scan the flooded interior.

INT. SUB BAY/R.O.V. STATION                                             B123

TIGHT ON VIDEO SCREEN, LITTLE GEEK'S POV.  The interior of the structure is a
shambles.  The lights of the little robot fall upon a figure... Perry.
Lying on the deck, almost looking like he's asleep.

                                HIPPY
                That's Perry.

                                BUD
                    (lets his breath out slowly)
                That's it then.  Finler, McWhirter, Dietz, and
                Perry.  Jesus.

                                HIPPY
                       (gestured at the screen)
                Do we just leave him there?

                                BUD
                Yeah, for now.  Our first priority's to get
                something to breathe.

                                                                CUT TO:

Catfish and Lindsey, in suits and helmets, drop down from the glare of the
moonpool onto the dark sea floor under the rig.  Walking, they pull their
umbilicals behind them and head out through the twisted wreckage.  Little
Geek follows along like a dog at their heels.  They settle beside a valve
assembly at the base of the wrecked module.

                                LINDSEY
                Cat, you tie onto this manifold.  There's some
                tanks on the other side; I'm gonna go check
                them out.

                                CATFISH
                You watch yourself.

He begins to attach one end of a coiled-up high-pressure hose to a manifold.
She takes the other end of the hose and moves off into the darkness.  Little
Geek goes with her faithfully.

INT. SUB BAY                                                            125

Cab One is hanging from the overhead crane while One Nigh works to repair it.
Bud is nearby, tending hose for the divers and handing her tools.  Talking
while they work.  Hippy is across the moonpool running Little Geek.

                                ONE NIGHT
                Gimme a three-eighths socket on a long extension.
                           (he hands it to her)
                So there you were--

                                BUD
                There we were, side by side, on the same ship,
                for two months.  I'm tool-pusher and we're
                testing this automated derrick of hers.  So, we
                get back on the beach and... we're living
                together.

                                ONE NIGHT
                Doesn't mean you had to marry her.

                                BUD
                We were due to go back out on the same ship.
                Six months of tests.  If you were married you
                got a state-room.  Otherwise it was bunks.

                                ONE NIGHT
                Okay, good reason.  Then what?

                                BUD
                It was alright for a while, you know.  But then
                she got promoted to project engineer on this
                thing, couple years ago.

                                ONE NIGHT
                She went front-office on you.  Tighten that for
                me, right there.  That's it.

                                BUD
                Well, you know Lindsey, too damn aggressive--
                Son of a--!!

He's jammed his fingers with a wrench torquing down a bolt.  Whips his hand
out.

                                BUD
                She didn't leave me... she just left me behind.

She puts her arm around his shoulders, somehow managing to be fraternal,
maternal and suggestive all at the same time.

                                ONE NIGHT
                Bud, let me tell you something.  She ain't half
                as smart as she thinks she is.

She smiles and pretends to kink Lindsey's air-hose.

ACROSS THE CHAMBER, Hippy scowls as Little Geek's screen starts to go haywire
with interference.

                                HIPPY
                Hey, Lindsey, you reading me?  Over.

Catfish is working on one side of the wrecked module while Lindsey is on the
other, out of sight.  She is standing on the bottom at the base of the
wreckage, checking valves on a rack of oxygen bottles amongst the wreckage.
Right at the edge of the canyon wall.  Behind her is a sheer drop to
nothingness

                                LINDSEY
                Yeah, Hippy, I read you.  What's the matter?

The reply is GARBLED by a wash of static.  Then, for no apparent reason,
Lindsey's helmet light begins to dim out.  Little Geek's lights fade.  His
motors whine to a stop.

ON CATFISH, as his lights drop to candleglows.

The emergency lights are dimming, like a brownout.  Bud grabs the diver
intercom mike.

                                BUD
                Lins, how're you doing?  Lindsey?

ON LINDSEY, as she fiddles with her lights and transceiver pack.

                                LINDSEY
                Catfish... I got a problem here.  You there?
                Catfish?

Behind her, SOMETHING rises from the depths.

It is the little vehicle she almost collided with at the Montana wreck.

It comes right up behind her.  She doesn't know it's there.  It hovers
sideways like a hummingbird, as if curious, trying to get a better look.  She
becomes aware of the pulsing glow on the ground around her.  She turns
slowly.  We see her react as the glowing, pulsing apparition is reflected in
her faceplate.

A more powerful glow washes up onto her from below.

Her eyes go down.  She gasps, absolutely stunned...

Above the edge of the wall, AN ENORMOUS SHAPE RISES SILENTLY OUT OF THE
DEPTHS.  Over sixty feet across.  It looks like a blown glass manta ray, its
transparent outer hull housing interior structures of great delicacy and
complexity, pulsing with a blue-violet glow.

Lindsey stand before it, unable to move.  Absolutely rapt.

Captivated by its ethereal beauty.  It begins to turn, majestically, one
rounded wing passing only a few feet above her.  She reaches up.  Touches it
as it passes over her.

Lindsey is without fear, completely mesmerized.

The thing completes its turn and dives gracefully down along the wall.  She
is gently lifted by a backwash of turbulent water.

About that time, Lindsey remembers she has a still camera, a little Nikonos.

She fumbles to set focus and exposure with her bulky gloves as the beautiful
machine glides into the depths.  Gets all set for a shot and...

WOOSH!  The little 'scoutschip' whizzes past her from behind, startling her.
She completely misses the shot of the 'manta ship'.  She pivots, trying to
get a shot of the little one as it zig-zags down along the wall, fast as a
meteor.  CLICK.  She get a shot a second before it disappears.

From around the flank of the rig module, Catfish appears.  Their com-sets
come backs to life, along with their lights.

                                LINDSEY
                You better not say you missed that.

                                CATFISH
                Missed what?

                                                                CUT TO:

TIGHT ON SLIDE STRIP.  Lindsey's fingertip in for scale.  The shot is black
with a little squiggle of light in the center.  Pathetic.

                                BUD
                Nice shot, Lins.

                What is that?  You drop your dive light?

WIDER, SHOWING THE GROUP huddled around Lindsey who has her freshly-processed
slide roll laid out on the pinball machine, using it as a light table.

                                LINDSEY
                Come on, you guys... look, this is the little
                one right here.  You can see how it's kind of
                zigging around.

                                BUD
                If you say so.  It could be anything.

                                LINDSEY
                I'm telling you what is there.  You're just not
                hearing.  The impulses somehow aren't getting
                from you ears to your brainpan.  There's something
                down there.  Something not... us.

She looks around.  Sees a lot of skepticism in the eyes around her.

                                CATFISH
                Y'all could be more specific.

                                LINDSEY
                Not us.  Not human.  Get it?  Something non-
                human, but intelligent...

                                HIPPY
                You mean like Coffey?

Lindsey is reddening.  Despite her conviction, this is really hard.

                                LINDSEY
                A non-terrestrial intelligence.

                                HIPPY
                Non-Terrestrial Intelligence.  NTIs.  Yeah, I
                like that better then UFOs.  Although that
                works too... Underwater Flying Objects.

Hippy is not really mocking her.  He's actually into it.  But it has that
effect.  Catfish is eyeing Lindsey like he's never seen her before.

                                CATFISH
                Are we talkin' little space friend here?

                                HIPPY
                Right on!  Hot rods of the Gods.  Right, Lins?
                Hey, no really!  It could be NTIs.  The CIA has
                known about them for years.  They abduct people
                all the time.  There was this woman I knew in
                Albuquerque who--

                                LINDSEY
                Hippy, do me a favor... stay off my side.

Bud takes her firmly by the arm.  Heads her out into the corridor.

                                BUD
                Lindsey, will you step into my office for a
                minute...

INT. CORRIDOR/LADDER WELL                                               130

He propels her along the corridor, away from the mess hall doorway.  They
face each other in the narrow space.

                                BUD
                Jesus, Lindsey--

                                LINDSEY
                Bud, something really important is happening
                here.

                                BUD
                Look.  I'm just trying to hold this situation
                together.  I can't allow you to cause this kind
                of hysteria--

                                LINDSEY
                Who's hysterical?  Nobody's hysterical!

They're talking across each other, not connecting.  Bud weary and frustrated.
Lindsey is cranked up with the afterglow of her encounter.

                                BUD
                All I'm saying is when you're hanging on by your
                fingernails, you don't go waving you arms around.

                                LINDSEY
                I saw something!  I'm not going to go back there
                and say I didn't see it when I did.  I'm sorry.

                                BUD
                God, you are the most stubborn woman I ever knew.

                                LINDSEY
                I need you to believe me, Bud.  Look at me.  Do
                I seem stressed out?  Any of the symptoms of
                pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?

                                BUD
                No.

                                LINDSEY
                Bud, this is me, Lindsey.  Okay?  You know me
                better than anybody in the world.  Now watch my
                lips... I saw these things.  I touched one of
                them.  And it wasn't some clunky steel can like
                we would build... it glided.  It was the most
                beautiful thing I've ever seen.

Bud is stilled by her intensity.  She moves close to him.  Eyes alive and
luminous.

                                LINDSEY
                It was a machine, but it seems almost alive.
                Like a... dance of light.  Bud, you have to
                trust me... please.  I don't think they mean us
                harm.  I don't know how I know that, it's just a
                feeling.

                                BUD
                How can I go on a feeling?  You think Coffey's
                going to go on you 'feeling'?

                                LINDSEY
                We all see what we want to see... Coffey looks
                and he sees Russians, he sees hate and fear.
                Bud, you have to look with better eyes than
                that.

Bud has been taking this all in.  His eyes tracking her face.  He closes his
eyes, taking a deep breath.  It's so hard for him to do this, but...

                                BUD
                I can't, Lindsey.  I'm sorry.  How can I?

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. MESS HALL -- LATER                                                 131

Coffey has Bud, Lindsey and several of the rig crew gathered for a little
summit.  Lindsey is withdrawn, sitting far from the others, a self-imposed
exile.  They're all wearing warm clothes and hugging themselves.  Their
breath shows in the air.

                                COFFEY
                I want 'round-the-clock manning of the sonar
                shack and the exterior cameras.  We need early
                warning if the Soviet craft try another incursion.

                                LINDSEY
                          (rolling her eyes)
                Gimme a break!  Coffey, these things live three
                and a half miles down on the bottom of an abyssal
                trench!  Trust me... they're not speaking
                Russian.

Coffey looks at her for a moment, then goes on as if she hadn't spoke.

                                COFFEY
                            (to One Night)
                Why haven't you finished repairs on the
                hydrophone transmitter yet?

                                ONE NIGHT
                I was having my nails done.

Coffey is sweating, despite the chill.  Keeps his hands clenched in fists so
they won't see how bad the tremors have gotten.

                                COFFEY
                Get something straight.  You people are under my
                authority--

                                CATFISH
                Look, podner... we don't work for you, we don't
                take orders from you, and we don't much like you.
                In addition to which your momma dresses you
                funny.

Coffey's eyes are straight razors.  He slashes them from face to face.  You
can see him tightening up like a clockspring, losing control of the situation
in front of his own men.  Bud defuses it.

                                BUD
                'Fish'?

                                CATFISH
                Yuh?

                                BUD
                Take the first watch in sonar.  Hippy, you
                handle the exterior surveillance.  One Night, see
                if you can get that transmitter working for me,
                okay?

                                ONE NIGHT
                Gimme a couple of hours.

HOLD ON COFFEY as everyone leaves.  Winding tighter.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. MAINTENANCE ROOM B -- LATER                                        132

Coffey and Schoenick are bending over the warhead.  They have a small port
removed and are attaching waterproof leads from an ELECTRONIC DETONATOR.  The
black box Lindsey glimpsed earlier.  As the two SEALs work like surgeons, we
see past Coffey's shoulder to a hemispherical window behind him, which looks
out into the perpetual blackness.  Something appears... a goofy shark face.

Big Geek rises silently in front of the port.  It moves a little, trying to
get a peek over Coffey's shoulder.

INT. CONTROL MODULE/ROV SHACK                                           133

Hippy is twiddling his joysticks, watching the screen like a ferret.

                                HIPPY
                Come on... move to the left... just a little
                more... come on, A.J. Squared Away... that's
                it--

ON THE SCREEN, Geek's POV.  Coffey is blocking Hippy's view of whatever it is
they're working on.  Abruptly, be moves.  The warhead is lying there in plain
sight, detonator wires hooked up.  Hippy's eyes bug out.  He knows exactly
what it is.

                                HIPPY
                Pretty radical, guys.  Pretty radical.

He hurries to the VCR and puts it into RECORD.

INT. CONTROL MODULE/ROV SHACK -- MINUTES LATER                          134

Video image of the SEALs working.  It FREEZES on a clear view of the warhead.

                                HIPPY (V.O.)
                Say hello to MIRV.

Bud has his face right up to screen.  He frowns, skeptical.

                                HIPPY
                Come on, man.  What else could it be?

                                BUD
                Why bring it here?

                                HIPPY
                It's gotta be, like, an emergency plan to keep
                it away from the Russians... Hotwire one of the
                nukes with some kinda detonator, put it back in
                the sub, and fry the whole thing, slicker'n snot.
                Oh, uh... hi, Lins.

Bud whips around.  Lindsey, standing quietly in the doorway.  It's apparent
from expression she's been watching them for some time.  She looks ready to
kill somebody.  Then she's gone.

INT. CORRIDOR                                                           135

Bud catches up to her in the corridor, trying to put the brakes on her.

                                LINDSEY
                Look, goddamnit, if you won't do something about
                it, I will.

                                BUD
                Lindsey!  Wait a second--

She reaches the watertight door to Maintenance Room B.  It's locked.  Before
Bud can stop her she grabs a fire-extinguisher off the wall and pounds on
the steel door like a big gong.  BOOM!  BOOM!  BOOM!

Needless to say, it opens.  She pushes past Schoenick, see the bomb lying
there naked.

                                LINDSEY
                You've got some huevos bringing this...
                thing... into my rig!  With everything that's
                been going on up in the world, you bring a
                nuclear weapon in here?  Does this strike anyone
                as particularly psychotic, or is it just me?

                                COFFEY
                You don't need to know the details of this
                mission... you're better off if you don't.

                                LINDSEY
                You're right... I don't.  I just need to know
                that this thing is out of here!  You hear me,
                Roger Ramjet?

                                COFFEY
                Mrs. Brigman, you're becoming a serious impediment
                to this mission.  I believe the stress is
                affecting you.
                            (to Schoenick)
                Escort her to quarters and have Monk prepare a
                tranquilizer.

Schoenick takes her arm in a tight grip.

                                LINDSEY
                Bullshit, you can't do that.  Oww... goddamnit!

Lindsey goes bananas, trying to get Schoenick's big hands off her arms.  Bud
slams his hand down on the intercom button.

                                BUD
                Emergency!  Maintenance room B.  Emergency!

He pulls the fire alarm for good measure and spins on Coffey... warning him
with a look that is not to be messed with.  Coffey is braced back against the
worktable... an odd stance, with one arm behind his back.  Suddenly there's
a crowd outside the door as Catfish, Hippy, One Night, and Sonny come running
up.  Confrontation time.

Sirens going.  About a million volts of electricity in the air.  Bud braces
Schoenick.

                                BUD
                Let her go.  Do it... right now.

He does.  Lindsey jerks away.  Rubs her arms.

                                LINDSEY
                You dumb jarhead motherf--

                                BUD
                Chill out, Lindsey!!

                                CATFISH
                What's the problem?

Everyone is frozen in place.  Bud a Coffey... snake and mongoose, glaring.
Bud pulls Lindsey back into the corridor.

                                BUD
                Nothing.  We were just leaving.
                              (to her)
                Weren't we?

ANGLE FROM BEHIND COFFEY, as Bud's group moves out of sight up the corridor.
Hands behind his back.  In his hand, cocked, finger on the trigger, is the
.45.  He turns and sets it on the table, steadying himself as if in the wind.
he seems to sag.  When he looks at Schoenick, his eyes are wounds.  A hunted
animal.  Voice shaky.

                                COFFEY
                They can't be trusted.  They're turning against
                us.  We may have to take... steps.

INT. CORRIDOR                                                           136

Lindsey, Bud, Hippy.  Bud slows, letting them trail behind the others.

                                BUD
                Lins, stay away from that guy.  I mean it.

                                HIPPY
                Yeah.  The dude's in bad shape... you see his
                hands?

                                LINDSEY
                He's got the shakes?

                                BUD
                Look, the guy's operating on his own, cut off
                from chain of command.  He's exhibiting symptoms
                of pressure-induced psychosis.  And he's got a
                nuclear weapon.  So, as a personal favor to me...
                will you put your tongue in neutral for a while?

                                HIPPY
                Man, I give this a sphincter-factor of about
                nine point five.

INT. MAINTENANCE ROOM B                                                 137

Coffey goes to the dome port.  Looks past his shrunken and twisted reflection
into the void.  Eternal night.

ANGLE FROM OUTSIDE.  Coffey's face in the window.  Stuck to the acrylic
bubble beside him is one of those Garfields, suction cups on its paws.  Coffey
stares out.  Behind his eyes, his brain is like that cat, just hanging on,
spreadeagle and screaming.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. SUB-BAY/DIVE-PREP AREA                                             138

Under a single worklight, a couple of conspirators.  Lindsey and Hippy hunch
over Big Geek.  The ROV grins maniacally with goofy shark teeth.

                                LINDSEY
                Look, you can just punch into his little chip
                where you want him to go, and he goes, right?

                                HIPPY
                Well, yeah, but the tether off it ain't gonna
                be fancy.  When he gets down there he'll just
                sit, like a dumb-shit.  Unless something wanders
                through view of the camera, you'll get nada.

                                LINDSEY
                Let's go for it.  We could get lucky.

INT. CONTROL MODULE                                                      139

ONE SURVEILLANCE MONITOR.  Lindsey and Hippy next to Big Geek.  Their voices
are tinny but intelligible.

                                HIPPY (V.O.)
                I don't know.  I really oughta talk to Bud about
                this.

E.C.U. COFFEY.  Watching them in the dark.  Alone.

                                LINDSEY (V.O.)
                No.  Just you and me.  We get some proof, then
                tell them.  Hippy, look... if was can prove to
                Coffey it's not Russians, maybe he'll ease off
                the button a little.

                                HIPPY (V.O.)
                I gotta tell you, that guy scares me a lot more
                than whatever's down there.  A.J. Squared Away
                goddamn jarhead robot.  Okay, gimme a couple
                hours on this.

Coffey watches, his jaw clenched.

INT. QUARTERS/MESS HALL                                                 140

The lights are down.  Those who can are grabbing some sleep.  Snoring comes
from one of the bunkrooms as Lindsey passes.  In the mess hall, Catfish and
Bud are crashed out on the tables, wrapped in blankets.  The cold has gotten
intense.  Water drips.  The walls sweat with condensation.  Lindsey can see
her breath as she makes coffee.  She carries a cup over to Monk, who is a
face in a pile of blankets.  A hand comes out, takes the coffee.

                                MONK
                Thanks.

Lindsey sips hers, staring.  Her thoughts are far away... in the bottomless
pit.  She is leaning up against the table where Bud is sleeping.  His soft
snoring downshifts into a loud rasp.  Lindsey touches him gently on the
shoulder.

                                LINDSEY
                Virgil, turn on your side.

Bud grunts and turns without waking, an automatic response.  The snoring
stops.  It is a quiet, intimate moment, a reminder of the mileage these two
have logged together.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. SONAR SHACK                                                        141

Sonny has made himself comfortable in front of the screens.  Too comfortable.
He's asleep, chin on his chest.  On the main passive-sonar screen, an almost
imperceptibly faint trace appears.  A HUM, which is by now familiar, becomes
audible.  Sonny shifts in his seat.  Doesn't wake.

INT. SUB BAY                                                            142

Hippy puts his tools away, finished with the modifications to Big Geek.

                                HIPPY
                All set, big guy.  Hey, I told you to wipe that
                grin off your face.

He yawns as he shambles across the chamber to the corridor door.  Switches off
the lights.  Goes out.

Quiet lapping of water in the moonpool.  A beat.  Then...

A cold luminosity suffuses the water beneath the moonpool opening, sending
shadows shifting across the top of the chamber.  The surface begins to
pulsate.

Suddenly, the water itself rises, forming itself into a shifting, shimmering
pseudopod as big around as a man's body.  The transparent form pulses... an
amoebic mass shivering in the air.

It stretches, becoming a more refined form.  Like a blindly probing glass
python, it elongates and weaves across the room.  It extends and extends,
stretching out from the moonpool, a shimmering tentacle.  The 'head' or tip,
a featureless liquid bulb, seems somehow to be scanning as it moves forward,
as if it can see where it's going.

INT. CORRIDOR                                                           143

Hippy trudges along the dark corridor.  He reaches the men's head and goes in.
As the door closes, the tip of the liquid pseudopod extends into the corridor
B.G.  It 'looks' left and right.  Then extends the length of the corridor,
holding itself a couple feet off the floor like a weightless snake.

INT. TRIMODULE B/LADDERWELL/BUNKROOM/MESS HALL                          144

LOOKING DOWN three levels through the central ladderwell between the
cylinders.  The pseudopod enters and undulates upward.

FROM INSIDE THE MAKESHIFT BUNKROOM, we see its tip extend inside.

Sonny and One Night are snoring, oblivious.  Jammer is still unconscious.  The
pseudopod, taking its time, checks them out and then moves on.

IN THE MESS HALL, it's dark and quiet.  Lindsey has even fallen asleep in her
chair, her head buried in her arms on the table.  The shimmering tentacle
enters the room in total silence.  It sways gracefully in to air, searching.
It undulates across the room, hanging about five feet in the air, surveying
everything.  It moves past Lindsey.  Sensing something, she lifts her head,
turning... sees the apparition next to her.

Her eyes go wide.  Amazement, but not fear.  The tentacle is moving on, still
searching.  Lindsey shakes Bud awake, clapping her hand over his mouth.

Bud blinks twice, then freezes.  When she lowers her hand his mouth is hanging
open like a total goon.

Bud chucks his pillow are Catfish, on the next table.

Catfish cracks one eye open.  Turns away.  Turns right back... both eyes open
now.  Sensing movement, the thing turn back toward them.  It seems to
recognize Lindsey.  It doubles back on itself in a loop and comes right up to
her.  She holds her ground, fascinated.

The bulbous tip forms suddenly into a human face... her face.  It is water,
still clear and undulating... but definitely Lindsey.  She gasps in surprise.
The liquid-Lindsey gasps soundlessly... a perfect mimic of her expression.
Lindsey laughs involuntarily.  It laughs... without sound.  Lindsey makes a
face, sticking out her tongue... testing it.

The liquid-Lindsey does the same.  Bud has just had the rug jerked out from
under his sense of what is possible and what isn't, but he's taking it pretty
will, considering.

                                BUD
                            (whispering)
                I think it likes you.

                                LINDSEY
                It's trying to communicate.

Her liquid face suddenly transforms into a likeness of Bud's.

She reaches out her hand slowly.  Gingerly, her fingers touch the surface.
Ripples extend outward from the contact, across Bud's features.

Her fingertips break effortlessly through the surface, just like she's
dipping her hand into a bowl of water, except sideways.  She draws her wet
fingers out and studies them, amazed.  Touches one fingertip to her tongue.

                                LINDSEY
                Seawater.

The pseudopod pulls back from her.  It loops in the air dramatically, full
circle... and ties itself into a knot.  As the knot tightens down, it melts
back into the body.  The 'disappearing knot' trick.

Lindsey laughs, grinning with the open wonder and delight of a child at a
magic show.  She is transported.

                                LINDSEY
                Show off.

She looks at Bud.  He grins broadly.  He's with her now.

The stunned group watches as the thing moves on across the room.  Out to the
corridor

INT. SUB-BAY                                                            145

Coffey and Schoenick enter the back way, through the dive-prep area.  They see
the pseudopod arching from the moonpool big as a treetrunk.  Coffey's mind is
blown.  We can smell the insulation burning.  He just stares.

INT. CORRIDOR/MAINTENANCE ROOM B                                        146

The water tentacle enters and moves toward the hot-wired warhead.  It studies
the device for a few seconds.  Bud and Lindsey enter through a side door, in
time to see the tentacle divide into four tendrils which wrap around the
warhead.  They begin to lift it off its cart.

INT. SUB BAY                                                            147

Coffey finally jump-starts his brain.  In a flash of insight, he runs to the
big sliding door through which the pseudopod stretches into the corridor.  He
and Schoenick heave on the door.  Like a guillotine blade it slices
effortlessly through it.

VARIOUS ANGLES -- CORRIDORS, MESS HALL, LADDERWELL, MAINTENANCE... as the
body of the pseudopod collapses, splashing on the floor.  It reverts to
nothing more than a long puddle of simple seawater.  As the tendrils dissolve,
the warhead slams back down onto the cart, unharmed.  ON COFFEY'S SIDE ON THE
DOOR, however, the "stump" rears back like a cobra.  It withdraws rapidly into
the moonpool.  The glow fades away.

INT. SONAR SHACK                                                        148

Sonny wakes up with a start as the HUM revs up into a LOUD WHINE and then
fades away.  He scrambles to track it.  Too late.

INT. CORRIDOR                                                           149

Hippy emerges from the can and looks down, puzzled, at the puddle running the
length of the corridor.  He missed the whole thing.

INT. MESS HALL                                                          150

Light on.  Everybody there.  Lindsey is really strutting, high on life, now
that she's been proven right.

                                LINDSEY
                Okay, raise your hand if you think that was a
                Russian water-tentacle.  Lieutenant?  No?  Well,
                a breakthrough.

Coffey is looking out from under his eyebrows like Nicholson in "The Shining".
Bud give her a warning look.  Don't poke at the rattler.

                                BUD
                You done impressing yourself, ace?

                                ONE NIGHT
                No way that could just be seawater.

                                LINDSEY
                They must've learned how to control water... I
                mean at a molecular level.  They can plasticize
                it, polymerize it... whatever.  Put it under
                intelligent control.

                                BUD
                Maybe their whole technology is based on that.
                Controlling water.

Coffey is hunched over, elbows on his knees.  His hands are out of sight.  His
arm is moving in a slow rhythm.  We can't see what he's doing.

                                HIPPY
                That thing was probably their version of Big
                Geek... like an ROV.

                                CATFISH
                Just checking is out, huh?  How come?

ANGLE UNDER THE TABLE, showing what Coffey is doing.  He has his K-BAR KNIFE
gripped white-knuckle in one hand.  He is drawing it slowly and repeatedly
across the skin of the other forearm.  Neat chevrons of blood from wrist to
elbow.

C.U. COFFEY -- He doesn't flinch.  His eyes are hard and bright as diamond
drills.  No one notices.  He's keeping the edge.

                                LINDSEY
                They're curious, maybe.  We could be the first
                people they've seen up close.

                                SONNY
                Hope they don't judge the whole race offa us.

                                CATFISH
                Maybe I oughta shave.

Coffey stands abruptly, snags Schoenick with his eyes, and leaves, walking
through the group as if they were smoke.  This cold behavior brings the mood
down a notch.

INT. CORRIDOR/MAINTENANCE ROOM B                                        151

Outside the mess hall, Coffey pauses, listening to the conversation resume.
Bright speculation, a few jokes.  Coffey is visible shaking.  Breathing hard.
Pupils dilated.  Schoenick looks at him with concern.

                                COFFEY
                It went straight for the warhead.  And they
                think it's cute.

                                SCHOENICK
                You need to get some sleep.

Coffey walks away without hearing him.  Schoenick catches up.

INT. MAINTENANCE                                                        152

The door opens in the dark room.  Coffey enters, moving with purpose.  He
pulls his gear bag out from under the work table.  Unzips it.  Pulls out a
short-barreled CAR-15 assault rifle.

                                COFFEY
                We have no way of warning the surface.  Do you
                know what that means?

Schoenick doesn't know.  He hopes Coffey knows.  Because he's a fearless man
who's discovering what it is to be afraid.  Coffey inserts the magazine with
a CLACK!  Snaps the bolt.  Tosses the rifle to Schoenick.

                                COFFEY
                It means... whatever happens is up to us.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. CORRIDOR/MAINTENANCE -- LATER                                      153

Hippy passes the maintenance room.  Looks in.  The warhead and its cart are
missing.  He looks around.  Heads toward the sub-bay.

INT. MESS HALL                                                          154

The discussion, still in progress.

                                ONE NIGHT
                You think they're from down there originally?
                Or from... you know.

She jerks her thumb toward the ceiling.

                                LINDSEY
                I think they're from 'you know'.  Some place
                that has similar conditions... cold, intense
                pressure.  No light.

                                CATFISH
                Happy as hogs in a waller down there, prob'ly.

INT. CORRIDOR/SUB BAY                                                   155

Hippy freezes in the corridor as he hears a loud ratcheting sound echoing from
the sub-bay.  He edges forward slowly, trying to keep his feet silent on the
steel floor.  Slides up along the wall next to the door.  Inches his eye
around the doorframe.  Across the room. Schoenick is working with a chainfall,
lowering Big Geek onto the MIRV warhead, which is still on its cart.  He
begins to attach them together with a sling of tie-down straps.

Hippy lets his breath out slowly.  His expression is Holy Shit.

He slides back along the corridor wall, silently.  Away from the door.  Then
turn turns quickly to go... WHAM!  Coffey slams him up against the wall!
.45 pressed to Hippy's temple.  Hippy gulping air as Coffey ears back the
hammer.

                                COFFEY
                Sniff something did you, rat boy?

INT. MESS HALL                                                          156

The meeting is breaking up as the door CLANGS open and Hippy is thrusted
inside.  His hands are taped behind his back and he stumbles onto his face.
Coffey steps through smoothly, straight-arming the .45.  Schoenick flanks him
with the assault rifle aimed at the group.

                                COFFEY
                FREEZE!  Don't move.  That's it.
                              (to Monk)
                Here, hold this a second.  We're going to phase
                three.

He hands his gun to Monk, with the assumption of absolute loyalty from a team
member.  Monk's eyes move between Coffey and the pistol.  We can't tell what
he's thinking.  Coffey grabs Hippy and shoves him onto a chair.

                                HIPPY
                They're using Big Geek to take the bomb to the
                NTIs!  We set it up to go right to them.

Lindsey looks stricken.  Her plan is betraying them all.

                                LINDSEY
                Oh my God...  Oh no...
                        (steps toward Coffey)
                Please, you can't.  Coffey, think about what
                you're doing... for God's sake--

Coffey lets her approach him, his eyes glittering.

Without warning he grabs her by the hair and hurls her against the Coke
machine, pinning her there with one hand.  Bud leaps forward.

                                SCHOENICK
                GET BACK!

Bud freezes.  The rifle's muzzle is aimed for a heart-shot.

Coffey moves up close to Lindsey.

                                COFFEY
                This is something I've wanted to do since I
                first met you.

His hand reaches down, OUT OF FRAME.  We hear something RIP.  His hand comes
back up... holding a piece of gaffer's tape.

He slaps it over her mouth.  Then pushes her down into a chair.

Hippy looks at Monk and Schoenick.

                                HIPPY
                You boss is having a full-on meltdown.  Guy's
                fixing to pull the pin on fifty kilotons and
                we're all ringside!

                                MONK
                What's the timer set for?

                                SCHOENICK
                Three hours.

                                COFFEY
                Shut up!  Don't talk!

                                MONK
                We can't get to minimum-safe-distance in three
                hours.  The shockwave will kill us.  It'll crush
                this rig like a semi driving over a beer can.

                                COFFEY
                Shut up!  SHUT UP!  What's the matter with you?!

Everybody is twitching a hyper.  Schoenick is white-knuckling his assault
rifle... looking from Monk to Coffey to the group.

                                COFFEY
                Just stay calm.  The situation is under control.

Coffey backs out quickly with Schoenick.

INT. CORRIDOR                                                           157

Coffey dogs down the watertight door and wedges a piece of steel pipe into
the mechanism so it can't be opened.

                                COFFEY
                Stay here.

Schoenick take a position in front of the door.  Coffey turns and runs through
the corridor like demons are chasing him.

INT. MESS HALL                                                          158

Their only hope is to sway Schoenick.  But the SEAL's fear is making him the
perfect machine, totally dependent on external orders.  And his orders are
clear.  They can see him through the tiny window in the door.  Lindsey rips
the tape painfully off her mouth.

                                LINDSEY
                Schoenick... your Lieutenant is about to make
                a real bad career move...

                                HIPPY
                That guy's crazier'n a shithouse rat!

                                BUD
                We have to stop him!  Schoenick!!

They pound on the door.  Schoenick turns and hangs his cap over the tiny
window.

INT. SUB BAY                                                            159

Using the chainfall, Coffey maneuvers the completed Geek/MIRV package over
the back of Flatbed, obviously preparing to use the submersible to take it
out and launch it.

INT. MESS HALL                                                          160

Lindsey is up next to the door, with Bud.

                                LINDSEY
              ... he's about to declare war on an alien species,
                Schoenick, just when they're trying to make
                contact with us.
                                (to Bud)
                I think I'm reaching him.

There is a CLUNK-CLATTER and the door unlatches.

                                LINDSEY
                See?

The door opens.  Jammer is standing there.  Schoenick is in a heap against
the far wall, moaning.  Jammer hands the rifle to Hippy as he walks in.  Hippy
turns to cover the other SEAL.  Monk puts his hands up, passively.

                                MONK
                I'm the least of your problems.

Bud appraises Jammer, who seems a little weak and dazed but basically okay.

                                BUD
                Thanks.  How you feeling, big guy?

                                JAMMER
                Figured I was dead, there, when I seen that
                angel comin' toward me.

They all look at him for a second.  What?

                                BUD
                Uh, okay, right.  You can tell us about it
                later.  Let's go.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. TRIMODULE C/LADDERWELL                                             161

Bud drops down the ladder, INTO FRAME, followed by the others.  He tries the
door into the main corridor.  The wheel won't turn.  The others get on it.
Won't budge.

                                BUD
                He's jammed the mechanism.

                                LINDSEY
                Now what?

They're locked in trimodule-C.  No other doors give access to the sub-bay
corridor.  Bud's mind is racing.  He drops down the ladder to Level One, into
about two feet of water.  He reaches down and open the emergency lockout
hatch.  Takes off his boots.

                                BUD
                Okay, I'm gonna free-swim to hatch six... get
                inside, get the door open from the other side.

                                LINDSEY
                Bud, that water's only a couple degrees above
                freezing.

                                BUD
                Then I guess you better wish me luck, huh?

Catfish is pulling his boots off as well.

                                CATFISH
                Wish us luck.
                       (hands his wallet to Hippy)
                'Case I don't die.  Okay, Bud... let's go,
                podner, I ain't got all day.

Bud clasps him on the shoulder and starts hyperventilating.  He drops into
the water.

EXT. DEEPCORE/TRIMODULE C                                               162

Bed shoots down through the hatch.  The cold hits him list a fist, becoming
instantly paralyzing.  He starts kicking in powerful strokes through the dark
water, maneuvering around tangles of umbilical cable twisted tubular steel.
Catfish is behind him, swimming like hell.  They reach hatch six.  Together
they spin the wheel and heave upward, opening it.

INT.  TRIMODULE D/LEVEL ONE                                             163

Bud surges up into the lock.  Catfish jams into the tiny airspace with him.
They try the upper hatch.  Jammed.  They're both panting with the exertion
and intense cold.

                                BUD
                Hafta... go on to... the moonpool.  Only way.

                                CATFISH
                I can't... make it... podner.

Bud looks at Catfish, shivering and heaving, wide-eyed.

                                BUD
                Okay, Cat.  You head back.

Bud hyperventilates rapidly and pikes over diving back out through the hatch.

EXT. DEEPCORE                                                           164

Bud is stroking rapidly through the tangle of pipes and conduit.  He sees the
lit rectangle of the moonpool far ahead.

INT. SUB BAY                                                            165

In the moonpool, Bud surface with an explosive gasp beside the full of
Flatbed.  His wracked breathing is masked by the WHINE of HYDRAULICS as Coffey
uses the external controls to extend Flatbed's big hydraulic arm, locking
the Geek/MIRV in its gripper.

Bud strokes to a point where Coffey can't see him and heaves up out of the
water onto the deck of the pool.  He lies gasping behind Cab One's cradle.
His limbs are wooden and unresponsive from the cold.  His fingers are
completely numb.  He hugs himself, putting his hands under his armpits.
Scans the situation.  He can't get to the door, which is across the room,
without Coffey seeing him.

INT. CONTROL MODULE                                                     166

Lindsey watching the whole thing going down, ON THE SCREEN, a high angle of
the sub bay... Bud moving up on Coffey.

                                HIPPY
                He can't get to the door... I think he's going
                to try and take him himself.

                                LINDSEY
                He couldn't be that dumb.  The guy's a trained
                killer.  Bud's idea of a fight is arm-wrestling
                One Night over laundry duty.

ON THE SCREEN, Bud picks up a piece of pipe.  Hefts it.  Moves forward,
crouched... stalking.  Lindsey yells at the screen in frustration.

                                LINDSEY
                BUUUUUD!!

INT. SUB BAY                                                            167

Bud chucks a tool across the chamber, creating a clattering distraction, then
wades in with the pipe in a vicious swing to the back of Coffey's knees,
taking him down.  Coffey spins even as he falls, catching Bud in a scissor
kick that topples him.

Grappling, they fall together into the freezing water.

Coffey is momentarily stunned by the cold, giving Bud time to haul himself
out, hoping to make it to the door.

Coffey launches from the water and grabs him legs.

He pulls himself up as Bud kick out.  Claws his way viciously over Bud's
body until he has him pinned to the deck.  Then he pulls out the .45.

Put it unceremoniously to Bud's forehead.

INT. CONTROL MODULE                                                     168

                                LINDSEY
                NOOO!!

INT. SUB BAY                                                            169

Coffey pulls the trigger... CLICK.  Bud flinches, then opens his eyes,
staring cross-eyed at the muzzle of the .45.  Coffey cocks it and tries
again.  CLICK.  Nothing.  Really pissed off beyond description, Bud hurls
the commando off him with a powerful heave, sending him clattering against
a rack of equipment.  They face off, panting.

INT. CONTROL MODULE                                                     170

The rig crew turns from the screen at the sound of Monk's voice.

                                MONK
                I tool the liberty of removing this before I
                gave it back to him.

Monk pulls his hand out from under his blanket and holds up the magazine from
the .45.

INT. SUB WAY                                                            171

Even so Bud is getting his ass kicked.  Coffey's really trying to put him out
of business.  It's mostly duck and dodges on Bud's part.  Throw a few things.
When Coffey connects, Bud goes down hard.  Give him credit, though.  He
manages to scramble back up.

The fight wrecks the room, scattering tools and gear.

Compressed air cylinders roll dangerously around the floor.

Coffey slips on one and Buds get in a couple of good licks.

Slams the SEAL's head in an equipment locker door.

But the Navy man is just too massive.  Bud is hammered back into a wall.
Coffey has his fist cocked back for the coup de grace.  Spins around at the
sound of a VOICE.

                                CATFISH
                Hey!

Catfish is right behind him.  Dripping wet.  A trail of water goes back to
the moonpool a few feet away.

CRACK!  Catfish's 'Hammer' punch comes in so hard and so fast, Coffey is
knocked right on his ass.  He doesn't get up.  Just sort of flops around.

Catfish helps Bud to his feet.  They advance on Coffey, who crab-scuttles
sideways, his eyes rabid.

He picks up a helium tank and hurls it at them.  As they duck he sprints to
Flatbed and drops through the hatch and slams it down.

                                BUD
                           (to Catfish)
                Get the door!

Bud leaps across the water to land on Flatbed.  The hatch is already sealed.
He grapples with Geek/MIRV, trying to free it from the steel claw.

INT. FLATBED                                                            172

Coffey crawls along the access tunnel to the pilot's compartment.  He claws
his way into the control seat and starts rapidly flipping switches.

INT. CORRIDOR                                                           173

Catfish pounds down the corridor like he's never run before, his beer gut
doing a rumba.  He reaches the door, tears out the piece of pipe and spins
the wheel.  Hippy pushes it open so fast it hits Catfish in the stomach.
Hippy tears past him, running with the assault rifle.  John Wayne.

INT. SUB-BAY                                                            174

Flatbed is submerging, with only the hatch tower still above the water.  Bud
is being dragged down, still trying to free the ROV.  He gives up when he
sees Hippy run in, waving the assault rifle around like a 130-pound Rambo.

Bud climbs the hatch tower and leaps to the deck of the moonpool.

Hippy clumsily raises the unfamiliar rifle at Coffey, visible inside his
viewing bubble beneath the swirling water.  Coffey looks up, stares at the
gun... doesn't seem to care.

                                CATFISH
                SHOOT!

Hippy's squeezing the trigger and nothing's happening.  Flatbed's hatch tower
goes under.

                                CATFISH
                Safety's on!  On the side... the lever!  Up,
                push it up!

Hippy fumble with the selective-fire lever, BLAM-BLAM-BLAM!  He put three
quick rounds into the ceiling.

                                HIPPY
                SHIT!

                                CATFISH
                Give me that!!

He grabs it out of Hippy's hands and aims it at the sub.  He racks the water
with a long burst.  BENEATH THE SURFACE, the rounds nip nasty contrails
through the water.  They barely scar the front port.

                                LINDSEY
                Forget that... go for Big Geek!

Catfish rakes the descending sub with more bursts, trying to hit the
shimmering shape of the ROV on its back.  UNDERWATER we see the rounds
arcing wild, a few hitting the ROV but causing little damage.

Coffey complete his descent to just above the seafloor.  ABOVE, Catfish
empties the weapon.

                                BUD
                Gimme a hand!

They all turn.  Bud is fumbling into his wetsuit like a madman.  The others
rush over to help him.

                                BUD
                Get the rest of my gear.  Grab that hat there...
                let's go guys!  Come on, come on!

Catfish slams a backpack onto Bud's shoulders, grappling with the straps and
hose connections.  Hippy and Sonny (with one hand) are clipping, zipping and
buckling all over him.  This is a world-record suit-up time.  Bud pulls the
rubber neck-dam of the helmet's lower ring down over his face.

                                BUD
                Helmet... helmet!  Work fast.

EXT. DEEPCORE UNDERSTRUCTURE                                            175

Beneath the habitat, Coffey is maneuvering Flatbed through the twisted pipe
and debris left by Deepcore's slide to the edge.  Bloodied, his fatigues
ripped half-off, he looks like a feral animal.  His eyes burn with the
determination of his mission.

INT. SUB BAY                                                            176

Jammer expertly works the crane controls, moving Cab One out over the
moonpool from its drydock cradle.  Lindsey and One Night are scrambling like
monkeys over the port side crash bars of the swinging sub, clambering up to
the hatch tower.

                                ONE NIGHT
                I'll unhook.
                           (Lindsey hesitates)
                GO!  You're better in these than I am.

Lindsey recognizes this for what it is... a sign of respect, a
reconciliation.  She nods and drops through the hatch.

EXT. DEEPCORE                                                           177

Coffey passes under the twisted wreckage of the big automated derrick and makes
a tight turn beneath the drill-floor module.  Flatbed scrapes through between
twisted conduit, metal screeching on metal.

INT. SUB BAY                                                            178

Bud has his 'hat' locked down and his air cut on.  He take two quick strides
to the edge of the pool and just drops in.

EXT. DEEPCORE                                                           179

Bud rockets DOWN INTO FRAME in a column of bubbles.  He looks around.  Through
the lattice of conduit under the rig he can see Flatbed moving forward from
its exit point under the stern.  Bud see a shortcut under the platform.

He kicks along a lattice a pipes, heaving himself along in frantic hand-over-
hand stokes.  He reaches for Flatbed's stern as it passes.

Misses the last hand-hold... but just manages to seize a tie-down trailing
behind it.  He is jerked along behind the sub.

Bud holds on with both hands as he is buffeted in the wake of the powerful
thrusters.  Flatbed gathers speed, moving out toward the edge of the abyssal
wall.  The current slams him, spinning him like a fishing lure.  He pulls
himself forward slowly until he can grip the stern rail of Flatbed's platform.

LOW ANGLE, look up the wall.  Flatbed appears over the edge and stops.
Hovering.

ON THE BACK OF FLATBED.  Bud has the break he needs.  He scrambles up onto the
deck and opens and equipment locker.  Nothing in it but one of the yellow
nylon safety lines.  The big arm begins to unfold, lifting Geek/ROV.

INT./EXT. FLATBED                                                       180

Coffey works intently.  His eyes are the cool ice of lethal madness in a
face streaked with blood.  He brings the ROV into view with the boom arm.

GEEK/ROV had a passenger.  Brigman.  The diver is holding Geek's skid with
one hand, doing something with the other.  He turns to look at Coffey.

EXT. FLATBED/DEEPCORE                                                   181

Coffey releases the ROV with the gripper and makes a grab at Bud with the
steel claw.  Bud dives.  The gripper hits his helmet a glancing blow.  Bud
kicks away rapidly, letting nylon rope pay out.  We see he has managed to tie
one end to Geek's skids.  Coffey hits the button to activate the ROV, sending
an acoustic pulse to Geek's transponder.  The little robot, pregnant with its
load of death, turns nimbly around and dives out and down toward the void.

Coffey pivots his bid machine toward Bud.  Bud strokes rapidly to a large
jumble of wreckage.  He loops the rope around a twisted pipe.  Big Geek is
hauling ass away from him.  The line snap taut an instant later.  The ROV
strains, like a Rottweiler on a leash... trying to go.  The rope is slipping
as Bud fights to make a knot.

Flatbed slews around, thrusters whining.  As it banks, it hurls up clouds of
sediment from the escarpment face.

Through the front panel we see Coffey jerking on the controls.

The big arm extends menacingly.  The smaller from manipulators open.  An
enormous predatory instinct, its lights blaring.

The big machine roars forward.  Straight at Bud.

Bud gets his knot partly done.  See Flatbed looming.

Glare-lit in its lights, Bud grabs a handlehold and pulls himself downward as
Coffey closes the last few feet.

One manipulator slams into his backpack, tumbling him, and the sub's underside
rakes across his legs as it passes over.  Flatbed crushes into the tangle of
pipework.  K-CRUUUNCH!!

INT. FLATBED                                                            182

Coffey is slammed hard over the controls, up into the front dome port.  He
gets back in the seat.  Strains to free his machine.

EXT. DEEPCORE/BIG GEEK/FLATBED                                          183

Bud swims clear, diving down at an angle along the wall, hoping to stay in
Coffey's blind area.  Flatbed backs out of the wreckage in a cloud of debris.
It pivots toward Bud.  Moves after him.

Nearby, the ROV is whining mindlessly, trying to please.  Trying to GO.
DETAIL OF ROPE attached to wreckage, as Bud's knot begins to slip.  The nylon
line starts to play through the knot slowly.

BUD has gotten himself into a bad position.  Along the bare rock face of the
cliff wall he is naked, nailed in the spotlights like a rabbit in front of a
truck.  Coffey puts the hammer down, thrust levers all the way forward.
Flatbed surges forward, multi-limbed and demonic.  There's no cover, side to
side, up or down.

Coffey has him head in his lights.  Suddenly a bright glare blasts in,
blinding Coffey.  He looks up to see Cab One rushing down upon him, full
throttle.

At the last moment LIndsey slams the thrusters full-lock and the submersible
slews sideways, slamming its heavy skidplate into Flatbed's cab.  Coffey is
smashed sideways by the shock.  He fights to control his vehicle.  Lindsey
looks up to see Coffey's sub gun it up over the wall, out of sight.  She
cruises up over Bud.

                                LINDSEY (V.O.)
                Get in!

Bud gets the lockout hatch open and clambers up into Cab One's belly.

INT./EXT. CAB ONE                                                       184

Bud flops over the lip of the hatch and slams it shut.  He ditches his helmet.
Lindsey raises her vehicle warily above the wall.  Through the front port
there is not sign of Coffey.

                                LINDSEY
                You owe me one, Virgil.

                                BUD
                Can we negotiate later?  There's Big Geek.

He points.  Through the front port, they can see the ROV still straining at
its leash.  Lindsey dives toward it, simultaneously working the controls to
open her own small manipulator claws.

EXT. DEEPCORE/WALL, ETC.                                                185

The last few feet of the rope slip through the knot.

Big Geek happily surges forward.  It dives gracefully down into the void,
trailing the yellow rope like a kite tail.

ONE CAB ONE, Bud and Lindsey through the front port.

                                BUD
                Go after it!  We gotta catch it!

FLATBED DROPS INTO FRAME BEHIND THEM, dwarfing little Cab One.  They are
slammed viciously as Coffey's submersible hammers into them.  She hits full
throttle.  Coffey floors it after Lindsey, ramming her from behind with his
more powerful vehicle.  With difficulty Lindsey maintains trim.

She arcs back toward the rig.  Flatbed slams her again, for the side.  She
fights for control.

INT./EXT. CAB ONE                                                       186

Bud is tossed around, ricocheting off the walls.  Lindsey flies with her
jaw set.  Fighting hard for control.  The A-frame of the rig looms before her.
She shoots through at full throttle.

EXT. DEEPCORE AND OCEAN TERRAIN                                         187

Now the fight is really on.  The two subs are dodging between the cylindrical
modules at full throttle, slamming into each other and the steel pressure
hulls.

Coffey sideswipes the smaller sub, jamming it sideways.  It screeches along
the flank of one of the trimodules.

They head out over empty terrain in a flat-out speed run.

Lindsey is jinking and dodging as Flatbed, roars along behind her, tearing
up the bottom with its powerful backwash.  Lindsey carves hard around a rock
pinnacle, finding herself running parallel to the edge of the abyssal canyon.
Coffey is ramming, hammering from behind, then from side to side.

Lindsey snarls.  He's pissing her off.  He shouldn't do that.

Ahead, out of the blackness, another outcropping.

Lindsey rises, cuts right.

Smashes down into Coffey's craft.  Timing it just right.  He skids catch in
the rocks.

Flatbed slews violently, nosing down.  Crushing into the rocky bottom.
Pressing the advantage, Lindsey hammers into Flatbed from behind.

It smashes full force into a second spire, spinning out of control.

Tangles together, the subs slide down an embankment toward the edge of the
wall.  With her one remaining thruster she jerks clear of Flatbed and grounds
her crippled sub.  Flatbed tumbles over the edge.

ANGLE DOWN THE WALL as it falls, trailing a cloud of sediment like a comet's
tail, down into the unfathomable blackness below.

INT. FLATBED                                                            188

Inside the machine, Coffey is fighting for control.

He has no buoyancy or motors and the craft continues its mad plunge.  As the
pressure intensifies the hull begins to groan, and steel fitting scream with
the enormous load.

A tiny silver fracture shoots partway across the front bubble.  Grows.
Coffey gives up fighting.  Just stares, wide eyed, at his death.  A damned
soul dropping into the bottomless pit.

The fracture line arcs rapidly across the dome port.

Suddenly, a scythe-like curtain of seawater, under tons of pressure, slashes
into him.  A moment later the bubble implodes, and Coffey disappears in a
bloody froth of churning water, air and glass shards.

EXT. CANYON WALL                                                        189

Flatbed looks like a toy, tumbling away down the wall.

Soon its lights vanish.

INT. CAB ONE                                                            190

They're both going to have a lot of bruises...

Lindsey is surveying the damage.  Water is spraying down on them like a
shower, and lights are flickering.

                                LINDSEY
                You did okay, back there.  I was fairly
                impressed.

                                BUD
                Not good enough.  We still gotta catch Big Geek.

                                LINDSEY
                Not in this thing.

Lindsey is flipping switches.  Nothing works.

                                BUD
                You totaled it, huh?

                                LINDSEY
                Yeah.  So sue me.

Bud looks down.  There's already about a foot of water sloshing around the
floor at their feet.

                                BUD
                It's flooding like a son of the bitch.

                                LINDSEY
                You noticed.

She picks up and hand-mike of the underwater telephone.

                                LINDSEY
                Deepcore, Deepcore, this is Cab One, over.

She waits.  No response.

                                BUD
                Try again.

                                LINDSEY
                Deepcore, this is Cab One.  We need assistance,
                over.  Deepcore, this--

With a SEARING CRACKLE or arc-light, a power panel shorts out and everything
goes black.

                                LINDSEY
                Well, that's that.

                                BUD
                Wonderful.
                          (looking around)
                There's some light from somewhere...

A faint illumination, dimmer than moonlight, washes in through the front port.
Lindsey scrunches up against the acrylic and scans the darkness.

                                LINDSEY
                Over there.  It's the rig.

A glow, beyond a rock promontory... like the lights of a town just over the
hill in the desert.

                                BUD
                Good hundred yards, I'd say.

                                LINDSEY
                They'll come out after us.

                                BUD
                Yeah, but it's gonna take them a while to find
                us.  We better get this flooding stopped.

He picks up his helmet and clicks on the light.  Using the thing like a bulky
flashlight.  The water is really pouring in, spraying them like a shower...
almost two feet deep already.

                                LINDSEY
                You see where it's coming in?

                                BUD
                Somewhere behind this panel.  Hold this.

She takes the light and he tries to reach the burst weld, which is blocked by
a steel switch panel and a bunch of conduit.

                                BUD
                Can't get to it.  Have to pull this panel off.
                You go any tools?

                                LINDSEY
                I don't know, look around.

Bud scans the cramped interior, feels around under the water.  It's past his
knees.

                                BUD
                Nothing.  Son of a bitch.  All I need's a goddamn
                crescent wrench.

He grabs the panel in both hands and starts torquing on it, trying to wrench
it off the wall.  Heaves on it repeatedly.  Finally stops, panting.  He's
breathing hard now, and it's not just effort.

                                BUD
                Son of a bitch!

                                LINDSEY
                Calm down, Bud.

A nervous edge in her voice now.  Bud's turning all around, looking around
for anything, trying to think fast.  Water up to their waists.  The sea
closing in.

                                BUD
                Okay... okay.  We gotta get you out of here.

                                LINDSEY
                How?

                                BUD
                I don't know how!

                                LINDSEY
                We've only got one suit.

                                BUD
                I know!  I know!  But we better come up with
                something.

                                LINDSEY
                Aaargh!!  I'm freezing!

She climbs up on the pilots seat, scrunching right up against the ceiling,
keeping as much of herself as possible out of the frigid water.  She's
shaking all over with the cold, and getting drenched from above by water
pouring in.

                                LINDSEY
                Okay, look, you swim to the rig and come back
                with another suit.

                                BUD
                Seven, eight minute swim each way... not enough
                time.  Look at this...
                       (the rate of flooding)
                Time I get back you'll be--

That stops the conversation for a second.  About two feet of airspace left.
Bud can't believe what this is coming down to.  They both stare at each other
for a long moment.

He makes a decision.  Starts pulling off his backpack.

                                BUD
                Alright, put this on.

                                LINDSEY
                What, you growing gills all of a sudden?  You
                got it on, keep it on.

                                BUD
                Don't argue, goddamnit, just--

                                LINDSEY
                No way!  Forget it.  Not an option.

Bud has his pack off uncoupling it.  She keeps fighting his hands, stopping
him, hooking it back up.  The desperation of the situation fuel the struggle.

                                BUD
                Lindsey, just put the thing on and shut up--

                                LINDSEY
                NO!!  Now be logical, Bud, you're--

                                BUD
                FUCK LOGIC!!

They're both right up against the ceiling, water up to their chests.
Lindsey's lips are blue and trembling from the cold.

                                LINDSEY
                Listen... will you listen to me for a second!?
                You're for the suit on and you're a better
                swimmer than me.  Right?  So I got a plan...

                                BUD
                What's the plan?

                                LINDSEY
                I drown, you tow me back to the rig--

                                BUD
                WHAT KIND OF PLAN IS THAT!??

Lindsey's gut-scared... shaking violently, her eyes wide.  But she's keeping
it together.  Thinking it out.  Bud see the bottomless pit opening to take her
and he can barely think.

                                LINDSEY
                Look, this water is only a couple degrees above
                freezing.  I drown.  I go into deep hypothermia...
                my blood like icewater.  I can maybe be revived
                after ten, fifteen minutes.  You got all the
                stuff to do it on the rig.

Bud stops moving and looks into her face, inches from him.  The water is up
to their necks.  He knows that, as always, infuriatingly, Lindsey is right.

                                BUD
                It is insane.

                                LINDSEY
                It's the only way, Bud.  Now trust me.

She takes a deep breath.  Before her nerve fails she busies her hands on his
suit, rehooking everything.

                                BUD
                Jesus, I don't believe this is happening.

She raise his helmet.  Water up to their chins.  They lock eyes, inches
apart.  He can feel her breath on his face... maybe for the last time.

                                BUD
                Oh God, Lins... I--

                                LINDSEY
                Tell me later.

He grabs her head in both hands and pulls her mouth to his.  They lock
together in a fierce kiss, fueled by passion and terror... the naked
realization of love hanging over the abyss of death.

She breaks away at the last possible second and quickly pulls his helmet
over his head.  Seats is down over the neck ring.  Lock the bail-out handle,
sealing it.  Even with her head press up into the highest point of the
ceiling, Lindsey's mouth is barely above water.  She give a scared little
laugh.

                                LINDSEY
                This is maybe not such a great plan, is it?

She is half-paralyzed with the cold, shaking pathetically.  Puts her face to
the glass of his helmet.  Seconds to go.

                                LINDSEY
                Hold me.  Hold me, Bud... I'm so scared...

He can't hear her, but he read her lips.  They clutch each other desperately.
The embrace last while the water rises over her mouth and nose.  She starts
to choke.  Her hands grip his shoulders like claws.  She bucks and thrashes.
Bud holds her, and a scream tears loose from him, a pure agony of the soul.

                                BUD
                NOOOOO!!!

The freezing seawater races into her lungs.  Her finger go slack, and her
hands float lifelessly.

Bud stares, transfixed, as the last tiny bubble trickles out of Lindsey's open
mouth.  He kicks himself into gear, fingers frenzied as he spins the wheel of
the lockout hatch.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. DEEPCORE/COMMAND MODULE                                            191

TIGHT ON VIDEO SCREEN, one of the outside cameras.  A ghostly figure swims out
of the darkness, towing something.

                                ONE NIGHT
                It's Bud.  Oh my God... that's Lindsey!

                                BUD (V.O./faint)
                Deepcore, Deepcore, do you read?

                                HIPPY
                Read you, Bud.  We're here.

EXT. DEEPCORE                                                           192

Bud swims with long, powerful kicks, towing Lindsey.  Her arms and legs float
as gracefully as seaweed waving in a gentle current.  Bud's voice comes in
short rasps, breathing hard, but icy with control.

                                BUD
                Go to the infirmary... get the cart .. oxygen...
                de-fib kit... adrenaline in a... ten cc
                syringe... and some... heating blankets.
                You got all that?

                                HIPPY (V.O.)
                Got it. Over.

                                BUD
                Meet me in the moonpool.  Move fast.

INT. INFIRMARY                                                          193

The door crashes open and Jammer thunders in.  He picks up the CPR cart, meant
to roll on wheels, and carries it out past Hippy, Catfish, and One Night, who
are crowding in to get the rest of the equipment.  They ransack the place in
about ten seconds, grabbing everything they might need and half of everything
else.

EXT. DEEPCORE/UNDER THE MOONPOOL                                        194

Bud moves up toward the rectangle of light, towing Lindsey to the diving
platform.  Through the surface we can see the others arrive at the edge,
looking down.

INT. SUB-BAY                                                            195

Hippy and Catfish are setting up the cart and the oxygen kit, dropping things,
making mistakes.  One Night is teaching herself how to fill a syringe from a
bottle of adrenaline.

                                SONNY
                Here he comes!

Jammer and Sonny leap into the freezing water, waist deep on the submerged
diving platform.  Bud bursts to the surface.  Together they haul Lindsey
across the platform, out of the water, and onto the deck.  Her skin is blue-
white, her chest still.

Bud rips his helmet off in a near-frenzy, like a man possessed, a man with a
mission.  The others are galvanized by his energy even though they all see
Lindsey as dead, a corpse... cold and inert.  Water flows from her mouth and
nose and her lips are blue, her limbs completely limp.  Hippy peels back one
eyelid, to find the pupil fixed and dilated.

But when Bud shouts for them to move, they move.

                                BUD
                Turn her over!

They flip his wife's body over.  He straddles her, pushing down with both
hands in the middle of her back.  Seawater gushes from her slack lips.  He
does it again until the flow stops, then flips her onto her back.

                                BUD
                Come on, hurry!  Gimme the de-fib...

One Night and Catfish are fumbling with the emergency cart equipment.  They've
all been trained in CPR and use of the gear but that was years ago, and is a
friend they're working on.  They're all thumbs.  Catfish drops the electrodes,
picks them up quickly, hands them to Bud...

                                CATFISH
                Here, here, here... no, you got to have bare
                skin, or it won't...

Bud rips into her clothing, opening her jumpsuit, literally tearing away her
T-shirt, revealing her bare chest... bony and still.

                                BUD
                Jesus.  Gimme those, come on.  Catfish, move it,
                man!  Come on... come on!

He slaps the things into Lindsey's bare skin, one on the sternum and one on
the side of the rib cage.

                                BUD
                Is that it?  Is this right?

                                HIPPY
                Yeah!  I mean, I don't know... it looks right.

                                BUD
                All right.  Do it!

One Night hits the switch and Lindsey's body convulses.  It is a pure muscle
reflex, and when it is over, there is not a hint of life.  Hippy pushes him
back and puts a black rubber oxygen mask over her mouth.  He opens the valve
on the cylinder and starts pumping the squeeze bag.  They start packing
electronic blankets around her to fight the intense hypothermia

                                BUD
                Do it again, One Night.  Zap her again!

The current hits Lindsey again and her back arches.  Bud doesn't wait for a
result... he's in his own reality now, driven.  He's doing it all at once,
somehow, in a senseless frenzy... pumping on her chest with his hands,
squeezing the oxygen bag, placing the electrodes.

                                BUD
                Aw.  Christ... come on, baby.  Again!  Do it
                again!

Lindsey's back arches.  Her body relaxes, inert.

                                BUD
                Come on, One Night... what are you waiting for?

A hush seems to have fallen over the group.  They know instinctively that it's
over.  But Bud can't accept it.  He looks at them, beseechingly, like they
are somehow intentionally holding out on him.  One Night starts to cry,
quietly.

                                CATFISH
                                (gently)
                Bud, it's over, man.  It's over.

There is a beat of silence.  Bud stares down into Lindsey's half-open,
motionless eyes.

TIGHT ON LINDSEY'S EYES, moving in until the pupil FILLS FRAME, a black void.

REVERSE, HER POV.  SILENCE.  A distant, distorted image, we see Bud, One
Night, Jammer, Hippy, Catfish, staring down.  It is like the circular top of
a dark well, their faces shimmering as if through the surface of water.  It is
as if we are in a well, descending, looking up at a circle of faces growing
smaller as we drop away... smaller and smaller, receding until it becomes
a point of light in the void, like the fading bright dot at the center of a
turned-off TV.

TIGHT ON BUD, rigid, staring.  Catfish puts his hand gently on Bud's shoulder.
Suddenly Bud tears Catfish's hand away and sets upon Lindsey like a madman,
renewing his efforts in spades... totally manic.

                                BUD
                No!  NO!  She's not... her heart is strong,
                she wants to live... can't you see that?  Come
                on, Lins.  Come on, baby!  Zap her again!  Do
                it... DO IT!

They do.  And Bud works, feverishly.  He lock his lips over hers and starts
mouth-to-mouth.  It is frantic, passionate... the kiss of life.

                                BUD
                Come on, breath!  Goddamn it, you bitch, you
                never backed down from anything in life... now
                fight!

He slaps her face, hard.  Her head lolls.  He smacks her the other way.

                                BUD
                Fight, Goddamnit!

LINDSEY's POV, from the bottom of the great well.  The circles of faces and
light rockets toward us in the blackness, as we soar upward from the pit.  We
see Bud yelling, but his voice is distant, windlike.

                                BUD
                FIGHT!!

TIGHT ON LINDSEY, still.  Then something incredible happens.  Something they
will never forget as long as they live.  Lindsey coughs once, weakly, and her
hands clench in a spasm.

Bud see it and his expression becomes beatific.

                                BUD
                Come on, Lins.  You can do it... fight your
                way back, baby...

The others look on in wonder as Bud wills this woman back.

She starts to cough, weakly at first... then more violently as she draws air
into her lungs.  Bud crouches over her, rubbing her limbs... trying to re-
establish circulation.  It is like a difficult birth.  Lindsey comes hacking
and howling back into the world, wet and naked and fighting for breath.

Bud puts the oxygen mask over her face and she draws breath after agonized
breath.  He pushes her wet hair back from her face with his trembling hands,
and watches her breathe.  Color is returning to her skin as she lies there,
gasping weakly.

ONE THE GROUP... Catfish, Hippy, One Night, Jammer, the others... they're
all grinning, crying, beaming... gazing at the miracle of her rebirth.

ON BUD... tears are streaming down his face.

                                BUD
                   (a whisper, fierce and harsh)
                You did it, ace.

                                                                DISSOLVE TO:

INT. DEEPCORE/QUARTERS -- LATER                                         196

TIGHT ON LINDSEY, sleeping peacefully.  WIDER shows Bud hovering over her,
attentive.  They are alone in Bud's tiny cubicle.  Perhaps twenty minutes
have passed.  She is completely swaddles in blankets, except for her face,
and looks like a waif.

Lindsey's eyes flutter and open.  The first thing she sees is Bud, bending
over her.  He can't help himself.  The tears break again and roll down his
cheeks.  She seems terribly fragile, but bright and aware.  She smiles,
faintly... touches his cheek.

                                LINDSEY
                Hey... big boys don't cry, remember?

                                BUD
                Hi, lady.

                                LINDSEY
                Hi, tough guy.  I guess it worked, huh?

                                BUD
                'Course is worked.  You're never wrong, are you?
                How d'you feel.

                                LINDSEY
                I've been better.  Next time it's your turn,
                okay?

Bud's expression turn inexplicably grim.

                                BUD
                Well, you got that right.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. SUB-BAY                                                            197

TIGHT ON BUD'S EYES, as Monk's fingers insert acrylic scleral lenses under his
eyelids so he can see in the fluid helmet.

WIDER reveals Bud is wearing the SEALs' deep suit.  Everybody is grouped
around, buckling and zipping.  He is hyperventilating with an oxygen mask,
part of the procedure for transitioning from air to fluid breathing.  Monk,
on his stretcher, is presiding.  The resident expert.  Lindsey is wrapped in a
blanket, still looking wan and frail.  She doesn't have the strength to resist
Bud's will, but she's trying.

                                LINDSEY
                No, Bud, no... not you.

                                BUD
                Who then?

She looks around at the others.  Sees their eyes.  The fear.  Has her answer.
He lowers the helmet over his head.  Catfish clamps it down.  We see what's
driving him... his sense of responsibility for these people, for not being
able to prevent this situation.

He touches her cheek, one last time.  She sees his fingers are trembling.
Then he puts on the gloves.  Catifsh is strapping a KEYPAD UNIT onto Bud's
forearm.  Lindsey wants to scream... to stop this madness.

                                BUD (muffled)
                So I'll hear you, but I can't talk?

                                MONK
                The fluid prevents your larynx from making
                sound.  It'll feel a little strange.

                                BUD (muffled)
                Warning you now, folks, I'm a lousy typist.
                              (a beat)
                The moment of truth, huh?

His breathing is shallow and tense.  He looks at Lindsey.  The eyes of a
condemned man.  She squeezes his hand.  He takes a deep breath.

                                BUD
                Okay.  Let's rock and roll.

Monk gently cracks a valve on the suit's feed line.  The breathing fluid (3M
fluorocarbon emulsion FX-80) swirls into the helmet.  Bud reflexively raises
his chin.  The liquid fills toward his mouth.

                                MONK
                Relax now, Bud.  Just keep breathing as it
                fills... don't fight it.  Take it in.  Just let
                yourself take it in.

Suddenly, there's nothing in there to breathe but liquid.  His eyes go wide,
instant panic.  He starts to thrash.  Chest heaving.

                                MONK
                Hold him.  Hold him.  This is normal... it'll
                pass in a second.  You're gonna be okay.  We all
                breathe liquid for nine months, Bud.  Your body
                will remember.

Lindsey grabs Bud's shoulders, steadying him.  He finds her eyes, the look
calming him.  He's passed into a realm from which she has already returned.
His spasms subside.  He begins to "breathe" normally.  He gets a goofy look
of wonder on his face, not really believing what he's experiencing.  He is
alive, alert and quite completely drowned inside the FBS helmet.  He grins.
Gives a big thumbs up.  Lindsey picks up a microphone.

                                LINDSEY
                Can you hear me okay?
                          (another thumbs up)
                Try your keypad.

Bud taps out a brief message.  FEELS WEIRD - YOU SHOULD TRY THIS prints out
on their portable monitor.

                                LINDSEY
                I already have, moron.

They help Bud to the edge of the dive platform.  Jammer and Hippy lower Little
Geek into the water and Bud grabs onto it.  Hippy yells right up next to his
helmet.

                                HIPPY
                I redid Little Geek's chip the same as Big Geek!
                He should take you right to it.  All you gotta
                do is hang on!

Lindsey crouches at the edge to watch Bud submerge.

He looks up at her as he drops away.

In a few seconds, she can't see him.  Her chin quivers, minutely.

EXT. DEEPCORE/THE WALL                                                  198

FROM FAR BELOW, Deepcore is a faint tiara of lights, above in the blackness.
A single moving light appears above, at the edge of the cliff, and starts
down.  It grows large, resolving into Bud, free-falling down the wall.

He gathers speed as Little Geek's vertical thruster drives them down.

Bud looks down.  Between his feet he can see a short way down the wall in the
glow of his single light, and beyond that an unfathomable blackness.  The wall
unrolls upwards out of the darkness like a convoluted gray drapery.  He looks
up.  The lights of Deepcore are gone.  He feels  more alone than he has ever
felt.  He types out:  CANT SEE YOU

                                LINDSEY (V.O.)
                We're right here with you, Bud.  Your depth is
                3800 feet.  You're doing fine.

Bud comes upon the twisted wreckage of the crane, hanging against the wall
like a forty-ton yo-yo at the end of the umbilical.

INT. COMMAND MODULE                                                     199

Everyone is grouped around the monitor screen, watching Bud's telemetry.  Bud
types out: GOOD DEAL ON SLIGHTLY USED CRANE.  They watch the depth meter
counting down.

                                MONK
                4800 feet.  It's official.

                                LINDSEY
                Bud, according to Monk here, you just set a record
                for the deepest suit dive.  Bet you didn't think
                you'd be doing this when you got up this morning.

The screen print out:  CALL GUINESS.  They laugh.  So far so good.  Seconds
later...

                                HIPPY
                One mile down and still grinnin'.

WIDE SHOT.  Bud is a tiny spider dropping down the wall in a pathetic little
pool of light.  The wall is sterile brown-gray, devoid of life at this depth.
LOOKING DOWN, as the light shrinks to a star and vanishes in the blackness
yawning below.

INT. COMMAND MODULE                                                     201

Lindsey has the microphone gripped tightly, and the lightness in her voice is
a bit brittle.

                                LINDSEY
                8500 feet, Bud.  Everything okay?

                                MONK
                Ask him a pressure effects.  Tremors, vision
                problems, euphoria.

                                LINDSEY
                Ensign Monk want to know how you feel.

ON THE SCREEN, printing out: COLD.

                                LINDSEY
                Big baby.

Then:  HANDS SHAKING.  HHARD TO TYPE.

                                MONK
                It's starting.  It hits the nervous system
                first.

                                ONE NIGHT
                Keep talking, Lindsey.  Just let him hear your
                voice.  It doesn't matter what about.

                                LINDSEY
                Don't forget Bud, you're being graded on spelling
                as well as sentence structure, so concentrate,
                okay?
                              (long pause)
                Bud, I... uh, there's some things I want to say.
                It's hard for me.  I'm not of those softy, gooey-
                center-type people.  It's not easy, you know,
                being a cast-iron bitch.  It takes discipline
                and years of training.  A lot of people don't
                appreciate that.

Lindsey has somehow tuned out the others in the room.  In her mind she is
with Bud, out in the darkness.

                                LINDSEY
                But is wasn't all bad.  I know that.  You
                remember that bike trip... we rode the Honda
                up through Oregon?  It took me a week to get my
                hair untangled, but I've never been happier.  It
                was the most... free... I've ever felt.  I'm
                sorry I can't tell you these things to your face.

Bud is visibly trembling, gritting his teeth... holding on as the vise-grip
of pressure takes him.

                                LINDSEY (V.O./filtered)
                It's pitiful.  I have to wait until you're
                freezing in the dark and there's ten thousand
                feet of water between us.  I guess I'm babbling.
                I'm sorry.

Bud struggles with his keyboard.

Somehow's she's smiling and on the verge of tears at the same time.

BLAM!  Bud jerks as his dive light implodes.  He still has Geek's floodlights.
He falls on.

INT. CONTROL MODULE                                                     205

                12000 feet.  Jesus, I don't believe he's doing
                this.

                                LINDSEY
                Shut up, Hippy.  Bud, how you doing?

He types: SE LUMINUS THINNGS

Everyone snaps suddenly alert.

                                HIPPY
                Uh, oh...

                                LINDSEY
                What kind of luminous things, Bud?

                                CATFISH
                Maybe it's... you know... them.

The screen prints out:  ITS OK. SQUID. GLOWING SQUID.

Bud is in an enormous school of bioluminescent squid, graceful, attenuated
creatures less than a foot long.  Thousands of then glide in ghostly arcs
around him, filling the black void as far as the eye can see.  He stares at
them in wonder.  Reaches out and touches one, catches it, lets it go.  Are
they really here?  He can no longer be sure of his own perceptions.

Bud emerges from the school of squid.  As he falls, they form a luminous plane
of swirling colors above him.  He stares upwards, transfixed.  BUD'S POV, the
ghostly blizzard of luminescence above him.  A spectral form takes shape in
the patternless glow... resolving into Lindsey's face, a hundred feet wide.
Gazing down at him, her expression sad.  Her image receded away from him into
the darkness above as he falls.

DOWN ANGLE ON BUD, reaching up in anguish.

                I'm not going away, Bud.  I'm right here, right

Bud is shaking violently, as if with palsy.  His eyes keep rolling back, and
he's having a hard time staying conscious.  He tries to type a message and he
can't.  The tons of pressure per square inch are short-circuiting his nervous
system.  Suddenly K-BAM!  Little Geek's pressure hull implodes.  Its lights
go out.  BLACKNESS.

                cold blackness... but I'm there in the dark

Lindsey seems not to be in the room, but to be with him, seeing what he sees.
She is oblivious to the others.

Blackness.  Then a bright light appears... he's lit a MAGNESIUM FLARE.

It's fierce, flickering glare lights his plunge.  Bud discards the stalwart
little ROV and free-falls like a skydiver without a chute.  Out of control, he
hits a ledge and rolls off.  Tumbles forward in a cloud of debris.  He hits
another outcropping, limp as a rag doll.  Rocks and sand rain down with him
as he continues his descent.

Bud us quivering, teeth locked in a titanic rigor.

He pulls his arms and legs slowly into a fetal position.

In the plunge toward death he has gone he has gone full circle, returned to
the womb in which we all breathe the water of life before we know the world of
air and light.  Still, there is Lindsey's voice, faintly in his helmet.

                                LINDSEY (V.O.)
                You remember that time, you were pretty drunk,
                you probably don't remember... the power went
                out at the old apartment, the one on Orange
                Street... and we were staring at that one little
                candle, and I said something really dumb like
                that candle is me, like every one of us is out
                there alone in the dark in this life...

whisper.  Her eyes are intense, focused on a point far beyond the walls of the
room.

              ... and you lit another candle and put it beside
                mine and said "that's me"... and we stared at
                the two candles, and then we... well, if you
                remember any of it, I'm sure you remember the
                next part.  Bud, there are two candles in the
                dark.  I'm with you.  I'll always be with you.

EXT. THE ABYSS                                                          214

A tiny flickering light moves down along a vast black wall.  Bud falls on in
dream-like solitude, a candle in the dark.

INT. CONTROL MODULE                                                     215

Catfish gently takes the microphone from Lindsey's hands and leans close.

                                CATFISH
                How you doin', podner?  Still with us, come-back?
                Talk to us, Buddy boy.

They watch the screen, expectantly.

Nothing.  Hippy and One Night start checking the equipment.  Lindsey tried
unsuccessfully to keep the terror our of here voice.

                                LINDSEY
                Bud?  You hangin' in there?  Talk to me, Bud.
                Are you okay?

There is an agonizing pause, then the letters appear slowly:  SHAKING STOPED.
FEEL BETER.  SOM LITE BELOW.

                                LINDSEY
                What kind of light?

LIGHT EVYWHER.  BEAWTIFULLL

                                MONK
                He's hallucinating badly.

EXT. THE ABYSS                                                          216

Bud is no longer in pain.  His expression is rapt.

LOOKING DOWN, past his to a ghostly landscape.  His last flare sputters out,
but there is light.  Bioluminescent algae carpet the walls of the canyon
below him.  And he's right... it is beautiful.

The water is so clear we can see down 500 feet past Bud's tiny, silhouetted
figure, to a vast landscape faintly revealed in spectral pastels.  Barren as
the moon but exquisite, serene.  Changeless.  A place unseen by human eyes.
Like a firefly below, the lights of Big Geek are visible.  Bud descends toward
the ROV, which has grounded on a narrow shelf.  Below the shelf, the wall
slopes out, suggesting we are near the bottom of the canyon but can't see it.

ONE BIG GEEK/MIRV, sitting there like a dumbshit.  Bud's feet thump into the
sediment next to it, stirring it luminous particles.  Touchdown... three and
half miles of water over his head.  Bud leans over the warhead in a swarm of
fireflies.

INT. CONTROL MODULE                                                     217

AT GEEK prints out.  Monk takes the headset gently from Lindsey.

                                MONK
                Okay, Bud, we'll go step by step.  Take the
                cover plate off the firing box.

A long pause.  Then... PLATE OFF

                                MONK
                All right, Bud, you have to cut the ground wire,
                not the lead wire...

EXT. ABYSSAL LEDGE                                                      218

Bud is peering into the detonator unit.  How bad is he?  We can't tell.

                                MONK (V.O.)
                It's the blue wire with the white stripe, not...
                I repeat... NOT the black wire with the yellow
                stripe.

Bud is staring.  Blinking.  The two wire look big as sewer pipes, and they're
miles away... way down there where his hands are.

The only light he has left is a CYALUME STICK.  He pulls out the little
plastic tube.  Breaks and shakes.  It starts to glow, a tiny wand of green
light.  He fumbles with his tool pouch, takes out a pair of side-cutters.
CUTING NNOW he types to them.  He reaches into the detonator.

DETAIL, THE WIRES... in the green Cyalume glow, the look identical.  The
cutters go over on wire.  A long beat.  They withdraw, then go over the other
wire...

He cuts--

INT. CONTROL MODULE                                                     219

Everyone is frozen.  Waiting.  It's very quiet.

                                LINDSEY
                Would we see the flash?

                                MONK
                Through three miles of water?   I don't know.

They're holding their breaths.  Then... STILL HERE

A cheer goes up.  Rebel yells.

                                CATFISH
                Quiet, quiet!  Save you air, goddamnit.

                                MONK
                Bud, give me a reading off you liquid oxygen
                gauge.

TEN MINUTES WORTH ID SAY.  Lindsey does white.

                                HIPPY
                It took him over an hour to get down there--

It's hopeless.  Lindsey grabs the headset from Monk.

                                LINDSEY
                Drop you weights and start back now!  The gauge
                could be wrong...

EXT. ABYSSAL LEDGE                                                      220

Bud is one his knees beside the dead warhead.  His expression is enigmatic.
He looks around slowly at the luminous canyon.  Starts to type.

INT. CONTROL MODULE                                                     221

The message comes in:  NO.  THINK ILL STAY A WHILE.  BEAUTIFUL HERE.  WORTH
ADMISSION

                                LINDSEY
                No!  You can make it!  You hear me?  Drop your
                weights... you... can breathe shallow... you...
                it could be wrong--

Lindsey's voice has twisted into a sob.  She begins to weep, quietly.

                                LINDSEY
                Oh God, Virgil, please...

DONT CRY BABY

A pause.  Then the words...

WE KNEW THIS WAS A ONE WAY TICKET WHEN I PUT THIS THING ON.  BUT YOU KNOW I
HAD TO COME.

Lindsey sobs at the mike.  The others look away.  The signal is weakening.
One Night boosts it and the screen clears briefly.

LOVE YOU WIFE.

She stares at the printout.

                                LINDSEY
                Love you.

There is no reply.

                                                                CUT TO:

EXT. THE ABYSS                                                          222

A tiny figure lies slumped beside the inert ROV, an Indian dying with his
horse in the desert.

Bud's eyelids close.  His chest barely moving.

A strange illumination bathes his face and his eyes open.  He blinks.  Weakly,
he raises his head, facing the source of the radiance.

BUD'S POV... A glowing figure hovers before him, like a vision.  It seems to
be an angel.  Seen closer, as it drifts toward him, we see that it is an
extraterrestrial being, bioluminescent like some deep-sea fish.  Its body
and limbs are transparent, and it resembles a figure made of blown glass.  A
delicate mantle or veil billows out around its like a corona, which pulsates
gently, propelling the being with the hypnotic grace of a Spanish dancer.  The
head is refined and strangely anthropomorphic, with large eyes that convey a
cold, dispassionate wisdom.

It is stunningly beautiful.

The creature settles toward him.  Unafraid, Bud extends his hand.

Its slender, blown-glass digits grasp his bulky glove.  It pulls him up from
the benthic ooze and they glide together down the slope, deeper into the
abyss.

At the limits of visibility we see faint, glowing forms moving below.  They
resolve into NTI ships.  Tiny ovoids, like the little scoutship that Lindsey
nearly collided with at the Montana wreck.  The larger manta-ships.  And
others, strangely configured, moving in the darkness below like luminous fish.

Suddenly the darkness explodes with light.  A vast, reticulated pattern of
brightly glowing lines, like some enormous circuit diagram, appears below
them, covering the floor of the abyssal trench.  It sweeps outward from the
center, as if the light were surging through channels.  The NTIs are revealing
their home to Bud.  The ships move among the spires like air traffic over a
major city.

EXT. N.T.I. STRUCTURE                                                   223

Bud and the creature descend until, between the lines of light, we see a dark
surface of inhuman design.  The shape extends beyond the limits of visibility.
Towers hundreds of feet high stretch upward from the curving surface.  It
dwarfs their figures as the descend toward it, approaching an opening that soon
yawns like a vast mouth.

They are picking up speed, swept along by a powerful current, into the mouth-
like opening.

INT. N.T.I. STRUCTURE                                                   224

Bud stares around in awe as smooth, pearlescent walls blur past him.  It is a
curving three-dimensional maze of tunnels, like a vast circulatory system,
where controlled currents of water become freeways in three-dimensional
space.  Tunnels divide, narrow, and reenter main-routes hundreds of feet
across, as the pair race through in a dizzying blur.

INT. FINAL CHAMBER                                                      225

Entering a smaller chamber they settle to the floor, and the NTI moves back a
few feet.

A shimmering plane or surface appears like a vertical curtain bisecting the
chamber.  The seawater divides, like the Red Sea, into two rippling walls.
They move apart.  Leaving Bud standing in a short, shimmering hallway.

Weakly, he uncouples his helmet and pulls it free.  Drops to his knees.
Doubles over as spasms wrack him.  Breathing fluid explodes from his lungs.
He lies gasping and coughing on the floor, dragging in deep breaths of what
he can only hope is air.  It is.

Bud slowly recovers, sitting up.  His head is clearing.  This really is
happening.  Beyond the shimmering, vertical surface of the water he sees the
NTI being joined by others, move or less identical, until a group of seven
is gathered watching him.

                                BUD
                Howdy, Uuuh... how you guys doin'?

His voice echoes metallically in the strange chamber.  Soft laps of water
from the 'walls'.

In the air a pattern of glowing lines appears, a series of what appears to be
circuit diagrams.  Bud staggers back from this strange 'screen' hanging in
mid-air.  The image is about twenty feet across.

There is a rolling jumble of static and interference which resolves into...
the face of Dan Rather, doing the evening news.  STATIC, then another
newscast.  And another.  Fragments of the same story.  The world on the brink
of war.

                                BUD
                You watch out TV?  That what you're trying to
                say?  That you know what's been going on up
                there?

The NTIs are impassive.  Static... then another newscast.

This time, we're allowed to focus on the story.  An on-the-scene interview
outside a high-tech seismology lab.  There is an air of hysteria about the
scene... technicians running across the background of the shot, people
shouting, the reporter jamming his mike at the harried-looking scientist.

                                REPORTER
              ... a Caltech scientist who is among those
                reporting an unprecedented disturbance in the
                world's oceans.  Dr. Breg, can you give us a
                clearer explanation then we're getting?

Berg is edgy and distracted.  People keeps handing him pieces of paper,
computer hardcopy.  The biggest thing in his life is happening...

                                BERG
                They're acoustic shockwaves, like tsunamis, but
                with no seismological source.  The waves are
                propagating toward the shorelines of every
                continent--

An assistant runs up, face shiny with fear, beckoning.  We see that Berg is
running scared.  The impossible bringing the greatest terror to the rational
mind.

                                BERG
                Yeah.  I'll be right there... I have to go.
                Look, we don't know what it is!  Okay?  Not the
                slightest goddamn idea!

The image dissolves into static, fades out.  Bud turns to the NTIs.

                                BUD
                You're doing it!  Right?  That's what you're
                telling me.  Yeah, you can control water...
                that's your technology.  But why?

Static again, then a brilliant flash.  Grainy stock film of a hydrogen bomb
test in the Pacific.

The film repeats, and then again, faster, and again until is merges into an
unbroken white glare.  Bud gets the message.

                                BUD
                Hey, you don't know they're really gonna do it.
                Where do you get off passing judgment on us,
                when you can't be sure?  How do you know?

The screen exploded into a staccato series of searing images, stark moments
from recent history...

US soldiers fighting in Vietnam, street warfare in Beirut, a car bomb in
Belfast, a suspect shot in the head in the streets of Saigon, burned and
bleeding children, grainy footage of corpses bulldozed into mass graves at
Auschwitz, Wermacht soldiers marching in goose-step review, a 13-year-old
contra with an AK-47...  Just glimpses, strobing... a few frames of each.
But enough.  The images continue.

HOLD ON BUD, as the lights flicker on his face, the ongoing indictment of
humanity.

                                                                CUT TO:

EXT. OCEAN FRONT WALK, SANTA MONICA, CALIFORNIA -- DAY                  226

A video news crew leaps from a Jet Ranger helicopter in a parking area and
runs to set up near the railing, facing the ocean.  Pandemonium reigns around
them, people running, driving, evacuating inland.

On the horizon, out to sea, a dark line has appeared.

It grows in height as it comes closer, a wall of water stretching across the
horizon, already hundreds of feet high and growing.

EXT. NEW YORK -- DAY                                                    227

LONG LENSE SHOT, looking seaward past the Statue of Liberty, out past the
Verazzano Narrows.  Stacked up by perspective, the distant wave is a wall of
water impossibly high, still miles out.

EXT. NAVAL BASE, KAMCHATKA PENINSULA, U.S.S.R. -- NIGHT                 228

The scene repeats on the eastern coast of the Kamchatka Penninsula in Russia,
where a full moon shimmers along the crest of a vast wave.

SIRENS wail as Russian sailors run from the docks of Petropavlovsk Naval Base.
Some stand rooted as the black glacier of water, a thousand feet high and
growing, thunders toward them in nightmarish slow motion.

EXT. OCEAN FRONT, SANTA MONICA -- DAY                                   229

The minicam crew reporter is speaking rapidly, faltering with emotion, his
voice cracking like the famous broadcast from the scene of the Hindenburg
disaster.

                                REPORTER
                The horizon has gone dark... the crowd is starting
                to run... some are just staring, unable to
                move... the wave... the wave is... it's...
                I don't know... maybe a thousand feet high
                already... getting bigger as I'm watching...
                still miles out... oh my God, Jesus... I can
                hear it...

A roar fills the air, a thunder which drowns out the people's screams, even
the rotors of the news chopper as the camera teams scrambles aboard.  They
leave the announcer standing transfixed, his face blank, eyes tracking upward
and upward as the ground begins to shake.

EXT. NEW YORK -- DAY                                                    230

The Statue of Liberty looks like a souvenir figurine at the afternoon sun is
blocked out by the cresting tsunami, an escarpment of water 2500 feet tall.

EXT. SAN FRANSISCO -- DAY                                               231

LONG LENS SHOT -- The Golden Gate Bridge and the hills of the city, the
buildings downtown.  Beyond, FILLING FRAME is the wall of sea green which
defies our comprehension.  The image shakes with the THUNDER.

EXT. MALIBU -- DAY                                                      232

A diehard surfer looks over his shoulder as the mountain of water which
transcends his worst nightmare.  He lies paralyzed on his board.

EXT. MIAMI -- DAY                                                       233

Downtown Miami crouches in terror at the feet of the shimmering monolith.

In a penthouse office suite, an executive watches the wave towering above him,
blocking out the sun, a line of raging foam appearing as it arches over,
about to break upon the teeming city.

And then...

The wave slows as it crests...

And stops.

IT SIMPLY STOPS.

2600 feet high and motionless except for a shimmering undulation of its
surface in the bright sun.  There is quiet, a faint wind and calling of
confused gulls.  Various reactions, as the thunder fades and people recover,
only to stand awed before the vast, inexplicable manifestation.  A news
helicopter passes in front of it like a dragonfly.

EXT. MALIBU                                                             234

The surfer just blinks, starting.

EXT. NEW YORK -- DAY                                                    235

On the East Coast it's the same, as the World Trade Centers are dwarfed by a
shimmering blue wall which stands... waiting.

EXT. PETROPAVLOVSK NAVAL BASE, U.S.S.R. -- NIGHT                        236

Russian seamen, lining the harbor breakwall at Petropavlovsk Naval Base on the
Kamchatka Peninsula, stare upward at the monolith of water, undulating in the
moonlight.  It seems poised to crash down, inflicting inconceivable
devastation... but it doesn't.

EXT. OCEAN FRONT WALK, SANTA MONICA                                     237

When all have seen...

The wave soundlessly subsides, slowly slipping back and down until the surface
of the sea is normal again.

VIDEO SHOT, HANDHELD, of a crowd of people watching the sea.  Moving from
face to face.  Various reactions as people respond to what they can only
understand as a miracle.  The faces... awed, stunned, tear-streaked...
laughing.  The cameraman is just walking.  Some people turn to him and smile,
or laugh, or whoop.

A woman is collapsed on a bench, crying.

A man is on his knees, shaking.

Total strangers hug each other.

A black guy, tears pouring down his face, turns to the camera with a beautific
grin.

                                GUY
                Somebody just laid it down to us, man.  Things
                ain't never gonna be the same!

INT. FINAL CHAMBER                                                      238

Bud sits, shaken, watching the screen, as people react to their deliverance.
He turns to the NTIs.

                                BUD
                Why?  You could've done it.  Why didn't you?

The screen darkens.  Then letters appears on it, slowly printing out, as if
someone was clumsily typing them.

WE KNEW THIS WAS...

And we've seen this before so we know the rest...

WE KNEW THIS WAS A ONE WAY TICKET WHEN I PUT THIS THING ON.  BUT YOU KNOW I
HAD TO COME.

A pause, then:

LOVE YOU WIFE

The last message expands to fill the entire screen.

Bud stares at the screen, at his message of self-sacrifice, then at the
aliens.  They bow their heads, just for a moment.  A sign of respect.

CLOSE ON BUD as he begins to realize what has happened.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. DEEPCORE/CONTROL MODULE                                            239

Lindsey is slumped in a chair, just staring.  Withdrawn.

The others are conserving oxygen and heat, huddling in the dark.

The air is looking pretty thick.  The speaker of the hydrophone transceiver
crackles to life.

                                MCBRIDE (V.O.)
                Deepcore, do you read?  This is Benthic Explorer,
                over.

                Hell yes, we read!  Good of you to join us.  How's
                that storm doin'?

                                MCBRIDE
                Well, it's strange... it just kind've blew
                itself out all of the sudden.  We're up here in
                a flat sea with no wind.  But then a lot of weird
                things've been happening.

                                CATFISH
                Well, hell, son.  You better get us a line down
                here, we're in moderately poor shape.

LATER, Hippy, Catfish, and Monk are conferring B.G. on how to get a new
umbilical hooked on.  One Night is talking to McBride on the hydrophone.

                                MCBRIDE
                They figure is was over a half mile high.

                                ONE NIGHT
                I wish I could have seen it--

She glances down at the telemetry screen, seeing movement.

                                ONE NIGHT
                Hey.  Hey!  HEY!!  Look... it's Bud.

                                MONK
                That's impossible.

Lindsey bolts to the screen.  Stares at the message printing out.

A huge grin wraps around her face.

                                LINDSEY
                No it's not.

                                MCBRIDE (V.O.)
                What's it say?

Lindsey take the mike and sits before the screen.  During the message, her
voice will go through an emotional spectrum from confusion to wonder, to a
childlike joy.

INTERCUT BETWEEN DEEPCORE AND EXPLORER BRIDGE DURING THE FOLLOWING:

                                LINDSEY
                It says...
                "VIRGIL BRIGMAN BACK ON THE AIR/HAVE SOME NEW
                FRIENDS DOWN HERE/I GUESS THEYVE BEEN HERE AWHILE/
                THEYVE LEFT US ALONE BUT IT BOTHERS THEM TO SEE
                US HURTING EACH OTHER/GETTING OUT OF HAND LATELY"

Lindsey grins as she reads the next part...

                                LINSEY
                "THEY SENT A MESSAGE/HOPE YOU GOT IT"

                                CATFISH
                I'd say that's a big 10-4, jack.

                                LINDSEY
                "THEY WANT US TO GROW UP A BIT AND PUT AWAY
                CHILDISH THINGS/OF COURSE ITS JUST A SUGGESTION."

INT. BENTHIC EXPLORER BRIDGE -- DAY                                     240

Beyond the windows the ocean is calm.  The sky steel-gray put placid.  McBride
turns to Commodore DeMarco and the Navy contingent, his eyebrows cocked.

                                MCBRIDE
                Looks like you boys might by out of business.

                                BENDIX
                Something's going on down there.  I'm getting
                some big readings....

Bendix is hunched over the sonar, and we can see the screens lit up like a
Wurlitzer.

INT. DEEPCORE                                                           241

In Deepcore the crew becomes aware of a strange subsonic rumbling.  The sonar
is going crazy.  One Night puts the headphones of her passive sonar rig up to
her ear, then jerks it away.

                                ONE NIGHT
                Whew!  Whatever this is, it's major.

The rumbling increases and a glow diffuses the water.

The glow intensifies until a blinding shaft of light blasts through the
viewport, bathing the whole interior in a cold white radiance.

A last message appears on the screen:

KEEP YOU PANTYHOSE ON/YOURE GONNA LOVE THIS

The radiance intensifies.  Everyone covers their eyes.  It flares to
WHITE-OUT.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT./EXT. EXPLORER BRIDGE -- DAY                                        242

Bendix and the bridge crew are going nuts.  All their instruments are pegged.

                                BENDIX
                Active is pinging back something big... it's
                enormous!  Coming up right under us.

                                DEMARCO
                Where?

                                BENDIX
                Where?  EVERYWHERE!!
                         (looks out the window)
                Over there!  Port bow.

EXT. BENTHIC EXPLORER AND OCEAN                                         243

A depression appears in the surface of the sea a hundred yards off, not
swirling down like a whirlpool, just dimpling down.

It gets wider.  Deeper.  Rapidly becomes a yawning pit.

The ocean is OPENING.

Now the surface is churned by turbulence.  Slow massive roils of tremendous
power boil up from the depths.

McBride leads a mass exodus onto the deck to see better.

The open becomes a roaring maw a hundred yards across.

The ships are like toys on the shimmering rim of the maelstrom.

SOMETHING RISES IN THE CENTER OF THE OPENING.  A massive spire.  Smoothly
curving and iridescent.  Off the starboard beam, a quarter mile away, another
spire rises.  Tons of seawater fall from its sides with a THUNDEROUS ROAR, the
energy of Niagara.

Off the port bow... another spire.

And another, beyond the destroyer Albany, dwarfing it.

Six towers... plus one larger, in the center.  Rising.

One the Explorer's deck, a shadow engulfs them as the nearest spire blocks out
the sun.  The air, the sea, the deck... all vibrate with the THUNDER OF
CREATION.

And now for the payoff shot:  WE'RE HIGH, LOOKING DOWN.  THE SPIRES FORM A
PERFECT RING A MILE ACROSS.  A VAST DARK FORM, LIKE A GREAT SHADOW, RISES FROM
THE DEPTHS BENEATH THE SHIPS.  THE SPIRES ARE CONNECTED.  IT IS ALL ONE.

THE NTI ARK.

It surfaces with slow majesty, gently beaching all the ships on its broad
back.  We recognize it as the structure into which Bud was led by the angelic
being, which we assumed was a city.  The Explorer rocks gently on its flat
hull, clunking massively to one side as it settles.

The bridge crew watch millions of tons of seawater streaming off the back of
the vast, slightly curved hull.  The missile cruiser rocks back and forth
nearby, high and dry... its prop whining futility.

ON EXPLORER'S DECK, McBride, Bendix, DeMarco, the rest of the Navy
contingent... they're all standing there open-mouthed, in a dream-like daze.
Touched by the hand of God.

                                BENDIX
                Look...

WHAT THEY SEE -- Fifty yards away, between them and the Albany, sits Deepcore
Two.  It looks like a particularly ugly and unwanted toy, sitting on the
glistening plain of the NTI Ark's hull.

CLOSER, ON TRIMODULE C, as the hatch at the bottom opens.

Catfish's feet appear, bicycling.  He swings down to the pearlescent 'deck'.
Stands there blinking in the sunlight, mole-like.  Jammer plonks down behind
him.  He turns, lifts Lindsey down.  Hippy, Sonny, and the rest, emerge into
the light of the sun.  A deliverance from the blackest night they will ever
know.

                                LINDSEY
                We should be dead.  We didn't decompress.

                                CATFISH
                Out blood oughta be fizzin' like a warm, shook-
                up Coke.

                                HIPPY
                They must've done something to us.

Lindsey has tears streaming down her cheeks... for the sun, for life, for
their deliverance and the larger one she knows has happened, an epiphany for
the whole human race.

                                LINDSEY
                Oh, yes.  I think you could say that.

She blinks.  Seeing something not far away.  She gives a little laugh, or
something between laughing and crying.

REVERSE, as Bud walks up the curving incline of one of the mouth-like
enterances to the NTI structure.  His suit is casually unzipped and the FBS
helmet dangles from one hand jauntily.

She starts toward him.  Breaks into a run.  Then stops a few feet from him.
Watching him come to her.

His smile, his eyes illuminating her.

He stops and she touches him, lightly.  Is this real?

The look at each other, wonderingly a moment.

Then laugh.  She sniffs loudly.

                                LINDSEY
                Hello, Brigman.

                                BUD
                Hello, Mrs. Brigman.

Their lips meet.

                                                                CUT TO BLACK

TITLE: THE ABYSS -- ON BLACK, DISSOLVING TO COBALT BLUE

EXT. OCEAN/UNDERWATER -- DAY                                            3

Blue, deep and featureless, the twilight of five hundred feet down.
PROPELLER SOUND.  Materializing out of the blue limbo is the enormous but
sleek form of an Ohio-class SSBN ballistic missile submarine.

INT. U.S.S. MONTANA -- DAY                                              4

In the attack center, darkened to womb-red, the crew's faces shine with sweat
in the glow of their instruments.  The SKIPPER and his EXEC crowd around
BARNES, the sonarman.

                                CAPTAIN
                Sixty knots?  No way, Barnes... the reds don't
                have anything that fast.

                                BARNES
                Checked it twice, skipper.  It's a real unique
                signature.  No cavitation, no reactor noise...
                doesn't even sound like screws.

He puts the signal onto a speaker and everyone in the attack room listens to
the intruder's acoustic signature, a strange THRUMMING.  The captain studies
the electronic position board, a graphic representation of the contours of
the steep-walled canyon, a symbol for the Montana, and converging with it, an
amorphous trace, representing the bogey.

                                CAPTAIN
                What the hell is it?

                                EXEC
                I'll tell you what it's not, it's not one of
                ours.

                                BARNES
                Sir!  Contact changing heading to two-one-four,
                diving.  Speed eighty knots!  Eighty knots!

                                EXEC
                Eighty knots...

                                BARNES
                Still diving, depth nine hundred feet.  Port
                clearance to cliff wall, one hundred fifty feet.

                                FRANK
                           (simultaneously)
                Still diving, depth nine hundred feet.  Port
                clearance to cliff wall, one hundred fifty feet.

Tension builds in the attack room as the Montana surges to intercept the
intruder.  The exec tensely watches the vector-graphic readout for the side-
scan sonar array.  The sub is running uncomfortably close to the cliff walls.

                                EXEC
                          (low, to Captain)
                It's getting tight in here.

                                CAPTAIN
                We can still give him a haircut.  Helm, come
                right to oh six niner, down five degrees.

                                HELMSMAN
                Coming right to oh six niner, sir.  Down five
                degrees.

                                NAVIGATOR
                Port side clearance one hundred twenty feet
                narrowing to seventy-five.  Sir, we have a
                proximity warning light.

                                EXEC
                That's too damn close!  We've gotta back off.

                                BARNES
                Range to contact, two hundred.  Contact junked to
                bearing two six oh and accelerated to... one
                hundred thirty knots, sir!

                                EXEC
                         (really freaked now)
                Nothing goes one thirty!

Suddenly the control room lights dim almost to blackness.

EXT. U.S.S. MONTANA                                                     5

We see only the effect, not the source, as a large diffuse light passes
rapidly under the sub's hull.  Moments later a shockwave, like an underwater
sonic boom, impacts the sub, slamming it sideways.

INT. U.S.S. MONTANA                                                     6

The bride crew are knocked off their feet, as the ship is buffeted.

                                EXEC
                Turbulence!  We're in its wake!

SIRENS.  Everyone shouting at once.  The power flickers low.

                                CAPTAIN
                Helm, all stop!  Full right rudder!

                                HELMSMAN
                All stop.  Full right rudder.  Hydraulic failure.
                Planes are not responding, sir!

Power returns in time for the sonarman to get a glimpse at the side-scan
display... AS THE SHEER CLIFF WALL LOOM BEFORE THEM.

                                HELMSMAN
                Hydraulics restored, sir.

EXT. U.S.S. MONTANA                                                     7

The cliff wall materializes out of the blue limbo off the port bow with
nightmarish slow-motion.  The sub slams into it with horrific force, scraping
along and bouncing off.  One tail stabilizer is sheared off and the big screw
prangs the wall with an earsplitting K-K-KWANG!

INT. PORT TO TORPEDO ROOM                                               8

With the outer tube-doors torn off, seawater slams in, busting the inner
hatches.  Two-foot thick columns of water, like fire-hoses of the gods,
blast into the room.  Everything vanishes instantly in white spray.

INT. CONTROL RM/ATTACK CENTER                                           9

Everyone is hurled off his feet.  The planesman flights to recover control of
the yoke.

                                CAPTAIN
                Collision alarm!  Collision alarm!  Lighten
                her up, Charlie!

                                NAVIGATOR
                The torpedo room is flooded, sir!

                                CAPTAIN
                Blow all tanks!  Blow everything!

                                HELMSMAN
                Passing twelve hundred feet...

                                EXEC
                Blowing main tanks!

                                HELMSMAN
                Twelve hundred fifty feet...

EXT. MONTANA                                                            10

The great sub is being hauled down by the mass of its flooded bow section,
its flanks rushing past us like a freight train headed for Hell.

INT. MONTANA CONTROL ROOM                                               11

The command crew fights futility for control, everyone shouting and terrified.

                                EXEC
                Main forward tanks ruptured!

                                HELMSMAN
                Passing thirteen hundred feet...

                                EXEC
                Too deep to pump auxiliaries!

                                CAPTAIN
                All back full!  All back full!

                                HELMSMAN
                Answering all back full.  Passing thirteen hundred
                fifty feet... fourteen hundred... fourteen
                fifty...

The Captain locks eyes with the Exec amid the din...

                                CAPTAIN
                We're losing her.  Launch the buoy!

The Exec opens the door to a small box and punches a button.  A red light
comes on.  The Captains takes a deep breath.

EXT. MONTANA                                                            12

A tiny transmitter is ejected from the sub's hell and begins its long ascent
to the surface.  A second later the sub slams down like a piledriver onto a
ledge, tearing open its pressure hull.

INT. MONTANA                                                            13

VARIOUS QUICK CUTS, just flashes and impressions, as...
Seawater blasts down the corridors --
Explodes across the control room, hurling men like dolls --
Floods the cavernous missile bay in seconds --
Bursts through hatches into the reactor room --
Blasts men OUT OF FRAME in a micro-second.

EXT. OCEAN/UNDERWATER                                                   14

In the cobalt twilight we see the Montana slide down the sea cliff, its hull
SCREECHING like the death agonies of some marine dinosaur.  Descending in an
avalanche of silt, it finally disappears into the blackness below... a
blackness which continues almost straight down, 20,000 feet to the bottom of
the Cayman Trough.  The abyss.

EXT. OCEAN SURFACE -- DAY                                               15

Above, in the world, the Caribbean rolling gray under a stormy sky.  The
Montana's emergency buoy pops to the surface, transmitting.

                                                                CUT TO:

EXT. OCEAN/20 MILES AWAY -- DAY                                         16

LONG LENS SHOT: three massive Navy Sea King helicopters thundering straight
at us, FILLING FRAME.

REVERSE, as they barrel OVER CAMERA toward a lone civilian ship... an ugly
but very sophisticated deep-sea drilling support ship, the BENTHIC EXPLORER.
It is a twin-hulled monstrosity with a central opening in its deck, around
which crouch enormous cranes, winches and other arcane equipment.

The first Sea King settles onto the helipad, disgorging a contingent of Naval
officers, technicians, and a squad of armed seamen.  A pantomime in the
rotorwash, we see the Benthic Petroleum "company man" KIRKHILL greeting
COMMODORE DEMARCO, the on-scene commander.

INT. BENTHIC EXPLORER/BRIDGE -- DAY                                     17

The bridge is state-of-the-art, with computers and sophisticated navigation
and communications gear, looking like mission control with its bank of video
monitors.  The Drilling Operations Supervisor, LELAND MCBRIDE, and BENDIX,
the crew chief, watch the invaders swarming the deck below.

                                MCBRIDE
                Does not look good at all.

TIGHT ON VIDEO SCREEN (MINUTES LATER) showing divers working in total
blackness around some sort of installation on the bottom of the ocean.  They
move through the harsh floodlights in dreamlike slow motion, looking like
space-suited figures with their helmets and umbilical hoses.

                                DEMARCO (V.O.)
                No light from the surface.  How deep are they?

                                MCBRIDE (V.O.)
                Seventeen hundred feet.

WIDER, showing the Navy contingent crowding the control room.  DeMarco is
hardcore military, brusque and efficient.  Kirkhill is a small man with
pinched features, wearing a shirt and tie, which on a drill ship means
company man and/or dickhead.

                                DEMARCO
                I need them to go to over two thousand.

                                KIRKHILL
                They can do it.
                              (to McBride)
                Get Brigman on the line.

EXT. UNDERWATER -- DAY (TOTAL DARKNESS)                                 18

1700 FEET BELOW.  A submersible oil-drilling platform, DEEPCORE II, an island
of light in the vast blackness.  Its main framework connects two "tri-
modules" consisting of three cylinders each.  These contain living and work
areas in a pressurized environment.  An umbilical cable, thick as a man's
thigh, runs up from the oil rig into the darkness, to the Benthic Explorer
at the surface.  In a bubble-like dome port window we see the rig foreman, or
"toolpusher," BUD BRIGMAN.  He's talking (via headset) with two divers
working outside... 'CATFISH' DE VRIES, AND LEW 'BIRD-DOG' FINLER.

                                BUD
                Hey, you guys are milking that job.

                                CATFISH
                           (Kentucky drawl)
                That's cause we love freezin' our butts off out

Bud turns from the window and crosses the drill floor.  The working heart of
the rig.  THUNDEROUS MECHANICAL ROAR.  The drill crew, in hardhats and mud-
plastered overalls, tend the massive spinning turn-table in the center of the
chamber.  The semi-automated system requires only five men to operate.  The
others are LUPTON MCWHIRTER, DWIGHT PERRY, JAMMER WILLIS, and TOMMY RAY
DIETZ.  Bud hears his names called above the din by Jammer, a massive
roughneck/diver who stands a good head taller than the rest.

                                JAMMER
                               (yelling)
                Bud!  Hippy's on the bitch-box.  It's a call
                from topside.  That new company man.

                                BUD
                Kirkhill?  That guy doesn't know his butt from
                a rathole.  Hey, Perry!

One of the roustabouts, a wiry Texan, turns to him.

                                BUD
                Do me a favor and square away the mud hose and
                those cable slings.  This place is starting to
                look like my apartment.

Perry chuckles and sets to the task cheerfully.  Bud EXITS, ducking his head
through a low watertight hatch.

INT. CORRIDOR/TOOLPUSHER'S OFFICE                                       21

Bud tromps down the narrow corridor, his work boots gonging on steel.

                                P.A. (HIPPY'S VOICE)
                BUD, PICK UP THE TOPSIDE LINE URGENT.

                                BUD
                I'm coming.  Keep your pantyhose on.

He enters his office, a tiny cubicle with stacks of paperwork, dust-
gathering tech manuals and waterstained Penthouse fold-outs.  He picks up the
phone... punches down a line.

                                BUD
                Brigman here.  Kirkhill?  What's going on?
                              (pause)
                I am calm.  I'm a calm person.  Is there some
                reason why I shouldn't be calm?

HOLD ON Bud's expression, darkening, as he listens.

INT. CORRIDOR/CONTROL MODULE                                            22

The control module is a long narrow cabin like the inside of a Winnebago,
packed with instrumentation.  At the end is a small bay with multiple
viewports.  Outside, at a 'Christmas tree' pipe installation, a lone diver
can be seen welding.  He is accompanied by a large submersible, FLATBED, and
by a Remotely Operated Vehicle, or ROV, call LITTLE GEEK.  Little Geek is an
underwater robot which operated on the end of a cable-like control TETHER.
It has a single video 'eye' in front, by which the operator pilots the little
machine.  The rig's ROV pilots is ALLEN 'HIPPY' CARNES, who stands by the
window twiddling his joysticks and drinking coffee.  His pet white rat,
BEANY, crawls contentedly around his shoulders.  The door BANGS OPEN.

Hippy jumps, slops his coffee.  Bud strides in.  Not calm.

                                BUD
                Son of a bitch.

He kicks a chair out of the way and slams his palm down on a switch marked
DIVER RECALL.  A SIREN, blasting through the water from a big hydrophone
loudspeaker.

                                BUD
                All divers.  Drop what you're doing.  Everybody
                out of the pool.

EXT. DEEPCORE/CHRISTMAS TREE                                            A22

Flatbed's pilot, LISA 'ONE NIGHT' STANDING, can be clearly seen behind a
bubble canopy.  She is a no-nonsense lady who holds her own in the mostly
male environment by being one of the best submersible drivers in the
business.  She controls a hydraulic manipulator arm, assisting the diver,
ARLISS 'SONNY' DAWSON, in his work.  Little Geek hovers around them like a
tiny helicopter.  One Night moves the Flatbed arm to Sonny and hands him the
pipe.

                                ONE NIGHT
                Here you go, hon'.

                                SONNY
                Just in time, sugar.

They react to Bud's recall, looking toward him up in the control module.

                                ONE NIGHT
                Dammit, we just got out here.

                                SONNY
                There was a time when I would have asked why.

One Night makes a grab for his butt with the manipulator claw, which he
narrowly avoids.

                                                                CUT TO:

EXT. DEEPCORE/UNDER SUB-BAY                                             23

Flatbed moves underneath the rig, a few feet above the seafloor, with Sonny
riding on its top deck.  It passes under a lit opening and rises toward the
surface of the water in the chamber above.  Little Geek follows like an
obedient dog.

INT. SUB-BAY/MOONPOOL                                                   24

The opening is called the moonpool, and Deepcore's submersibles are launched
through it.  From inside the sub-bay it looks just like a swimming pool.
Flatbed surfaces, nearly filling it.  The chamber also contains CAB ONE, a
similar submersible.  Jammer, Perry, and some of the other drill-room boys
are helping the divers out of the water.  The water at this depth is only
about six degrees above freezing, and these folks are cold and prune-
fingered.  Finler pulls off his demand-helmet, revealing a round, boyish
face.

                                FINLER
                What's goin' on?  How come we got recalled?

                                SONNY
                Hell is I know.

One Night jumps 'ashore' from Flatbed's broad deck and joins them.  Catfish
is unzipping his bulky dry-suit.

                                CATFISH
                Just follow standard procedure, will ya...
                flog the dog till somebody tells us what's
                happening.

                                JAMMER
                Hey, Catfish, I'll sell you my October Penthouse
                for twenty bucks.

                                ONE NIGHT
                Save you money, darlin'... the pages are all
                stuck together by now.

Bud enters, approaching the group.

                                JAMMER
                What's goin' on, Boss?

                                BUD
                Folks, I've just been told to shut down the hole
                and prepare to move the rig.

                                SONNY
                She-hit.

                                BUD
                We're being asked to cooperate in a matter of
                national security.  Now you know exactly as much
                as I do.  So just get your gear off and get up to
                control.  There's some kind of briefing in ten
                minutes.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. DEEPCORE/COMMAND MODULE                                            25

The whole rig crew is somehow jammed into the room for the video briefing.
DeMarco is on the main monitor, with his aides and Kirkhill visible b.g.

                                DEMARCO
                At 09:22 local time this morning, an American
                nuclear submarine, the USS Montana, with 156 men
                aboard, went down 22 miles from here.  There has
                been no contact with the sub since then.  The
                cause of the incident is not known.

PAN AROUND the reactions of the various drill crew members... shocked,
hushed, curious.

                                DEMARCO
                Your company has authorized the Navy's use of
                this facility for a rescue operation.  The code
                name is Operation Salvor.

                                ONE NIGHT
                You want us to search for the sub?

                                DEMARCO
                No.  We know where it is.  But she's in 2000 feet
                of water and we can't reach her.  We need divers
                to enter the sub and search for survivors, if
                any.

Bud's scowl has been deepening since DeMarco started to talk.

                                BUD
                Don't you guys have your own stuff for this type
                of thing?

                                DEMARCO
                By the time we get our rescue submersible here
                the storm front will be right on us.  But you
                can get your rig in under the storm and be on-
                site in fifteen hours.  That makes you our best
                option right now.

Hippy, born suspicious and recently graduated to paranoid, leans forward...

                                HIPPY
                Why should we risk our butts on a job like this?

                                KIRKHILL
                I have been authorized to offer you all special-
                duty bonuses equivalent to three times normal
                dive pay.

                                CATFISH
                Hell, for triple time I'd crawl through razor
                blades and shower off with lime juice.

                                FINLER
                I'm here to tell ya', you could set me on fire
                and call me names.

                                BUD
                Look, I don't know what kind of a deal you guys
                worked out with the company, but my people are
                not qualified for this... they're oil workers.

                                DEMARCO
                A four-man SEAL team will transfer down to you
                to supervise the operation.

                                BUD
                You can send down whoever you like, but I'm the
                toolpusher on this rig, and when it comes to the
                safety of these people, there's me... then
                there's God.  Understand?  If things get dicey,
                I'm pulling the plug.

                                KIRKHILL
                I think we're all on the same wavelength,
                Brigman.  Now let's get the wellhead uncoupled,
                shall we?

A single Navy Sea King churns through the rain under massive thunderheads.
The sea below is whipped by the storm.

INT./EXT. SEA KING                                                      28

PANNING ALONG BOOTED FEET, four pairs of black military size twelves line
up, onto... a pair of Charles Jourdans fives under shapely ankles.

WIDER, revealing the four-man team of Navy SEALs.  And a slender woman in
her early thirties.  She's attractive, if a bit hardened, dressed
conservatively in a skirt and jacket.  Meet LINDSEY.  Project Engineer for
Deepcore.  She's a pain in the ass, but you'll like her.  Eventually.
She's holding on grimly, sitting crammed in with the SEALs and a bunch of
gear, getting tossed around by the storm.  The SEALs are dressed alike in
black fatigues.  They are muscular, finely-tuned and extremely dangerous
special-forces types.  The leader of the SEAL team, LIEUTENANT COFFEY, makes
his way forward to the cockpit.

The pilot is white-knuckling his stick, trying to hold the great beast of a
helicopter in position.  Through the windshield, the deck of the Benthic
Explorer can be seen below, pitching in a violent sea.

                                PILOT
                No way I'm putting her down.  I shouldn't even
                be flying in this shit.

                                COFFEY
                                (cool)
                Just hold it over the deck.

Coffey goes back to the crew deck, moving easily in the bucking craft.  He
nods to the others SEALs, MONK, WILHITE, and SCHOENICK.  In the open side
door, Wilhite clips a 100 foot nylon rope to the airframe and throws out the
coil.  One by one the shoulder the gear-bags, grab the rope, and step out.
Lindsey stands swaying in the chopper door, watching the SEALs fast-roping
to the deck.  One, two, three.  Coffey looks at her.

                                COFFEY
                You want to be on that ship, there's only one
                way it's going to happen.

He's sure she won't go for it.  It's his certainty that gets her.  She sets
her jaw.  Opening her purse she takes out a small plastic bag, puts her
shoes and purse in the bag, and grips the bag in her teeth.  Then grabs
the rope and slides down.

EXT. BENTHIC EXPLORER/HELIPAD                                           29

Swinging wildly in the wind like a human pendulum, Lindsey fast-ropes forty
feet to the deck.  She steps away an instant before Coffey hits behind her.
Lindsey crosses the rainswept deck with athletic strides.  Her nylons are
ruined.  An air-crewman in the chopper lowers two additional equipment cases
using the rescue sling.  The SEALs catch them as they swing radically across
the deck.  They Navy chopper banks and seems to scurry away before the
mounting storm.

Flatbed appears, trailing two heavy two cables.  Behind it, the mass of
Deepcore emerges from the darkness, its forward lighting array blazing.
Flatbed is towing it like a tug, aided by Deepcore's own mighty stern

Bud responds via video.

                                BUD
                Fred, huh?  I don't know.  Hurricanes should be
                named after women.

McBride looks up as the bridge door opens.  Lindsey enters in a blast of wind,
wet as a wharf rat and twice as pissed off.  Maybe Bud is right.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. DEEPCORE/CONTROL MODULE                                            33

Bud is surprised to see Lindsey's face appear on the monitor screen.

                                LINDSEY
                I can't believe you let them do this!

                                BUD
                     (unpreturbed, almost cheerful)
                Hi, Lins.  I thought you were in Houston.

                                LINDSEY
                I was, but I managed to bum a ride on the last
                flight out here.  Only here isn't where I left
                it, is it, Bud?

                                BUD
                Wasn't up to me.

                                LINDSEY
                We were that close to proving a submersible
                drilling platform could work.  We had over seven
                thousand feet of hole down for Chrissake.  I
                can't believe you let them grab my rig!

                                BUD
                Your rig?

                                LINDSEY
                My rig.  I designed the damn thing.

                                BUD
                Yup, a Benthic Petroleum paid for it.  So as long
                as they're hold the pink slip, I go where they
                tell me.

                                LINDSEY
                You wimp.  I had a lot riding on this.  They
                bought you... more like least rented you cheap--

                                BUD
                I'm switching off now.

                                LINDSEY
                Virgil, you wiener!  You never could stand up
                to fight.  You--

Bud hits the switch and the screen goes dead.

                                BUD
                Bye.

Hippy looks over him, trying very hard not to crack up.

                                HIPPY
                Virgil?

                                BUD
                God, I hate that bitch.

                                HIPPY
                Yeah, well you never should have married her then.

Bud nods fatalistically.

                                                                CUT TO:

EXT. EXPLORER DECK/LAUNCH WELL                                          34

Ten foot waves crash through the launch-well, sending up geysers of spray.
Next to the launch-well, crewman have attached a lifting cable to CAB THREE,
eighteen feet of ugly yellow submersible.  It slams violently in its steel
cradle as the drill-ship rolls.  Coffey and Schoenick hand the gear bags in
to Wilhite and Monk though the hatch under the rear of the submersible.

Lindsey approaches, wearing a borrowed roustabout's coverall.

She looks down at the larger of the two equipment cases brought by the SEALs,
lying on the deck.  Stenciled on it are the words: F.B.S./DEEP SUIT/MARK IV.
Coffey and Schoenick push past her to pick it up.

                                LINDSEY
                Let's go, gentlemen!  We either launch now or
                we don't launch.

Coffey looks up in surprise as she nimbly climbs the side of Cab Three and
grabs the lifting shackle, circling her raised hand to signal the crane man.

                                LINDSEY
                Take her up, Byron!

Cab Three, with Lindsey riding its back, is pulled up out its cradle and
starts to swing violently as Explorer pitches.  The submersible is then
swung out to the center of the launch well.  It sways and gyrates above the
furious water below.  Lindsey drops into the upper hatch.

INT. EXPLORER BRIDGE/D.O.C.                                             35

Kirkhill leans suddenly over the console to look out the window.

                                KIRKHILL
                What the hell is she doing out there?  Son of a
                bitch...
                           (into microphone)
                Lindsey... get out of Cab Three.  Bates is taking
                her down.

INT. CAB THREE                                                          36

Lindsey pulls her headset as she dogs down the inside locking levers of the
hatch.

                                LINDSEY
                Bates is sick.  Besides I've got more hours in
                this thing than he does.
                              (to Coffey)
                A little change of plan.

The little sub is swinging like a pendulum on the cable, and the SEALs,
jammed in with their equipment in the tiny space, are getting slammed into
the walls.  Lindsey is calmly flipping switches as she talks.

                                COFFEY
                Lady, we better fish or cut bait.

                                LINDSEY
                Just hold your water, okay?
                             (to Kirkhill)
                So Kirkhill, we gonna do this or we gonna talk
                about it?

INT. EXPLORER BRIDGE/D.O.C.                                             37

The plug is pulled on DeMarco's patience.

                                DEMARCO
                I don't care who drives the damn thing.  Just get
                my team in the water.

                                KIRKHILL
                Alright, alright.  Christ Almighty!

He gestured dismissively to McBride.

                                MCBRIDE
                Cab Three, you are clear to launch.

INT./EXT. CAB THREE                                                     38

Lindsey reaches up a grabs a red lever.

                                LINDSEY
                Roger.
                              (to Coffey)
                There's only one way it's going to happen...

She pulls the lever hard.  CLUNK-CLANG!  The shackle-release drops the sub.
It freefalls ten feet to the water with an enormous splash and keeps right
on going after Lindsey floods the trim tanks.  Coffey et al have been slammed
hard.

                                LINDSEY
                Touchdown.  The crowd goes wild.  Explorer...
                Cab Three.  We are styling.

                                MCBRIDE (filtered)
                Roger, Cab Three.

Lindsey cuts on the floodlights and maneuvers the descending submersible so
that the umbilical cable is a few feet ahead on her front port.  Moving up
through her lights, it will guide her down to the rig.  Cab Three free-falls
into increasing darkness.  Soon it is a candle below us in the indigo.

EXT./INT. FLATBED                                                       39

One Night is driving the tug one-handed, pouring coffee from a thermos and
rocking out to the great truck-driving song "Willing" on the beat-box she's
got propped up on the sonar rig.  Fighting white-line fever in the best
tradition.

INT. CONTROL MODULE                                                     40

Bud and Hippy come in for a rousing chorus.

                                BUD/HIPPY
              ... I've been driving every kinda rig that's
                ever been maaaaade...

EXT. DEEPCORE                                                           41

Lit up like a proud Peterbilt, the rig crossed the trackless wastes.  We
hear them singing, carried OVER.

EXT. OCEAN DEPTHS/CAB THREE                                             42

In total blackness, the submersible descends along the rigorous line of the
umbilical cable.  Two hundred feet below it, the lights of Deepcore resolve
out of the darkness.  Now we can see the rig crawling over the ocean bottom
like some monster lawnmower.

                                LINDSEY (V.O.)
                Deepcore, Deepcore... this is Cab Three on
                final approach.

                                HIPPY (V.O.)
                Gotcha, Cab Three.  Who is that?  That You,
                Lindsey?

INT. DEEPCORE/CONTROL MODULE                                            43

Bud stop singing and snaps around at the mention of her name.

                                LINDSEY (V.O.)
                None other.

Bud's expression is nothing less than stricken.

                                BUD
                Oh no... you gotta be kidding me.

EXT./CAB THREE/DEEP CORE                                                44

Lindsey executes a 180 degree turn and cruises over the control module, back
through the A-frame toward the docking hatch.  The flange of Cab Three's
lockout hatch settles over the pressure collar on the rig's back.  There is
a CLUNK as it mates up.

INT. DEEPCORE/COMPRESSION CHAMBER/GAS CONTROL STATION                   45

Lindsey drops down from the hatch into the small cylindrical pressure chamber.
The SEALs drop down behind her, passing their gear through hand-over-hand.
The chamber is spartan, with steel benches, a folding card table, breathing
masks, and medical supplies.  Catfish greets them through the tiny porthole
at one end.

                                CATFISH
                Howdy, y'all.  Hey, Lindsey!  I'll be damned!
                You shouldn't be down here sweet thing, ya'll
                might run ya stockings.

                                LINDSEY
                Couldn't stay away.  You running mixture for us?
                Good.  Couldn't ask for better.

                                CATFISH
                Okay, here we go.  Start equalizing, y'all.

HISSSS of inrushing compressed gas.  The pressure in the chamber rises.  The
breathing mixture is composed of helium, oxygen and nitrogen.  Catfish
monitors it carefully from a station outside the chamber, watching the
gauges with a practiced eye.  Lindsey and the SEALs all grab their noses
and start making funny faces... popping their ears with the familiar diver's
'equalization' technique.  They continue as:

                                LINDSEY
                Get comfortable.  The bad news is we got six
                hours in this can, blowing down.  The worse news
                is it's gonna take us three weeks to decompress
                back to the surface later.

                                COFFEY
                We've been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman.

                                LINDSEY
                Don't call me that, okay... I hate that.  Alright,
                from now on we watch each other closely for
                signs of HPNS...

                                MONK
                           (as if by rote)
                High-Pressure Nervous Syndrome.  Muscle tremors,
                usually in the hands first.  Nausea, increased
                excitability, disorientation.

                                LINDSEY
                Very good.  About one person in twenty just can't
                handle it.  They go buggo.  They're no way to
                predict who's susceptible, so stay alert.

                                COFFEY
                Look, we've all made chamber runs to this depth.
                We're checked out.

                                LINDSEY
                Oh... chamber runs.  Uh huh, that's good.
                          (Coffey turn away)
                Well, hey... you guys know any songs?

They ignore her.  Start going over some diagrams of the Montana's interior.
It's going to be a long six hours.

INT. GAS CONTROL STATION -- HOURS LATER                                 46

Catfish checks his watch, then reaches over and adjusts a value on the tri-
mix manifold, watching the gauges.  Satisfied, he leans over to the pressure
window in the door, checking out the SEALs.  Hippy has come down from the
control deck for an advanced look are the interlopers.  Jammer is in a chair,
reading a Louis L'Amour paperback.

                                CATFISH
                Those guys ain't so tough.  I fought plenty of
                guys tougher'n them.

                                HIPPY
                Now we get to hear about how he used to be a
                contender.

Catfish hold up one calloused fist up in front of Hippy's face.

                                CATFISH
                You see this?  They used to call this the Hammer.

                                JAMMER
                Hippy wasn't born then.

INT. PRESSURE CHAMBER                                                   47

It looks like the end of a long bus trip.  Everyone silent... leafing
through beat-to-hell magazines or just staring.  Lindsey has her feet propped
up on the smaller of the SEALs' two equipment cases.  She casually toes open
one of the latches, then the other.  Glances at Coffey.  He's reading.  She
begins to lift the lid with her toe.  Gets a GLIMPSE INSIDE, of packing foam,
and what looks like a SMALL BLACK METAL BOX.  Then... WHAM!  Coffey's foot
comes down on the lid, slamming it shut.  Startled, she looks up into his
cool gaze.

                                COFFEY
                Curiosity killed the cat.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. GAS CONTROL STATION/CHAMBER DOOR -- LATER                          48

TIGHT ON CATFISH'S hands... closing values... spinning the wheel on the
chamber hatch.  CUT WIDER as it cracks open with a virgin's sigh and swings
aside.

                                CATFISH
                Y'all'er done to a turn and ready to serve.
                Everybody okay?

The SEALs nod peremptorily and shoulder their gear.  Lindsey exists first,
followed by Monk, Wilhite, and Schoenick.  Coffey bends to relatch the small
equipment case.  He is alone for one moment in the chamber.  He raises his
hand and stares at it.  The fingertips are trembling the slightest bit.  He
clenches them into a fist and walks out.

INT. CORRIDOR                                                           49

As Lindsey emerges into the main corridor of the rig, she bumps into a large,
dark mass.

                                LINDSEY
                Hey, was there a wall here before?  I don't
                remember a wall here.  Oh, Jammer!  Hi.

The 'wall' grins down to her.

                                JAMMER
                Howdy, there, little lady.

Coffey emerges behind them and, ignoring Lindsey, faces Jammer.

                                COFFEY
                              (to Jammer)
                Show us the dive prep area.  We need to check
                out your gear.

Jammer scowls, turns and leads the SEALs in the sub-bay.  Catfish and Lindsey
exchange a look.

                                LINDSEY
                Those guys are about a much fun as a tax audit.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. COMMAND MODULE                                                     50

TIGHT ON HIPPY, bathed in the light of the sonar display.  He is making
kissing sounds at Beany, who has his inquisitive nose right up to Hippy's
lips.

                                LINDSEY
                Hippy, you're going to give that rat a disease.

WIDER, as Hippy and Bud to see Lindsey leaning in the doorway.  She and Bud
size each other up.  He opts for a jovial approach, his eyes wary.

                                BUD
                Well, well.  Mrs. Brigman.

                                LINDSEY
                Not for long.

Lindsey crossed past him, her eyes scanning the banks of equipment, almost
unconsciously checking, checking... getting the pulse of her big iron baby.

                                BUD
                You never did like being called that, did you?

                                LINDSEY
                Not even when it meant something.
                     (looking through the front port)
                Is that One Night up in Flatbed?

                                BUD
                Who else?

Lindsey leans past Bud to the gooseneck mike on the console.

                                LINSEY
                Hi, One Night, it's Lindsey.

INT. FLATBED                                                            51

One Night mimes a puking motion, finger down her throat.  Then she replies
with sickening sweetness...

                                ONE NIGHT
                Oh, hi, Lindsey.

INT. COMMAND MODULE                                                     52

Lindsey fives the sonar shack the once-over.  She tweaks some knobs.

                                BUD
                I can't believe you were dumb enough to come
                down.  Now you're stuck here for the storm...
                dumb, hot-rod... dumb.

                                LINDSEY
                Look, I didn't come down here to fight.

She crosses past Bud and exits into the corridor.  Bud bolts out of the chair
to follow her and Hippy scrambles in to take over.

INT. CORRIDOR/LADDER-WELL/LEVEL ONE LANDING                             53

Bud catches up with Lindsey in the corridor, and through the following keeps
pace with here as she make here inspection.

                                BUD
                Then why'd you come down?

She stops abruptly to look at a leaky pipe.  He almost slams into her.  She
moves on, climbing down the ladder to the lower level.

                                LINDSEY
                You need me.  Nobody knows the systems on this
                rig better than I do.  What is something was
                to go wrong after the Explorer clears off?  What
                would have you done?

                                BUD
                Wow, you're right!  Us poor dumb ol' boys might've
                had to think for ourselves.  Coulda been a
                disaster.

On the lower level landing, Lindsey opens a hatch into one of the machine
rooms.  ROAR OF PUMPS AND COMPRESSORS.

INT. MACHINE ROOM                                                       54

Lindsey enters and moves expertly through the dark labyrinth of pipes and
roaring machinery.  Her eyes rove constantly over fittings, gauges, circuit
panels.

                                BUD
                             (yelling)
                You wanna know what I think?

                                LINDSEY
                Not particularly.  Jeez, look where this is set!
                Morons.

She scowls at a pressure gauge and turn a valve minutely.

                                BUD
                I think you were worried about me.

                                LINDSEY
                That must be it.

Lindsey's on the move again, and Bud scrambles through the pipes to keep up.

                                BUD
                No, I think you were.  Come on, admit it.

                                LINDSEY
                I was worried about the rig.  I've got over four
                years invested in this project.

                                BUD
                Oh, yeah, right... and you only had three years
                with me.

She looks up at him.

                                LINDSEY
                You've got to have priorities.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. BUD'S ROOM                                                         55

Darkness.  The door opens and Bud snaps on the light.

                                BUD
                My bunk's the only one I can guarantee won't be
                occupied.  You can grab a couple hours before
                we get there.

Lindsey slips past him into his tiny state-room, the only private bunk on the
rig.  Rank had its privileges.  His hand on the door is just level with her
eyes.  She notices his wedding ring, a massive band of pure titanium
(something your fiancee might have picked out if she had a degree from
M.I.T.).

                                LINDSEY
                What are you still wearing that for?

                                BUD
                I don't know.  Divorce ain't final.  Forgot to
                take it off.

Bud stays in the doorway.  Lindsey takes a heaps of Bud's cloths off the
narrow bunk.  Start unconsciously straightening the room.

                                LINDSEY
                I haven't worn mine in months.

                                BUD
                Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it.  The
                Suit.

                                LINDSEY
                Do you always have to call him that?  The Suit?
                It makes you sound like such a hick.  His name
                is Michael.

Lindsey takes off her borrowed tennies and socks.

Bud eyes her, sounding too causal.

                                BUD
                So what about "Michael" then... Mr. Brooks
                Brothers... Mr. BMW.  You still seeing him?

                                LINDSEY
                No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks.

                                BUD
                What happened?

                                LINDSEY
                Bud, why are you doing this?  It's not part of
                you life any more.

                                BUD
                I'll tell you what happened... you woke up one
                day and realized the guy never made you laugh.

                                LINDSEY
                You're right, Bud.  It was just that simple.
                Aren't you clever?  You should get your own
                show... Ask Dr. Bud, advice to the lovelorn
                from three hundred fathoms.

She closes the watertight door, forcing him out.  Locks it.  She turns and
throws her shoe hard against the far wall.

                                LINDSEY
                AAAARRRGGH!

She flops down on the bed, sitting... staring at the wall.  Her armor is
gone.  She looks small and vulnerable.  A long beat.  She reaches over to the
tiny sink.  Amid the clutter is a bottle of Bud's aftershave.  She unscrews
it and takes a sniff.  Catches herself.  Tosses it.

                                LINDSEY
                Shit.

INT. QUARTERS/HEAD                                                      56

Bud barges into the tiny head and puts some soap on his ring finger.  He pulls
the ring off roughly and throws it into the toilet.  He reaches forward to
flush.  Can't do it.  Now really pissed off at himself, he reaches into the
toilet bowl, wrist deep in the chemical-blue water, and salvages the ring.
He puts it on and washes his hands.  The right hand stays faintly blue no
matter how hard he scrubs.

                                BUD
                Shit.

                                                                CUT TO:

The platform is stopped, hovering in place.  Like a great spacecraft setting
down on a barren planet, the rig settles into the bottom ooze.  Flatbed
releases its tow lines and heads back to its berth inside.

                                                                CUT TO:

CLOSE ON A PHOTOGRAPH, actually a computer-composited down-looking scan from
a towed LIDAR (laser imaging sonar) rig.  It shows a faint, blurry outline of
the Montana lying on her side on a ledge part-way down the canyon wall.  There
is no detail.  A finger points to a flat ledge nearby.  An "X" has been put
on with a grease pencil.

                                COFFEY (V.O.)
                This is us.  We're just on the edge of the Cayman
                Trough.  The Montana is here, on its side, 300
                meters away and 70 meters below us.  We think she
                slid down the wall, and lodged against this
                outcropping.

CUT WIDE, showing the rig crew gathered around a worktable in the sub-bay.
The divers, Bud, Catfish, Sonny, Finler, Jammer, and the four SEALs have
their dry-suits on.  The pre-dive briefing.  Lindsey, One Night, and Hippy
will crew the submersibles.  Wilhite is going around clipping DOSIMETER
BADGES on everybody.

                                SONNY
                This tells us how much radiation we get?

                                HIPPY
                Hey, whoah... I can't handle no radiation, man.
                Forget it!  Include me out.

                                CATFISH
                Hippy, you pussy.

                                HIPPY
                What good's the money if your dick drops off in
                six months?

                                COFFEY
                We'll take reading as we go.  If the reactor's
                breached or the warheads have released
                radioactive debris, we'll back away.  Simple.

                                BUD
                Okay... Hippy's not going... McWhirter, you
                can run Little Geek.

Bud pats the top of a small ROV, sitting next to its larger brother, Big
Geek.

                                HIPPY
                No way!  No way!  He can't fly an ROV worth
                shit.  I'll go.  Shit!

                                COFFEY
                               (to all)
                On the dive, you will do absolutely nothing
                without direct orders from me, and you will
                follow my instructions without discussion.  Is
                this clear?  Alright, I want everyone finished
                prep and ready to get wet in fifteen minutes.

The rig crew disperses, picking up helmets and diving gear.  Some are studying
the diagrams of the Montana's interior layout.  Bud takes Coffey aside as
the others prepare.

                                BUD
                Look, it's three AM.  These guys are running on
                bad coffee and four hours sleep.  You better
                start cutting them some slack.

                                COFFEY
                I can't afford slack, Brigman.

                                BUD
                Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me,
                you start ordering my guys around.  It won't
                work.  You gotta know how to handle these
                people... we have a certain way of doing things
                here.

                                COFFEY
                I'm not interested in your way of doing things.
                Just get your team ready to dive.

End of discussion.  Coffey is walking away.  Burning, Bud crosses to his gear
locker.  Picks up his helmet.  Finler is suiting out next to him.

                                FINLER
                Hey, you know your hand is blue?

                                BUD
                Shut up and get your gear on.

NEARBY, Monk comes over to pick his helmet up off the worktable.  Hippy
points to the heavy equipment case that says F.B.S. DEEP SUIT/MARK IV.

                                HIPPY
                I've been meaning to ask you what this thing is.

Mink opens the case and shows them an unfamiliar diving suit, what looks like
a space helmet, and a large backpack.

                                MONK
                Fluid breathing system.  We just got them.  We
                use it if we need to go really deep.

                                HIPPY
                How deep?

                                MONK
                Deep.
                     (shrugs)
                It's classified... you know.  Anyway, you
                breathe liquid, so you can't be compressed.
                Pressure doesn't get to you.

Catfish is grappling with the concept.

                                CATFISH
                You're saying you get liquid in your lungs?

                                MONK
                Oxygenated fluorocarbon emulsion.

Monk take a clear plastic box full of O-rings off the shelf and dumps them
out.  He opens a valve on the backpack and allows some of the fluid inside
it to drain into the box.  Then he take Beany by the tail off Hippy's
shoulder.

                                HIPPY
                Hey!

                                MONK
                Check this out.

He drops Beany in the box and, before Hippy can protest, closes the lid.
Beany is forced under the surface.  He struggled for a second, and bubbles
come out of his mouth.  Then he casually swims around in there, completely
submerged... breathing liquid.  Catfish and the others stare into the box,
amazed.

                                MONK
                See?  He's diggin' it.

Monk takes Beany out and hold him by the tail for a few seconds to drain his
lungs.  Then hands him back to Hippy.  The rat is annoyed, but otherwise
alright.

                                CATFISH
                This is no bullshit hands down the goddamnedest
                thing I ever saw.

Three sets of moving lights move outward from Deepcore.  Cab One and Three,
with Lindsey and Hippy at the controls respectively, and One Night in the
Flatbed.  Lindsey is in the lead.  She approaches the cliff-like drop-off
and starts to descend.

                                LINDSEY
                Com-check, everybody.  Flatbed, you on line?

Eight divers ride the back of Flatbed like itinerant workers on the way to
the fields.  Bud and his civilian crew, Catfish, Finler, and Jammer... sit
across from the SEALs.  They are in their gear and breathing from umbilical
hooked in Flatbed's low-pressure manifold.

                                BUD
                Okay so far.

                                JAMMER
                How deep's the drop-off here?

                This here's the bottomless pit, baby.  Two and
                a half miles straight down.

Lindsey consults her array of instruments.

                                COFFEY
                Cab One, do you see it yet?

                                LINDSEY
                The magnetometer is pegged.  Side-scan is showing
                a big return, but I don't see anything yet.  Are
                you sure you got the depth right on this?

                                BUD (V.O., filtered)
                You should be almost to it, ace.

She turns the submersible and...

The spotlight flares back from the great brass screw of the Montana.  It
dwarfs Cab One, FILLING FRAME.

                                LINDSEY
                Uh, yeah, roger that... uh, found it.

EXT. MONTANA/SUBMERSIBLES                                               62

Cab One maneuvers along the flank of the enormous sub, while Flatbed and Cab
Three move above it.  Wilhite take readings with a hand-held neutron counter.

                                COFFEY
                Cab One, radiation readings?

                                LINDSEY
                Neutron counter's not showing very much.

                                COFFEY
                Wilhite, anything?

                                WILHITE
                Negative.  Nominal.

                                COFFEY
                Just continue forward along the hull.

                                LINDSEY
                Copy that, continuing forward.  You just want
                me to get shots of everything, right?

                                COFFEY
                Roger, document as much as you can, but keep
                moving.  We're on a tight timeline.

                                LINDSEY
                Copy that.

The great black hull of the Montana recedes into the darkness beyond the
puny beams of their lights.  It seems bigger than the Titanic and just as
eerie in its final resting place.  On it side, the sub's top deck becomes a
wall along which the tiny submersibles are moving.  Ahead, in the lights, is
a white painted circle.

                                COFFEY
                That's the midship hatch.  You see it, Cab Three?

                                HIPPY
                Roger, I see it.

                                BUD
                Just get around so your lights are on the hatch.

                                HIPPY
                Check.  Then I just hang with these guys, right?

                                COFFEY
                Right.

                                ONE NIGHT
                How do you want me?

                                COFFEY
                Just hold above it.  Alright, A team.

Wilhite, Schoenick, and Monk unhook their short whip-umbilicals from the
central manifold and roll off the side of Flatbed.  They maneuver down toward
the sub's hatch.  Hippy guides Cab Three in closer to the hatch area.

INT. CAB THREE                                                          63

Hippy turns to Perry back in the lockout chamber, ready to launch Little Geek.
The ROV has a handheld neutron-counter gripped in its manipulator arm.

                                MONK (V.O.)
                Stand by on the ROV.

                                HIPPY
                Perry, stand by on the ROV.
                           (to Little Geek)
                Sorry about this, little buddy.  Better you than
                me, know what I mean?

Hippy nods and Perry drops Little Geek through the hatch into the water and
feed out a length of tether.  Hippy picks up the control box and watches the
video screen, guiding the ROV toward the Montana's hatch.

EXT. MONTANA HATCH AREA                                                 64

The three SEALs have unlatched the deck cover and revealed the hatch.  They
open the out hatch and Monk swims down into to narrow escape trunk.  He bangs
on the inner hatch with a wrench, listening carefully with his helmet pressed
against it.

                                MONK
                It's flooded.  Alright, I'm opening her up.

Straining hard in the confined space, he get the lower hatch open, then swims
backs out immediately.  He gestures to Hippy, via Little Geek's vision, and
Hippy flies the ROV into the hatch.

EXT./INT. CAB ONE/MISSLE DECK                                           65

Meanwhile Cab One and Flatbed have proceeded forward along the hull.  Beyond
Lindsey's front port, the great hatches of the Trident missile tubes roll
toward us in procession.  Several of the hatch covers have been forced
partway open by the warping of the hull.

                                COFFEY (V.O.)
                Radiation is nominal.  The warheads must still
                be intact.

                                LINDSEY
                How many are there?

                                COFFEY (V.O.)
                24 Trident missiles.  Eight MIRVs per missile.

                                LINDSEY
                That's 192 warheads... And how powerful are
                they?

                                SCHOENICK
                Your MIRV is a tactical nuke, 50 kilotons
                nominal yield.  Say times time Hiroshima.

                                LINDSEY (V.O.)
                Jesus Christ... this is World War Three in a
                can.

                                COFFEY (V.O.)
                Let's knock off the chatter, please.

INT. CAB THREE                                                          66

TIGHT ON VIDEO SCREEN -- LITTLE GEEK'S CAMERA.  Passing through a hatch, into
a large grotto filled with pipes and machinery.  The engine room.

                                MONK (V.O.)
                Getting a reading?

                                HIPPY
                It's twitching but it's below the line you said
                was safe.

EXT. MONTANA MIDSHIP HATCH                                              67

Monk moves into the opening.

                                MONK
                Alright.  Let's get in there.

Wilhite and Schoenick follow him through the escape trunk, into the dark
corridor beyond.

EXT. MONTANA/BOW SECTION                                                68

Out of the darkness ahead emerges the trailing edge of the sail, big as a
five-story building.  Far below her, Flatbed moves along the edge of the
ledge which supports the vast sub.  Its lights, and Lindsey's strobes, reveal
the tremendous damage to the forward section as they pass the sail.  The torn
and twisted hull looms above Flatbed as it sets down.

Coffey indicated an enormous rent where the bow section is almost torn away
from the rest of the hull.

                                COFFEY
                We'll go in through that large breach.

                                BUD
                Let's go, guys.

Bud's team leaves Flatbed, swimming forward.  The opening is a black mouth in
their lights.  Coffey moves inside.  Bud attaches one end of an orange nylon
line to a piece of pipe and moves into the wreck behind him.

                                BUD
                Take it slow, stay on the line, and stay in
                sight.  Watch for hatches that could close on
                you, or any loose equipment that could fall.

Jammer, Catfish, Finler, and Sonny follow him inside.

INT. MONTANA/FORWARD BERTHING SECTION                                   69

They find themselves in the forward berthing compartment with its rows of
bunks.  The room is twisted and disheveled, with bedding hanging from the
bunks like the lolling tongues of dead dogs.  Papers float in gentle
eddying currents, letters, pages from paperback novels, photos of girlfriends.
Bud pays out the line and follows Coffey forward.  As they pass sealed doors,
Coffey pounds with a tool, listening.  All flooded.

INT. ENGINE ROOM                                                        70

Monk leads his team along a corridor, following Little Geek's tether.  Through
a hatch into the engine room.  Their lights play over flooded machinery.

INT. COMPANIONWAY/CONTROL ROOM AND ATTACK CENTER                        71

From the berthing Coffey's team swims up a companionway towards the attack
center.  He pulls at a buckled watertight door.

                                COFFEY
                It's jammed.  Give me a hand.

Jammer and Bud squeeze in around Coffey.  Together they wrench the door open
on its squealing hinges.  It give way suddenly, flying open.  The suction
pulls SOMETHING THROUGH.  It slams Bud's shoulder.  He turns.  A FACE...
RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM!  He jerks back, gasping.

Face to face with Barnes, the sonarman.  The ensign seems unmarked, merely
dismayed at his own mortality, judging from his wide eyes and mouth.  Coffey
reaches past Bud and pushes the ensign's body out of the way.

                                COFFEY
                Alright, let's keep moving.  We knew we were
                going to see this.

They enter the control room.  Their lights play over the high-tech wreckage.
Floating debris and bodies make shifting shadows on the walls as they swirl
in the currents.  A languid, weightless waltz.  They move through the carnage.
Their lights pick out tableaux... the planesman still strapped in his chair,
someone jammed into the ceiling pipes, hanging down.  Dead faces, pale in the
lights.  Still.  We see only glimpses.

Coffey locates the captain's body and rolls it over.  Removes the missile
arming key which hangs on a chain around the dead man's neck.  Moves on. All
business.  Bud turns back to his guys.  Checking them.  He notices Jammer is
breathing so rapidly he's fogging his helmet.  Catfish, Finler, and Sonny
aren't much better.  A wave a panic seems imminent.

                                BUD
                How you guys doing?

                                SONNY
                I'm alright, I'm dealing.

                                CATFISH
                Triple time sounds like a lotta money, Bud.  It
                ain't.  I'm sorry...

                                BUD
                We're here now.  Let's get her done.

We see Bud working, calming them, talking them through it.  He's sweating
rivers in his helmet, not looking too steady.  His projection of calm to the
others is his own salvation.

Coffey pauses in the doorway to the communications room.

                                COFFEY
                This part I do alone.  Brigman, take you men and
                continue aft.  Split up into two teams of two.
                Let's get moving... we head back in fourteen
                minutes.

Bud leads his team into a narrow corridor.

INT. CORRIDOR/ROOMS                                                     72

They search the rooms along the corridor with their lights until they come to
a vertical hatch, open.  a pit of darkness below.

                                BUD
                Okay, Cat, Lew, Sonny.  You guys stay on this
                deck.  Hook you line onto mine.  Any problem,
                you tug my line.  Two pulls.  Jammer, you're
                with me.

Bud drops down through the hatch to the level below, followed by Jammer, who
barely fits through.  Catfish hooks his safety line onto Bud's with a
carabiner and move along the corridor with the others.

EXT./INT. CAB ONE                                                       73

Lindsey circles the hull, documenting, photographing.  Her strobes sear the
darkness, give glimpses of the dead leviathan's form as her tiny submersible
circles it like a bee.

INT. COMMUNICATIONS CENTER                                              74

Working from a plastic card, Coffey spins the dial on the wall safe and opens
it.  He removes several plastic binders... the code books.  He also grabs
handfuls of classified documents and orders, and a set of missile arming keys,
all which he places in a pouch at his waist.

INT. CORRIDOR                                                           75

Bud leads Jammer through a long, claustrophobically narrow corridor, tapping
on the walls and hatches periodically.  After he taps, he waits a few
moments.  There are no answering taps.  They open doors and shine their lights
into the rooms.  The are bodies, but they seem anonymous.  Crumpled shapes
in khaki or blue.  They undog and open a hatch.  Beyond it is the largest
chamber of the sub, the...

INT. MISSLE COMPARTMENT                                                 76

The missile compartment is the large gallery a hundred and twenty feet long
and forty feet high, with two rows of vertical launch tubes, 24 in all.  The
chamber is divided into three levels by a floor of open steel grillwork.

                                JAMMER
                Where are we?

                                BUD
                Missile compartment.  Those are the launch tubes.

They sweep their lights around the chamber.  Jammer turns... his beam
illuminating a body just beyond the door.  A coveralled seaman turning
slowly in the eddying current.  Small albino crabs crawl slowly over the
man's face.  One scuttles out of his gaping mouth.

                                JAMMER
                Lord Almighty.

                                BUD
                Hey, you okay?

Bud goes to him.  Gets up close to his face.  Sees that he's not.  That he's
hyperventilating.  Fighting nausea.  Bud grabs him by the shoulders.

                                BUD
                Deep and slow, big guy.  Deep and slow.  Just
                breathe easy.

                                JAMMER
                I... they're all dead, Bud.  They're all dead.
                I thought... some of them... you know...

                                BUD
                I'm taking you back out.

                                JAMMER
                No!  I'm okay now.  I just don't... I can't go
                any further in.

Bud sees that the big diver's breathing has stabilized.  He looks at his
watch.  Checker Jammer's pressure gauges.

                                BUD
                Okay, Jammer.  No problem.  You stay right here.
                I have to go there to the end... you'll see my
                lights.  We'll stay in voice contact.  Just hold
                onto the rope.  Five more minutes.  Okay?

                                JAMMER
                Yeah, okay.  Okay.

He moves off through the center aisle of the gallery swimming between the huge
cylinders.  He pays out the lifeline as he goes.

INT. COM-ROOM                                                           77

Coffey is working rapidly and efficiently, moving from one rack of electronics
gear to the next, setting thermite grenades at vital points.  As the thermite
ignites, it generates an intense arc-bright light and tremendous heat.  The
circuit chasses melt.  Coffey works calmly in the infernal glare.

INT. MISSLE COMPARTMENT                                                 78

Bed negotiates his way through the tangle of wreckage near the far end of the
missile compartment.  He goes down a stairwell to the lower level.  A HUNDRED
FEET AWAY, Jammer loses sight of Bud's dive-lights.  He starts to get
nervous.  Suddenly his own lights begin to DIM, flickering lower and lower.
They become little orange candles, the filament barely glowing.  The darkness
closes in.

                                JAMMER
                Bud?  BUD?!  You readin' me?  BUD?!!

BUD, at the same moment, is fiddling with the connector cables on his helmet
lights, which are dimming and flickering.  He hears nothing from his helmet
transceiver.

JAMMER, smacks the side of his helmet.  Shakes the transceiver on his belt.
Nothing... just static.  Then even the static dies.  Panic time.

He grabs the safety line and pulls twice.  Hard.  It is snagged on a sharp
metal edge ten feet from him.  He pulls twice more, harder, hauling the
thing.  The line severs.  Jammer stared at the frayed and floating toward
him.  His eyes bug.  He looks all around in the darkness.  Can't see Bud.
Can't decide what to do.  We can see hysteria revving up inside him like a
flywheel.

Then he becomes aware of a faint radiance flickering over the walls.  It is a
cold and ethereal light, unlike the warm-white of their dive lights.

It grows brighter.  He turns slowly toward it.

The glow is moving beneath the steel grill of the deck, sending shafts of
cold light flickering upward hypnotically, coming toward him.

                                JAMMER
                Bud?  Is that you?

C.U. JAMMER, shielding his eyes, staring into the radiant source.

Guess what, Jammer?  It's not Bud.  In the brightest center of the glow,
SOMETHING is moving, a figure casting strange inhuman shadow across the walls.
Jammer blinks against the glare, his face registering total, outright
astonishment melting into terror.

The glare pulses subtly, hypnotically.  The shifting shadow falls across
Jammer.  He finally snaps out of his fixity...

Screaming and gulping air he spins away and starts clawing hand over hand
through the treacherous wreckage.

His harness catches on a twisted pipe.

He struggles, totally out of control... the big man reduced to a blind panic.

Jammer heaves forward with all his adrenalized strength.

He tears free of the entangling debris.  Launches like a torpedo... slamming
his backpack full force into the top sill of the hatchway.  His tri-mix
regulator takes the full brunt of the impact.

ON BUD, swimming furiously back toward Jammer's position.  The strange
radiance is gone.  His dive light flare back to full brightness.

                                BUD
                Jammer?  Answer me, buddy,  JAMMER?!

He reaches Jammer only to find him thrashing violently in place.  A seizure.
Bud grapples with him.

                                BUD
                Hang on, big guy.  Hand on!

Catfish, Sonny, and Finler arrive from the corridor a moment later.  They
leap into the fray.

                                BUD
                He's convulsing!

                                CATFISH
                It's his mixture!  Too much oxygen!

Then they're all yelling at once, grappling with the big man, struggling with
the valves on his breathing gear.

                                FINLER
                Crank it down, man!  We're gonna losing him...

                                BUD
                SHIT, it's stuck... goddamnit!

                                SONNY
                You got it?!  You got it?

                                BUD
                Yeah, yeah... yeah.  It's turning.

Jammer's convulsion ends.  He goes limp.

                                BUD
                We gotta get him out of here.  Come on!
                           (to Jammer)
                Hang on, buddy.

They drag Jammer's slack form into the corridor, hauling their way rapidly
back along the lifeline.

INT./EXT. CAB ONE & MONTANA SAIL                                        79

Lindsey is approaching the monolith of the sail, maneuvering to clear the
horizontal diving plane.  Then her lights go dim and her thrusters loose
power.

Suddenly a bright corona breaks around the bulk of the sail and SOMETHING
appears right in front of her, a glowing object moving like a bat out of
hell right at her!  It is slightly smaller than submersible and we only get
a glimpse.  What we think we see in the diffuse glow is a translucent ovoid,
open at the front with a spinning vortex of light inside... like some
hallucinatory jet engine.  And it's hauling ass.

Lindsey jinks left.  The object jogs right.  She fights the control as her
sub slews around, slamming broadside into the sail.  K-BAM!  Her power comes
back up.  Righting Can One, she spins to look through the aft viewport in
time to see the object racing away in a broad arc.  It pulls a high-G turn
and dives straight down.

We see the object zip behind Flatbed.  One Night can't see it.  The thing
spirals down into the darkness like a hit-and-run drunk, diving along the
wall into the abyss until it is lost to view.

HOLD ON Lindsey excited, amazed... dazed.  Her hands are shaking.  Suddenly
Bud's voice blares out over the open frequency.

                                BUD (V.O.)
                CAB ONE!  CAB ONE!  Meet me at Flatbed!  This
                is a diver emergency!!  Do you copy?  Lindsey?!

She has a hard time focusing on what he's saying.  Finally...

                                LINDSEY
                Copy you, Bud.  On my way.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. DEEPCORE INFIRMARY -- AN HOUR LATER                                80

Jammer is unconscious on a folding cot set up in the tiny cubicle of the
infirmary.  Monk, who is cross-trained as a medic as well as a demolitions
man, has hung an IV of something.  Bud and the SEAL are in the room, the
others hovering outside.

                                BUD
                Whattya think?

                                MONK
                I'm a medic, which is mostly about patching
                holes.  This type of thing... there's not much
                I can do.  The coma could last hours or days.

Bud, torn by guilt, gazes at the big man lying pathetically on the cot.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. CONSOLE MODULE                                                     81

The SEALs, minus Monk, are all gathered inside, debriefing with DeMarco via
closed-circuit video.

                                DEMARCO (video)
                Did any of you see it?

                                COFFEY
                Negative.  But there was definitely a Russian
                bogey.  The Brigman woman saw it.

                                DEMARCO
                CINCLANTFLT's gonna go apeshit.  Two Russian
                attack subs, a Tango and Victor, have been tracked
                within fifty miles of here... and now we don't
                know what the hell they are.  Okay, I don't have
                any choice.  I'm confirming you to go to Phase
                Two.

Wilhite and Schoenick glance uneasily at each other.

Coffey is silent.  He is vibrating with tension... his fists clenched to
prevent the shaking.  He is wrestling with the moment, knowing it is, in a
way, a point of no return.

                                DEMARCO
                Is there any problem?

                                COFFEY
                Yes... I mean no.  Negative, sir.

Coffey takes a deep breath.  Lets it out.  Phase Two is clearly a big deal.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. MAINTENANCE ROOM B/DARKROOM                                         82

The maintenance room doubles as a camera workstation.  An adjoining head serves
as darkroom.  Lindsey is glumly reassembling Cab One's camera housings.

                                BUD
                Did you get anything on the cameras.  Video or
                anything?

                                LINDSEY
                No.  Look, forget it.  I don't want to talk
                about it.

                                BUD
                Fine.  Be that way.

                                LINDSEY
                I don't know what I saw.  Okay?  Coffey wants to
                call it a Russian submersible, fine.  It's a
                Russian submersible.  No problem.

                                BUD
                But you think it's something else.  What?  One
                of ours?

                                LINDSEY
                No.

                                BUD
                Whose then?  Lindsey?  Talk to me...

Lindsey is wrestling with a feeling which is somehow also certain knowledge.

                                LINDSEY
                Jammer saw something in there, something that
                scared the hell out him--

                                BUD
                His mixture got screwed up.  He panicked and
                pranged his regulator.

                                LINDSEY
                But what did he see that made him panic?

                                BUD
                What do you think he saw?

                                LINDSEY
                I don't know.  I DON'T KNOW!

Hippy comes pounding up, sticks his head in, gesturing animatedly.

                                HIPPY
                Hey, you guys... hurry up, check this out!
                They're announcing it.

They follow him into the corridor, trotting down to the mess hall.

A LONG LENSE VIDEO SHOT of the Benthic Explorer and the other vessels in a
stormy sea CUTS TO a shot of BILL TYLER, the on-scene reporter, in rain
gear, clutching his microphone.  He is on the deck of a Navy support ship,
being used as a staging area from the press, well away from the center of the
operation.

                                TYLER
                --there is a tremendous amount of activity.
                With Cuba only 80 miles away, the massive buildup
                of US ships and aircraft in the area has drawn
                official protest from Havana and Moscow and has
                led to a redirection of Soviet warships into the
                Caribbean theater.

                                ANCHORMAN
                How would you describe the mood there?

                                TYLER
                The mood is one of suspicion, even confrontation.
                A number of Russian and Cuban trawlers,
                undoubtedly surveillance vessels, have been
                circling within a few miles throughout the day,
                and Soviet aircraft have repeatedly been warned
                away from the area...

incipient paranoia.

                                LINDSEY
                Figured that out for yourself, did you?

                Hippy, just relax.  You're making the women

                Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy.

                Goddamnit!  D'you tell him we need it right now?

Bud clears the door in time to see an empty moonpool, roiling with turbulence.
He runs to the edge and looks down.  Flatbed is a vague shape moving off.

The sky is charcoal, the sea is a mountain range of gray slopes.  Waves
thunder over the foredeck, whipped by eighty-know winds.  Men in life

vanishes and reappears among waves sixty feet tall.  McBride scream orders
that can't be heard to the crewmen on deck.  He staggers back along the bridge
railing.

                                MCBRIDE
                We're trying to get unhooked and get out of

De Marco's expression is infuriatingly calm... icy.  McBride looks at his
watch and swears under his breath.

For a second time the black hull of the ballistic missile sub is illuminated
by diver's lights.  Tiny figures, the divers move like moths around a distant
streetlight.  Wilhite, Monk and Schoenick are clustered around an open missile
hatch.  Using a large lift bag, they are removing the frangible fiberglass,
or 'diaphragm'.  Coffey pilots Flatbed with increasing deftness, deploying
the big arm to aid in the work.

DOWN ANGLE as the diaphragm lifts away... revealing the blunt nose of the

                Hey, they don't want war any more than we do.
                You think about it, you say... hey, they love
                their kids too.  So why are we doing this?

He is replaced by a self-righteous, middle-aged woman.

                                WOMAN
                If the Russians sank that submarine, they deserve
                what they got and a lot more, if you ask me,
                and you did.  I think we've been pussyfooting
                around with them long enough.

EXT. USS MONTANA                                                        92

It is now clear what the SEALs are doing.  Using large lift bags and Flatbed's
big arm, they have pulled one of the Trident C-4 missiles partway out of its
launch tube, and have partially disassembled the nose-shroud, exposing
several of the MIRV warheads within.

Moving very carefully, Wilhite and Schoenick ease one of the individual MIRVs
out of its bracket.  Hanging under a lift-bag in a jerry-rigged harness, the
three-foot long warhead is move gently by the divers to the back of Flatbed.

INT. DEEPCORE/VIDEO SCREEN                                              93

                Scared?  I'm scared ____-less.  But if it happens
                it happens, nothing I can do about it.  Right?
                So why think about it?

Flatbed surfaces in boiling foam.  The rig crew are all waiting.  Like a
crack pit-crew Bud's people leap onto Flatbed while its deck is still awash
and start to work on to Navy divers, unsealing their helmets and uncoupling
their umbilicals.  Hippy and Bud start to untie a cylindrical object wrapped
in one of the SEAL's gear bags.  Coffey emerges from the hatch.

                                COFFEY
                Don't touch that.  Just step away.  Now!

                Coffey, we're a little pressed for time.

                                COFFEY
                Monk, Schoenick... secure the package.

The two SEALs unlash the object in the black bag.  Bud an Lindsey exchange a
glance.  He glares at Coffey as they pass each other.  One Night nimbly
climbs the hatch-tower and drops in.  Bud swings the heavy hatch up,
balancing it, and grins down at One Night.

                                BUD
                This ain't no drill, slick.  Make me proud.

                                ONE NIGHT
                Piece of cake, baby.

He swings the hatch closed with a CLANG.

The big A-frame, massive as a railroad bridge, to which the umbilical from
the Explorer is attached.  Flatbed rises INTO FRAME arcing around the
coupling mechanism F.G.  One Night deploys the big hydraulic arm.

It unfold from Flay bed like a huge steel spider leg, its claw-like 'gripper'
opening.

INT./EXT. BENTHIC EXPLORER BRIDGE -- DAY                                96

An ALARM sounds stridently on the dynamic-positioning console.

Deep in one of the catamaran hulls, the positioning thruster motor is
SCREAMING like a steel banshee above its usual roar.  It EXPLODES with smoke
and shrapnel.  A roaring fire erupts.  Crewmen run shouting in the smoke.

INT. EXPLORER BRIDGE                                                    98

Now a KLAXON is going off as the ship begins to slew in the high winds.

                                BENDIX
                It's not holding.  We're swinging out of

EXT. EXPLORER'S DECK/LAUNCH WELL                                        99

As the ship slews, the umbilical is drawn off vertical.  It goes tight as a
bowstring.  Pulled to the edge of the launch well, it rips down the side
with a godawful screech, tearing loose ladders and floats.

EXT. DEEPCORE/A-FRAME                                                   100

Flatbed's manipulator has gripped the de-coupling mechanism when the cable
suddenly pulls taut.  The sub is jerked sideways, its grip dislodged.  We
see One Night get tossed around inside.

INT. DEEPCORE                                                           101

Lindsey is in the corridor with a cup of tea when the whole rig BOOMS LIKE A
GONG and lurches sideways.  She's wearing her tea when Bud tears through a
doorway and goes pounding past her.  The intercom blares...

                                HIPPY (intercom)
                Bud to control!  Emergency!  Bud to Control!

Bud claws his way up the ladder to level two.  The rig BOOMS and shudders
as...

The rig begins to move. The enormous skid breaks loose.  Start to slide,
plowing furrows in the bottom.  One Night junks the controls, pivoting her
submersible as the A-frame looms toward her.

INT. DEEPCORE/CONTROL MODULE                                            103

The winch man staggers along the railing, blasted by 80-knot winds.  He
sprints for the base of the enormous crane which supports the umbilical
winch.  A wave blasts him into the bulkhead.  He half-crawls to the ladder
going up to the winch-house.  As he climbs the winch's heave-compensator
slides up and down, FILLING FRAME behind him.

It is bottoming-out with a sound like a piledriver, overloaded by the strain
on the cable.  It chooses that moment to fail.  GRINDING CRASH OF METAL.

INT./EXT. DEEPCORE CONTROL MODULE                                       105

Lindsey has joined Bud, looking out the front viewport.

EXT. EXPLORER DECK                                                      106

The deck is ripped upward as the entire 40-ton crane is pulled over by the
weight of Deepcore.  It topples in the launch well with a roar of tortured
steel that rivals the storm.  An EXPLOSION OF WATER.  UNDERWATER, the crane
tumbles between the twin hulls.  Trailing a vortex of foam and debris, it
roars down on us, FILLING FRAME WITH BLACKNESS.

INT. EXPLORER BRIDGE                                                    107

Bud shouts over the intercom.

                Rig for impact!  Seal all exterior hatches.
                Move it!  Let's go!

VARIOUS ANGLES, QUICK CUTS, as everyone runs to comply:

The rig crew pounding down the narrow corridors.  Diving through low
hatchways.  Hatches are closed and the wheels spun down.  Hippy puts into a
ZIP-LOK BAG and seals it.

The umbilical drops down in slack loops out of the blackness above, draping
itself over the habitat in large coils.  One Night pilots her submersible
feverishly among the falling loops.  She banks and twists.  A length of heavy
umbilical slams onto her neck, tipping the sub.

She manages to get out from under it a keep going.

Through the front viewport they can see the coils of cable piling up in front
of the rig.  The hull booms with impacts as the massive stuff hits.

Everyone hold their breath as the sonar return-pings get closer... and
closer.  And closer...

An ENORMOUS SHAPE plunged into the floodlight in front of the rig.

K-WHAM!!  The 40-ton crane hits like a flatiron thirty feet in front of them.
A clean miss.  Much WHOOPING AND CHEERING.  Then...

The crane topples slowly over the back.  It rolls down the slope of the drop-
off, gathering speed.  Then tumbles over the cliff into the abyssal canyon.
The coiled umbilical starts to pay out after it like rope after a harpoon.
And they're still attached.

                                LINDSEY
                Oh shit.

An agonizing few seconds.  Then... the cable pulls taut.

K-BOOM!!  The rig is slammed by the shock.  Everyone is knocked off his feet,
into walls and equipment.

The rig begins to slide.  It tilts over the embankment and grinds down the
slope of the drop-off in a cloud of silt.  The cable pulling it inexorably
toward the cliff.  The framework twists and slams into rocks.  SCREECHING
AND GROANING of tortured steel.

INT. DEEPCORE/CORRIDOR/LADDERWELL/MAIN CORRIDOR                         112

All hell has broken loose.  SIRENS, SCREAMING, a KLAXON HOOTING moronically.
Bud sprints from Control, bouncing off the corridor walls as the rig
lurches and tilts.  The lights go out.  Emergency light come on.  He trips
and falls, scrambles up, running on.

IN THE LADDERWELL of trimodule C, Lindsey runs toward the machine rooms.
K-BOOM!  A searing bright EXPLOSION in the electrical room.  Flames roar
through the doorway.  She dashed to a seawater hose hanging nearby and starts
to unroll it.  She sees Coffey and Schoenick in maintenance, lashing down
the mystery package.

                                LINDSEY
                Hey!  Get on this hose, you turkeys!

INT. TRIMODULE C/COMPRESSOR ROOM                                        113

Monk is working in a spray of seawater, turning valves to stop the flow of
ruptured pipes.  Behind him, a wall of flame blossoms through the door from
the electrical room, driving the back with the heat.  A reservoir-tanks
breaks loose from one of the compressor assemblies.  In rolls at him,
crushing his legs against machinery.  The fire roars into the room.

INT. SUB BAY                                                            114

Hippy runs in.  The place is going nuts.  Water floods from the moonpool as
the rig tilts.  Wilhite is dancing across the deck, leaping over compressed-
gas cylinders which are rolling around loose.  Cab One jumps clear off its
cradle and slides SCREECHING across the deck.  Wilhite, running before the
12-tom juggernaut, had no place to go.  The SEAL dives into the churning
moonpool.  Cab One slams into the end wall, then spins and rolls toward
Hippy.

He starts to run.  Drop something.  Looks back.

Beany, in his zip-loc bag, is lying in the path of the slide submersible.
Hippy runs back.  Scoops up the baggie.  Cab One FILLS FRAME behind him.
He makes it through the door an instant before the thing hits behind him,
buckling the steel doorframe.

Wilhite is clawing up the sheep skirting of the moonpool.  He gets his fingers
over the top.  Pulls himself up...

A steel helium tank slams against his fingers, crushing them, and he falls
back.  More tanks bounce over the lip of the pool, hammering Wilhite down
into the foaming water.

He doesn't surface.

The rig is sliding to the edge of the cliff.  Beyond it... the bottomless
pit of the Cayman Trough.  It slams, crushing and twisting, into a rock
outcropping and stops, hanging over the precipice.

INT. TRIMODULE A/QUARTERS                                                116

Perry is trapped as the trimodule floods with stunning swiftness.  He makes
it through an emergency hatch between floors but can't get it closed.  The
inrushing tide blasts it open.  He scramble upward to the next hatch.  Spins
the wheel.  No time.  He is slammed against the ceiling by the force of the
water.

Lew Finler, Tommy Ray Dietz, and Lupton McWhirter fight their way toward the
door as the drill room floods rapidly.  Ahead, the big automated watertight
door is closing like a motorized bank-vault.  They reach it just as it is
closing, but can't prevail against the strength of the motors.  FROM THE FAR
SIDE, we can see them screaming soundlessly at the tiny pressure window in
the door.  We can hear the dull THUNK of their pounding.

INT. TRIMODULE C/LADDERWELL AND COMPRESSOR ROOM                         117

Coffey and Schoenick, in emergency breathing masks, are fighting the fire with
a seawater hose and fire extinguishers.  Smoke and steam choke the dark
chambers.

Nearby, Lindsey grabs Hippy's arm as he is running past and drags him into the
blazing compressor room.  Hands him her seawater hose.  Wide-eyes, he starts
blasting everything in sight with water.

                                LINDSEY
                No! Hold it on me!

She rushed into the teeth of the fire as Hippy blasts her with a spray of
water, following her into the intense heat.  She grabs Monk, who is
semiconscious, and drags him out of the blazing room... Hippy dancing back
with the hose, tripping, blasting her in the face.

But it works.  They get Monk clear.

INT. DRILL ROOM CORRIDOR                                                118

Bud comes pounding down the flooding corridor in time to see the water in the
drill room swirl above the pressure window, obscuring the faces of the
trapped men.  He claws futility at the door.  The motors and the fail-safe
latching mechanism are on the opposite side.  Through the pressure window he
watches helplessly as they drown.  We don't see what he sees, but we know
what he sees.  Suddenly the bulkhead next to him gives way and a freezing
torrent thunders in.  Bud is blown off his feet a hurled along the corridor.

He scramble up somehow, splashing waist deep toward the opposite end of the
corridor where another of the hydraulic doors is closing inexorably.  He's
not going to make it.  He reaches it a moment too late to squeeze through.
Grabs the edge of the door and desperately tries to stop it from closing with
the strength of this arms.  It doesn't work.  The steel door closes on the
fingers of his left hand, pinning them in the doorframe.

But something amazing happens.  His wedding ring lodges between the door and
frame, preventing his fingers from being crushed and the door from
sealing and locking.

It resists tons of pressure, denting but not collapsing.

The freezing sea pours in until only his head is clear.

                                BUD
                Heeyy!!  HHHEEEYYY!!

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR, Catfish and Sonny come pounding up.  They see
his face at the tiny window and his hand jammed in the door.  Sonny wedges
a crowbar in the narrow opening and starts to pry.  Catfish whips open his
jackknife and slashes the hydraulic hoses on the door actuator.  He is
sprayed with red hydraulic fluid, machine blood.

Together they force open the door.  Bud is blown through in a torture of
water.  Sonny is thrown back into some pipes.  Breaks his arm.

Together they somehow heave the door shut manually, cutting off the flow.
Catfish hammers the fail-safe latch home with the crowbar.

Bud lies gasping and shivering... staring at the tiny band of metal that
saved him.

                                                                DISSOLVE TO:

to show Deepcore perched at the very edge of the abyss.  The rig is twisted
and dented, covered with loops of umbilical, trimodule-A a mass of wreckage.
The ROV passes across the front of the control module.  Through the front

Bud walks down the corridor from control, slowly... as if carrying a great
weight.  The air is still thick with smoke.  The power off... everything
lit by emergency lights.  Makeshift quarters have been set up in the mess
hall, with blankets laid out on the tables, and with folding cots in the
storage room across the hall.  Jammer is still unconscious.  Coffey and
Schoenick bring Monk in on a stretcher, and set him up on a table.  He is
conscious but dazed with painkillers, his led splinted.

                                BUD
                Did you find Wilhite?

                                COFFEY
                No.

He and Bud lock eyes.  Bud bites back on his recriminations, but his gaze
blames Coffey.  He turns away.

                              (Bud turns)
                I was under orders.  I had no choice.

Coffey's manner is subdued, contrite.  A marked contrast to his previous
brusque arrogance.  He's wrestling with his own loss, a sever blow to the
tight brotherhood of a SEAL unit.  Bud's anger is not dispelled.  But he
can't address it now.  He moves on.

PAST THE INFIRMARY, where Sonny Dawson is rigging a sling over his own broken
arm.  He cries out in pain, cursing at himself.  LOOKING DOWN THE CENTRAL WELL
as Bud crosses.  Down through the grill decking we can see the bottom level
of the module is flooded.  Catfish is down there welding, sending shivering
reflections through the chamber.

INT. MACHINE ROOM                                                       120

Lindsey is working, up to her knees in water.  She is covered with grease,
tools scattered around.  Bud puts his hand on her shoulder.  She looks up,
blows some hair out of her eyes.

                                BUD
                What's the scoop, ace?

                                LINDSEY
                I can get power to this module and sub-bay if
                I remote these busses.  I've gotta get past the
                mains, which are a total melt-down.

Rather than trigger anger and invective, the disaster seems to have affected
her in a different way.  She's accepted the situation, now that's it's done,
and is immersing herself in technical tasks, which are for her therapeutic.

                                BUD
                Need some help?

                                LINDSEY
                Thanks.  No, I can handle it.  Bud... there
                won't be enough to run the heaters.  In a couple
                hours this place is going to be as cold as a
                meat locker.

                                BUD
                What about O-2?

                                LINDSEY
                Brace yourself.  We've got about 12 hours worth
                if we close off the sections we're not using.

                                BUD
                The storm's gonna last longer than 12 hours.

                                LINDSEY
                I can extend that.  There's some storage tanks
                outboard on the wrecked module.  I'll have to go
                outside to tie onto them.

She goes back to her task, working efficiently with a socket wrench.

                                BUD
                Hey, Lins...
                          (she looks up)
                I'm glad your here.

                                LINDSEY
                Yeah?  Well I'm not.

The sub bay is still a mess.  Dark.  A few battery-operated lamps.  Flatbed
is back, floating in the moonpool.

One Night and Hippy are in deep concentration, piloting the two ROVs in a
damage survey of the rig.  Bud comes up behind them, check her screen first.
BIG GEEK'S MONITOR shows a view of the aft section of the rig.  The drilling
derrick had collapsed across Cab Three, totaling it.  A girder is jammed
through its acrylic front dome.

scan the flooded interior.

Lying on the deck, almost looking like he's asleep.

                Yeah, for now.  Our first priority's to get
                something to breathe.

Catfish and Lindsey, in suits and helmets, drop down from the glare of the
moonpool onto the dark sea floor under the rig.  Walking, they pull their
umbilicals behind them and head out through the twisted wreckage.  Little
Geek follows along like a dog at their heels.  They settle beside a valve
assembly at the base of the wrecked module.

                                LINDSEY
                Cat, you tie onto this manifold.  There's some
                tanks on the other side; I'm gonna go check
                them out.

                                CATFISH
                You watch yourself.

He begins to attach one end of a coiled-up high-pressure hose to a manifold.
She takes the other end of the hose and moves off into the darkness.  Little
Geek goes with her faithfully.

Cab One is hanging from the overhead crane while One Nigh works to repair it.
Bud is nearby, tending hose for the divers and handing her tools.  Talking
while they work.  Hippy is across the moonpool running Little Geek.

                                ONE NIGHT
                Gimme a three-eighths socket on a long extension.
                           (he hands it to her)
                So there you were--

                                BUD
                There we were, side by side, on the same ship,
                for two months.  I'm tool-pusher and we're
                testing this automated derrick of hers.  So, we
                get back on the beach and... we're living
                together.

                                ONE NIGHT
                Doesn't mean you had to marry her.

                                BUD
                We were due to go back out on the same ship.
                Six months of tests.  If you were married you
                got a state-room.  Otherwise it was bunks.

                                ONE NIGHT
                Okay, good reason.  Then what?

                                BUD
                It was alright for a while, you know.  But then
                she got promoted to project engineer on this
                thing, couple years ago.

                                ONE NIGHT
                She went front-office on you.  Tighten that for
                me, right there.  That's it.

                                BUD
                Well, you know Lindsey, too damn aggressive--
                Son of a--!!

He's jammed his fingers with a wrench torquing down a bolt.  Whips his hand
out.

                                BUD
                She didn't leave me... she just left me behind.

She puts her arm around his shoulders, somehow managing to be fraternal,
maternal and suggestive all at the same time.

                                ONE NIGHT
                Bud, let me tell you something.  She ain't half
                as smart as she thinks she is.

She smiles and pretends to kink Lindsey's air-hose.

ACROSS THE CHAMBER, Hippy scowls as Little Geek's screen starts to go haywire
with interference.

                                HIPPY
                Hey, Lindsey, you reading me?  Over.

Catfish is working on one side of the wrecked module while Lindsey is on the
other, out of sight.  She is standing on the bottom at the base of the
wreckage, checking valves on a rack of oxygen bottles amongst the wreckage.
Right at the edge of the canyon wall.  Behind her is a sheer drop to
nothingness

                                LINDSEY
                Yeah, Hippy, I read you.  What's the matter?

The reply is GARBLED by a wash of static.  Then, for no apparent reason,
Lindsey's helmet light begins to dim out.  Little Geek's lights fade.  His
motors whine to a stop.

ON CATFISH, as his lights drop to candleglows.

The emergency lights are dimming, like a brownout.  Bud grabs the diver
intercom mike.

                Lins, how're you doing?  Lindsey?

ON LINDSEY, as she fiddles with her lights and transceiver pack.

                                LINDSEY
                Catfish... I got a problem here.  You there?
                Catfish?

Behind her, SOMETHING rises from the depths.

It is the little vehicle she almost collided with at the Montana wreck.

It comes right up behind her.  She doesn't know it's there.  It hovers
sideways like a hummingbird, as if curious, trying to get a better look.  She
becomes aware of the pulsing glow on the ground around her.  She turns
slowly.  We see her react as the glowing, pulsing apparition is reflected in
her faceplate.

A more powerful glow washes up onto her from below.

Her eyes go down.  She gasps, absolutely stunned...

Above the edge of the wall, AN ENORMOUS SHAPE RISES SILENTLY OUT OF THE
DEPTHS.  Over sixty feet across.  It looks like a blown glass manta ray, its
transparent outer hull housing interior structures of great delicacy and
complexity, pulsing with a blue-violet glow.

Lindsey stand before it, unable to move.  Absolutely rapt.

Captivated by its ethereal beauty.  It begins to turn, majestically, one
rounded wing passing only a few feet above her.  She reaches up.  Touches it
as it passes over her.

Lindsey is without fear, completely mesmerized.

The thing completes its turn and dives gracefully down along the wall.  She
is gently lifted by a backwash of turbulent water.

About that time, Lindsey remembers she has a still camera, a little Nikonos.

She fumbles to set focus and exposure with her bulky gloves as the beautiful
machine glides into the depths.  Gets all set for a shot and...

WOOSH!  The little 'scoutschip' whizzes past her from behind, startling her.
She completely misses the shot of the 'manta ship'.  She pivots, trying to
get a shot of the little one as it zig-zags down along the wall, fast as a
meteor.  CLICK.  She get a shot a second before it disappears.

From around the flank of the rig module, Catfish appears.  Their com-sets
come backs to life, along with their lights.

                                LINDSEY
                You better not say you missed that.

                                CATFISH
                Missed what?

                                                                CUT TO:

TIGHT ON SLIDE STRIP.  Lindsey's fingertip in for scale.  The shot is black
with a little squiggle of light in the center.  Pathetic.

                                BUD
                Nice shot, Lins.

                What is that?  You drop your dive light?

WIDER, SHOWING THE GROUP huddled around Lindsey who has her freshly-processed
slide roll laid out on the pinball machine, using it as a light table.

                                LINDSEY
                Come on, you guys... look, this is the little
                one right here.  You can see how it's kind of
                zigging around.

                                BUD
                If you say so.  It could be anything.

                                LINDSEY
                I'm telling you what is there.  You're just not
                hearing.  The impulses somehow aren't getting
                from you ears to your brainpan.  There's something
                down there.  Something not... us.

She looks around.  Sees a lot of skepticism in the eyes around her.

                                CATFISH
                Y'all could be more specific.

                                LINDSEY
                Not us.  Not human.  Get it?  Something non-
                human, but intelligent...

                                HIPPY
                You mean like Coffey?

Lindsey is reddening.  Despite her conviction, this is really hard.

                                LINDSEY
                A non-terrestrial intelligence.

                                HIPPY
                Non-Terrestrial Intelligence.  NTIs.  Yeah, I
                like that better then UFOs.  Although that
                works too... Underwater Flying Objects.

Hippy is not really mocking her.  He's actually into it.  But it has that
effect.  Catfish is eyeing Lindsey like he's never seen her before.

                                CATFISH
                Are we talkin' little space friend here?

                                HIPPY
                Right on!  Hot rods of the Gods.  Right, Lins?
                Hey, no really!  It could be NTIs.  The CIA has
                known about them for years.  They abduct people
                all the time.  There was this woman I knew in
                Albuquerque who--

                                LINDSEY
                Hippy, do me a favor... stay off my side.

Bud takes her firmly by the arm.  Heads her out into the corridor.

                                BUD
                Lindsey, will you step into my office for a

face each other in the narrow space.

                Jesus, Lindsey--

                                LINDSEY
                Bud, something really important is happening
                here.

                                BUD
                Look.  I'm just trying to hold this situation
                together.  I can't allow you to cause this kind
                of hysteria--

                                LINDSEY
                Who's hysterical?  Nobody's hysterical!

They're talking across each other, not connecting.  Bud weary and frustrated.
Lindsey is cranked up with the afterglow of her encounter.

                                BUD
                All I'm saying is when you're hanging on by your
                fingernails, you don't go waving you arms around.

                                LINDSEY
                I saw something!  I'm not going to go back there
                and say I didn't see it when I did.  I'm sorry.

                                BUD
                God, you are the most stubborn woman I ever knew.

                                LINDSEY
                I need you to believe me, Bud.  Look at me.  Do
                I seem stressed out?  Any of the symptoms of
                pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?

                                BUD
                No.

                                LINDSEY
                Bud, this is me, Lindsey.  Okay?  You know me
                better than anybody in the world.  Now watch my
                lips... I saw these things.  I touched one of
                them.  And it wasn't some clunky steel can like
                we would build... it glided.  It was the most
                beautiful thing I've ever seen.

Bud is stilled by her intensity.  She moves close to him.  Eyes alive and
luminous.

                                LINDSEY
                It was a machine, but it seems almost alive.
                Like a... dance of light.  Bud, you have to
                trust me... please.  I don't think they mean us
                harm.  I don't know how I know that, it's just a
                feeling.

                                BUD
                How can I go on a feeling?  You think Coffey's
                going to go on you 'feeling'?

                                LINDSEY
                We all see what we want to see... Coffey looks
                and he sees Russians, he sees hate and fear.
                Bud, you have to look with better eyes than
                that.

Bud has been taking this all in.  His eyes tracking her face.  He closes his
eyes, taking a deep breath.  It's so hard for him to do this, but...

                                BUD
                I can't, Lindsey.  I'm sorry.  How can I?

summit.  Lindsey is withdrawn, sitting far from the others, a self-imposed

breath shows in the air.

                I want 'round-the-clock manning of the sonar
                shack and the exterior cameras.  We need early
                warning if the Soviet craft try another incursion.

                                LINDSEY
                          (rolling her eyes)
                Gimme a break!  Coffey, these things live three
                and a half miles down on the bottom of an abyssal
                trench!  Trust me... they're not speaking
                Russian.

Coffey looks at her for a moment, then goes on as if she hadn't spoke.

                                COFFEY
                            (to One Night)
                Why haven't you finished repairs on the
                hydrophone transmitter yet?

                                ONE NIGHT
                I was having my nails done.

Coffey is sweating, despite the chill.  Keeps his hands clenched in fists so
they won't see how bad the tremors have gotten.

                                COFFEY
                Get something straight.  You people are under my
                authority--

                                CATFISH
                Look, podner... we don't work for you, we don't
                take orders from you, and we don't much like you.
                In addition to which your momma dresses you
                funny.

Coffey's eyes are straight razors.  He slashes them from face to face.  You
can see him tightening up like a clockspring, losing control of the situation
in front of his own men.  Bud defuses it.

                                BUD
                'Fish'?

                                CATFISH
                Yuh?

                                BUD
                Take the first watch in sonar.  Hippy, you
                handle the exterior surveillance.  One Night, see
                if you can get that transmitter working for me,
                okay?

                                ONE NIGHT
                Gimme a couple of hours.

HOLD ON COFFEY as everyone leaves.  Winding tighter.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. MAINTENANCE ROOM B -- LATER                                        132

Coffey and Schoenick are bending over the warhead.  They have a small port
removed and are attaching waterproof leads from an ELECTRONIC DETONATOR.  The
black box Lindsey glimpsed earlier.  As the two SEALs work like surgeons, we
see past Coffey's shoulder to a hemispherical window behind him, which looks
out into the perpetual blackness.  Something appears... a goofy shark face.

Big Geek rises silently in front of the port.  It moves a little, trying to
get a peek over Coffey's shoulder.

INT. CONTROL MODULE/ROV SHACK                                           133

Hippy is twiddling his joysticks, watching the screen like a ferret.

                                HIPPY
                Come on... move to the left... just a little
                more... come on, A.J. Squared Away... that's
                it--

ON THE SCREEN, Geek's POV.  Coffey is blocking Hippy's view of whatever it is
they're working on.  Abruptly, be moves.  The warhead is lying there in plain
sight, detonator wires hooked up.  Hippy's eyes bug out.  He knows exactly
what it is.

                                HIPPY
                Pretty radical, guys.  Pretty radical.

He hurries to the VCR and puts it into RECORD.

INT. CONTROL MODULE/ROV SHACK -- MINUTES LATER                          134

Video image of the SEALs working.  It FREEZES on a clear view of the warhead.

                                HIPPY (V.O.)
                Say hello to MIRV.

Bud has his face right up to screen.  He frowns, skeptical.

                                HIPPY
                Come on, man.  What else could it be?

                                BUD
                Why bring it here?

                                HIPPY
                It's gotta be, like, an emergency plan to keep
                it away from the Russians... Hotwire one of the
                nukes with some kinda detonator, put it back in
                the sub, and fry the whole thing, slicker'n snot.
                Oh, uh... hi, Lins.

Bud whips around.  Lindsey, standing quietly in the doorway.  It's apparent
from expression she's been watching them for some time.  She looks ready to
kill somebody.  Then she's gone.

INT. CORRIDOR                                                           135

Bud catches up to her in the corridor, trying to put the brakes on her.

                                LINDSEY
                Look, goddamnit, if you won't do something about
                it, I will.

                                BUD
                Lindsey!  Wait a second--

She reaches the watertight door to Maintenance Room B.  It's locked.  Before
Bud can stop her she grabs a fire-extinguisher off the wall and pounds on
the steel door like a big gong.  BOOM!  BOOM!  BOOM!

Needless to say, it opens.  She pushes past Schoenick, see the bomb lying
there naked.

                                LINDSEY
                You've got some huevos bringing this...
                thing... into my rig!  With everything that's
                been going on up in the world, you bring a
                nuclear weapon in here?  Does this strike anyone
                as particularly psychotic, or is it just me?

                                COFFEY
                You don't need to know the details of this
                mission... you're better off if you don't.

                                LINDSEY
                You're right... I don't.  I just need to know
                that this thing is out of here!  You hear me,
                Roger Ramjet?

                                COFFEY
                Mrs. Brigman, you're becoming a serious impediment
                to this mission.  I believe the stress is
                affecting you.
                            (to Schoenick)
                Escort her to quarters and have Monk prepare a
                tranquilizer.

Schoenick takes her arm in a tight grip.

                                LINDSEY
                Bullshit, you can't do that.  Oww... goddamnit!

Lindsey goes bananas, trying to get Schoenick's big hands off her arms.  Bud
slams his hand down on the intercom button.

                                BUD
                Emergency!  Maintenance room B.  Emergency!

He pulls the fire alarm for good measure and spins on Coffey... warning him
with a look that is not to be messed with.  Coffey is braced back against the
worktable... an odd stance, with one arm behind his back.  Suddenly there's
a crowd outside the door as Catfish, Hippy, One Night, and Sonny come running
up.  Confrontation time.

Sirens going.  About a million volts of electricity in the air.  Bud braces
Schoenick.

                                BUD
                Let her go.  Do it... right now.

He does.  Lindsey jerks away.  Rubs her arms.

                                LINDSEY
                You dumb jarhead motherf--

                                BUD
                Chill out, Lindsey!!

                                CATFISH
                What's the problem?

Everyone is frozen in place.  Bud a Coffey... snake and mongoose, glaring.
Bud pulls Lindsey back into the corridor.

                                BUD
                Nothing.  We were just leaving.
                              (to her)
                Weren't we?

ANGLE FROM BEHIND COFFEY, as Bud's group moves out of sight up the corridor.
Hands behind his back.  In his hand, cocked, finger on the trigger, is the
.45.  He turns and sets it on the table, steadying himself as if in the wind.
he seems to sag.  When he looks at Schoenick, his eyes are wounds.  A hunted
animal.  Voice shaky.

                                COFFEY
                They can't be trusted.  They're turning against
                us.  We may have to take... steps.

INT. CORRIDOR                                                           136

Lindsey, Bud, Hippy.  Bud slows, letting them trail behind the others.

                                BUD
                Lins, stay away from that guy.  I mean it.

                                HIPPY
                Yeah.  The dude's in bad shape... you see his
                hands?

                                LINDSEY
                He's got the shakes?

                                BUD
                Look, the guy's operating on his own, cut off
                from chain of command.  He's exhibiting symptoms
                of pressure-induced psychosis.  And he's got a
                nuclear weapon.  So, as a personal favor to me...
                will you put your tongue in neutral for a while?

                                HIPPY
                Man, I give this a sphincter-factor of about
                nine point five.

INT. MAINTENANCE ROOM B                                                 137

Coffey goes to the dome port.  Looks past his shrunken and twisted reflection
into the void.  Eternal night.

ANGLE FROM OUTSIDE.  Coffey's face in the window.  Stuck to the acrylic
bubble beside him is one of those Garfields, suction cups on its paws.  Coffey
stares out.  Behind his eyes, his brain is like that cat, just hanging on,
spreadeagle and screaming.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. SUB-BAY/DIVE-PREP AREA                                             138

Under a single worklight, a couple of conspirators.  Lindsey and Hippy hunch
over Big Geek.  The ROV grins maniacally with goofy shark teeth.

                                LINDSEY
                Look, you can just punch into his little chip
                where you want him to go, and he goes, right?

                                HIPPY
                Well, yeah, but the tether off it ain't gonna
                be fancy.  When he gets down there he'll just
                sit, like a dumb-shit.  Unless something wanders
                through view of the camera, you'll get nada.

                                LINDSEY
                Let's go for it.  We could get lucky.

INT. CONTROL MODULE                                                      139

ONE SURVEILLANCE MONITOR.  Lindsey and Hippy next to Big Geek.  Their voices
are tinny but intelligible.

                                HIPPY (V.O.)
                I don't know.  I really oughta talk to Bud about
                this.

E.C.U. COFFEY.  Watching them in the dark.  Alone.

                                LINDSEY (V.O.)
                No.  Just you and me.  We get some proof, then
                tell them.  Hippy, look... if was can prove to
                Coffey it's not Russians, maybe he'll ease off
                the button a little.

                                HIPPY (V.O.)
                I gotta tell you, that guy scares me a lot more
                than whatever's down there.  A.J. Squared Away
                goddamn jarhead robot.  Okay, gimme a couple
                hours on this.

Coffey watches, his jaw clenched.

INT. QUARTERS/MESS HALL                                                 140

The lights are down.  Those who can are grabbing some sleep.  Snoring comes
from one of the bunkrooms as Lindsey passes.  In the mess hall, Catfish and
Bud are crashed out on the tables, wrapped in blankets.  The cold has gotten
intense.  Water drips.  The walls sweat with condensation.  Lindsey can see
her breath as she makes coffee.  She carries a cup over to Monk, who is a
face in a pile of blankets.  A hand comes out, takes the coffee.

                                MONK
                Thanks.

Lindsey sips hers, staring.  Her thoughts are far away... in the bottomless
pit.  She is leaning up against the table where Bud is sleeping.  His soft
snoring downshifts into a loud rasp.  Lindsey touches him gently on the
shoulder.

                                LINDSEY
                Virgil, turn on your side.

Bud grunts and turns without waking, an automatic response.  The snoring
stops.  It is a quiet, intimate moment, a reminder of the mileage these two
have logged together.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. SONAR SHACK                                                        141

Sonny has made himself comfortable in front of the screens.  Too comfortable.
He's asleep, chin on his chest.  On the main passive-sonar screen, an almost
imperceptibly faint trace appears.  A HUM, which is by now familiar, becomes
audible.  Sonny shifts in his seat.  Doesn't wake.

INT. SUB BAY                                                            142

Hippy puts his tools away, finished with the modifications to Big Geek.

                                HIPPY
                All set, big guy.  Hey, I told you to wipe that
                grin off your face.

He yawns as he shambles across the chamber to the corridor door.  Switches off
the lights.  Goes out.

Quiet lapping of water in the moonpool.  A beat.  Then...

A cold luminosity suffuses the water beneath the moonpool opening, sending
shadows shifting across the top of the chamber.  The surface begins to
pulsate.

Suddenly, the water itself rises, forming itself into a shifting, shimmering
pseudopod as big around as a man's body.  The transparent form pulses... an
amoebic mass shivering in the air.

It stretches, becoming a more refined form.  Like a blindly probing glass
python, it elongates and weaves across the room.  It extends and extends,
stretching out from the moonpool, a shimmering tentacle.  The 'head' or tip,
a featureless liquid bulb, seems somehow to be scanning as it moves forward,
as if it can see where it's going.

INT. CORRIDOR                                                           143

Hippy trudges along the dark corridor.  He reaches the men's head and goes in.
As the door closes, the tip of the liquid pseudopod extends into the corridor
B.G.  It 'looks' left and right.  Then extends the length of the corridor,
holding itself a couple feet off the floor like a weightless snake.

INT. TRIMODULE B/LADDERWELL/BUNKROOM/MESS HALL                          144

LOOKING DOWN three levels through the central ladderwell between the
cylinders.  The pseudopod enters and undulates upward.

FROM INSIDE THE MAKESHIFT BUNKROOM, we see its tip extend inside.

Sonny and One Night are snoring, oblivious.  Jammer is still unconscious.  The
pseudopod, taking its time, checks them out and then moves on.

IN THE MESS HALL, it's dark and quiet.  Lindsey has even fallen asleep in her
chair, her head buried in her arms on the table.  The shimmering tentacle
enters the room in total silence.  It sways gracefully in to air, searching.
It undulates across the room, hanging about five feet in the air, surveying
everything.  It moves past Lindsey.  Sensing something, she lifts her head,
turning... sees the apparition next to her.

Her eyes go wide.  Amazement, but not fear.  The tentacle is moving on, still
searching.  Lindsey shakes Bud awake, clapping her hand over his mouth.

Bud blinks twice, then freezes.  When she lowers her hand his mouth is hanging
open like a total goon.

Bud chucks his pillow are Catfish, on the next table.

Catfish cracks one eye open.  Turns away.  Turns right back... both eyes open
now.  Sensing movement, the thing turn back toward them.  It seems to
recognize Lindsey.  It doubles back on itself in a loop and comes right up to
her.  She holds her ground, fascinated.

The bulbous tip forms suddenly into a human face... her face.  It is water,
still clear and undulating... but definitely Lindsey.  She gasps in surprise.
The liquid-Lindsey gasps soundlessly... a perfect mimic of her expression.
Lindsey laughs involuntarily.  It laughs... without sound.  Lindsey makes a
face, sticking out her tongue... testing it.

The liquid-Lindsey does the same.  Bud has just had the rug jerked out from
under his sense of what is possible and what isn't, but he's taking it pretty
will, considering.

                                BUD
                            (whispering)
                I think it likes you.

                                LINDSEY
                It's trying to communicate.

Her liquid face suddenly transforms into a likeness of Bud's.

She reaches out her hand slowly.  Gingerly, her fingers touch the surface.
Ripples extend outward from the contact, across Bud's features.

Her fingertips break effortlessly through the surface, just like she's
dipping her hand into a bowl of water, except sideways.  She draws her wet
fingers out and studies them, amazed.  Touches one fingertip to her tongue.

                                LINDSEY
                Seawater.

The pseudopod pulls back from her.  It loops in the air dramatically, full
circle... and ties itself into a knot.  As the knot tightens down, it melts
back into the body.  The 'disappearing knot' trick.

Lindsey laughs, grinning with the open wonder and delight of a child at a
magic show.  She is transported.

                                LINDSEY
                Show off.

She looks at Bud.  He grins broadly.  He's with her now.

The stunned group watches as the thing moves on across the room.  Out to the
corridor

INT. SUB-BAY                                                            145

Coffey and Schoenick enter the back way, through the dive-prep area.  They see
the pseudopod arching from the moonpool big as a treetrunk.  Coffey's mind is
blown.  We can smell the insulation burning.  He just stares.

INT. CORRIDOR/MAINTENANCE ROOM B                                        146

The water tentacle enters and moves toward the hot-wired warhead.  It studies
the device for a few seconds.  Bud and Lindsey enter through a side door, in
time to see the tentacle divide into four tendrils which wrap around the
warhead.  They begin to lift it off its cart.

INT. SUB BAY                                                            147

Coffey finally jump-starts his brain.  In a flash of insight, he runs to the
big sliding door through which the pseudopod stretches into the corridor.  He
and Schoenick heave on the door.  Like a guillotine blade it slices
effortlessly through it.

VARIOUS ANGLES -- CORRIDORS, MESS HALL, LADDERWELL, MAINTENANCE... as the
body of the pseudopod collapses, splashing on the floor.  It reverts to
nothing more than a long puddle of simple seawater.  As the tendrils dissolve,
the warhead slams back down onto the cart, unharmed.  ON COFFEY'S SIDE ON THE
DOOR, however, the "stump" rears back like a cobra.  It withdraws rapidly into
the moonpool.  The glow fades away.

INT. SONAR SHACK                                                        148

Sonny wakes up with a start as the HUM revs up into a LOUD WHINE and then
fades away.  He scrambles to track it.  Too late.

INT. CORRIDOR                                                           149

Hippy emerges from the can and looks down, puzzled, at the puddle running the
length of the corridor.  He missed the whole thing.

INT. MESS HALL                                                          150

Light on.  Everybody there.  Lindsey is really strutting, high on life, now
that she's been proven right.

                                LINDSEY
                Okay, raise your hand if you think that was a
                Russian water-tentacle.  Lieutenant?  No?  Well,
                a breakthrough.

Coffey is looking out from under his eyebrows like Nicholson in "The Shining".
Bud give her a warning look.  Don't poke at the rattler.

                                BUD
                You done impressing yourself, ace?

                                ONE NIGHT
                No way that could just be seawater.

                                LINDSEY
                They must've learned how to control water... I
                mean at a molecular level.  They can plasticize
                it, polymerize it... whatever.  Put it under
                intelligent control.

                                BUD
                Maybe their whole technology is based on that.
                Controlling water.

Coffey is hunched over, elbows on his knees.  His hands are out of sight.  His
arm is moving in a slow rhythm.  We can't see what he's doing.

                                HIPPY
                That thing was probably their version of Big
                Geek... like an ROV.

                                CATFISH
                Just checking is out, huh?  How come?

ANGLE UNDER THE TABLE, showing what Coffey is doing.  He has his K-BAR KNIFE
gripped white-knuckle in one hand.  He is drawing it slowly and repeatedly
across the skin of the other forearm.  Neat chevrons of blood from wrist to
elbow.

C.U. COFFEY -- He doesn't flinch.  His eyes are hard and bright as diamond
drills.  No one notices.  He's keeping the edge.

                                LINDSEY
                They're curious, maybe.  We could be the first
                people they've seen up close.

                                SONNY
                Hope they don't judge the whole race offa us.

                                CATFISH
                Maybe I oughta shave.

Coffey stands abruptly, snags Schoenick with his eyes, and leaves, walking
through the group as if they were smoke.  This cold behavior brings the mood
down a notch.

INT. CORRIDOR/MAINTENANCE ROOM B                                        151

Outside the mess hall, Coffey pauses, listening to the conversation resume.
Bright speculation, a few jokes.  Coffey is visible shaking.  Breathing hard.
Pupils dilated.  Schoenick looks at him with concern.

                                COFFEY
                It went straight for the warhead.  And they
                think it's cute.

                                SCHOENICK
                You need to get some sleep.

Coffey walks away without hearing him.  Schoenick catches up.

INT. MAINTENANCE                                                        152

The door opens in the dark room.  Coffey enters, moving with purpose.  He
pulls his gear bag out from under the work table.  Unzips it.  Pulls out a
short-barreled CAR-15 assault rifle.

                                COFFEY
                We have no way of warning the surface.  Do you
                know what that means?

Schoenick doesn't know.  He hopes Coffey knows.  Because he's a fearless man
who's discovering what it is to be afraid.  Coffey inserts the magazine with
a CLACK!  Snaps the bolt.  Tosses the rifle to Schoenick.

                                COFFEY
                It means... whatever happens is up to us.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. CORRIDOR/MAINTENANCE -- LATER                                      153

Hippy passes the maintenance room.  Looks in.  The warhead and its cart are
missing.  He looks around.  Heads toward the sub-bay.

INT. MESS HALL                                                          154

The discussion, still in progress.

                                ONE NIGHT
                You think they're from down there originally?
                Or from... you know.

She jerks her thumb toward the ceiling.

                                LINDSEY
                I think they're from 'you know'.  Some place
                that has similar conditions... cold, intense
                pressure.  No light.

                                CATFISH
                Happy as hogs in a waller down there, prob'ly.

INT. CORRIDOR/SUB BAY                                                   155

Hippy freezes in the corridor as he hears a loud ratcheting sound echoing from
the sub-bay.  He edges forward slowly, trying to keep his feet silent on the
steel floor.  Slides up along the wall next to the door.  Inches his eye
around the doorframe.  Across the room. Schoenick is working with a chainfall,
lowering Big Geek onto the MIRV warhead, which is still on its cart.  He
begins to attach them together with a sling of tie-down straps.

Hippy lets his breath out slowly.  His expression is Holy Shit.

He slides back along the corridor wall, silently.  Away from the door.  Then
turn turns quickly to go... WHAM!  Coffey slams him up against the wall!
.45 pressed to Hippy's temple.  Hippy gulping air as Coffey ears back the
hammer.

                                COFFEY
                Sniff something did you, rat boy?

INT. MESS HALL                                                          156

The meeting is breaking up as the door CLANGS open and Hippy is thrusted
inside.  His hands are taped behind his back and he stumbles onto his face.
Coffey steps through smoothly, straight-arming the .45.  Schoenick flanks him
with the assault rifle aimed at the group.

                                COFFEY
                FREEZE!  Don't move.  That's it.
                              (to Monk)
                Here, hold this a second.  We're going to phase
                three.

He hands his gun to Monk, with the assumption of absolute loyalty from a team
member.  Monk's eyes move between Coffey and the pistol.  We can't tell what
he's thinking.  Coffey grabs Hippy and shoves him onto a chair.

                                HIPPY
                They're using Big Geek to take the bomb to the
                NTIs!  We set it up to go right to them.

Lindsey looks stricken.  Her plan is betraying them all.

                                LINDSEY
                Oh my God...  Oh no...
                        (steps toward Coffey)
                Please, you can't.  Coffey, think about what
                you're doing... for God's sake--

Coffey lets her approach him, his eyes glittering.

Without warning he grabs her by the hair and hurls her against the Coke
machine, pinning her there with one hand.  Bud leaps forward.

                                SCHOENICK
                GET BACK!

Bud freezes.  The rifle's muzzle is aimed for a heart-shot.

Coffey moves up close to Lindsey.

                                COFFEY
                This is something I've wanted to do since I
                first met you.

His hand reaches down, OUT OF FRAME.  We hear something RIP.  His hand comes
back up... holding a piece of gaffer's tape.

He slaps it over her mouth.  Then pushes her down into a chair.

Hippy looks at Monk and Schoenick.

                                HIPPY
                You boss is having a full-on meltdown.  Guy's
                fixing to pull the pin on fifty kilotons and
                we're all ringside!

                                MONK
                What's the timer set for?

                                SCHOENICK
                Three hours.

                                COFFEY
                Shut up!  Don't talk!

                                MONK
                We can't get to minimum-safe-distance in three
                hours.  The shockwave will kill us.  It'll crush
                this rig like a semi driving over a beer can.

                                COFFEY
                Shut up!  SHUT UP!  What's the matter with you?!

Everybody is twitching a hyper.  Schoenick is white-knuckling his assault
rifle... looking from Monk to Coffey to the group.

                                COFFEY
                Just stay calm.  The situation is under control.

Coffey backs out quickly with Schoenick.

INT. CORRIDOR                                                           157

Coffey dogs down the watertight door and wedges a piece of steel pipe into
the mechanism so it can't be opened.

                                COFFEY
                Stay here.

Schoenick take a position in front of the door.  Coffey turns and runs through
the corridor like demons are chasing him.

INT. MESS HALL                                                          158

Their only hope is to sway Schoenick.  But the SEAL's fear is making him the
perfect machine, totally dependent on external orders.  And his orders are
clear.  They can see him through the tiny window in the door.  Lindsey rips
the tape painfully off her mouth.

                                LINDSEY
                Schoenick... your Lieutenant is about to make
                a real bad career move...

                                HIPPY
                That guy's crazier'n a shithouse rat!

                                BUD
                We have to stop him!  Schoenick!!

They pound on the door.  Schoenick turns and hangs his cap over the tiny
window.

INT. SUB BAY                                                            159

Using the chainfall, Coffey maneuvers the completed Geek/MIRV package over
the back of Flatbed, obviously preparing to use the submersible to take it
out and launch it.

INT. MESS HALL                                                          160

Lindsey is up next to the door, with Bud.

                                LINDSEY
              ... he's about to declare war on an alien species,
                Schoenick, just when they're trying to make
                contact with us.
                                (to Bud)
                I think I'm reaching him.

There is a CLUNK-CLATTER and the door unlatches.

                                LINDSEY
                See?

The door opens.  Jammer is standing there.  Schoenick is in a heap against
the far wall, moaning.  Jammer hands the rifle to Hippy as he walks in.  Hippy
turns to cover the other SEAL.  Monk puts his hands up, passively.

                                MONK
                I'm the least of your problems.

Bud appraises Jammer, who seems a little weak and dazed but basically okay.

                                BUD
                Thanks.  How you feeling, big guy?

                                JAMMER
                Figured I was dead, there, when I seen that
                angel comin' toward me.

They all look at him for a second.  What?

                                BUD
                Uh, okay, right.  You can tell us about it
                later.  Let's go.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. TRIMODULE C/LADDERWELL                                             161

Bud drops down the ladder, INTO FRAME, followed by the others.  He tries the
door into the main corridor.  The wheel won't turn.  The others get on it.
Won't budge.

                                BUD
                He's jammed the mechanism.

                                LINDSEY
                Now what?

They're locked in trimodule-C.  No other doors give access to the sub-bay
corridor.  Bud's mind is racing.  He drops down the ladder to Level One, into
about two feet of water.  He reaches down and open the emergency lockout
hatch.  Takes off his boots.

                                BUD
                Okay, I'm gonna free-swim to hatch six... get
                inside, get the door open from the other side.

                                LINDSEY
                Bud, that water's only a couple degrees above
                freezing.

                                BUD
                Then I guess you better wish me luck, huh?

Catfish is pulling his boots off as well.

                                CATFISH
                Wish us luck.
                       (hands his wallet to Hippy)
                'Case I don't die.  Okay, Bud... let's go,
                podner, I ain't got all day.

Bud clasps him on the shoulder and starts hyperventilating.  He drops into
the water.

EXT. DEEPCORE/TRIMODULE C                                               162

Bed shoots down through the hatch.  The cold hits him list a fist, becoming
instantly paralyzing.  He starts kicking in powerful strokes through the dark
water, maneuvering around tangles of umbilical cable twisted tubular steel.
Catfish is behind him, swimming like hell.  They reach hatch six.  Together
they spin the wheel and heave upward, opening it.

INT.  TRIMODULE D/LEVEL ONE                                             163

Bud surges up into the lock.  Catfish jams into the tiny airspace with him.
They try the upper hatch.  Jammed.  They're both panting with the exertion
and intense cold.

                                BUD
                Hafta... go on to... the moonpool.  Only way.

                                CATFISH
                I can't... make it... podner.

Bud looks at Catfish, shivering and heaving, wide-eyed.

                                BUD
                Okay, Cat.  You head back.

Bud hyperventilates rapidly and pikes over diving back out through the hatch.

EXT. DEEPCORE                                                           164

Bud is stroking rapidly through the tangle of pipes and conduit.  He sees the
lit rectangle of the moonpool far ahead.

INT. SUB BAY                                                            165

In the moonpool, Bud surface with an explosive gasp beside the full of
Flatbed.  His wracked breathing is masked by the WHINE of HYDRAULICS as Coffey
uses the external controls to extend Flatbed's big hydraulic arm, locking
the Geek/MIRV in its gripper.

Bud strokes to a point where Coffey can't see him and heaves up out of the
water onto the deck of the pool.  He lies gasping behind Cab One's cradle.
His limbs are wooden and unresponsive from the cold.  His fingers are
completely numb.  He hugs himself, putting his hands under his armpits.
Scans the situation.  He can't get to the door, which is across the room,
without Coffey seeing him.

INT. CONTROL MODULE                                                     166

Lindsey watching the whole thing going down, ON THE SCREEN, a high angle of
the sub bay... Bud moving up on Coffey.

                                HIPPY
                He can't get to the door... I think he's going
                to try and take him himself.

                                LINDSEY
                He couldn't be that dumb.  The guy's a trained
                killer.  Bud's idea of a fight is arm-wrestling
                One Night over laundry duty.

ON THE SCREEN, Bud picks up a piece of pipe.  Hefts it.  Moves forward,
crouched... stalking.  Lindsey yells at the screen in frustration.

                                LINDSEY
                BUUUUUD!!

INT. SUB BAY                                                            167

Bud chucks a tool across the chamber, creating a clattering distraction, then
wades in with the pipe in a vicious swing to the back of Coffey's knees,
taking him down.  Coffey spins even as he falls, catching Bud in a scissor
kick that topples him.

Grappling, they fall together into the freezing water.

Coffey is momentarily stunned by the cold, giving Bud time to haul himself
out, hoping to make it to the door.

Coffey launches from the water and grabs him legs.

He pulls himself up as Bud kick out.  Claws his way viciously over Bud's
body until he has him pinned to the deck.  Then he pulls out the .45.

Put it unceremoniously to Bud's forehead.

INT. CONTROL MODULE                                                     168

                                LINDSEY
                NOOO!!

INT. SUB BAY                                                            169

Coffey pulls the trigger... CLICK.  Bud flinches, then opens his eyes,
staring cross-eyed at the muzzle of the .45.  Coffey cocks it and tries
again.  CLICK.  Nothing.  Really pissed off beyond description, Bud hurls
the commando off him with a powerful heave, sending him clattering against
a rack of equipment.  They face off, panting.

INT. CONTROL MODULE                                                     170

The rig crew turns from the screen at the sound of Monk's voice.

                                MONK
                I tool the liberty of removing this before I
                gave it back to him.

Monk pulls his hand out from under his blanket and holds up the magazine from
the .45.

INT. SUB WAY                                                            171

Even so Bud is getting his ass kicked.  Coffey's really trying to put him out
of business.  It's mostly duck and dodges on Bud's part.  Throw a few things.
When Coffey connects, Bud goes down hard.  Give him credit, though.  He
manages to scramble back up.

The fight wrecks the room, scattering tools and gear.

Compressed air cylinders roll dangerously around the floor.

Coffey slips on one and Buds get in a couple of good licks.

Slams the SEAL's head in an equipment locker door.

But the Navy man is just too massive.  Bud is hammered back into a wall.
Coffey has his fist cocked back for the coup de grace.  Spins around at the
sound of a VOICE.

                                CATFISH
                Hey!

Catfish is right behind him.  Dripping wet.  A trail of water goes back to
the moonpool a few feet away.

CRACK!  Catfish's 'Hammer' punch comes in so hard and so fast, Coffey is
knocked right on his ass.  He doesn't get up.  Just sort of flops around.

Catfish helps Bud to his feet.  They advance on Coffey, who crab-scuttles
sideways, his eyes rabid.

He picks up a helium tank and hurls it at them.  As they duck he sprints to
Flatbed and drops through the hatch and slams it down.

                                BUD
                           (to Catfish)
                Get the door!

Bud leaps across the water to land on Flatbed.  The hatch is already sealed.
He grapples with Geek/MIRV, trying to free it from the steel claw.

INT. FLATBED                                                            172

Coffey crawls along the access tunnel to the pilot's compartment.  He claws
his way into the control seat and starts rapidly flipping switches.

INT. CORRIDOR                                                           173

Catfish pounds down the corridor like he's never run before, his beer gut
doing a rumba.  He reaches the door, tears out the piece of pipe and spins
the wheel.  Hippy pushes it open so fast it hits Catfish in the stomach.
Hippy tears past him, running with the assault rifle.  John Wayne.

INT. SUB-BAY                                                            174

Flatbed is submerging, with only the hatch tower still above the water.  Bud
is being dragged down, still trying to free the ROV.  He gives up when he
sees Hippy run in, waving the assault rifle around like a 130-pound Rambo.

Bud climbs the hatch tower and leaps to the deck of the moonpool.

Hippy clumsily raises the unfamiliar rifle at Coffey, visible inside his
viewing bubble beneath the swirling water.  Coffey looks up, stares at the
gun... doesn't seem to care.

                                CATFISH
                SHOOT!

Hippy's squeezing the trigger and nothing's happening.  Flatbed's hatch tower
goes under.

                                CATFISH
                Safety's on!  On the side... the lever!  Up,
                push it up!

Hippy fumble with the selective-fire lever, BLAM-BLAM-BLAM!  He put three
quick rounds into the ceiling.

                                HIPPY
                SHIT!

                                CATFISH
                Give me that!!

He grabs it out of Hippy's hands and aims it at the sub.  He racks the water
with a long burst.  BENEATH THE SURFACE, the rounds nip nasty contrails
through the water.  They barely scar the front port.

                                LINDSEY
                Forget that... go for Big Geek!

Catfish rakes the descending sub with more bursts, trying to hit the
shimmering shape of the ROV on its back.  UNDERWATER we see the rounds
arcing wild, a few hitting the ROV but causing little damage.

Coffey complete his descent to just above the seafloor.  ABOVE, Catfish
empties the weapon.

                                BUD
                Gimme a hand!

They all turn.  Bud is fumbling into his wetsuit like a madman.  The others
rush over to help him.

                                BUD
                Get the rest of my gear.  Grab that hat there...
                let's go guys!  Come on, come on!

Catfish slams a backpack onto Bud's shoulders, grappling with the straps and
hose connections.  Hippy and Sonny (with one hand) are clipping, zipping and
buckling all over him.  This is a world-record suit-up time.  Bud pulls the
rubber neck-dam of the helmet's lower ring down over his face.

                                BUD
                Helmet... helmet!  Work fast.

EXT. DEEPCORE UNDERSTRUCTURE                                            175

Beneath the habitat, Coffey is maneuvering Flatbed through the twisted pipe
and debris left by Deepcore's slide to the edge.  Bloodied, his fatigues
ripped half-off, he looks like a feral animal.  His eyes burn with the
determination of his mission.

INT. SUB BAY                                                            176

Jammer expertly works the crane controls, moving Cab One out over the
moonpool from its drydock cradle.  Lindsey and One Night are scrambling like
monkeys over the port side crash bars of the swinging sub, clambering up to
the hatch tower.

                                ONE NIGHT
                I'll unhook.
                           (Lindsey hesitates)
                GO!  You're better in these than I am.

Lindsey recognizes this for what it is... a sign of respect, a
reconciliation.  She nods and drops through the hatch.

EXT. DEEPCORE                                                           177

Coffey passes under the twisted wreckage of the big automated derrick and makes
a tight turn beneath the drill-floor module.  Flatbed scrapes through between
twisted conduit, metal screeching on metal.

INT. SUB BAY                                                            178

Bud has his 'hat' locked down and his air cut on.  He take two quick strides
to the edge of the pool and just drops in.

EXT. DEEPCORE                                                           179

Bud rockets DOWN INTO FRAME in a column of bubbles.  He looks around.  Through
the lattice of conduit under the rig he can see Flatbed moving forward from
its exit point under the stern.  Bud see a shortcut under the platform.

He kicks along a lattice a pipes, heaving himself along in frantic hand-over-
hand stokes.  He reaches for Flatbed's stern as it passes.

Misses the last hand-hold... but just manages to seize a tie-down trailing
behind it.  He is jerked along behind the sub.

Bud holds on with both hands as he is buffeted in the wake of the powerful
thrusters.  Flatbed gathers speed, moving out toward the edge of the abyssal
wall.  The current slams him, spinning him like a fishing lure.  He pulls
himself forward slowly until he can grip the stern rail of Flatbed's platform.

LOW ANGLE, look up the wall.  Flatbed appears over the edge and stops.
Hovering.

ON THE BACK OF FLATBED.  Bud has the break he needs.  He scrambles up onto the
deck and opens and equipment locker.  Nothing in it but one of the yellow
nylon safety lines.  The big arm begins to unfold, lifting Geek/ROV.

INT./EXT. FLATBED                                                       180

Coffey works intently.  His eyes are the cool ice of lethal madness in a
face streaked with blood.  He brings the ROV into view with the boom arm.

GEEK/ROV had a passenger.  Brigman.  The diver is holding Geek's skid with
one hand, doing something with the other.  He turns to look at Coffey.

EXT. FLATBED/DEEPCORE                                                   181

Coffey releases the ROV with the gripper and makes a grab at Bud with the
steel claw.  Bud dives.  The gripper hits his helmet a glancing blow.  Bud
kicks away rapidly, letting nylon rope pay out.  We see he has managed to tie
one end to Geek's skids.  Coffey hits the button to activate the ROV, sending
an acoustic pulse to Geek's transponder.  The little robot, pregnant with its
load of death, turns nimbly around and dives out and down toward the void.

Coffey pivots his bid machine toward Bud.  Bud strokes rapidly to a large
jumble of wreckage.  He loops the rope around a twisted pipe.  Big Geek is
hauling ass away from him.  The line snap taut an instant later.  The ROV
strains, like a Rottweiler on a leash... trying to go.  The rope is slipping
as Bud fights to make a knot.

Flatbed slews around, thrusters whining.  As it banks, it hurls up clouds of
sediment from the escarpment face.

Through the front panel we see Coffey jerking on the controls.

The big arm extends menacingly.  The smaller from manipulators open.  An
enormous predatory instinct, its lights blaring.

The big machine roars forward.  Straight at Bud.

Bud gets his knot partly done.  See Flatbed looming.

Glare-lit in its lights, Bud grabs a handlehold and pulls himself downward as
Coffey closes the last few feet.

One manipulator slams into his backpack, tumbling him, and the sub's underside
rakes across his legs as it passes over.  Flatbed crushes into the tangle of
pipework.  K-CRUUUNCH!!

INT. FLATBED                                                            182

Coffey is slammed hard over the controls, up into the front dome port.  He
gets back in the seat.  Strains to free his machine.

EXT. DEEPCORE/BIG GEEK/FLATBED                                          183

Bud swims clear, diving down at an angle along the wall, hoping to stay in
Coffey's blind area.  Flatbed backs out of the wreckage in a cloud of debris.
It pivots toward Bud.  Moves after him.

Nearby, the ROV is whining mindlessly, trying to please.  Trying to GO.
DETAIL OF ROPE attached to wreckage, as Bud's knot begins to slip.  The nylon
line starts to play through the knot slowly.

BUD has gotten himself into a bad position.  Along the bare rock face of the
cliff wall he is naked, nailed in the spotlights like a rabbit in front of a
truck.  Coffey puts the hammer down, thrust levers all the way forward.
Flatbed surges forward, multi-limbed and demonic.  There's no cover, side to
side, up or down.

Coffey has him head in his lights.  Suddenly a bright glare blasts in,
blinding Coffey.  He looks up to see Cab One rushing down upon him, full
throttle.

At the last moment LIndsey slams the thrusters full-lock and the submersible
slews sideways, slamming its heavy skidplate into Flatbed's cab.  Coffey is
smashed sideways by the shock.  He fights to control his vehicle.  Lindsey
looks up to see Coffey's sub gun it up over the wall, out of sight.  She
cruises up over Bud.

                                LINDSEY (V.O.)
                Get in!

Bud gets the lockout hatch open and clambers up into Cab One's belly.

INT./EXT. CAB ONE                                                       184

Bud flops over the lip of the hatch and slams it shut.  He ditches his helmet.
Lindsey raises her vehicle warily above the wall.  Through the front port
there is not sign of Coffey.

                                LINDSEY
                You owe me one, Virgil.

                                BUD
                Can we negotiate later?  There's Big Geek.

He points.  Through the front port, they can see the ROV still straining at
its leash.  Lindsey dives toward it, simultaneously working the controls to
open her own small manipulator claws.

EXT. DEEPCORE/WALL, ETC.                                                185

The last few feet of the rope slip through the knot.

Big Geek happily surges forward.  It dives gracefully down into the void,
trailing the yellow rope like a kite tail.

ONE CAB ONE, Bud and Lindsey through the front port.

                                BUD
                Go after it!  We gotta catch it!

FLATBED DROPS INTO FRAME BEHIND THEM, dwarfing little Cab One.  They are
slammed viciously as Coffey's submersible hammers into them.  She hits full
throttle.  Coffey floors it after Lindsey, ramming her from behind with his
more powerful vehicle.  With difficulty Lindsey maintains trim.

She arcs back toward the rig.  Flatbed slams her again, for the side.  She
fights for control.

INT./EXT. CAB ONE                                                       186

Bud is tossed around, ricocheting off the walls.  Lindsey flies with her
jaw set.  Fighting hard for control.  The A-frame of the rig looms before her.
She shoots through at full throttle.

EXT. DEEPCORE AND OCEAN TERRAIN                                         187

Now the fight is really on.  The two subs are dodging between the cylindrical
modules at full throttle, slamming into each other and the steel pressure
hulls.

Coffey sideswipes the smaller sub, jamming it sideways.  It screeches along
the flank of one of the trimodules.

They head out over empty terrain in a flat-out speed run.

Lindsey is jinking and dodging as Flatbed, roars along behind her, tearing
up the bottom with its powerful backwash.  Lindsey carves hard around a rock
pinnacle, finding herself running parallel to the edge of the abyssal canyon.
Coffey is ramming, hammering from behind, then from side to side.

Lindsey snarls.  He's pissing her off.  He shouldn't do that.

Ahead, out of the blackness, another outcropping.

Lindsey rises, cuts right.

Smashes down into Coffey's craft.  Timing it just right.  He skids catch in
the rocks.

Flatbed slews violently, nosing down.  Crushing into the rocky bottom.
Pressing the advantage, Lindsey hammers into Flatbed from behind.

It smashes full force into a second spire, spinning out of control.

Tangles together, the subs slide down an embankment toward the edge of the
wall.  With her one remaining thruster she jerks clear of Flatbed and grounds
her crippled sub.  Flatbed tumbles over the edge.

ANGLE DOWN THE WALL as it falls, trailing a cloud of sediment like a comet's
tail, down into the unfathomable blackness below.

INT. FLATBED                                                            188

Inside the machine, Coffey is fighting for control.

He has no buoyancy or motors and the craft continues its mad plunge.  As the
pressure intensifies the hull begins to groan, and steel fitting scream with
the enormous load.

A tiny silver fracture shoots partway across the front bubble.  Grows.
Coffey gives up fighting.  Just stares, wide eyed, at his death.  A damned
soul dropping into the bottomless pit.

The fracture line arcs rapidly across the dome port.

Suddenly, a scythe-like curtain of seawater, under tons of pressure, slashes
into him.  A moment later the bubble implodes, and Coffey disappears in a
bloody froth of churning water, air and glass shards.

EXT. CANYON WALL                                                        189

Flatbed looks like a toy, tumbling away down the wall.

Soon its lights vanish.

INT. CAB ONE                                                            190

They're both going to have a lot of bruises...

Lindsey is surveying the damage.  Water is spraying down on them like a
shower, and lights are flickering.

                                LINDSEY
                You did okay, back there.  I was fairly
                impressed.

                                BUD
                Not good enough.  We still gotta catch Big Geek.

                                LINDSEY
                Not in this thing.

Lindsey is flipping switches.  Nothing works.

                                BUD
                You totaled it, huh?

                                LINDSEY
                Yeah.  So sue me.

Bud looks down.  There's already about a foot of water sloshing around the
floor at their feet.

                                BUD
                It's flooding like a son of the bitch.

                                LINDSEY
                You noticed.

She picks up and hand-mike of the underwater telephone.

                                LINDSEY
                Deepcore, Deepcore, this is Cab One, over.

She waits.  No response.

                                BUD
                Try again.

                                LINDSEY
                Deepcore, this is Cab One.  We need assistance,
                over.  Deepcore, this--

With a SEARING CRACKLE or arc-light, a power panel shorts out and everything
goes black.

                                LINDSEY
                Well, that's that.

                                BUD
                Wonderful.
                          (looking around)
                There's some light from somewhere...

A faint illumination, dimmer than moonlight, washes in through the front port.
Lindsey scrunches up against the acrylic and scans the darkness.

                                LINDSEY
                Over there.  It's the rig.

A glow, beyond a rock promontory... like the lights of a town just over the
hill in the desert.

                                BUD
                Good hundred yards, I'd say.

                                LINDSEY
                They'll come out after us.

                                BUD
                Yeah, but it's gonna take them a while to find
                us.  We better get this flooding stopped.

He picks up his helmet and clicks on the light.  Using the thing like a bulky
flashlight.  The water is really pouring in, spraying them like a shower...
almost two feet deep already.

                                LINDSEY
                You see where it's coming in?

                                BUD
                Somewhere behind this panel.  Hold this.

She takes the light and he tries to reach the burst weld, which is blocked by
a steel switch panel and a bunch of conduit.

                                BUD
                Can't get to it.  Have to pull this panel off.
                You go any tools?

                                LINDSEY
                I don't know, look around.

Bud scans the cramped interior, feels around under the water.  It's past his
knees.

                                BUD
                Nothing.  Son of a bitch.  All I need's a goddamn
                crescent wrench.

He grabs the panel in both hands and starts torquing on it, trying to wrench
it off the wall.  Heaves on it repeatedly.  Finally stops, panting.  He's
breathing hard now, and it's not just effort.

                                BUD
                Son of a bitch!

                                LINDSEY
                Calm down, Bud.

A nervous edge in her voice now.  Bud's turning all around, looking around
for anything, trying to think fast.  Water up to their waists.  The sea
closing in.

                                BUD
                Okay... okay.  We gotta get you out of here.

                                LINDSEY
                How?

                                BUD
                I don't know how!

                                LINDSEY
                We've only got one suit.

                                BUD
                I know!  I know!  But we better come up with
                something.

                                LINDSEY
                Aaargh!!  I'm freezing!

She climbs up on the pilots seat, scrunching right up against the ceiling,
keeping as much of herself as possible out of the frigid water.  She's
shaking all over with the cold, and getting drenched from above by water
pouring in.

                                LINDSEY
                Okay, look, you swim to the rig and come back
                with another suit.

                                BUD
                Seven, eight minute swim each way... not enough
                time.  Look at this...
                       (the rate of flooding)
                Time I get back you'll be--

That stops the conversation for a second.  About two feet of airspace left.
Bud can't believe what this is coming down to.  They both stare at each other
for a long moment.

He makes a decision.  Starts pulling off his backpack.

                                BUD
                Alright, put this on.

                                LINDSEY
                What, you growing gills all of a sudden?  You
                got it on, keep it on.

                                BUD
                Don't argue, goddamnit, just--

                                LINDSEY
                No way!  Forget it.  Not an option.

Bud has his pack off uncoupling it.  She keeps fighting his hands, stopping
him, hooking it back up.  The desperation of the situation fuel the struggle.

                                BUD
                Lindsey, just put the thing on and shut up--

                                LINDSEY
                NO!!  Now be logical, Bud, you're--

                                BUD
                FUCK LOGIC!!

They're both right up against the ceiling, water up to their chests.
Lindsey's lips are blue and trembling from the cold.

                                LINDSEY
                Listen... will you listen to me for a second!?
                You're for the suit on and you're a better
                swimmer than me.  Right?  So I got a plan...

                                BUD
                What's the plan?

                                LINDSEY
                I drown, you tow me back to the rig--

                                BUD
                WHAT KIND OF PLAN IS THAT!??

Lindsey's gut-scared... shaking violently, her eyes wide.  But she's keeping
it together.  Thinking it out.  Bud see the bottomless pit opening to take her
and he can barely think.

                                LINDSEY
                Look, this water is only a couple degrees above
                freezing.  I drown.  I go into deep hypothermia...
                my blood like icewater.  I can maybe be revived
                after ten, fifteen minutes.  You got all the
                stuff to do it on the rig.

Bud stops moving and looks into her face, inches from him.  The water is up
to their necks.  He knows that, as always, infuriatingly, Lindsey is right.

                                BUD
                It is insane.

                                LINDSEY
                It's the only way, Bud.  Now trust me.

She takes a deep breath.  Before her nerve fails she busies her hands on his
suit, rehooking everything.

                                BUD
                Jesus, I don't believe this is happening.

She raise his helmet.  Water up to their chins.  They lock eyes, inches
apart.  He can feel her breath on his face... maybe for the last time.

                                BUD
                Oh God, Lins... I--

                                LINDSEY
                Tell me later.

He grabs her head in both hands and pulls her mouth to his.  They lock
together in a fierce kiss, fueled by passion and terror... the naked
realization of love hanging over the abyss of death.

She breaks away at the last possible second and quickly pulls his helmet
over his head.  Seats is down over the neck ring.  Lock the bail-out handle,
sealing it.  Even with her head press up into the highest point of the
ceiling, Lindsey's mouth is barely above water.  She give a scared little
laugh.

                                LINDSEY
                This is maybe not such a great plan, is it?

She is half-paralyzed with the cold, shaking pathetically.  Puts her face to
the glass of his helmet.  Seconds to go.

                                LINDSEY
                Hold me.  Hold me, Bud... I'm so scared...

He can't hear her, but he read her lips.  They clutch each other desperately.
The embrace last while the water rises over her mouth and nose.  She starts
to choke.  Her hands grip his shoulders like claws.  She bucks and thrashes.
Bud holds her, and a scream tears loose from him, a pure agony of the soul.

                                BUD
                NOOOOO!!!

The freezing seawater races into her lungs.  Her finger go slack, and her
hands float lifelessly.

Bud stares, transfixed, as the last tiny bubble trickles out of Lindsey's open
mouth.  He kicks himself into gear, fingers frenzied as he spins the wheel of
the lockout hatch.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. DEEPCORE/COMMAND MODULE                                            191

TIGHT ON VIDEO SCREEN, one of the outside cameras.  A ghostly figure swims out
of the darkness, towing something.

                                ONE NIGHT
                It's Bud.  Oh my God... that's Lindsey!

                                BUD (V.O./faint)
                Deepcore, Deepcore, do you read?

                                HIPPY
                Read you, Bud.  We're here.

EXT. DEEPCORE                                                           192

Bud swims with long, powerful kicks, towing Lindsey.  Her arms and legs float
as gracefully as seaweed waving in a gentle current.  Bud's voice comes in
short rasps, breathing hard, but icy with control.

                                BUD
                Go to the infirmary... get the cart .. oxygen...
                de-fib kit... adrenaline in a... ten cc
                syringe... and some... heating blankets.
                You got all that?

                                HIPPY (V.O.)
                Got it. Over.

                                BUD
                Meet me in the moonpool.  Move fast.

INT. INFIRMARY                                                          193

The door crashes open and Jammer thunders in.  He picks up the CPR cart, meant
to roll on wheels, and carries it out past Hippy, Catfish, and One Night, who
are crowding in to get the rest of the equipment.  They ransack the place in
about ten seconds, grabbing everything they might need and half of everything
else.

EXT. DEEPCORE/UNDER THE MOONPOOL                                        194

Bud moves up toward the rectangle of light, towing Lindsey to the diving
platform.  Through the surface we can see the others arrive at the edge,
looking down.

INT. SUB-BAY                                                            195

Hippy and Catfish are setting up the cart and the oxygen kit, dropping things,
making mistakes.  One Night is teaching herself how to fill a syringe from a
bottle of adrenaline.

                                SONNY
                Here he comes!

Jammer and Sonny leap into the freezing water, waist deep on the submerged
diving platform.  Bud bursts to the surface.  Together they haul Lindsey
across the platform, out of the water, and onto the deck.  Her skin is blue-
white, her chest still.

Bud rips his helmet off in a near-frenzy, like a man possessed, a man with a
mission.  The others are galvanized by his energy even though they all see
Lindsey as dead, a corpse... cold and inert.  Water flows from her mouth and
nose and her lips are blue, her limbs completely limp.  Hippy peels back one
eyelid, to find the pupil fixed and dilated.

But when Bud shouts for them to move, they move.

                                BUD
                Turn her over!

They flip his wife's body over.  He straddles her, pushing down with both
hands in the middle of her back.  Seawater gushes from her slack lips.  He
does it again until the flow stops, then flips her onto her back.

                                BUD
                Come on, hurry!  Gimme the de-fib...

One Night and Catfish are fumbling with the emergency cart equipment.  They've
all been trained in CPR and use of the gear but that was years ago, and is a
friend they're working on.  They're all thumbs.  Catfish drops the electrodes,
picks them up quickly, hands them to Bud...

                                CATFISH
                Here, here, here... no, you got to have bare
                skin, or it won't...

Bud rips into her clothing, opening her jumpsuit, literally tearing away her
T-shirt, revealing her bare chest... bony and still.

                                BUD
                Jesus.  Gimme those, come on.  Catfish, move it,
                man!  Come on... come on!

He slaps the things into Lindsey's bare skin, one on the sternum and one on
the side of the rib cage.

                                BUD
                Is that it?  Is this right?

                                HIPPY
                Yeah!  I mean, I don't know... it looks right.

                                BUD
                All right.  Do it!

One Night hits the switch and Lindsey's body convulses.  It is a pure muscle
reflex, and when it is over, there is not a hint of life.  Hippy pushes him
back and puts a black rubber oxygen mask over her mouth.  He opens the valve
on the cylinder and starts pumping the squeeze bag.  They start packing
electronic blankets around her to fight the intense hypothermia

                                BUD
                Do it again, One Night.  Zap her again!

The current hits Lindsey again and her back arches.  Bud doesn't wait for a
result... he's in his own reality now, driven.  He's doing it all at once,
somehow, in a senseless frenzy... pumping on her chest with his hands,
squeezing the oxygen bag, placing the electrodes.

                                BUD
                Aw.  Christ... come on, baby.  Again!  Do it
                again!

Lindsey's back arches.  Her body relaxes, inert.

                                BUD
                Come on, One Night... what are you waiting for?

A hush seems to have fallen over the group.  They know instinctively that it's
over.  But Bud can't accept it.  He looks at them, beseechingly, like they
are somehow intentionally holding out on him.  One Night starts to cry,
quietly.

                                CATFISH
                                (gently)
                Bud, it's over, man.  It's over.

There is a beat of silence.  Bud stares down into Lindsey's half-open,
motionless eyes.

TIGHT ON LINDSEY'S EYES, moving in until the pupil FILLS FRAME, a black void.

REVERSE, HER POV.  SILENCE.  A distant, distorted image, we see Bud, One
Night, Jammer, Hippy, Catfish, staring down.  It is like the circular top of
a dark well, their faces shimmering as if through the surface of water.  It is
as if we are in a well, descending, looking up at a circle of faces growing
smaller as we drop away... smaller and smaller, receding until it becomes
a point of light in the void, like the fading bright dot at the center of a
turned-off TV.

TIGHT ON BUD, rigid, staring.  Catfish puts his hand gently on Bud's shoulder.
Suddenly Bud tears Catfish's hand away and sets upon Lindsey like a madman,
renewing his efforts in spades... totally manic.

                                BUD
                No!  NO!  She's not... her heart is strong,
                she wants to live... can't you see that?  Come
                on, Lins.  Come on, baby!  Zap her again!  Do
                it... DO IT!

They do.  And Bud works, feverishly.  He lock his lips over hers and starts
mouth-to-mouth.  It is frantic, passionate... the kiss of life.

                                BUD
                Come on, breath!  Goddamn it, you bitch, you
                never backed down from anything in life... now
                fight!

He slaps her face, hard.  Her head lolls.  He smacks her the other way.

                                BUD
                Fight, Goddamnit!

LINDSEY's POV, from the bottom of the great well.  The circles of faces and
light rockets toward us in the blackness, as we soar upward from the pit.  We
see Bud yelling, but his voice is distant, windlike.

                                BUD
                FIGHT!!

TIGHT ON LINDSEY, still.  Then something incredible happens.  Something they
will never forget as long as they live.  Lindsey coughs once, weakly, and her
hands clench in a spasm.

Bud see it and his expression becomes beatific.

                                BUD
                Come on, Lins.  You can do it... fight your
                way back, baby...

The others look on in wonder as Bud wills this woman back.

She starts to cough, weakly at first... then more violently as she draws air
into her lungs.  Bud crouches over her, rubbing her limbs... trying to re-
establish circulation.  It is like a difficult birth.  Lindsey comes hacking
and howling back into the world, wet and naked and fighting for breath.

Bud puts the oxygen mask over her face and she draws breath after agonized
breath.  He pushes her wet hair back from her face with his trembling hands,
and watches her breathe.  Color is returning to her skin as she lies there,
gasping weakly.

ONE THE GROUP... Catfish, Hippy, One Night, Jammer, the others... they're
all grinning, crying, beaming... gazing at the miracle of her rebirth.

ON BUD... tears are streaming down his face.

                                BUD
                   (a whisper, fierce and harsh)
                You did it, ace.

                                                                DISSOLVE TO:

INT. DEEPCORE/QUARTERS -- LATER                                         196

TIGHT ON LINDSEY, sleeping peacefully.  WIDER shows Bud hovering over her,
attentive.  They are alone in Bud's tiny cubicle.  Perhaps twenty minutes
have passed.  She is completely swaddles in blankets, except for her face,
and looks like a waif.

Lindsey's eyes flutter and open.  The first thing she sees is Bud, bending
over her.  He can't help himself.  The tears break again and roll down his
cheeks.  She seems terribly fragile, but bright and aware.  She smiles,
faintly... touches his cheek.

                                LINDSEY
                Hey... big boys don't cry, remember?

                                BUD
                Hi, lady.

                                LINDSEY
                Hi, tough guy.  I guess it worked, huh?

                                BUD
                'Course is worked.  You're never wrong, are you?
                How d'you feel.

                                LINDSEY
                I've been better.  Next time it's your turn,
                okay?

Bud's expression turn inexplicably grim.

                                BUD
                Well, you got that right.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. SUB-BAY                                                            197

TIGHT ON BUD'S EYES, as Monk's fingers insert acrylic scleral lenses under his
eyelids so he can see in the fluid helmet.

WIDER reveals Bud is wearing the SEALs' deep suit.  Everybody is grouped
around, buckling and zipping.  He is hyperventilating with an oxygen mask,
part of the procedure for transitioning from air to fluid breathing.  Monk,
on his stretcher, is presiding.  The resident expert.  Lindsey is wrapped in a
blanket, still looking wan and frail.  She doesn't have the strength to resist
Bud's will, but she's trying.

                                LINDSEY
                No, Bud, no... not you.

                                BUD
                Who then?

She looks around at the others.  Sees their eyes.  The fear.  Has her answer.
He lowers the helmet over his head.  Catfish clamps it down.  We see what's
driving him... his sense of responsibility for these people, for not being
able to prevent this situation.

He touches her cheek, one last time.  She sees his fingers are trembling.
Then he puts on the gloves.  Catifsh is strapping a KEYPAD UNIT onto Bud's
forearm.  Lindsey wants to scream... to stop this madness.

                                BUD (muffled)
                So I'll hear you, but I can't talk?

                                MONK
                The fluid prevents your larynx from making
                sound.  It'll feel a little strange.

                                BUD (muffled)
                Warning you now, folks, I'm a lousy typist.
                              (a beat)
                The moment of truth, huh?

His breathing is shallow and tense.  He looks at Lindsey.  The eyes of a
condemned man.  She squeezes his hand.  He takes a deep breath.

                                BUD
                Okay.  Let's rock and roll.

Monk gently cracks a valve on the suit's feed line.  The breathing fluid (3M
fluorocarbon emulsion FX-80) swirls into the helmet.  Bud reflexively raises
his chin.  The liquid fills toward his mouth.

                                MONK
                Relax now, Bud.  Just keep breathing as it
                fills... don't fight it.  Take it in.  Just let
                yourself take it in.

Suddenly, there's nothing in there to breathe but liquid.  His eyes go wide,
instant panic.  He starts to thrash.  Chest heaving.

                                MONK
                Hold him.  Hold him.  This is normal... it'll
                pass in a second.  You're gonna be okay.  We all
                breathe liquid for nine months, Bud.  Your body
                will remember.

Lindsey grabs Bud's shoulders, steadying him.  He finds her eyes, the look
calming him.  He's passed into a realm from which she has already returned.
His spasms subside.  He begins to "breathe" normally.  He gets a goofy look
of wonder on his face, not really believing what he's experiencing.  He is
alive, alert and quite completely drowned inside the FBS helmet.  He grins.
Gives a big thumbs up.  Lindsey picks up a microphone.

                                LINDSEY
                Can you hear me okay?
                          (another thumbs up)
                Try your keypad.

Bud taps out a brief message.  FEELS WEIRD - YOU SHOULD TRY THIS prints out
on their portable monitor.

                                LINDSEY
                I already have, moron.

They help Bud to the edge of the dive platform.  Jammer and Hippy lower Little
Geek into the water and Bud grabs onto it.  Hippy yells right up next to his
helmet.

                                HIPPY
                I redid Little Geek's chip the same as Big Geek!
                He should take you right to it.  All you gotta
                do is hang on!

Lindsey crouches at the edge to watch Bud submerge.

He looks up at her as he drops away.

In a few seconds, she can't see him.  Her chin quivers, minutely.

EXT. DEEPCORE/THE WALL                                                  198

FROM FAR BELOW, Deepcore is a faint tiara of lights, above in the blackness.
A single moving light appears above, at the edge of the cliff, and starts
down.  It grows large, resolving into Bud, free-falling down the wall.

He gathers speed as Little Geek's vertical thruster drives them down.

Bud looks down.  Between his feet he can see a short way down the wall in the
glow of his single light, and beyond that an unfathomable blackness.  The wall
unrolls upwards out of the darkness like a convoluted gray drapery.  He looks
up.  The lights of Deepcore are gone.  He feels  more alone than he has ever
felt.  He types out:  CANT SEE YOU

                                LINDSEY (V.O.)
                We're right here with you, Bud.  Your depth is
                3800 feet.  You're doing fine.

Bud comes upon the twisted wreckage of the crane, hanging against the wall
like a forty-ton yo-yo at the end of the umbilical.

INT. COMMAND MODULE                                                     199

Everyone is grouped around the monitor screen, watching Bud's telemetry.  Bud
types out: GOOD DEAL ON SLIGHTLY USED CRANE.  They watch the depth meter
counting down.

                                MONK
                4800 feet.  It's official.

                                LINDSEY
                Bud, according to Monk here, you just set a record
                for the deepest suit dive.  Bet you didn't think
                you'd be doing this when you got up this morning.

The screen print out:  CALL GUINESS.  They laugh.  So far so good.  Seconds
later...

                One mile down and still grinnin'.

WIDE SHOT.  Bud is a tiny spider dropping down the wall in a pathetic little
pool of light.  The wall is sterile brown-gray, devoid of life at this depth.
LOOKING DOWN, as the light shrinks to a star and vanishes in the blackness
yawning below.

INT. COMMAND MODULE                                                     201

Lindsey has the microphone gripped tightly, and the lightness in her voice is
a bit brittle.

                                LINDSEY
                8500 feet, Bud.  Everything okay?

                Ensign Monk want to know how you feel.

Then:  HANDS SHAKING.  HHARD TO TYPE.

                                MONK
                It's starting.  It hits the nervous system
                first.

                                ONE NIGHT
                Keep talking, Lindsey.  Just let him hear your
                voice.  It doesn't matter what about.

                                LINDSEY
                Don't forget Bud, you're being graded on spelling
                as well as sentence structure, so concentrate,
                okay?
                              (long pause)
                Bud, I... uh, there's some things I want to say.
                It's hard for me.  I'm not of those softy, gooey-
                center-type people.  It's not easy, you know,
                being a cast-iron bitch.  It takes discipline
                and years of training.  A lot of people don't
                appreciate that.

Lindsey has somehow tuned out the others in the room.  In her mind she is
with Bud, out in the darkness.

                                LINDSEY
                But is wasn't all bad.  I know that.  You
                remember that bike trip... we rode the Honda
                up through Oregon?  It took me a week to get my
                hair untangled, but I've never been happier.  It
                was the most... free... I've ever felt.  I'm
                sorry I can't tell you these things to your face.

Bud is visibly trembling, gritting his teeth... holding on as the vise-grip
of pressure takes him.

                                LINDSEY (V.O./filtered)
                It's pitiful.  I have to wait until you're
                freezing in the dark and there's ten thousand
                feet of water between us.  I guess I'm babbling.
                I'm sorry.

Bud struggles with his keyboard.

BLAM!  Bud jerks as his dive light implodes.  He still has Geek's floodlights.
He falls on.

                this.

                                LINDSEY
                Shut up, Hippy.  Bud, how you doing?

He types: SE LUMINUS THINNGS

Everyone snaps suddenly alert.

                                HIPPY

                                LINDSEY

                Maybe it's... you know... them.

The screen prints out:  ITS OK. SQUID. GLOWING SQUID.

Bud is in an enormous school of bioluminescent squid, graceful, attenuated
creatures less than a foot long.  Thousands of then glide in ghostly arcs
around him, filling the black void as far as the eye can see.  He stares at
them in wonder.  Reaches out and touches one, catches it, lets it go.  Are
they really here?  He can no longer be sure of his own perceptions.

Bud emerges from the school of squid.  As he falls, they form a luminous plane
of swirling colors above him.  He stares upwards, transfixed.  BUD'S POV, the
ghostly blizzard of luminescence above him.  A spectral form takes shape in
the patternless glow... resolving into Lindsey's face, a hundred feet wide.
Gazing down at him, her expression sad.  Her image receded away from him into
the darkness above as he falls.

DOWN ANGLE ON BUD, reaching up in anguish.

                                LINDSEY
                I'm not going away, Bud.  I'm right here, right
                here with you.  This is Lindsey, Bud.  I'm right

Everyone hustles to comply.  The room is plunged into darkness, the faces of
the group lit only by the ghostly CRT screen.

Bud is shaking violently, as if with palsy.  His eyes keep rolling back, and
he's having a hard time staying conscious.  He tries to type a message and he
can't.  The tons of pressure per square inch are short-circuiting his nervous
system.  Suddenly K-BAM!  Little Geek's pressure hull implodes.  Its lights
go out.  BLACKNESS.

                cold blackness... but I'm there in the dark

Lindsey seems not to be in the room, but to be with him, seeing what he sees.
She is oblivious to the others.

Blackness.  Then a bright light appears... he's lit a MAGNESIUM FLARE.

It's fierce, flickering glare lights his plunge.  Bud discards the stalwart
little ROV and free-falls like a skydiver without a chute.  Out of control, he
hits a ledge and rolls off.  Tumbles forward in a cloud of debris.  He hits
another outcropping, limp as a rag doll.  Rocks and sand rain down with him
as he continues his descent.

Bud us quivering, teeth locked in a titanic rigor.

He pulls his arms and legs slowly into a fetal position.

In the plunge toward death he has gone he has gone full circle, returned to
the womb in which we all breathe the water of life before we know the world of
air and light.  Still, there is Lindsey's voice, faintly in his helmet.

                                LINDSEY (V.O.)
                You remember that time, you were pretty drunk,
                you probably don't remember... the power went
                out at the old apartment, the one on Orange
                Street... and we were staring at that one little
                candle, and I said something really dumb like
                that candle is me, like every one of us is out
                there alone in the dark in this life...

TIGHT ON LINDSEY as she grips the microphone.  Her voice has become a hoarse
whisper.  Her eyes are intense, focused on a point far beyond the walls of the
room.

                                LINDSEY
              ... and you lit another candle and put it beside
                mine and said "that's me"... and we stared at
                the two candles, and then we... well, if you
                remember any of it, I'm sure you remember the
                next part.  Bud, there are two candles in the
                dark.  I'm with you.  I'll always be with you.

A tiny flickering light moves down along a vast black wall.  Bud falls on in
dream-like solitude, a candle in the dark.

They watch the screen, expectantly.

Nothing.  Hippy and One Night start checking the equipment.  Lindsey tried
unsuccessfully to keep the terror our of here voice.

                Bud?  You hangin' in there?  Talk to me, Bud.
                Are you okay?

There is an agonizing pause, then the letters appear slowly:  SHAKING STOPED.

Bud is no longer in pain.  His expression is rapt.

LOOKING DOWN, past his to a ghostly landscape.  His last flare sputters out,
but there is light.  Bioluminescent algae carpet the walls of the canyon
below him.  And he's right... it is beautiful.

The water is so clear we can see down 500 feet past Bud's tiny, silhouetted
figure, to a vast landscape faintly revealed in spectral pastels.  Barren as
the moon but exquisite, serene.  Changeless.  A place unseen by human eyes.
Like a firefly below, the lights of Big Geek are visible.  Bud descends toward
the ROV, which has grounded on a narrow shelf.  Below the shelf, the wall
slopes out, suggesting we are near the bottom of the canyon but can't see it.

ONE BIG GEEK/MIRV, sitting there like a dumbshit.  Bud's feet thump into the
sediment next to it, stirring it luminous particles.  Touchdown... three and
half miles of water over his head.  Bud leans over the warhead in a swarm of
fireflies.

Bud is peering into the detonator unit.  How bad is he?  We can't tell.

                                MONK (V.O.)
                It's the blue wire with the white stripe, not...
                I repeat... NOT the black wire with the yellow
                stripe.

Bud is staring.  Blinking.  The two wire look big as sewer pipes, and they're
miles away... way down there where his hands are.

The only light he has left is a CYALUME STICK.  He pulls out the little
plastic tube.  Breaks and shakes.  It starts to glow, a tiny wand of green
light.  He fumbles with his tool pouch, takes out a pair of side-cutters.
CUTING NNOW he types to them.  He reaches into the detonator.

DETAIL, THE WIRES... in the green Cyalume glow, the look identical.  The
cutters go over on wire.  A long beat.  They withdraw, then go over the other
wire...

He cuts--

                It took him over an hour to get down there--

It's hopeless.  Lindsey grabs the headset from Monk.

Bud is one his knees beside the dead warhead.  His expression is enigmatic.
He looks around slowly at the luminous canyon.  Starts to type.

INT. CONTROL MODULE                                                     221

The message comes in:  NO.  THINK ILL STAY A WHILE.  BEAUTIFUL HERE.  WORTH
ADMISSION

                                LINDSEY
                No!  You can make it!  You hear me?  Drop your
                weights... you... can breathe shallow... you...
                it could be wrong--

Lindsey's voice has twisted into a sob.  She begins to weep, quietly.

                                LINDSEY
                Oh God, Virgil, please...

DONT CRY BABY

A pause.  Then the words...

WE KNEW THIS WAS A ONE WAY TICKET WHEN I PUT THIS THING ON.  BUT YOU KNOW I
HAD TO COME.

Lindsey sobs at the mike.  The others look away.  The signal is weakening.
One Night boosts it and the screen clears briefly.

LOVE YOU WIFE.

She stares at the printout.

                                LINDSEY
                Love you.

There is no reply.

                                                                CUT TO:

EXT. THE ABYSS                                                          222

A tiny figure lies slumped beside the inert ROV, an Indian dying with his
horse in the desert.

Bud's eyelids close.  His chest barely moving.

A strange illumination bathes his face and his eyes open.  He blinks.  Weakly,
he raises his head, facing the source of the radiance.

BUD'S POV... A glowing figure hovers before him, like a vision.  It seems to
be an angel.  Seen closer, as it drifts toward him, we see that it is an
extraterrestrial being, bioluminescent like some deep-sea fish.  Its body
and limbs are transparent, and it resembles a figure made of blown glass.  A
delicate mantle or veil billows out around its like a corona, which pulsates
gently, propelling the being with the hypnotic grace of a Spanish dancer.  The
head is refined and strangely anthropomorphic, with large eyes that convey a
cold, dispassionate wisdom.

It is stunningly beautiful.

The creature settles toward him.  Unafraid, Bud extends his hand.

Its slender, blown-glass digits grasp his bulky glove.  It pulls him up from
the benthic ooze and they glide together down the slope, deeper into the
abyss.

At the limits of visibility we see faint, glowing forms moving below.  They
resolve into NTI ships.  Tiny ovoids, like the little scoutship that Lindsey
nearly collided with at the Montana wreck.  The larger manta-ships.  And
others, strangely configured, moving in the darkness below like luminous fish.

Suddenly the darkness explodes with light.  A vast, reticulated pattern of
brightly glowing lines, like some enormous circuit diagram, appears below
them, covering the floor of the abyssal trench.  It sweeps outward from the
center, as if the light were surging through channels.  The NTIs are revealing
their home to Bud.  The ships move among the spires like air traffic over a
major city.

EXT. N.T.I. STRUCTURE                                                   223

Bud and the creature descend until, between the lines of light, we see a dark
surface of inhuman design.  The shape extends beyond the limits of visibility.
Towers hundreds of feet high stretch upward from the curving surface.  It
dwarfs their figures as the descend toward it, approaching an opening that soon
yawns like a vast mouth.

They are picking up speed, swept along by a powerful current, into the mouth-
like opening.

INT. N.T.I. STRUCTURE                                                   224

Bud stares around in awe as smooth, pearlescent walls blur past him.  It is a
curving three-dimensional maze of tunnels, like a vast circulatory system,
where controlled currents of water become freeways in three-dimensional
space.  Tunnels divide, narrow, and reenter main-routes hundreds of feet
across, as the pair race through in a dizzying blur.

INT. FINAL CHAMBER                                                      225

Entering a smaller chamber they settle to the floor, and the NTI moves back a
few feet.

A shimmering plane or surface appears like a vertical curtain bisecting the
chamber.  The seawater divides, like the Red Sea, into two rippling walls.
They move apart.  Leaving Bud standing in a short, shimmering hallway.

Weakly, he uncouples his helmet and pulls it free.  Drops to his knees.
Doubles over as spasms wrack him.  Breathing fluid explodes from his lungs.
He lies gasping and coughing on the floor, dragging in deep breaths of what
he can only hope is air.  It is.

Bud slowly recovers, sitting up.  His head is clearing.  This really is
happening.  Beyond the shimmering, vertical surface of the water he sees the
NTI being joined by others, move or less identical, until a group of seven
is gathered watching him.

                                BUD
                Howdy, Uuuh... how you guys doin'?

His voice echoes metallically in the strange chamber.  Soft laps of water
from the 'walls'.

In the air a pattern of glowing lines appears, a series of what appears to be
circuit diagrams.  Bud staggers back from this strange 'screen' hanging in
mid-air.  The image is about twenty feet across.

There is a rolling jumble of static and interference which resolves into...
the face of Dan Rather, doing the evening news.  STATIC, then another
newscast.  And another.  Fragments of the same story.  The world on the brink
of war.

                                BUD
                You watch out TV?  That what you're trying to
                say?  That you know what's been going on up
                there?

The NTIs are impassive.  Static... then another newscast.

This time, we're allowed to focus on the story.  An on-the-scene interview
outside a high-tech seismology lab.  There is an air of hysteria about the
scene... technicians running across the background of the shot, people
shouting, the reporter jamming his mike at the harried-looking scientist.

                                REPORTER
              ... a Caltech scientist who is among those
                reporting an unprecedented disturbance in the
                world's oceans.  Dr. Breg, can you give us a
                clearer explanation then we're getting?

Berg is edgy and distracted.  People keeps handing him pieces of paper,
computer hardcopy.  The biggest thing in his life is happening...

                                BERG
                They're acoustic shockwaves, like tsunamis, but
                with no seismological source.  The waves are
                propagating toward the shorelines of every
                continent--

An assistant runs up, face shiny with fear, beckoning.  We see that Berg is
running scared.  The impossible bringing the greatest terror to the rational
mind.

                                BERG
                Yeah.  I'll be right there... I have to go.
                Look, we don't know what it is!  Okay?  Not the
                slightest goddamn idea!

The image dissolves into static, fades out.  Bud turns to the NTIs.

                                BUD
                You're doing it!  Right?  That's what you're
                telling me.  Yeah, you can control water...
                that's your technology.  But why?

Static again, then a brilliant flash.  Grainy stock film of a hydrogen bomb
test in the Pacific.

The film repeats, and then again, faster, and again until is merges into an
unbroken white glare.  Bud gets the message.

                                BUD
                Hey, you don't know they're really gonna do it.
                Where do you get off passing judgment on us,
                when you can't be sure?  How do you know?

The screen exploded into a staccato series of searing images, stark moments
from recent history...

US soldiers fighting in Vietnam, street warfare in Beirut, a car bomb in
Belfast, a suspect shot in the head in the streets of Saigon, burned and
bleeding children, grainy footage of corpses bulldozed into mass graves at
Auschwitz, Wermacht soldiers marching in goose-step review, a 13-year-old
contra with an AK-47...  Just glimpses, strobing... a few frames of each.
But enough.  The images continue.

HOLD ON BUD, as the lights flicker on his face, the ongoing indictment of
humanity.

                                                                CUT TO:

EXT. OCEAN FRONT WALK, SANTA MONICA, CALIFORNIA -- DAY                  226

A video news crew leaps from a Jet Ranger helicopter in a parking area and
runs to set up near the railing, facing the ocean.  Pandemonium reigns around
them, people running, driving, evacuating inland.

On the horizon, out to sea, a dark line has appeared.

It grows in height as it comes closer, a wall of water stretching across the
horizon, already hundreds of feet high and growing.

EXT. NEW YORK -- DAY                                                    227

LONG LENSE SHOT, looking seaward past the Statue of Liberty, out past the
Verazzano Narrows.  Stacked up by perspective, the distant wave is a wall of
water impossibly high, still miles out.

EXT. NAVAL BASE, KAMCHATKA PENINSULA, U.S.S.R. -- NIGHT                 228

The scene repeats on the eastern coast of the Kamchatka Penninsula in Russia,
where a full moon shimmers along the crest of a vast wave.

SIRENS wail as Russian sailors run from the docks of Petropavlovsk Naval Base.
Some stand rooted as the black glacier of water, a thousand feet high and
growing, thunders toward them in nightmarish slow motion.

EXT. OCEAN FRONT, SANTA MONICA -- DAY                                   229

The minicam crew reporter is speaking rapidly, faltering with emotion, his
voice cracking like the famous broadcast from the scene of the Hindenburg
disaster.

                                REPORTER
                The horizon has gone dark... the crowd is starting
                to run... some are just staring, unable to
                move... the wave... the wave is... it's...
                I don't know... maybe a thousand feet high
                already... getting bigger as I'm watching...
                still miles out... oh my God, Jesus... I can
                hear it...

A roar fills the air, a thunder which drowns out the people's screams, even
the rotors of the news chopper as the camera teams scrambles aboard.  They
leave the announcer standing transfixed, his face blank, eyes tracking upward
and upward as the ground begins to shake.

EXT. NEW YORK -- DAY                                                    230

The Statue of Liberty looks like a souvenir figurine at the afternoon sun is
blocked out by the cresting tsunami, an escarpment of water 2500 feet tall.

EXT. SAN FRANSISCO -- DAY                                               231

LONG LENS SHOT -- The Golden Gate Bridge and the hills of the city, the
buildings downtown.  Beyond, FILLING FRAME is the wall of sea green which
defies our comprehension.  The image shakes with the THUNDER.

EXT. MALIBU -- DAY                                                      232

A diehard surfer looks over his shoulder as the mountain of water which
transcends his worst nightmare.  He lies paralyzed on his board.

EXT. MIAMI -- DAY                                                       233

Downtown Miami crouches in terror at the feet of the shimmering monolith.

In a penthouse office suite, an executive watches the wave towering above him,
blocking out the sun, a line of raging foam appearing as it arches over,
about to break upon the teeming city.

And then...

The wave slows as it crests...

And stops.

IT SIMPLY STOPS.

2600 feet high and motionless except for a shimmering undulation of its
surface in the bright sun.  There is quiet, a faint wind and calling of
confused gulls.  Various reactions, as the thunder fades and people recover,
only to stand awed before the vast, inexplicable manifestation.  A news
helicopter passes in front of it like a dragonfly.

EXT. MALIBU                                                             234

The surfer just blinks, starting.

EXT. NEW YORK -- DAY                                                    235

On the East Coast it's the same, as the World Trade Centers are dwarfed by a
shimmering blue wall which stands... waiting.

EXT. PETROPAVLOVSK NAVAL BASE, U.S.S.R. -- NIGHT                        236

Russian seamen, lining the harbor breakwall at Petropavlovsk Naval Base on the
Kamchatka Peninsula, stare upward at the monolith of water, undulating in the
moonlight.  It seems poised to crash down, inflicting inconceivable
devastation... but it doesn't.

EXT. OCEAN FRONT WALK, SANTA MONICA                                     237

When all have seen...

The wave soundlessly subsides, slowly slipping back and down until the surface
of the sea is normal again.

VIDEO SHOT, HANDHELD, of a crowd of people watching the sea.  Moving from
face to face.  Various reactions as people respond to what they can only
understand as a miracle.  The faces... awed, stunned, tear-streaked...
laughing.  The cameraman is just walking.  Some people turn to him and smile,
or laugh, or whoop.

A woman is collapsed on a bench, crying.

A man is on his knees, shaking.

Total strangers hug each other.

A black guy, tears pouring down his face, turns to the camera with a beautific
grin.

                                GUY
                Somebody just laid it down to us, man.  Things
                ain't never gonna be the same!

INT. FINAL CHAMBER                                                      238

Bud sits, shaken, watching the screen, as people react to their deliverance.
He turns to the NTIs.

                                BUD
                Why?  You could've done it.  Why didn't you?

The screen darkens.  Then letters appears on it, slowly printing out, as if
someone was clumsily typing them.

WE KNEW THIS WAS...

And we've seen this before so we know the rest...

WE KNEW THIS WAS A ONE WAY TICKET WHEN I PUT THIS THING ON.  BUT YOU KNOW I
HAD TO COME.

A pause, then:

LOVE YOU WIFE

The last message expands to fill the entire screen.

Bud stares at the screen, at his message of self-sacrifice, then at the
aliens.  They bow their heads, just for a moment.  A sign of respect.

CLOSE ON BUD as he begins to realize what has happened.

                                                                CUT TO:

Lindsey is slumped in a chair, just staring.  Withdrawn.

The others are conserving oxygen and heat, huddling in the dark.

The air is looking pretty thick.  The speaker of the hydrophone transceiver
crackles to life.

                                MCBRIDE (V.O.)
                Deepcore, do you read?  This is Benthic Explorer,
                over.

                                CATFISH
                Hell yes, we read!  Good of you to join us.  How's
                that storm doin'?

                                MCBRIDE
                Well, it's strange... it just kind've blew
                itself out all of the sudden.  We're up here in
                a flat sea with no wind.  But then a lot of weird
                things've been happening.

                                CATFISH
                Well, hell, son.  You better get us a line down
                here, we're in moderately poor shape.

LATER, Hippy, Catfish, and Monk are conferring B.G. on how to get a new
umbilical hooked on.  One Night is talking to McBride on the hydrophone.

                                MCBRIDE
                They figure is was over a half mile high.

                                ONE NIGHT
                I wish I could have seen it--

She glances down at the telemetry screen, seeing movement.

                                ONE NIGHT
                Hey.  Hey!  HEY!!  Look... it's Bud.

                                MONK
                That's impossible.

Lindsey bolts to the screen.  Stares at the message printing out.

A huge grin wraps around her face.

                                LINDSEY
                No it's not.

                                MCBRIDE (V.O.)
                What's it say?

Lindsey take the mike and sits before the screen.  During the message, her
voice will go through an emotional spectrum from confusion to wonder, to a
childlike joy.

INTERCUT BETWEEN DEEPCORE AND EXPLORER BRIDGE DURING THE FOLLOWING:

                                LINDSEY
                It says...
                "VIRGIL BRIGMAN BACK ON THE AIR/HAVE SOME NEW
                FRIENDS DOWN HERE/I GUESS THEYVE BEEN HERE AWHILE/
                THEYVE LEFT US ALONE BUT IT BOTHERS THEM TO SEE
                US HURTING EACH OTHER/GETTING OUT OF HAND LATELY"

Lindsey grins as she reads the next part...

                                LINSEY
                "THEY SENT A MESSAGE/HOPE YOU GOT IT"

                                CATFISH
                I'd say that's a big 10-4, jack.

                                LINDSEY
                "THEY WANT US TO GROW UP A BIT AND PUT AWAY
                CHILDISH THINGS/OF COURSE ITS JUST A SUGGESTION."

INT. BENTHIC EXPLORER BRIDGE -- DAY                                     240

Beyond the windows the ocean is calm.  The sky steel-gray put placid.  McBride
turns to Commodore DeMarco and the Navy contingent, his eyebrows cocked.

                                MCBRIDE
                Looks like you boys might by out of business.

                                BENDIX
                Something's going on down there.  I'm getting
                some big readings....

Bendix is hunched over the sonar, and we can see the screens lit up like a
Wurlitzer.

INT. DEEPCORE                                                           241

In Deepcore the crew becomes aware of a strange subsonic rumbling.  The sonar
is going crazy.  One Night puts the headphones of her passive sonar rig up to
her ear, then jerks it away.

                                ONE NIGHT
                Whew!  Whatever this is, it's major.

The rumbling increases and a glow diffuses the water.

The glow intensifies until a blinding shaft of light blasts through the
viewport, bathing the whole interior in a cold white radiance.

A last message appears on the screen:

KEEP YOU PANTYHOSE ON/YOURE GONNA LOVE THIS

The radiance intensifies.  Everyone covers their eyes.  It flares to
WHITE-OUT.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT./EXT. EXPLORER BRIDGE -- DAY                                        242

Bendix and the bridge crew are going nuts.  All their instruments are pegged.

                                BENDIX
                Active is pinging back something big... it's
                enormous!  Coming up right under us.

                                DEMARCO
                Where?

EXT. BENTHIC EXPLORER AND OCEAN                                         243

A depression appears in the surface of the sea a hundred yards off, not
swirling down like a whirlpool, just dimpling down.

It gets wider.  Deeper.  Rapidly becomes a yawning pit.

The ocean is OPENING.

Now the surface is churned by turbulence.  Slow massive roils of tremendous
power boil up from the depths.

McBride leads a mass exodus onto the deck to see better.

The open becomes a roaring maw a hundred yards across.

The ships are like toys on the shimmering rim of the maelstrom.

SOMETHING RISES IN THE CENTER OF THE OPENING.  A massive spire.  Smoothly
curving and iridescent.  Off the starboard beam, a quarter mile away, another
spire rises.  Tons of seawater fall from its sides with a THUNDEROUS ROAR, the
energy of Niagara.

Off the port bow... another spire.

And another, beyond the destroyer Albany, dwarfing it.

Six towers... plus one larger, in the center.  Rising.

One the Explorer's deck, a shadow engulfs them as the nearest spire blocks out
the sun.  The air, the sea, the deck... all vibrate with the THUNDER OF
CREATION.

And now for the payoff shot:  WE'RE HIGH, LOOKING DOWN.  THE SPIRES FORM A
PERFECT RING A MILE ACROSS.  A VAST DARK FORM, LIKE A GREAT SHADOW, RISES FROM
THE DEPTHS BENEATH THE SHIPS.  THE SPIRES ARE CONNECTED.  IT IS ALL ONE.

THE NTI ARK.

It surfaces with slow majesty, gently beaching all the ships on its broad
back.  We recognize it as the structure into which Bud was led by the angelic
being, which we assumed was a city.  The Explorer rocks gently on its flat
hull, clunking massively to one side as it settles.

The bridge crew watch millions of tons of seawater streaming off the back of
the vast, slightly curved hull.  The missile cruiser rocks back and forth
nearby, high and dry... its prop whining futility.

ON EXPLORER'S DECK, McBride, Bendix, DeMarco, the rest of the Navy
contingent... they're all standing there open-mouthed, in a dream-like daze.
Touched by the hand of God.

                                BENDIX
                Look...

WHAT THEY SEE -- Fifty yards away, between them and the Albany, sits Deepcore
Two.  It looks like a particularly ugly and unwanted toy, sitting on the
glistening plain of the NTI Ark's hull.

CLOSER, ON TRIMODULE C, as the hatch at the bottom opens.

Catfish's feet appear, bicycling.  He swings down to the pearlescent 'deck'.
Stands there blinking in the sunlight, mole-like.  Jammer plonks down behind
him.  He turns, lifts Lindsey down.  Hippy, Sonny, and the rest, emerge into
the light of the sun.  A deliverance from the blackest night they will ever
know.

                                LINDSEY
                We should be dead.  We didn't decompress.

                                CATFISH
                Out blood oughta be fizzin' like a warm, shook-
                up Coke.

                                HIPPY
                They must've done something to us.

Lindsey has tears streaming down her cheeks... for the sun, for life, for
their deliverance and the larger one she knows has happened, an epiphany for
the whole human race.

                                LINDSEY
                Oh, yes.  I think you could say that.

She blinks.  Seeing something not far away.  She gives a little laugh, or
something between laughing and crying.

REVERSE, as Bud walks up the curving incline of one of the mouth-like
enterances to the NTI structure.  His suit is casually unzipped and the FBS
helmet dangles from one hand jauntily.

She starts toward him.  Breaks into a run.  Then stops a few feet from him.
Watching him come to her.

His smile, his eyes illuminating her.

He stops and she touches him, lightly.  Is this real?

The look at each other, wonderingly a moment.

Then laugh.  She sniffs loudly.

                                LINDSEY
                Hello, Brigman.

                                BUD
                Hello, Mrs. Brigman.

Their lips meet.

                                                                CUT TO BLACK

		Re:  Project Sawtooth

FADE IN:

EXT.  SMALL TEXAS TOWN - DAY	1

Beside a 1950 Ford, a quartet of elite intellectuals poses 
playfully...dressed in the local custom of boots and cowboy hats, the 
TOW ORIENTAL MEN, A CAUCASIAN MAN, AND A CAUCASIAN WOMAN squint into 
the hot sun and then down at the jiggling home movie camera, the 
operator lopsided...

NARRATOR
The advent of the Soviet nuclear capability ushers in a dangerous phase 
of the Cold War as the decade of the 1950s looms.  Stung by this Soviet 
challenge and the rapid race to develop ever more sophisticated 
weapons, the United States resurrects maverick Professor Toichi 
Hikita's work in electromagnetic particle acceleration...despite the 
dismal record of failure that has dogged the project.

TOICHI HIKITA, one of the group, walks forward, taking the CAMERA from 
its present operator, a four-year-old child...A LITTLE BOY IN CHAPS AND 
COWBOY HAT who now joins the other adults, in particular Caucasian 
woman and the elder Oriental man who pick him up and hug him...

NARRATOR
Doctor Masado Banzai, preeminent Japanese quantum theorist, declares 
himself anxious to work for the Allies.  Enamored of the great American 
West, Banzai sires a precocious son and tags the tiny child "Buckaroo."  
A tribute to his adopted homeland.

EXT.  TEST SITE - DAY	2

A strange TWO-MAN SPEED VEHICLE readies for takeoff...the FIRST "PILOT" 
in the cockpit Dr. Banzai himself:

NARRATOR
And thus given a second chance after his secret pre-war laboratory 
disaster at Princeton, Doctor Hikita finds new life at the Texas School 
of Mines, where he assembles a team of crack scientists willing to 
gamble he's right in his bold assertion that man can indeed pass 
unharmed through solid matter.

The SECOND "PILOT," a fair-haired Caucasian:	3

NARRATOR
Sir Alan Motley of Cambridge, a brainy, affable limey, co-developer 
with Whitehead and Lord Russell of the world's most advanced 
theoretical gravity catapult...

	4
The fourth scientist, the female Caucasian, busy with last-minute 
details, securing the two pilots in their seats, checking their 
instrument data, writing on a clipboard...

NARRATOR
Dr. Sandra Banzai, Texas-born pioneer in Negative Mass Propulsion 
...wife of Dr. Masado Banzai.

...as the four-year-old BUCKAROO BANZAI now approaches the speed 
machine and gives his father a good-bye kiss...Dr. Banzai saying 
something to the boy, Buckaroo bowing respectfully, as his father and 
mother exchange last-minute assurances...

The cockpit canopy comes down, and Sandra Banzai tugs a reluctant 
little Buckaroo toward a sandbagged shelter...

EXT.  SANDBAGS - DAY	5

...where Professor Hikita sits at a bank of monitoring equipment, 
Sandra Banzai and Buckaroo entering the enclosure as...

...A SUDDEN NOISE causes Sandra Banzai to turn in fear, the bizarre 
speed machine's motors whining at an astonishing rpm, BLINDING GREEN 
FLAMES ENGULFING ITS COCKPIT...

EXT.  TEST SITE - DAY	6

...Sandra Banzai rushing toward the sheet-metal vehicle through SMOKE 
AND GREEN FLAME as her husband and Sir Alan both struggle to get out...

	7
...Buckaroo running after his mother who attempts to help the 
scientists free themselves when suddenly the child is thrown to the 
ground and protected by Professor Hikita's own body...as the 
experimental car VAPORIZES IN A FLASH OF EMERALD GREEN LIGHT!  THE 
SCREEN GOING WHITE, A LAUNCH COUNTDOWN BEGINNING UNDER A SOMBER CARD:

TODAY
THIRTY YEARS LATER

VOICE OF MISSION CONTROL
T Minus five hundred and counting.  Phaser positive.  Latch compressor.

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	8

CLOSE ON AN OLDER, WISER PROFESSOR HIKITA:

PROF. HIKITA
Power source output, zero-zero-niner.  Multi-stage axial compressor 
latched.

EXT.  JET CAR - PROVING GROUNDS - DAY	9

One hundred yards from a concrete blockhouse, a SERIES OF MYSTERIOUS 
CLOSEUPS of an UNUSUAL STRATEGIC AUTOMOBILE sitting ready to roll, as 
TECHNICIANS in asbestos suites fill its tanks with HIGHLY FLAMMABLE 
FUEL.

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	10

PROF. HIKITA
Fuel pressure, 1800 torrs.  Oxygenation.

...amid television screens, monitoring devices...an elite assortment of 
GOVERNMENT VIPS, MILITARY MEN, AND NEWS MEDIA REPRESENTATIVES standing 
by...

	11
...one such observer, GENERAL CATBURD, an AIDE approaching, whispering 
unpleasant news in his ear...

GENERAL CATBURD
You're kidding. Where is he?  Still in the hospital? 

The aide shrugging, the General leaning over to a nervous man sitting 
next to him...SECRETARY OF DEFENSE McKINLEY.

GENERAL CATBURD
Banzai hasn't showed yet, Mr. Secretary. Looks like he's got cold feet.

Another angle.  Two of Buckaroo's men, RENO and PERFECT TOMMY, sitting 
with their boots on a computer console.

PERFECT TOMMY
Better see what's keepin' the boss, Reno.

RENO
Why me?

...an attractive NETWORK TV ANCHORWOMAN headed this way...

PERFECT TOMMY
'Cause I'm busy.  And get your clodhoppers off the UNIVAC.

INT.  OPERATING ROOM - DAY	13

THE EYES OF DOCTOR BUCKAROO BANZAI, THE REST OF HIS FACE HIDDEN BY A 
SURGICAL MASK...such concentration.

INT.  SURGICAL SCRUB ROOM - DAY	14

...a phone ringing, a NURSE answering it, then:

NURSE
Rawhide, it's for you.

Jacketless, A SINISTER PISTOL visible in the tooled leather shoulder 
holster, RAWHIDE takes the receiver.

RAWHIDE
I'll ask him.
(into his Go-Fone)
Buckaroo, I need an estimate.  They're getting antsy over at Mission 
Control.

INT.  OPERATING ROOM - DAY	15

Buckaroo Banzai speaks into his GO-FONE:

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Another ten minutes down here, Rawhide.

REVEALING DOCTOR BANZAI, the great surgeon, surrounded by a well-oiled 
team of physicians and nurses...his steady, miraculously skilled hands 
working a LASER KNIFE on the brain of a PATIENT sitting clamped in a 
serious chair.

INT.  SURGICAL SCRUB ROOM - DAY	16

RAWHIDE
(into phone)
The chief needs ten more minutes.  I got the chopper waiting.  Don't 
start without us.

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	17

Perfect Tommy still leaning back in his swivel chair, smiling at the 
blonde TV anchorwoman, waiting for her CAMERAMAN to set up...

TV ANCHORWOMAN
So where's Buckaroo?

PERFECT TOMMY
(a wry smile)
Whadda you need Buckaroo for?

The anchorwoman catching his drift, smiling, knowing Perfect Tommy 
perhaps intimately...Perfect Tommy glancing across the crowded room at 
Reno raising ten fingers...

PERFECT TOMMY
Unscheduled surgery.  He'll be waltzing along momentarily.  What're you 
doing tonight?

TV ANCHORWOMAN
(picking up his hat)
Flying to Cambodia.

Perfect Tommy frowning severely as she tried on his Stetson, the 
anchorwoman promptly getting the message and putting it back down.

PERFECT TOMMY
That's why I wear a fifty dollar hat.  Was a two hundred dollar hat, I 
hadda kill you.

TV ANCHORWOMAN
Bet you say that to all the girls, Perfect Tommy.

PERFECT TOMMY
Bet I do.

INT.  SURGICAL SCRUB ROOM - DAY	18

Another STAR SURGEON, scrubbing for an operation next door now peeking 
at his wrist watch TV:

CLOSE ON THE TINY TV:  AN IMAGE OF THE JET CAR...	19

ANGLE ON...	20

STAR SURGEON
Jesus Christ...how does the man find enough hours in the day?

RAWHIDE
We help.

The surgeon curious, studying the big TV monitor, Rawhide sensing an 
explanation is in order:

RAWHIDE
Dr. Banzai's using a laser to fuse artificial nerve fiber to the 
original, bypassing massive stroke damage.  A subcutaneous microphone's 
gonna allow the patient to transmit verbal instructions to his own 
brain.

STAR SURGEON
What, like "raise my left arm"?

RAWHIDE
Or "throw the harpoon," depending on cultural differences. People are 
gonna come from all over. This guy's an Eskimo.

INT.  OPERATING ROOM - DAY	21

Buckaroo winding down the surgery.  A BRILLIANT BUT ERRATIC JEWISH 
PHYSICIAN at his side whispering through a mask...

JEWISH PHYSICIAN
Okay...right...okay, I see...next time I'll be able to...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
There may not be a next time.

JEWISH PHYSICIAN
Look...I'm sorry...calling for help in the middle of an operation...but 
I just lost my nerve...I panicked...again.

Buckaroo picking a NIKON up off a table, snapping some pictures of his 
handiwork...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
You've got the God-given tools to be a success in any field of 
endeavor, Dr. Zwibel.  Ever thought about joining me full-time?

JEWISH PHYSICIAN (DR. ZWIBEL)
Are you serious?  Have you have an opening?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Can you sing?

DR. ZWIBEL
A little. I can dance.

Buckaroo glancing at the clock on the wall...

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	22

PROF. HIKITA
Inertial Control positive.  T minus seven zero and resume counting.

MISSION CONTROL
All systems righteous.  Professor Hikita says we have to go.

General Catburd and other VIPS happy to observe on their TV monitors 
the sight of a MAN IN BLACK COMMANDO PARACHUTE SUIT, carrying a 
BATTERED OLD BRIEFCASE, climbing into the cockpit of...THE JET CAR.

INT.  JET CAR - DAY

THE DRIVER'S POV, a curious combination of airplane dials and switches 
and personal touches like a big four-on-the-floor gear shift and a 
snazzy pearlized Brodi knob with snowflakes and a coochi-coochi girl...

	24
ANGLE ON the driver as he removes a strange GRYOSCOPIC DEVICE from his 
briefcase, plugs it into a cradle near his head...

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	25

Professor Hikita standing at a special monitor as a light pops on, 
indicating "Overthruster Armed"....he covers it with a hanky...

EXT.  JET CAR - DAY	26

...all quiet suddenly, the car poised, waiting...

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	27

General Catburd grabbing some coffee and doughnuts...the Secretary of 
Defense peering out through a viewing slot...

GENERAL CATBURD
I've got a budget meeting on the hill, John.  What's this thing 
supposed to do anyway?

SENATOR CUNNINGHAM
Three hundred miles an hour, General.

GENERAL CATBURD
Senator, you are so fulla shit.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
May not...

EXT.  JET CAR - DAY	28

The Jet Car undergoing an amazing transformation:  TWO STABILIZER FINS 
AND A JET ENGINE suddenly appearing on its rear deck...

INT.  JET CAR - DAY	29

CLOSE ON THE DRIVER TO REVEAL BUCKAROO BANZAI, world famous figure in 
every field of endeavor as he withdraws a beautiful KAMIKAZE SCARF from 
his flight suit...wraps it like a warrior's headband around his 
helmet...

	30
ANGLE ON Buckaroo's hand as his fingers flip a row of toggle switches, 
THE PULSATING POWER OF THE JET ENGINE INCREASING DRAMATICALLY with each 
successive switch...the vehicle a caged beast, taunting us, as Buckaroo 
flips the last switch...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Final contact is made.

EXT.  JET CAR - DAY	31

No kidding.  A TWENTY FOOT SHEET OF FIRE ROCKETING FROM THE BACK OF THE 
JET CAR...THEN ANOTHER...THEN ANOTHER...

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	32

The Cavaliers at their monitors, calm...Hikita making minor adjustments 
on his instrument bank...the Secretary of Defense and General Catburd 
both now at viewing slots in the blockhouse wall...

PROF. HIKITA
Point of no return...five, four, three, two...

INT.  JET CAR - DAY	33

PROF. HIKITA'S VOICE
...one.

As Buckaroo Banzai twists his steering-wheel mounted TWIN ACCELERATORS, 
the sudden forward lurch of the Jet Car slamming him back against the 
headrest...

EXT.  PROVING GROUNDS - DAY	34

THE JET CAR BLASTING OFF!  MORE FIRE!  MORE SMOKE!

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	35

Technicians and VIPS eye their monitors.

	36
AND SO DO WE:  the rugged JET CAR raising a cloud of dust, viewed from 
high above us it blasts ahead!

ANGLE ON	37

GENERAL CATBURD
Too bad war ain't Indianapolis.  It's fast, I'll give Banzai that.

SENATOR CUNNINGHAM
Perhaps an idea whose time has come, General?  Scoot over.

Catburd moving aside as Senator Cunningham takes her turn with the 
viewing device.

GENERAL CATBURD
It'll never work.  It's too simple.

INT.  HELICOPTER - DAY	38

HIGH OVERHEAD, manned by a TV NEWS CREW.

	39
AN OVER-THE-CAMERAMAN'S SHOULDER POV as the JET CAR'S EXHAUST TRAIL 
CHOKES THE LANDSCAPE BELOW...

INT.  JET CAR - DAY	40

BUCKAROO'S POV as the highway races underneath him...

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	41

ALL EYES glued to those TV monitors, Rawhide and Reno 
watching...Perfect Tommy slapping his hand on the desk.

TV ANCHORWOMAN
Now twenty seconds downrange...Perfect Tommy, how on earth is Buckaroo 
able to keep that thing on the ground?

PERFECT TOMMY
She's just a damn road hugger, Allison.  Plus the man can drive.

EXT.  PROVING GROUNDS - DAY	42

Talk about a road hugger...the JET CAR SCREAMS PAST A BANK OF HIGH 
SPEED CAMERAS...THE EARTH SHAKING...

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	43

PROF. HIKITA
Approaching thirty seconds downrange Three zero.  Course steady.  Speed 
three one seven nautical-four hundred...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
He's gonna do it!  The man is gonna do it!

GENERAL CATBURD
So what?  Big deal.  Anybody can drive fast in a straight line.

INT.  JET CAR - DAY	44

...as if in response to Catburd's comment, Buckaroo does an amazing 
thing, NOW FLICKING HIS DIRECTIONAL SIGNAL...

EXT.  JET CAR - DAY	45

LEAVING THE PAVED SURFACE FOR OPEN TERRAIN!  BEGIN INTERCUTTING 
BLOCKHOUSE AND JET CAR...

INT.  JET CAR - DAY	46

A FIRE breaking out on a dashboard gauge, Buckaroo quickly snuffing the 
SPARKS with his gloved hand...DANGER LIGHTS FLASHING!

EXT.  JET CAR - DAY	47

...as AWESOME PHYSICAL PRESSURES take their tool on car and driver...

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	48

PROF. HIKITA
Buckaroo, do you read?

MISSION CONTROL
Advise you abort.  Over.  Repeat: advise abort.

INT.  JET CAR - DAY	49

BUCKAROO BANZAI
That's a big "no can do".

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE- DAY	50

Buckaroo's voice through STATIC AND CRACKLE.  Professor Hikita white-
knuckled...determined.

INT.  JET CAR - DAY	51

Buckaroo STILL ACCELERATING, struggling with his mighty 
machine...fierce vibrations, OIL AND SMOKE filling the cockpit...as he 
wipes hot oil off his goggles...

INT.  HELICOPTER - DAY	52

In the NETWORK HELICOPTER, a NEWSMAN and CAMERMAN catch this shocking 
turn of events:

	53
THEIR POV OF...the JET CAR flaming along across the desert.  A SONIC 
BOOM!

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	54

A TV MONITOR...A HELICOPTER SHOT revealing that the course thus far 
traveled by Buckaroo is ON FIRE, the ground literally set ablaze by the 
incredible speed of his JET CAR:

ANGLE ON:	55

TV ANCHORWOMAN
The Jet Car off the road!  Radio contact with Mission Control here 
severed...that firestorm apparently interfering with 
communications...Buckaroo Banzai in serious trouble.

GENERAL CATBURD
Either that or he's popped his cookies.

Professor Hikita, on pins and needles, face taught, concerned.

MISSION CONTROL
Mach 1.  Buckaroo!  Do you read?  Commence braking procedure!  Over!

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
He's heading for the goddamn mountains!

MISSION CONTROL
Eject, Buckaroo! EJECT!

Buckaroo heard faintly in a STORM OF NOISE...SPEAKING JAPANESE...

SENATOR CUNNINGHAM
Professor Hikita, what'd he say?

PROF. HIKITA
(quizzical)
He said, "This Bud's for you, Professor."  What does that mean?

	56
ON THE MONITORS the JET CAR is seen heading directly into a box canyon 
and TOWARD A WALL OF MOUNTAINS, impact virtually assured.

ANGLE ON:	57

GENERAL CATBURD
Looks like Banzai's finally gonna get more than he bargained for.  And 
take the friends of the Earth with him.

Rawhide and Reno exchanging very concerned glances...

INT.  JET CAR - DAY	58

Buckaroo Banzai peers out his thick glass window.

BUCKAROO'S POV:  THE SIDE OF A MOUNTAIN CLOSING FAST...	59

MISSION CONTROL
It's off my scope!

GENERAL CATBURD
What the devil?  What is going on?!

INT.  JET CAR	67

BUCKAROO'S COCKPIT POV... like a roller coaster ride through a meteor 
shower - THE EIGHTH DIMENSION, AN ORGANIC ASTEROID HURTLING RIGHT AT US 
EMITTING STRANGE STATIC ELECTRICAL CHARGES...MONSTROUS...RED...GHASTLY!

	68
REVERSE ANGLE.  Looking directly at Buckaroo as his face distorts under 
God-knows-how-many G-forces...where the hell is he?!  His plexiglas 
visor shattering as if hit with a two-by-four.

COCKPIT POV...Buckaroo's windshield CRACKLING AND THE COCKPIT TURNING 
RED.	69

(in apoplexy)
He's through it!  He's gone through the mountain without a scratch!  
Oh, my God!  Oh, my God in Heaven!

filled JET CAR.

EXT.  JET CAR - DAY	76

A parachute popping out its back, at once ripping off in the high 
velocity wind...

INT.  JET CAR - DAY	77

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Chute negative.  I'm gonna try and lay her sideways.

ANOTHER ANGLE as he reaches for the hand brake and simultaneously spins 
his Brodi knob hard to the right!

EXT.  MIDDLE OF NOWHERE - DAY	79

Buckaroo doing the impossible, somehow bringing the racing JET CAR to a 
spinning, skidding halt in a thicket of dry brush!  AS OVERHEAD THAT 
NETWORK HELICOPTER CIRCLES...

EXT.  JET CAR - DAY	80

The battered JET CAR, exhausting smoke, Buckaroo rolling its window 
down, opening the door and emerging, checking the damage to his 
vehicle, noting a STRANGE GELATINOUS SUBSTANCE on the cracked 
windshield, touching it and turning his nose from the smell...his glove 
steaming!

THE NEWS COPTER LANDING IN THE DISTANCE.	81

	82
ANGLE ON Buckaroo as he lowers himself under the Jet Car, coming face-
to-face with one ugly SPHERICAL PARASITE, THE THING SUDDENLY SHOOTING 
OUT at Buckaroo as he's about to touch it...A MOBILE PHONE starting to 
BEEP back in the cockpit...the PARASITE coming to rest on the 
ground...dead?

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	83

Pandemonium, people cheering...General Catburd on the phone...

GENERAL CATBURD
This his frequency?  Nobody's home.

EXT.  JET CAR - DAY	84

Buckaroo ignoring the phone, taking his lunch bag from the front seat 
and removing a sandwich, taking a bite of it, and using the foil to 
pick up the BIZARRE PARASITE from the desert floor...wrapping the weird 
thing up...now at last reaching for the car phone...

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	85

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
(Taking the phone)
Gimme that!  You tell me, Buckaroo, what in the hell is this going-
through-solid-matter-and rendering-all-conventional-defense-perimeters-
useless-over-night bullshit?

But now Professor Hikita snatching the phone from the Secretary, 
turning his back to the room!

PROF. HIKITA
Buckaroo!  Did you seem them?  Did you?

EXT.  JET CAR - DAY	86

Buckaroo leaning in to check his gauges, talking on his telephone.  TWO 
FIGURES from the news copter approaching, still a hundred yards off...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
See 'em?  They about had me and the whole damn car for breakfast.  
Broke my windshield...

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	87

PROF. HIKITA
(into phone)
The creatures?  They attacked you?  They tried to possess you?

GENERAL CATBURD
Creatures?
(grabbing the phone)
Buckaroo, Catburd here.  I got egg all over my face, but that's okay.  
No room for egos here.  We're all Americans and I wanna buy that thing 
of yours.  What's it gonna run me?

PROF. HIKITA
Not for sale.

GENERAL CATBURD
I wasn't talking to you, Hikita san.

...as the Secretary of Defense picks up a RED PHONE...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
This'll be the President of me?

Perfect Tommy and Reno suddenly stepping forward, intimidating 
Catburd...

PERFECT TOMMY
She's not for sale, right, General?

INT.  HOME FOR CRIMINALLY INSANCE - DAY	88

CLOSE ON the haunting, unsettling eyes of DOCTOR LIZARDO, AN ORANGE-
HAIRED OLD MAN watching NETWORK FOOTAGE of the Jet Car Test on his 
battered Philco TV set...his eyes practically burning a whole through 
the screen...

...PULLING BACK TO REVEAL a room in an insane asylum, a room designed 
for several inmates but occupied by only one, this crazy old 
fiend...the empty beds piled with books and Italian memorabilia, the 
walls covered with mathematical equations...

	89
ANGLE ON Dr. Lizardo even now unable to resist scribbling another 
formula on the wall with a piece of chalk...

CLOSE ON PHILCO:	90

ANCHORWOMAN ON TV
Here she is, slowed down.  Lookit there...slam!  Right into the side of 
that mountain!  Perfect Tommy, Rawhide, Reno, you guys're the Hong Kong 
Cavaliers. Buckaroo's most trusted inner circle.  So I gotta ask, did 
it surprise you fellas as much as the rest of us when the BJV, the 
experimental jet vehicle went right off the scope and apparently smack 
into a black void?

PERFECT TOMMY ON TV
Nope.

ANCHORWOMAN ON TV
Was Buckaroo acting different this morning, I mean, in terms of other 
mornings?

The Cavaliers rolling their eyes, looking at one another...

RAWHIDE ON TV
Well, we partied pretty late last night.

	91
BACK TO Dr. Lizardo now hearing footsteps outside in the corridor, and 
HIS LEFT AHND, ACTING INDEPENDENTLY OF HIS RIGHT, ERASES THE EQUATION 
HE'S JUST WRITTEN...as his right hand reaches under his pillow and 
picks up a crude HOMEMADE ELECTROMAGNET...a piece of metal wrapped in 
copper wire, one end of which is a small loop that Lizardo now attaches 
directly to his thumbs...

DOCTOR LIZARDO
(muttering)
The Overthruster! The Overthruster! 

Lizardo looking back at his equation, at first puzzled to find it 
erased, then becoming angry.

	92
CLOSE ON HIS HAND NOW STICKING THE OTHER END OF HIS HOME-MADE DEVICE 
DIRECTLY INTO AN ELECTIRCAL SOCKET...

ANGLE ON:	93

DOCTOR LIZARDO
(obsessed)
The Overthruster! 

ELECTRICAL CURRENT COURSING THROUGH LIZARDO'S BODY...AN AURA 
SURROUNDING HIM AS HIS LIPS CURL INTO A HIDEOUS SMILE...BURNING THE 
SCREEN, TAKING US INTO AN ASTOUNDING FLASHBACK SEQUENCE:

INT.  STRANGE LABORATORY - NIGHT	94

Forty-six years prior (years before the ill-fated primitive speed car 
run involving Buckaroo's parents) an unlikely experiment in a strange 
factory...A RUNWAY...a much younger, dark-haired Doctor Lizardo being 
strapped into a homemade wicker chair/rocket sled by two LAB 
ASSISTANTS, the entire contraption set up like a catapult AIMED 
DIRECTLY AT A LOSID BRICK WALL, THROBBING ELECTROMAGNETS AND BANKS OF 
GLOWING OSCILLATORS...

	95
ANOTHER ANGLE...and peering into an unusual periscope, an equally 
JUVENILE PROFESSOR HIKITA wearing glasses and scraggly 
goatee...standing in front of a 1938 calendar on the wall, today's 
eagerly awaited date circled in red...

PROF. HIKITA
Almost ready, Dr. Lizardo...almost...

Doctor Lizardo pulling on a leather helmet, Professor Hikita nodding 
grimly at the LAB ASSISTANTS who tug on a GIANT LEVER...the 
ELECTROMAGNETS PULSATING...

DOCTOR LIZARDO
More!  More!

PROF. HIKITA
Not so fast...

	96
ANGLE ON Doctor Lizardo pulling a switch, UNLEASHING HIS WICKER CHAIR 
AT A FANTASTIC SPEED down the rails!

	97
AT THE END OF THE TRACK...the strange device coming to an abrupt and 
total stop ten feet from the brick wall, pitching Lizardo forward 
and...

	98
...through the wall, at least partially, the seemingly solid bricks 
turning out to be more like vertical QUICKSAND...Lizardo half in, half 
out, physically unhurt but screaming his head off...

	99
...the assistants rushing down the runway to help pry him loose, while 
Professor Hikita observes an astonishing thing through his periscope.

	100
PERISCOPE POV:  HUGE GROTESQUE RED CREATURES IN AN AURA OF ELECTRICITY 
TRYING TO PULL DOCTOR LIZARDO TOWARD THEM...ONE CREATURE IN PARTICULAR 
ENVELOPING LIZARDO!

	101
BACK TO...the doctor's assistants frantically tugging on his feet, 
dragging him back into the room only to find this SUDDENLY ORANGE-
HAIRED LIZARDO a fearsome, changed individual...a beast!

	102
CLOSE ON LIZARDO!  A terrifying scream issues from his mouth as he 
straightens up, at last wrenching free of the wicker chair, smashing 
his two assistants' heads together as he jumps over the runway!  Hikita 
watching wild-eyed as Lizardo makes a mad dash into the vast shadowy 
expanse of the factory...

	103
A DISTANT VIEW OF LIZARDO as he rips a door off its hinges, escaping 
into the night, SILHOUTTED AGAINST A DAZZLING SECURITY LIGHT, THE 
SCREEN BURNING WHITE...OUR FLASHBACK ENDING.

INT.  LIZARDO'S ROOM - NIGHT	104

Nearly half a century later, the elderly Lizardo regards with 
smoldering evil the turn of the key in his own door and the appearance 
of a GUARD who comes in and unplugs his TV set.

GUARD
Cheer up, Lizardo, it's Friday.  I come for your TV.  You been using 
too damn much juice...ten thousand kilowatts again this month.  Beats 
me how one old homicidal loony could use that much power.

The guard leaving with Lizardo's TV...Lizardo trying to control 
himself, his eyes rolling up at the ceiling where yet another UNUSUAL 
EQUATION has been scrawled in an angry hand.

DOCTOR LIZARDO
I want my TV...don't take my TV...I want it.  I want the Overthruster.  
I want it.

INT.  NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT	105

Mysterious half-light...CLOSEUPS...plugs and jacks...a portion of an 
upright base...drums with the BANZAI LOGO writ large...hands and feet 
putting everything together as an unseen audience stirs restlessly...

INT.  DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT	106

Backstage in a small dressing room, the rock band known as the Hong 
Kong Cavaliers waits to go on...three unidentified GROUPIES in 
attendance as Rawhide naps and Reno tunes his saxophone while Perfect 
Tommy answers the questions of a FEMALE REPORTER from the local 
underground press...

Professor Hikita meantime at a corner table, studying his big notebook, 
examining a pair of KODAK SLIDES...

...as there is the sound of a commotion in the corridor, EXCITED VOICES 
and FOOT TRAFFIC coming this way, Rawhide methodically counting down 
under his Stetson:

RAWHIDE
Five...four...three...two...one.

	107
The door to the dressing room opening precisely on the count of one, 
admitting an out-of-breath and hastily tuxedoed Buckaroo Banzai, A 
SMALL CROWD OF ASSORTED FEMAL FANS locked outside.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I'm starving...somebody, help.

RAWHIDE
Got a half a tuna sandwich.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Same one you had yesterday?

Rawhide taking a half-eaten sandwich out of his hat and tossing it to 
Buckaroo...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Smells fermented.
(taking a big bite)
Check in with the Institute, Reno, see if everything's kosher.

PROF. HIKITA
Buckaroo, I've done an advanced spectrograph analysis on the specimen 
you pulled off the Jet Car drive shaft.

RENO
And there's a two-hundred-dollar deductible we have to eat on that 
crack in her windshield.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Figures.  Anybody seen my scope?

PERFECT TOMMY
Coming right up, Buckaroo.

Perfect Tommy producing a highly sophisticated SLIDE VIEWER...Buckaroo 
slipping in a transparency.

	108
HIS POV OF A COLORFUL PRISMATIC GRAPH over the backdrop of A NAKED 
WOMAN.

	109
Buckaroo immediately diagnosing the problem and removing the naked-
woman slide from the viewer...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Anybody we know?

PERFECT TOMMY
Who put this dirty picture in Buckaroo's viewer?

Rawhide reclaiming his raunchy slide, Buckaroo looking back into the 
sleek device...

PROF. HIKITA
I ran it through the centrifuge, but I came up blank.  It's definitely 
dead now, although it still conducts electricity even better than 
copper does.

PERFECT TOMMY
Super performance organic material.

PROF. HIKITA
Yes, Perfect Tommy, in a way.  However...
(slipping in another slide)
...notice...although certain components resist identification, it 
corresponds very closely to an ordinary praying mantis.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
(scrutinizing)
Too closely.  Gotta be more than sheer coincidence.  Rawhide, you're 
keen on bugs.  What do you think?

Rawhide takes a look as Reno hangs the phone up...

RENO
Everything's copacetic at the Institute, Buckaroo.  Sam's with the Jet 
Car and she's under lock and key.  He's retiming her valves.

Buckaroo nodding, as he's interrupted by Perfect Tommy who's now 
brought over the female reporter...

PERFECT TOMMY
Buckaroo, you got a minute--?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Not really.  This is pretty important.

PERFECT TOMMY
She wants a picture.

Perfect Tommy quickly taking a place beside Buckaroo, smiling into the 
camera, as Reno and Rawhide exchange disgusted looks...

	110
...the shutter clicking...another commotion in the hallway...the 
dressing room door opening to admit the club owner, ARTIE DUNCAN, a 
fifty-year-old rocker who has to struggle to close the door behind him 
on a herd of REPORTERS and FANS...

ARTIE DUNCAN
I don't care who you are...when you play my joint, you're just another 
band. I want some music outta you characters.

RENO 
You want it, Artie? You got it.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Everybody ready?  How do we look?  Do we look okay?

PERFECT TOMMY
I look great.  Let's rock 'n' roll.

A pair of no-nonsense BLUE SHIELD IRREGULARS appearing to escort them 
on-stage...as Rawhide returns the spectroscope to Professor Hikita...

RAWHIDE
No question about it.  Something very akin to arachnoid tissue.  If I 
hadda guess?  A mutated species.

INT.  BACKSTAGE - NIGHT	111

Buckaroo, the Hong Kong Cavaliers, and their two Blue Shield escorts 
hustling down a corridor.

INT.  NIGHTCLUB STAGE - NIGHT	112

Our boys arriving on stage...SHADOWY FORMS in the dramatically murky 
light...a FAMILIAR VOICE BOOMING OVER THE P.A. SYSTEM...

ARTIE DUNCAN'S VOICE
Ladies and gentlemen, Artie's Artery is proud to present, for one night 
only...the one, the only, the amazing Buckaroo Banzai and his Hong Kong 
Cavaliers!

LIGHTS UP!  AND A WAVE OF GOOD OLD FASHIONED ROCK 'N' ROLL CRASHES OUT 
ON THE AUDIENCE, Buckaroo on lead guitar, joining the Hong Kong 
Cavaliers in a number so primal your feet just won't sit still!

	113
...while at the rear of the room, seated by herself, we find an 
ATTRACTIVE YOUNG LADY...crying, for some reason exempt from the general 
raucous good will.  She pours herself another drink, but booze won't do 
the job.  She's all alone.  She needs some help.  Her name is PENNY 
PRIDDY.

	114
On-stage Buckaroo Banzai suddenly stops moving, stops singing and waves 
the Cavaliers to cease as well.  EERIE STILLNESS, the only sound 
Buckaroo's lips on the silver mike.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I heard somebody crying.
(no response)
I said is someone out there crying in the darkness?

Yes, indeed...Penny's voice, weakly:	115

PENNY PRIDDY
Here...here at the back. I'm sorry...

	116
Buckaroo squints, spots her.  His voice comes mighty over the PUBLIC 
ADDRESS SYSTEM.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Raise your hand...where?

PENNY PRIDDY
(raising her hand)
This is so embarrassing...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Somebody get her a mike? Can we manage that?  And a spotlight.  What's 
your name?

PENNY PRIDDY
Penny.  I'd rather not reveal my last name or my age.

For reasons out of their control, Penny's name coming across to 
Buckaroo and the Cavaliers as "Peggy," said name immediately eliciting 
a surprised reaction from the Cavaliers...

...Buckaroo amazed as well...a not-too-distant pain deep in his soul 
momentarily manifesting itself, although he makes a brave attempt at 
nonchalance...as now Penny is given that microphone.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Did you say..."Peggy"?

PENNY PRIDDY
My name is Penny. Penny Priddy.  There I've said it, but it won't mean 
anything to you.  I'm a nobody.

The business of the names settled, Buckaroo and the Cavaliers breathing 
a bit more easily...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Nobody's a nobody.  Why're you crying?  What's wrong?

PENNY PRIDDY
(blowing her nose)
Did I say anything was wrong? I just sponged up a little too much Vat 
69, okay? I'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town, I can't get my 
luggage outta hock 'cause I met this jerk who said he was a record 
producer when all he had was a record.  He offered to set me up for 
life, and like a fool, well, I...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
He offered you money?

PENNY PRIDDY
Do I look like that kinda girl?
(to tell the truth)
I lost my room this morning.  I don't know where I'm gonna sleep 
tonight, but I keep going.  What the hell else can I do?  I've still 
got my figure, and like this bozo said, as long as there's a sidewalk, 
I'll always have a job.

A few snickers...BUCKAROO shooting a disapproving look at those guilty 
of laughing at another person's misfortune...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Remember it's always darkest just before the dawn.  Believe me, I've 
been there.

Buckaroo moving to a piano...starting to play...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
This song's for Peggy.  And all you others out there a little down on 
your luck.

PENNY PRIDDY
(exasperated)
My name's, Penny!  But who cares?

	117
Buckaroo and his men start to SING ANOTHER TUNE...slower, sexier.

	118
...and Penny opens HER BIG CLEAR PLASTIC PURSE, removes first a dog-
earned paperback entitled Beyond the Realm of Atomic Particles and 
Massless Photons, by Buckaroo Banzai...then a BUCKAROO BANZAI COMIC 
BOOK, its cover depicting Buckaroo locked in mortal combat with HANOI 
SHAN, THE MANCHU TERROR!  Penny lays both publications on the table, 
continues to dig around, revealing next a SHINY SMALL-CALIBER AUTOMATIC 
PISTOL...

	119
ON STAGE...as Buckaroo pours it on, looking in her direction...	

	120
Penny takes the gun from her purse and lays it in her lap, tears 
starting to flood her eyes...

	121
BUCKAROO CROONING, all the women enraptured by his voice, his sultry 
glance, his animal presence...a real heart-breaker.

	122
Penny takes another drink, wraps her hand around the tiny pearl 
handle...SLOWLY MOVING THE GUN...

	123
ON STAGE, Buckaroo startled...	

	124
...as in the blink of an eye Penny ATTEMPTS TO SHOOT HERSELF, her arm 
accidentally deflected by a passing WAITRESS, the SHOT going harmlessly 
into the ceiling as...

	125
...the crack Hong Kong Cavaliers whip out their GUNS, snapping back 
hammers, forming a human barricade around Buckaroo...

	126
...while BLUE SHIELD SECURITY MEN materialize and drag Penny screaming 
from the room.

PENNY PRIDDY
Let me go, let me go, you creeps...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Everybody okay up here?

ARTIE DUNCAN'S VOICE
Arrest the girl!  Let's get this thing on the road, huh?

	127
The Cavaliers holstering their weapons, resuming musical 
postures...Buckaroo too...but his mind still half on Penny Priddy.

INT.  CRIMINALLY INSANCE COORIDOR - NIGHT	128

Recreation time.  SEVERAL MADMEN playing video games, content.

Doctor Lizardo's Philco TV now sitting on a watch desk, the guard who 
took it eating dinner, leaning back in his chair, his feet on the 
set...so he can bash it now and then to improve the picture 
quality...as a SHADOW falls across him...Doctor Lizardo...pulling a 
RATTY SUITCASE on tiny travel wheels, wearing an ANCIENT SPORTJACKET.  
Out for a stroll?

GUARD
Where do you think you're going, doc? The moon?

	129
An amazing thing occurring, as Lizardo's right arm rockets out an 
catches the astonished guard around the throat, lifting him off the 
floor, Lizardo's left hand picking up the telephone...

DR. LIZARDO
Operator! I wanna place a person-to-person call to John Bigboote, 
Yoyodyne Propulsions Systems.  Grover's Mill, New Jersey. Tell him it's 
John Whorfin calling. That's W-H-O-R-F-I-N. Got it, honey? John! J-O-H-
N!

Lizardo waiting for the call to go through as he strangles the last 
breath of air out of the helpless guard, drops him to the linoleum, 
reaching for the dead man's keys...

DR. LIZARDO
(into phone)
Of course it's me, John Bigboote, you fool! Prepare for my return!  The 
time has come.  Haven't you heard? Don't you watch TV? Banzai and 
Hikita have done it! I'll meet you at the factory.  Get that 
overthruster!  And the little Jap!  Alive!  Banzai's too dangerous.

Lizardo ripping the phone out of the wall, hurling it across the 
room...

...those inmates playing their video games fleeing like rabbits when 
they see that...Lizardo obviously no ordinary lunatic, as he proves by 
simply reaching out and...

	130
...touching THE BUCKAROO BANZAI VIDEO GAME, instantly shorting it out 
on his way to freedom, suitcase in tow.

INT.  BEDROOM ON BUS - DAY	131

CLOSE ON a newspaper, a banner front page headline announcing the 
amazing Jet Car test...

...and down in a lower corner, A PHOTOGRAPH OF "WOULD-BE-ASSASSIN" 
PENNY PRIDDY being summarily escorted out of Artie's Artery...PULLING 
BACK TO REVEAL...

	132
...a simple steel frame bed, fold-out desk with microscope, scientific 
books everywhere...Buckaroo trying to tie his bowtie, glancing at the 
newspaper propped upon his dresser, that picture of Penny Priddy 
staring back at him...Perfect Tommy and Reno nearby assembling some 
kind of slide show...THE WHOLE ROOM SWAYING MYSTERIOUSLY...

...the two Cavaliers worrying more about Buckaroo than about what 
they're doing, as they fumble the slides, several falling to the 
floor...

PERFECT TOMMY
Pick those up, Reno.

RENO
I didn't drop 'em.

...Perfect Tommy getting up and peeking at the newspaper over 
Buckaroo's shoulder...then returning to Reno...their voices low...

PERFECT TOMMY
It's a spittin' image.

RENO 
Doesn't look anything like her to me.

PERFECT TOMMY
Pictures don't lie.

RENO 
Hell they don't. I met my first wife that way.

PERFECT TOMMY
It's Peggy to these eyes.  Same nose, same hair.  Plus Buckaroo thinks 
so too or else he wouldn't be ready to go make a fool of himself, 
right?

	133
Buckaroo overhearing all of this, of course, as the door opens, Rawhide 
appearing, offering a COMPUTER PRINT-OUT...

RAWHIDE
Hot off the World Watch Wire, Buckaroo. Thought you'd wanna be 
notified. That old pal of the professor's, Dr. Emilio Lizardo?  The one 
you did the brain scan on--?  He killed a guard last night, broke outta 
the Trenton Home for the Criminally Insane, stole a Masarati, totaled 
it a block away.

Buckaroo's expression changing at the mention of the name 
Lizardo...taking the 
print-out.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Then what?

RAWHIDE
Vanished. Thin air.

PERFECT TOMMY
Doctor Lizardo. Wasn't he on TV once?

RENO
You're thinking of Mr. Wizard.  This guy's an eccentric genius.

PERFECT TOMMY
Hey, so was Mr. Wizard.

RAWHIDE
Dr. Lizardo's a raving lunatic, Perfect Tommy, a vicious psychopath 
with crazy eyes and flaming orange hair that once upon a time was mousy 
brown like yours.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Have you warned Professor Hikita?

RAWHIDE
First thing I did.

PERFECT TOMMY
(in the dark)
Why?  What's going on?  Anything I oughta know?  C'mon, Rawhide, spill 
it.

Buckaroo nodding his permission...

RAWHIDE
The professor and Dr. Emilio Lizardo were actually the first to 
discover the Eighth Dimension.  Almost fifty years ago.  Before 
Buckaroo's parents even knew each other.  But there was trouble, a 
rocket catapult failed and Dr. Lizardo got sucked half in, half 
out...when they hauled him back ,he wasn't the same guy.  His hair was 
orange...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
And his soul black as the Ace of Spades.

RAWHIDE
He went on a senseless crime spree, killed a cop during a bank robbery, 
got caught and judged insane.  The professor told us they threw away 
the key.

PERFECT TOMMY
Hey, any lock can be picked.  So what's he up to?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.

Buckaroo heading for the door...Rawhide drawing a receipt book from his 
pocket.

RAWHIDE
And another thing.  Somebody took five bucks outta petty cash without 
signing.

Buckaroo and Reno automatically turning to Perfect Tommy...

PERFECT TOMMY
Wasn't me.  I'd take a hundred, right?

INT.  WORLD WATCH ONE/BUS - DAY	134

...the guys following Buckaroo into an amazing ELECTRONIC NERVE CENTER, 
like the rugged interior of an AWACS, dimly lighted instrument panels 
manned by two BLUE SHIELD TECHNICAL EXPERTS.

RADAR SHEILD ONE
Lookit this, Buckaroo.  Grossly abnormal high-altitude electrostatic 
disturbance over Connecticut.  Fallout from the Jet Car, you think?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Doubt it.  Check NORAD command.  Could be a volcanic ash cloud.  Work 
her up statistically, check it for the next twenty-four hours, then 
shovel the data over to Reno.

INT.  PASSENGER SECTION/BUS - DAY	135

Buckaroo coming through another heavy steel door, and for the first 
time we realize that we just might be on a MOVING BUS...

EXT.  POLICE STATION - ESTABLISHING - DAY	136

BUCKAROO'S BUS pulling up...BUCKAROO BANZAI AND THE HONG KONG CAVALIERS 
emblazoned along its side.

INT.  POLICE STATION - DAY	137

Waiting near the watch desk, Buckaroo's Jewish surgeon buddy, Dr. 
Zwibel...in a thousand-dollars worth of drugstore cowboy gear, a 
Hoppalong Cassidy hat, red alligator boots, listening to the local 
COUNTRY STATION on a suitcase size stereo...

...looking up as Buckaroo, Reno, and Perfect Tommy approach...

DR. ZWIBEL
Howdy, Buckaroo.  Got your message about rendezvousing here.  Barely 
had time to pack my saddlebags.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Sid, welcome aboard.
(shaking hands)
Fellas, meet a medical colleague, Sid Zwibel.  He'll be riding with us 
from now on, so get acquainted while I snoop around.

Buckaroo heading over to the DESK SERGEANT on duty...

RENO
The name's Reno.  This here's Perfect Tommy.

PERFECT TOMMY
Where do you hail from, Doc?

DR. ZWIBEL
(catching on)
New Jersey!

RENO NEVADA
Where's your spurs at?

DR. ZWIBEL
You making fun of me?

PERFECT TOMMY
Reno, how's about you take New Jersey's gear, mosey on over to the bus 
and introduce him to the rest of the hands.

RENO
Why me?

PERFECT TOMMY
Cause Buckaroo needs me here.

Reno picking up Doctor Zwibel's huge stereo and suitcase...

RENO
Follow me, pard'ner.

INT.  CELL - DAY	138

Penny sitting on her bunk, a disheveled mess...depressed, her head 
buried in her hands as Buckaroo arrives.  She sees his reflection in 
the pitiful mirror above her toilet...

PENNY PRIDDY
What're you doing here? Why're you looking at me like that?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I guess 'cause you remind me of someone I once knew, long ago before 
any of this craziness.

PENNY PRIDDY
Go away.  Let me rot?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Who were you really trying to kill last night?

PENNY PRIDDY
You.  Like the papers all say.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Pretty terrible shot.

Silence.  Penny realizing you don't fool this man with the sloppy 
bowtie...coming over to the bars...

PENNY PRIDDY
Was she pretty?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Who?

PENNY PRIDDY
The girl I remind you of.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
She was the Queen of the Netherlands.

PENNY PRIDDY
It's kinda hard this way.

Meaning fixing his tie...which she's trying to do...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I'd turn around, but I'm afraid you'd strangle me.

PENNY PRIDDY
The Netherlands.  Whew, that's a long way from Wyoming.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Wyoming? Not Cody, by any chance?

PENNY PRIDDY
No.  Laramie.  Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that?  Oh, 
right, sure, I forgot: you know everything.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
No, I don't.

Penny taking too long to retie Buckaroo's tie...an excuse to be near 
him...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Having a little trouble with that knot, aren't you?

PENNY PRIDDY
Which?  The one in my throat.

Things really heating up between these two...Buckaroo changing the 
subject...blocking Perfect Tommy's view.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Did you have family there--? A sister?  In Cody?

PENNY PRIDDY
I don't know. I always felt like I did, like there was another me...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Another 'you'?

PENNY PRIDDY
Somewhere.  See I was taken away by the Priddies when I was a baby.  I 
was adopted.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Adopted.  I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit 
me!

PENNY PRIDDY
What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Who does?  It's a crazy mixed-up world.  Just do the best you can with 
what you have...

Buckaroo touching her moist cheek, wiping away a tear.  Perfect Tommy 
and the Desk Sergeant exchanging looks...

PERFECT TOMMY
Running a little late, Buckaroo.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Let her out. In my custody.

PERFECT TOMMY
Let her out?  She's a killer.

Buckaroo and Penny unable to look away from each other.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
No she's not. 

INT.  PRESS CONFERENCE - AFTERNOON	139

REPORTERS, cameras, microphones, and a small audience of VIPS, civilian 
and military, in a large hotel conference room...eyes on the ticking 
clock...examining charts and MODELS OF SUBATOMIC PARTICLES...on the 
dais, Professor Hikita, Secretary of Defense McKinley and Senator 
Cunningham, waiting for Buckaroo.

	140
Over the refreshment table set up for reporters, TWO REDHEADED MEN 
WEARING GLASSES practically FILL THEIR CUPS WITH CUBES OF SUGAR...one 
of their arms ELONGATING (1) for more sugar...THE STRANGE MOVE 
UNNOTICED...

	141
...as the crowd breaks into SPONTANEOUS APPLAUSE and Buckaroo Banzai 
enter, Penny Priddy beside him...the glamorous couple surrounded by the 
Hong Kong Cavaliers.

	142
JOHN O'CONNOR, and JOHN GOMEZ, those two nearsighted REDHEADS with the 
sweet coffee applauding only politely.

	143
Buckaroo taking Penny onto the dais with him, the Cavaliers assuming 
positions of security as...

...Buckaroo sits next to Professor Hikita who shields his remarks from 
what must be easily FIFTY MICROPHONES...

PROF. HIKITA
Rawhide tells me Dr. Lizardo escaped...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
(nodding)
I'm assigning a couple Blue Shields to protect you around the clock, 
just in case.

Professor Hikita removing the OSCILLATION OVERTHRUSTER from his 
battered briefcase and laying it on the table.  Buckaroo taking a sip 
of water...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Thank you for coming.  Before I answer any questions, I think Buckaroo 
owes us all a few explanations for yesterday's antics.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Mr. Secretary...Senator Cunningham, ladies and gentlemen...thirty years 
ago, nearly to this day, my mother and father and Sir Alan Motley, all 
former colleagues of Professor Toichi Hikita at the Texas School of 
Mines, gave their lives for what was considered at the time an insane 
notion: the possibility of contacting alien life... not on another 
planet, but on a simultaneous plane of existence within solid 
matter...life which, before the war, Professor Hikita had actually 
glimpsed while pioneering a highly primitive gravity catapult with 
Doctor Emilio Lizardo.

1st REPORTER
The same Doctor Lizardo that just...?

PROF. HIKITA
One and the same.

	144
SOMEONE ELSE'S NEARSIGHTED POV, PEERING AT THE BACK OF PROFESSOR 
HIKITA'S HEAD THROUGH A CRACK IN THE CURTAINS BEHIND THE DAIS...

	145
John O'Connor and John Gomez at the refreshment table now adding 
several packs of 'Sweet 'n' Low' to their thick coffee as...

ON THE DAIS:	146

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I don't wanna go get too technical here, ladies and gentlemen, but I'm 
talking twister physics.  Quantum Mechanics.  Now you see, now you 
don't.  This table I'm sitting behind?  It appears to be solid matter, 
right?

Buckaroo demonstrating by picking up his plastic water glass, dropping 
it, splashing water left and right as the container naturally bounces 
off the table...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
But in point of fact, the solid parts of this table... the protons, 
quarks, your neutrons and electrons...they comprise only about one 
quadrillionth of its total volume.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Which is not a helluva lot to sink your teeth into.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Exactly.  So the professor here, way back in 1937, figured that if 
solid matter is mostly empty space, a person oughta be able to discover 
a to travel inside things like tables.  And mountains.

PROF. HIKITA
We at the Banzai Institute have at last found that way: an alternating 
gradient synchronizer that softens solid matter by attenuating its 
electroweak forces!

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Which we all know are the forces that tend to pull objects part, right, 
professor?

2nd REPORTER
What about the Pentagon?  The possibility of war in the Eighth 
Dimension, Mr. Secretary?

PENNY PRIDDY
Hey, better there than here, huh?

SOME APPLAUSE, the Secretary of Defense eyeing Penny critically as the 
lights dim...as RADAR SHIELD ONE slips into the room, approaches the 
dais, and the FIRST SLIDE is projected onto the screen...

	147
...the image a murky one...but the outline of a WARSHIP WITH U.S. 
SAILORS ABOARD nonetheless unmistakable...

CLOSE ON:	148

RADAR SHIELD ONE
(a whisper)
The President's calling you, Buckaroo.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
The president of what?

RADAR SHIELD ONE
The President of the United States.

	149
ANOTHER SLIDE, even more graphic, the number on the bow of the ship 
plainly visible...7541.

EVERYONE CAPTIVATED.	150

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Is he still delirious?

RADAR SHIELD ONE
(shrugging)
Can't tell. It's real fuzzy. I patched him through to a pay phone down 
the hall.

PROF. HIKITA
In 1942, a U.S. Navy frigate, number 7541, disappeared on a clear day 
in the North Atlantic. Long thought to have been torpedoed, these 
pictures of 7541 were taken yesterday in the Eighth Dimension.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Now wait a minute here...

PROF. HIKITA
Next transparency, please.

A loud murmur from the audience as the next slide in the projector 
proves to be a remarkable image...

...of AN UPSIDE DOWN SEVENTEENTH CENTURY PIRATE VESSEL.	151

...Buckaroo starting from the table only to be reminded by Penny:	152

PENNY PRIDDY
Buckaroo, don't forget your thruster.

...handing him the OSCILLATION OVERTHRUSTER...Buckaroo declining it...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
You keep an eye on it.

PENNY PRIDDY
Any time. 

EXT.  OUTER SPACE - AFTERNOON	153

Meanwhile, several thousand miles overhead, a HUGE SPIKEY SPACECRAFT 
APPROACHES EARTH...

INT.  SPIKEY SPACECRAFT (FATHER SHIP) - AFTERNOON	154

A mysterious cloud room where BLACK BRRODING CREATURES perch upside 
down and sideways at controls in a smoky, vaporous environment, the 
only illumination EERIE YELLOW LIGHT...THE WALLS BREATHING.

BUCKAROO BANZAI'S VOICE
Mr. President--? You there?

MORE NOISES, THE SOUND OF TELEPHONE SWITCHING EQUIPMENT...

INT.  CORRIDOR - AFTERNOON	155

Back at a pay phone in the corridor, Buckaroo trying to figure out why 
the President doesn't answer. 

RADAR SHIELD ONE
Seemed like a bad connection even back on the bus.  But they used the 
code.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Mr. President--?  Some kind of interference...I can't...

Nothing from the other end except ODD SOUNDING COMPUTER BEEPS and the 
STATIC-LADEN VOICES of several operators...

RAWHIDE
Maybe it's just a prankster. Some computer whiz kid.

RENO
Whoever it was they used the Blue Code, Alpha Clearance.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
(to Radar Shield One)
Go back to the bus and reroute the call.

RAWHIDE
And try the President's private number at the hospital.  Make sure this 
is on the level. We're busy people here.

	156
...when suddenly eerie, inexplicable things begin to occur...ALL HAVING 
TO DO WITH ELECTRICITY...the telephone book scooting closer to 
Buckaroo's fingers as if drawn by a magnet, the pages then turning, 
faster and faster...

	157
...Buckaroo amazed...now the glass phone booth door abruptly slamming 
shut, the phone simultaneously emitting a BIZARRE BUZZ...

	158
...and then Buckaroo gets literally the shock of his life...A MIGHTY 
ELECTRICAL CURRENT PASSING THROUGH THE TELEPHONE...

...AND HURLING HIM OUT INTO THE COORIDOR!	159

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Pencil!  Quick!  Pen!  Anything!

Reno complying, the lights returning to normal, Buckaroo dazed, his 
hand moving automatically, writing on any surface available.

A SPARK flying when he touches the metal-tipped pen to metal!	160

Buckaroo finally settling for his hand, SCRIBBLING NUMBERS ON HIS PALM.
	161

INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM - AFTERNOON	162

PROF. HIKITA
Let me ask you to imagine the Oscillation Overthruster as a 
sophisticated rifle accelerator firing a steady stream of protons at a 
target-in this case a mountain-and the Jet Car as a giant super-
conducting magnet.

The Secretary of Defense fascinated.	163

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Sure, sure, but what about the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Seventh 
Dimensions?

PENNY PRIDDY
(thumbing through her paperback)
I don't guess they matter.  It's like cheesecloth, I think.  Minkowiski 
space...

...as all eyes turn to see a still woozy Buckaroo Banzai returning, 
pointing dramatically at John Gomez and John O'Connor in the 
audience...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
There!  Those two!  Don't panic...

The Cavaliers haven't a clue what he's talking about...

RENO
Whadda you mean, Buckaroo?  Where?  What?

	164
BUCKAROO'S POV...SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY...ACROSS THE ROOM, TWO GHASTLY 
ALIENS, GIANT RED ARACHTOIDS WEARING SUITS AND TIES, HOLDING COFFEE 
CUPS...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Evil...pure and simple, from the eighth dimension! Grab 'em!

	165
RENO'S POV...NOTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY...neither Reno nor anyone else 
in the room seeing what Buckaroo does, seeing instead only those two 
redheaded gents who like their coffee sweet, John O'Connor and John 
Gomez...COULD THEY POSSIBLY BE THE CRIMSON CREATURES BUCKAROO THINKS 
ARE:

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Arachtoids! Stop 'em!

SENATOR CUNNINGHAM
Arachtoids?

	166
Buckaroo breaking into a dead run across the room, those two astonished 
RED ALIENS racing for the nearest exit!

	167
The Hong Kong Cavaliers rushing to help Buckaroo when suddenly the 
PIERCING SCREAM of Penny Priddy causes them to stop in their tracks and 
look toward the dais...

...where yet NOTHER REDHEAD called JOHN BIGBOOTÉ, in glasses and dark 
suit, a bandanna over his face, has just stepped from behind the 
curtain and seized Professor Hikita, pointing a revolver at the old 
man's head...the Cavaliers instinctively stepping toward the dais, 
outraged...

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
Okay, wise guys! 

...the masked John Bigbooté FIRING once, wounding Reno in the 
shoulder...

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
Let those gun belts hit the floor! And nobody follows, or the prof is 
history! 

The pistol stuck in Professor Hikita's ear convincing the Cavaliers to 
obey, to watch helplessly as the kidnapper backs his victim through the 
curtain and out of sight...as new Jersey administers first aid to Reno 
and Penny strokes the fallen Cavalier's hair, berating the idle 
bystanders around them:

PENNY PRIDDY
Is this the kind of society you want?  A society of weak-kneed 
jellyfish wallowing in self-pity, prey to ruthless hoodlums who pick us 
off like flies?

SENATOR CUNNINGHAM
Or a society where we stand strong, take charge of our own destiny, 
with the cry "So far and no farther will we be pushed!"

INT.  HOTEL BOWELS - MOVING - AFTERNOON	168

Buckaroo in the meantime running down a flight of stairs...catching 
sight of his prey...THOSE TWO MONSTROUS RED ALIENS running through a 
swinging door...

...Buckaroo accelerating, hitting the door with every ounce of strength 
in him...

INT.  UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE - LATE AFTERNOON	169

...Buckaroo flying through the door, taking a fall down concrete steps, 
finding himself in the hotel parking garage where a MOTORCYCLE SHOW is 
unloading equipment...

...Buckaroo spotting THREE SHADOWY FORMS halfway across the lot loading 
A LARGE CRATE into a van...

Buckaroo wasting no time going after the van, as it starts 
up...commandeering A FANCY NEW MOTORCYCLE, charging after the van 
despite an EXHIBITOR'S warning:

EXHIBITOR
Hey, you can't ride that! 

INT.  CORRIDOR - LATE AFTERNOON	170

The Cavaliers coming from two directions, colliding at an 
intersection...

PERFECT TOMMY
Any sign of Buckaroo?

RENO
No!  Ditto the professor-

RAWHIDE
Shit!

EXT.  CITY STREETS - LATE AFTERNOON	171

The van speeds by...the motorcycle pursues!

EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE - LATE AFTERNOON	172

The chase continues, leaving the city behind...

EXT.  WOODED ROAD - LATER AFTERNOON	173

...the van coming straight toward us, thundering past...as Buckaroo and 
his motorcycle next roar INTO CAMERA in hot pursuit, and over his 
shoulder an AWESOME SIGHT...

...A DARK, UNNERVINGLY PREHISTORIC CREATURE FLYING DIRECTLY AT US, 
GROWING LARGER AND LARGER ON THE SCREEN, BUCKAROO UNAWARE OF ITS 
EXISTENCE...

EXT.  FIELD - LATE AFTERNOON	174

Twilight enveloping a New Jersey meadow as a pair of DUCK HUNTERS and 
their DOG takes advantage of the last half hour of fading daylight 
as...

...that BLACK CREATURE wings overhead!	175

	176
The duck hunters confused, frightened, FIRING, as a reflex reaction to 
this sudden threat from above!

	177
CLOSE ON the AWFUL BLACK CREATURE HIT, swooping low with a horrible 
shudder!

The hunters transfixed...	178

DUCK HUNTERS
My God!  What the hell...

The FRIGHTFUL sound of the CREATURE'S FAILING LUNGS...a terrific noise 
as the duck hunters hurry to where their unnatural kill hangs obscured 
in a gigantic tree...their dog running ahead, intent on retrieving this 
unusual "BIRD"...

EXT.  TREE - LATE AFTERNOON	179

The heavy-footed hunters SLOSHING THROUGH WATER, the first hunter to 
arrive on the scene using a sharp stick to poke at a BULGING BLADDER on 
the bottom of the strange creature, the sac bursting and drenching the 
hunter with a hideous viscous fluid...SPARKS!  AND A STRANGE BLUE 
DUST...

	180
...as suddenly AN ENORMOUS SPHERE drops out of the tree and begins 
rolling toward the hunter who poked that sac...

DUCK HUNTERS
Jesus Christ--!  What is it?

The other hunter following the ODD SPERE as it backs his buddy into a 
shallow swamp...the thing coming to a stop and...

	181
...A BLACK MAN with dreadlocks emerging from the top of the weird 
vessel, trying to balance himself when he slips and crashes to the 
ground, his neck breaking...a beam from his dropped 'flashlight' 
revealing him in death to be not a black man, but a BLACK ALIEN WITH A 
THREE-FINGERED HAND...

	182
...the hunters terrified as their dog starts snarling at the tree where 
now a second BLACK MAN has emerged, running for the road, jumping the 
fence like a gazelle...

	183
...the hunters not seeing this second individual, obsessed instead with 
a BUCKAROO BANZAI COMIC BOOK they've discovered in the dead alien's 
fingers.

1ST HUNTER
It's the latest issue!

EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE - TWILIGHT	184

Buckaroo still on his MOTORCYCLE in pursuit of the van, taking a daring 
shortcut down a treacherous hillside...

INT.  VAN - TWILIGHT	185

Alien John Bigbooté at the wheel, alien John Gomez riding shotgun, in 
high spirits, cradling a DRY CELL BATTERY, his strange tongue upon it, 
getting high...his teeth glowing.

Bigbooté turning in his seat, overhearing alien John O'Connor operating 
a RADIO in the rear of the speeding van...

JOHN O'CONNOR
What? A black ship?  Where?
(listening)
A black thermopod's been shot down ten miles back.

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
A black thermopod here?  On Earth?!  Why, John Gomez?  Why?

John Bigbooté looking at John Gomez for any possible explanation.

JOHN GOMEZ
John Whorfin...maybe they know he's escaped!

JOHN O'CONNER
How?  How could they possibly know?  They're more than three trillion 
six hundred sixty million miles away.

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
(jerking the wheel)
They know everything!  I told Whorfin to sit tight.  This could be the 
end of us all!  We gotta get Banzai's Overthruster and get off this 
rock!

EXT.  VAN - TWILIGHT	186

The van making a 180( turn!

INT.  VAN - TWILIGHT	187

John Bigbooté yelling back to John O'Connor:

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
Where was it, John O'Connor? How far back?

JOHN O'CONNOR
I have a radio fix...

John Gomez opening the glove compartment, taking out a pistol:

JOHN GOMEZ
Death to the enemy!

JOHN O'CONNOR
Death to the enemy--!  Kill or die!

John Bigbooté just driving...his strange eyes set.

EXT.  ROAD - TWILIGHT	188

Buckaroo rounding a curve on his motorcycle when that van is suddenly 
upon him, coming head on!

Buckaroo just having a split-second to catch the logo 'Yoyodyne' on the 
front of the van as he swerves into a ditch to avoid certain death...

	189
...Buckaroo quickly restarting the motorcycle and taking out A SWISS 
ARMY LIGHTER/MINIATURE TWO-WAY RADIO, making a call to:

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Rawhide.  Come in.  Over.

INT.  PRESS CONFERENCE ROOM - TWILIGHT	190

Back in the press conference room, the anxious Cavaliers try to help 
several LAW ENFORCEMENT TYPES reconstruct the professor's kidnapping.  
A TINY BUZZER going off in Rawhide's pocket:  his SWISS ARMY CIGARETTE 
LIGHTER.  Rawhide turns his Back on everyone, taking out a pack of 
Luckies, lighting up as he talks quietly into the FLAME:

RAWHIDE
Over, Buckaroo.  What's up?  Where in Hades are you?  I'm getting a 
lotta static.

EXT.  ROAD - TWILIGHT	191

Buckaroo pushing and shoving his motorcycle onto a woodland path...IT 
IS GETTING QUITE DARK...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
That's me. I've been ionized, but I'm okay. I'm, switching on the 
homing beacon, mark two minute intervals.

RAWHIDE
Buckaroo, somebody shanghaied the Professor!

BUCKAROO BANZAI
The deuce you say.
(realizing)
That crate!

INT.  PRESS CONFERENCE ROOM - TWILIGHT	192

Elsewhere in the room, nervous and concerned, Penny Priddy sits apart 
from the others, thumping the keys of a piano...

RAWHIDE
What crate?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I think I'm on to something. You and the guys go back to the house and 
dig up everything you can on an outfit called Yoyodyne.

RAWHIDE
(into flame)
Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems?  You think they're mixed up in this?

...Reno sitting down next to Penny at the piano, his wounded arm in a 
sling but his fingers nimble as ever...

PENNY PRIDDY
How long you been riding with Buckaroo, Reno?

RENO
Nigh on ten years.  Been through a lotta scrapes together.

PENNY PRIDDY
What'd you do before?  Can I ask?

RENO
Government work.  Had my own think tank.  Got tired of thinking-wanted 
some action.  Seen plenty of it too.  So will you if you stick around.

PENNY PRIDDY
Where's Buckaroo?  Is he alive?

RENO
Course he's alive.  He's Buckaroo Banzai.

Rawhide calling from across the room...

RAWHIDE
All right.  Let's go!  We got our work cut out for us tonight!

Reno getting up, Penny unsure at that moment whether she's being 
included, as those steely eyes of Rawhide zero in on her...

RAWHIDE
You, too, Miss Penny.

EXT.  ROAD - NIGHT	193

Darkness as Buckaroo races on, the taillights of the van far ahead...

INT.  VAN - NIGHT	194

John Gomez now sharing his DRY CELL BATTERY with John O'Connor, the two 
of them singing a SONG from their home planet...

...John Bigbooté at the wheel, preoccupied, refusing their offer of a 
toke on the battery with:

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
No thanks, I'm driving.

EXT.  CRASH SITE - NIGHT	195

The Yoyodyne van approaching the scene of the downed spacecraft, the 
headlights of the single HIGHWAY PATROL CAR illuminating the CORPSE OF 
THE DEAD CREATURE in the water...the HIGHWAY PATROLMAN pulling the 
figure out of the water, the hunters standing by...

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Hand me that tarp. Let's cover this guy...

2ND HUNTER
What guy? He's got paws.

The other hunter tossing a plastic tarp over the body as they all turn 
to regard the headlights of the Yoyodyne van...the cop heading that 
way...

	196
BUCKAROO ARRIVING now too, scraping to a stop on his motorcycle in 
heavy brush, creeping closer to the crash site for a better look...

	197
BUCKAROO'S POV: The ungainly SPHERICAL SPACECRAFT and that amazing DEAD 
CREATURE on the ground, covered now with a sheet of semi-transparent 
plastic...observing John Bigbooté and John Gomez producing official 
I.D.s and appearing to BUCKAROO AS CRIMSON ALIENS...TO THE COPS AS...

ORDINARY CITIZENS:	198

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
John Bigbooté, Officer. Executive Vice President, Yoyodyne Propulsion 
Systems.

JOHN GOMEZ
(of the spacecraft)
One of our birds.

The highway patrolman returning Bigbooté's I.D., still a little 
skeptical about the whole thing, pointing to THE DEAD CREATURE UNDER 
PLASTIC.

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
That fella over there-that one of yours, too, is it?

John Bigbooté having a ready answer...

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
The droid, you mean?

	199
Buckaroo moving quickly to the back of the van, starting to open the 
rear door with a locksmith's pick attached to his special SWISS ARMY 
LIGHTER.

O'Connor...O'Connor thinking the noise has come from the crate 
itself...

JOHN O'CONNOR
Button up in there, Professor, if you know what's good for you.

John O'Connor stepping out for a smoke.

EXT.  VAN - NIGHT	203

Buckaroo watching the alien John O'Connor move off in the direction of 
the hunters, retrieving his dropped Swiss Army lighter, not noticing 
that the once blinking L.E.D. on the homing device has gone out!  
Buckaroo again picking the lock...

EXT.  CRASH SITE - NIGHT	204

...ordinary citizen John O'Connor meanwhile observing the hunters still 
hanging around, one of them engrossed in the Buckaroo comic, his pal 
trying to figure out how to operate the dead alien's unusual 
flashlight...

JOHN O'CONNOR
Nice night, huh?

INT.  VAN - NIGHT	205

EXT.  SWAMP - NIGHT	207

John Bigbooté, John Gomez, and the cop looming above the dead 
creature...

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Looks like nothing I ever seen. I seen droids in space movies, but 
they're nothing like this-

JOHN GOMEZ
It's a three-man thermopod...

John Bigbooté shooting John Gomez a hard stare...

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Thermopod?  What's a...

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
Very T.S.  Top Secret, right John Gomez?

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Yeah, well, I was gonna call Buckaroo Banzai out here to have a look.  
Right up his alley, I think.

John Bigbooté's mood suddenly changing...tensing...

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
You called Buckaroo Banzai?

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Not yet.  I said I was gonna.

The three of them looking up at another pair of headlights arriving, A 
SEDAN, the cop yelling at them:

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Go on!  Keep it moving!

JOHN GOMEZ
We got a truck on the way to mop things up for you.  Else this place 
could become a zoo, not to mention a haven for gawkers.

The highway patrolman moving off to deal with the sedan...

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
We'll just go ahead and start breaking it down.

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Don't touch it!  I got my own help on the way!  That's an order!

John Bigbooté frowning, telling John Gomez:

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
There's a crowbar in the truck.

John Gomez nodding, heading back to the van...

INT.  VAN - NIGHT	208

...as Buckaroo pries his way into the crate, extracting the shaken 
Professor Hikita.

A SPARK dancing between them as they touch!	209

	210
PROF. HIKITA
Buckaroo!  What the Sam Hill!

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Careful...don't make noise and don't touch me.  I'm hotter than 
flapjacks.

PROF. HIKITA
What?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I'm a giant semi-conductor, and there's alien creatures all around us.  
Form the Eighth Dimension, I think.  Look...

Buckaroo trying to show Professor Hikita the MATHEMATICAL FORMULA 
written on his hand.

PROF. HIKITA
You can see them? 

Buckaroo holding a finger to his lips...whispering...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Ever since that phony phone call from the President.  Look at this. 
What is it?

PROF. HIKITA
It's your hand, Buckaroo.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
It's an antidote. A formula.  Whoever it was on the phone made me 
scribble this and gave me the ability to penetrate their disguises.

Buckaroo opening the door to the van.

BUCKAROO SEES the red alien John Gomez coming closer...	211

	212
PROF. HIKITA
Antidote to what?  Whose disguises?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Arachtoids.  From Planet Ten.

PROF. HIKITA
Planet 10?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
(pointing quickly)
There's a Harley behind those bushes.  Get back to the laboratory and 
start working on the formula.  We don't have time to ask questions.  
Just synthesize it-

The professor still without the crucial information, however...John 
Gomez approaching...

PROF. HIKITA
Buckaroo, the formula--

Thinking fast, Buckaroo presses the palm of his hand to Professor 
Hikita's forehead, the ball-point ink transferring...THE IMPORTANT 
FORMULA IMPRINTED IN REVERSE ON THE PROFESSOR'S SHINY PATE...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Hurry!  Please.

Meanwhile back on Buckaroo's bus, in the nerve center, Rawhide and 
Perfect Tommy look at a BLANK OSCILLOSCOPE operated by a Blue Shield 
Technician...

PERFECT TOMMY

RAWHIDE
Too long.  We better get somebody over there.  Put up the grid, last 
known location--

CLOSE ON OSCILLOSCOPE...AN ELECTRONIC GRID FIELD coming up, noting 
Buckaroo's last location.

Scooter racing outside toward his father, CASPER LINDLEY, the station 
owner, an everyday no-nonsense guy in grungy overalls, presently trying

A weary, worried Rawhide comes back into the front of the bus and takes

Trouble?

RAWHIDE
Nah-Damn sophisticated equipment always breaking down.

Reno wondering if there's more to it than Rawhide's saying...Rawhide 
losing himself in a copy of American Horseman.

Penny leaning forward, thinking, picking at a guitar left on the seat 
in front of her, watching the mysterious Hong Kong Cavaliers.

	222
Perfect Tommy arriving, whispering something in Rawhide's ear, Rawhide 
nodding...

Penny looking over at Perfect Tommy across the aisle, Perfect Tommy 
confiscating the guitar...his guitar.

PENNY PRIDDY
What's his problem?

RENO
Perfect Tommy's just threatened by smart women.  Can you play that 
thing?

PENNY PRIDDY
Better than him.

EXT.  CRASH SITE - NIGHT	223

Buckaroo jockeying for an improved position, as the alien John Gomez 
prepares to strike the pod-TWO MEN getting out of the sedan

...THE CROWBAR HITTING THE POD for the first time!

	224
The cop turning, shouting at John Gomez from his squad car:

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Whadda you think you're doing?  Hey!

The cop in a jam, heading back toward the pod, as the two newly arrived 
redheads follow him despite his instructions:

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
I said back off!  I mean it.  Now get in your car and get the hell 
outta here!

...the two goons halting...but as soon as the cop turns, they follow 
him again...

INT.  FOYER/BUCKAROO'S HOUSE - NIGHT	227

A combination Japanese ryokan-American ranch house, an elegant

reacting as if she's seen a ghost...

MRS. JOHNSON
Peggy--!?  Oh, wow...no...

RENO
She's not Peggy, Mrs. Johnson--

MRS. JOHNSON
Not Peggy--!  Of course not. How could she be, huh?  Whew.

RAWHIDE

No...I thought he was with you guys...

BRAINY KID
Hi, fellas...gonna lay down some background vocals tonight?

RAWHIDE
Wish life was so simple, Billy.  Remember that outfit the Justice 
Department checked into last year-Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems?

BRAINY KID (BILLY)
The big space and weapons high tech consortium way behind on their 
delivery of the controversial new Truncheon Bomber?

PERFECT TOMMY
You got her.  Buckaroo's orders: access their data bank.  Attack their 
systems.  Up to it?

BILLY
I'm a little short-handed tonight.  My phone phreaks went into town for

SECOND-IN-COMMAND
But what if John Parker too is dead?  Then we must send another

BLACK ARACHTOID COMMANDER
There's no time.  We have our order from John Emdall.

INT.  VAN - NIGHT	236

The alien John O'Connor looking in on the crate...finding it 
empty...lid off...

EXT.  CRASH SITE - NIGHT	237

Ordinary citizen John Gomez HITTING the little thermopod again, the cop 
exasperated, pushed to the brink, surrounded...

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
That's it, gentlemen, you're all under...

The cop reaches for his pistol when suddenly John Bigbooté whirls and 
lunges out with HIS TELESCOPING ARM, chopping the cop's Adam's apple, 
knocking him to the ground...

...the hunters stunned, one of them reaching for a shotgun when the two 
newly-arrived Yoyodyne goons attack, easily knocking the hunters to the 
ground, beating them!

	238
Bucakroo starting forward, but A THREE-DIGIT HAND suddenly on his 
shoulder!  Spinning him around!

VOICE
Easy, friend-

Buckaroo face-to-face with RED ARACHTOID John O'Connor, the latter 
surprised to discover it's...

JOHN O'CONNOR
Buckaroo Banzai--!

Buckaroo taking advantage of this creature's momentary amazement to 
kick O'Connor below the belt...dropping him to the turf...now spying 
yet another set of headlights coming down the road...

JOHN O'CONNOR
(in pain)
It's Buckaroo Banzai! Get him! He let the professor outta the box!

	239
The goons pursuing Buckaroo onto the road, the HEADLIGHTS OF A TRUCK 
bearing down on them...Buckaroo waving back at the truck, his only 
chance, when suddenly, instead of slowing, the truck speeds up, trying 
to run him over...YOYODYNE!

...Buckaroo lunging to safety at the last minute, getting up and 
running into a field...the Yoyodyne truck making a 180( turn and coming 
after him, across the meadow.

	240
...Buckaroo pursued by the truck and the goons when suddenly THE BLACK 
THERMOPOD EXPLODES, Buckaroo and the goons flying to the ground, 
Buckaroo quickly up and running, the truck gaining on 
him...gaining...still gaining when out of nowhere, A ROPE LADDER falls 
from the sky, entangling Buckaroo and pulling him up to a hovering 
HELICOPER...

INT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT	241

Piloting the small chopper, Casper Lindley, gas station proprietor, 
along with his eager son, Scooter...both father and son dressed in Blue 
Shield outfits now...Casper giving Buckaroo a helping hand into the 
swift-flying craft and getting a MILD ELECTRICAL SHOCK, COMING THIS 
CLOSE TO DROPPING BUCKAROO!

CASPER LINDLEY
Forgive the butterfingers, Buckaroo.  Casper Lindley, Knight of the 
Blue Shield, at your disposal.  And my son, Scooter.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Nothing to apologize for, Casper.  You've gone beyond the call of duty 
tonight.  Mind if I get on the horn and radio the Cavaliers--?  They'll 
be worried.

Buckaroo reaching for the mike, relieved to feel only a SLIGHT 
ELECTRICAL CHARGE on touching it...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Not the famous Scooter....?

SCOOTER LINDLEY
Wow.  You know it.

EXT.  FRONT GATES/BUCKAROO'S HOUSE - NIGHT	242

Professor Hikita on motorcycle, being waved through the front gate by a 
BLUE SHIELD GUARD while a second Shield, PINKY CARRUTHERS (on 
HORSEBACK), telephones ahead...

PINKY CARRUTHERS
The prof just rolled in.  Says he's on his way to the lab and "Do not 
disturb."

INT.  STUDIO COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT	243

Reno on the phone, getting the word on Hikita while the other Cavaliers 
watch Billy call up a strange senseless MAZE OF LETTERS AND NUMBERS on 
his monitor...

RAWHIDE
Try a new cipher.  Try G.

BILLY 
G cipher. There!  More like it!

NEW JERSEY
Nice work, kid.

	244
CLOSE UP SCREEN:  the letters having at least turned into something 
coherent...a batch of names and dates, vital statistics...headed 
"YOYODYNE."

	245
BILLY
Looks like we've accessed their Read Only Memory...a personnel file. 
Could be highly revealing.

RENO
(rejoining the group)
The professor just pulled in, jabbering something about space monsters, 
locked himself in his lab.

PERFECT TOMMY
"Space monsters"...my ass.

INT.  HALLWAY/BUCKAROO'S HOUSE - NIGHT	246

Mrs. Johnson leading Penny down a richly paneled corridor past pictures 
and momentoes of Buckaroo and the Cavaliers, past and present...

MRS. JOHNSON
I'm sure the boys like you.  They just don't wanna get attached...and 
then see what happened to Buckaroo's last sweetheart happen to you.

PENNY PRIDDY
What happened to her?

Mrs. Johnson biting her tongue...

MRS. JOHNSON
You know any judo?

PENNY PRIDDY
Any what?

MRS. JOHNSON
Don't worry, I won't hurt you.

Penny staring at this strange young girl, not knowing what to say...

PENNY PRIDDY
What's up those stairs?

MRS. JOHNSON
Bunkhouse.  Off limits.  You'll be bedding down in here.

...Mrs. Johnson opening a guest room door...Penny eyeing those 
forbidden stairs...

INT.  STUDIO COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT	247

BILLY
This is queer...look...

Billy staring intently at the monitor...the others leaning in...

	248
CLOSE ON MONITOR:  a list of IDENTICAL DATES AND PLACES NEXT TO A RAFT 
OF NAMES.

	249
BILLY
All these people applied for drivers' licenses in the same town in New 
Jersey on the exact same date.

NEW JERSEY
New Jersey?

BILLY
Forty-six Yoyodyne employees.  Grover's Mill, New Jersey, 11/1/38.

RAWHIDE
Grover's Mills, Grovers' Mills...1938.  Why's that so darn familiar?

RENO
Looks like none of these guys ever lived anywhere else.  No places of 
birth.  And all of them with the same first name: John.

New Jersey studying the screen...

NEW JERSEY
November 1, thirty days have September, April, June, and 
November...when short February's done, all the rest have thirty-one. 
October 31st!  Halloween!  Don't you get it? 
(obviously not)
Orson Welles!

BILLY 
You mean the guy from the old wine commercials?

NEW JERSEY
Halloween. 1938..."War of the Worlds"...that fake radio news broadcast 
that got everybody scared, thinking that real live Martians were 
landing in Grover's Mill, New Jersey!  But then it all just turned out 
to be a hoax.

BILLY
Then that's it!

RENO
What's it?

NEW JERSEY
Right!  Hoax my eye!

RENO
You mean--?  No!

BILLY
Yes!  Martians!  Right across the river in Grover's Mills!

EXT.  FRONT GATES/BUCKAROO'S HOUSE - NIGHT	250

Pinky Carruthers aboard his palomino as JOHN PARKER (the only alien to 
escape the black thermopod) rides up outside the gate on a 
bicycle...holding a STRANGE YELLOW RECORD in his grasp...

PINKY CARRUTHERS
Hi, buddy, what can I do for ya?

JOHN PARKER
Buckaroo Banzai?

PINKY CARRUTHERS
You a messenger? What've you got here?

Pinky Carruthers snatching the ODD YELLOW RECORD through the gate...

JOHN PARKER
I need see Buckaroo Banzai in person. My name is John Parker. Identify 
yourself.

PINKY CARRUTHERS
Knight Commander, Pinky Carruthers. Sorry, John, all these people "need 
see" Buckaroo in person.

And with that Pinky Carruthers is gone, trotting up toward the mansion 
on his palomino...

...as a frustrated John Parker suddenly sticks his nose in the air, 
getting a whiff of something, causing him to get on his bike and 
pedal...

EXT.  OUTSIDE SECURITY WALL - NIGHT	251

...around the corner of Buckaroo's estate where he notices a PARKED VAN 
and THREE SHADOWY FIGURES lowering themselves into the ground near the 
high security wall...disappearing...

...John Parker approaching, beholding...that familiar "Yoyodyne" 
van...and a FRESHLY DUG HOLE, crawling into the hold himself.

EXT.  BANZAI INSTITUTE GROUNDS - NIGHT	252

...surfacing WITHIN THE WALLS OF THE ESTATE and again catching sight of 
THE SHADOWY FIGURES moving toward the buildings, John Parker 
following...quickly ducking behind a tree, trying to get himself a good 
view of the three intruders...

SUDDEN VOICE
That's as far as you go, pal.

John Parker jerking his head around, finding himself confronting the 
FRIGHTENING SILHOUETTE of a Blue Shield in camouflage commando gear...

	253
...John Parker instinctively raising a hand to protect himself when 
without warning, a second BLUE SHIELD drops on his head from the tree 
above, knocking him down...

INT.  GARAGE - NIGHT	254

Closed...SAM, the mechanic, next to Buckaroo's precious JET CAR, 
tinkering with that damaged Harley Davidson...the garage door suddenly 
sliding open, startling Sam...no one there.

SAM
Okay, who's the funny guy?

EXT.  GARAGE - NIGHT	255

In the buses, CLOSE ON SOMETHING WEIRD EMERGING SLOWLY FROM TEH ALIEN 
JOHN BIGBOOTÉ'S MOUTH...SHARP...

Sam stepping forward...A FIVE-PRONGED ORGANIC STINGER THE SIZE OF A 
WALNUT FLYING OUT OF THE NIGHT!  A scream dying in Sam's throat as he 
clutches his heart, John Bigbooté dragging him back into the garage.

INT.  GARAGE - NIGHT	256

...while the red alien John Gomez remains outside as a lookout, the 
alien John O'Connor quickly peering into the locked Jet Car and 
smashing the window, searching in vain for the OSCILLATION 
OVERTHRUSTER...

JOHN O'CONNOR
Not here!  No Overthruster!

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
John Whorfin will kill us!

JOHN O'CONNOR
You look!  It's not here!

JOHN GOMEZ
Professor Hikita!

EXT.  GARAGE - NIGHT	257

Outside, John Gomez making a startling discovery: the figure of 
Professor Hikita near an upstairs window of the research building only 
yards away...when suddenly overhead...

	258
GOMEZ'S POV...CASPER LINDLEY'S CHOPPER...landing behind a stand of 
trees as the alien intruders scatter for cover.

INT.  DEN - NIGHT	259

Mrs. Johnson sitting near a crackling fire, at a small desk stacked 
high with books and papers, her nose in an advanced chemical 
engineering text.

...looking up as the front door opens, admitting Buckaroo Banzai, 
Casper and Scooter bringing up the rear...

MRS. JOHNSON
Buckaroo!

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Is the professor here? Where's Penny?

MRS. JOHNSON
Both of 'em safe and sound. What's going on?  Everybody's freakin' out.

A shaken Rawhide, Reno, Perfect Tommy appearing on the stairway...

RENO 
They're arachtoids, Buckaroo, from Planet 10!

BUCKAROO BANZAI
What? How do you know that?

RAWHIDE
It's all on the record. Come on-

Buckaroo heading up the stairs...

	260
UPSTAIRS HALLWAY...BUCKAROO MOVING QUICKLY DOWN THE CORRIDOR with his 
men, being debriefed on the run:

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Planet 10?  The same Planet 10 you postulated beyond Pluto, Perfect 
Tommy?  The invisible body?

PERFECT TOMMY
Yeah, but most of 'em blasted in through the Eighth Dimension in 1938 
at Grover's Mills, New Jersey...

RENO
...where there was some kinda giant crash landing, a huge explosion and 
they fooled Orson Welles into covering it up!  And then they founded 
Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems and hid there for...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Orson Wells?  What about Doctor Lizardo?

PERFECT TOMMY
Lizardo caused it all.  Because he was already here on earth, screwing 
around with his own stupid Overthruster.

RAWHIDE
Faulty design.  It sucked.

RENO
...but he wasn't the real Doctor Lizardo...just this arachtoid creep 
that stole the good doc's body the year before in the Eighth Dimension 
when Prof. Hikita's lab exploded...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Stole his body?  When Doctor Lizardo's hair turned red and his mind 
snapped?  Of course!  What else?

PERFECT TOMMY
It wouldn't tell us the whole story until you got here.  It wasn't to 
talk to the head honcho.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
It?  Who does?

INT.  INSTITUTE LABORATORY - NIGHT	261

Professor Hikita and his assistant toil away, starting at...

	262
...an elaborate electron-tube apparatus that just now beings to produce 
TINY GLOWING GREEN PARTICLES...

	263
...the professor excited, confused...rechecking Buckaroo's EQUATION ON 
HIS FOREHEAD by looking into a mirror.

INT.  BUCKAROO'S STUDY - NIGHT	264

...while Billy places John Parker's UNUSUAL YELLOW RECORD on a 
turntable in Buckaroo's cluttered office...Casper and Scooter and the 
Cavaliers seeking protection behind a PLEXIGLAS 'BLACKBOARD', their 
faces seen through a maze of mathematical symbols and equations...

	265
...Buckaroo at his messy desk with a can of beer, FASCINATED TO SEE HE 
STILL POSSESSES ENOUGH STATIC ELECTRICITY IN HIS HAND TO DRAW A SHEET 
OF PAPER UP FROM THE BLOTTER LIKE A MAGNET!

RENO 
Stand back, man...

	266
...as the needle now comes down on the yellow disc, and amid a flurry 
of SMOKE AND SPARKS, A GORGEOUS BLACK HUMAN FEMAL sizzles up from the 
grooves of the record and hovers in mid-air...A HOLOGRAM!

HOLOGRAM
Salutations, great Buckaroo Banzai.  I am John Emdall from Planet 10.  
A common grave danger confronts both our worlds.

INT.  CORRIDOR - NIGHT	267

Meanwhile out in the corridor, Mrs. Johnson advances with a load of 
cold beers and Birdseye burritos...passing by a figure frozen in the 
shadows...OUR POV: THE ALIEN JOHN O'CONNOR.  Mrs. Johnson gone, none 
the wiser.

INT.  BUCKAROO'S STUDY - NIGHT	268

Mrs. Johnson entering, dropping some of her load in shock at the sight 
of beautiful John Emdall floating free in the center of the room...

MRS. JOHNSON
Oh, wow...

Reno picking her things up, as Mrs. Johnson backs away from the 
HOLOGRAM and sticks the burritos in a portable microwave oven in the 
corner of Buckaroo's desk...

	269
JOHN EMDALL
After a bloody reign of terror, the hated leader of our military caste, 
the self-proclaimed "Lord" Whorfin, a bloodthirsty butcher as evil as 
your Hitler was overthrown by freedom-loving forces, tried, and 
condemned, along with several hundred of his followers, to spend 
eternity in the formless void of the Eighth Dimension. Death was deemed 
too good for their ilk.

	270
RENO
Did you tell Penny Buckaroo wanted to see her?

MRS. JOHNSON
She's not in her room...I looked.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Will everybody please shut up so I can hear this thing?

	271
JOHN EMDALL
Were it not for the experiments of your father and Professor Hikita and 
the real Doctor Lizardo, then John Whorfin would still be locked safely 
away on another plane of existence.

	272
Rawhide and Pinky Carruthers holding a whispered conversation elsewhere 
in the room...

PINKY CARRUTHERS
"John Parker" I think he called himself, this Rasta man on a bike 
dressed up in aluminum foil.  With a weird album...how the hell was I 
supposed to know he came from outer space?

Buckaroo moving dangerously close to the HOLOGRAM...

John Emdall suddenly pointing right at the great man...	273

JOHN EMDALL
And now, you, Buckaroo Banzai, have unintentionally helped John Whorfin 
further with your Oscillation Overthruster! For our intelligence warns 
us that John Whorfin is about to make good his escape from Earth back 
through the Eighth Dimension...and on to Planet 10! If he should 
attempt this we will have no choice but to disrupt worldwide electronic 
communications and fire a particle beam weapon from your airspace to 
Smolensk, in the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics.

PERFECT TOMMY
An action the Kremlin will most certainly misinterpret as an American 
first strike!

JOHN EMDALL
Exactly, Perfect Tommy.  The Soviets will retaliate.  Your President 
Widmark will launch a massive counterforce strike...and within twenty 
minutes the danger to Planet 10 will be removed...

RENO
God, if it's not one thing it's another.

JOHN EMDALL
But...because we're good guys, we're giving you a chance to save your 
planet.  Stop John Whorfin before sunrise! If you fail we will be 
forced to help you destroy yourselves.  End of discussion.

	274
There's an awful pause...and then a SCREECH as John Emdall spirals 
downward into the grooves of the record again.

	275
CASPER LINDLEY
She gotta be kiddin', right? Vaporize the whole damn planet--?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
You wanna take the chance, Casper?

CASPER LINDLEY
Not me. No way.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Rawhide, go find out how Professor Hikita's coming with that formula.  
Mrs. Johnson, take Casper and Scooter, gas up the Jet Car.

SCOOTER LINDLEY
Wow, you know it!

Buckaroo heading for the door...

RENO
Where're you goin'?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
To get my guns.

PERFECT TOMMY
His guns?  Holy shit.

INT.  INSTITUTE LABORATORY - NIGHT	276

...Professor Hikita and his assistant leaning over the electron tube 
apparatus, removing a rubber stopper from one of the receptacles, in 
the process GETTING AN ACCIDENTAL WHIFF of that BIZARRE GLOWING GREEN 
COMPOUND...Professor Hikita and assistant letting out gasps, seeing a 
sight that nearly stops their hearts...

THEIR POV	277

AT THE WINDOW...JOHN BIGBOOTÉ...AND A RED ARACHTOID!

	278
Professor Hikita, petrified, stepping back, grabbing the OSCILLATION 
OVERTHRUSTER and knocking over a chair, as THE ALIEN CREATURE smashes 
the window!

INT.  INSTITUTE CORRIDOR - NIGHT	279

Rawhide, hearing screams from the Professor's laboratory, races down 
the corridor, gun drawn...

INT.  BUCKAROO'S BEDROOM - NIGHT	280

Buckaroo coming into his bedroom, opening a dresser drawer when 
suddenly...A NOISE BEHIND HIM!  Buckaroo whirling instinctively with 
twin EBONY HANDLED COLTS a fraction of a second from firing...at PENNY!

...the latter poking her head out of Buckaroo's closet just long enough 
to see him aim his silver pistols, jumping back into the closet, 
slamming the door...an exasperated Buckaroo stepping over to the 
closet, finding it locked...knocking...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Open up or I'll shoot it off.

PENNY PRIDDY
I'll shoot yours off if I had a gun, you double-dealing Casanova!  I 
thought you liked me for myself.  But why should you, huh?  A jerk like 
me.

Buckaroo understanding at last the reason for Penny's odd behavior, 
seeing THE PHOTOGRAPH on his bedstand of a younger, possibly not-yet-
so-world-famous Buckaroo Banzai in tuxedo...his pretty companion A DEAD 
RINGER FOR PENNY.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Penny, look-

PENNY'S VOICE
You look.  Who is she?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
That's kinda complicated to get into right now because the world's 
maybe coming to an end and I can't stand here and talk to a closet 
door.

PENNY'S VOICE
Yeah, whose world is coming to an end?  You only wanted me because I 
remind you of her.

Buckaroo fidgeting, precious seconds ticking away...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Penny, I was going to get into that, but I haven't had time...with 
arachtoids and all...but briefly she was your long lost twin sister, we 
got married, and that's about all I can say.  Right now.
(no response)
Penny?

A silence from the other side, the closet door unlocking...slowly 
opening, revealing Penny standing in the middle of a pile of female 
clothing...

PENNY PRIDDY
Married--?  So that's it!  Buckaroo Banzai, a married man.  Where is 
she?  With the kids some place?

Buckaroo turning...Penny eyeing him, penetrating his soul...

PENNY PRIDDY
She must've been a bigger fool than me if she ran out on a guy like 
you...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
She was killed, Penny.

PENNY PRIDDY
Oh, my.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Don't go to pieces.  I haven't got time tonight.

A pregnant pause, the pain evident on Buckaroo's face as he turns back 
to the job at hand, picking up his holster and rummaging through the 
dresser drawer, fighting back the painful memories...

PENNY PRIDDY
Looks like you're the one might go to pieces.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Where's my damn ammo?  Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around 
here!

PENNY PRIDDY
How did she die?  I wanna know.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
You don't wanna know.

PENNY PRIDDY
Yes, I do.  Gimme a chance.  I'm stronger than you think.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night.

PENNY PRIDDY
Hanoi Shan--?  The guy in your comic books.  Boss of the World Crime 
League?  Supreme Commander of the Legion of Death?  The Pivot of 
Mystery himself?  You're putting me on.  He's a cartoon character.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I wish he was.  He's real enough.

Penny having to sit down and think about this as Buckaroo straps on his 
guns...changes his torn and shredded jacket...Penny looking at a 
BUCKAROO BANZAI COMIC BOOK on the night stand...then at the framed 
photograph of Peggy...

PENNY PRIDDY
God, she's so young and beautiful.  I don't remember her at all.  Which 
I guess is good, under the circumstances.  I bet you'll never forget 
her though.

One look at Buckaroo says it all...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Never.

PENNY PRIDDY
I gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-I've got 
mixed emotions-I don't know if I can handle this.  Oh, boy...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I gotta go.  We're on borrowed time.

PENNY PRIDDY
Go where?  Where're you going?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
(squatting close to her)
Please, Penny.  You just gotta trust me now.  Okay?  And don't panic.  
Because it's gonna be all right.

PENNY PRIDDY
What?  If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.

PENNY PRIDDY
Believe in Penny Priddy?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Absolutely.

Penny looks into his eyes...

PENNY PRIDDY
You've got your six guns strapped on.  You're ridding off on another 
adventure?  Oh, my God, it's all real...it really is real.  I should go 
with you.  Please...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
It's too dangerous.

PENNY PRIDDY
That's just what you would say.  This is so unreal.  I'm dreaming...

Starry-eyed, she leans forward to kiss him, Buckaroo about to oblige 
when their fingers touch, Penny getting a MILD ELECTRICAL SHOCK...

...the door suddenly opens and Perfect Tommy sticks his head in...
	281

PERFECT TOMMY
(breathless)
Buckaroo--! Sorry--

BUCKAROO BANZAI
What is it, Tommy?

PERFECT TOMMY
Sam's dead!  Someone broke into the Jet Car! And things are going 
haywire over at the lab...

Buckaroo running for the door, calling over his shoulder to Penny:

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Stay here, I'll be back.

PENNY PRIDDY
Sure.  I won't hold my breath.

EXT.  BUCKAROO'S HOUSE - NIGHT	282

Buckaroo, the Cavaliers, and the Lindleys race out of the house toward 
the research building...

INT.  BUCKAROO'S BEDROOM - NIGHT	283

Penny hurriedly changes clothes...puts on Peggy's clothes...when 
suddenly THE SIGHT OF JOHN O'CONNOR standing in the hallway door, 
leering at her...

PENNY PRIDDY
Whadda you want?

John O'Connor, remembering her from the press conference...

JOHN O'CONNOR
Nothing right now, Penny Priddy.

John O'Connor vanishing...Penny again at a loss...

INT.  BANZAI INSTITUTE - NIGHT	284

Buckaroo and the Cavaliers running inside, racing up a bright yellow 
staircase to the second floor...

INT.  INSTITUTE LABORATORY - NIGHT	285

Buckaroo and the Cavaliers entering, finding the motionless lab 
assistant in Professor Hikita's wrecked laboratory...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Dead.  Damnit!

PERFECT TOMMY
Where's the professor?

RENO
Where's Rawhide?

CASPER
Who'd do a thing like this?

NEW JERSEY
Arachtoids.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Spread out. They can't be far.

INT.  INSTITUTE CORRIDORS - NIGHT	286

SHOTS of Cavaliers in empty hallways, guns drawn, discovering evidence 
of intruders...OFFICES RANSACKED, FURNITURE UPSET...EXPERIMENTS FOULED 
UP...

	287
...Buckaroo turning a corner, finding a SMALL AMOUNT OF SMOKE in the 
hallway...turning the corner...

INT.  DRAFTING ROOM - NIGHT	288

...stepping into a LARGE ROOM clouded with SMOKE from a burning file 
cabinet, Rawhide and a HULDING FORM struggling in the gloom...

...Buckaroo unable to get a clear shot at the beast when suddenly 
Rawhide succeeds in knocking his adversary to the floor, the "man" 
HISSING!

RAWHIDE
Look out, Buckaroo!

Rawhide putting himself in the line of fire, suddenly clutching his 
lower back...Buckaroo starting toward Rawhide but...

RAWHIDE
Behind you!

Buckaroo turning as THE SHADOW OF THE ALIEN JOHN O'CONNOR falls on his 
back!

...Buckaroo firing his guns, wounding the creature, the disoriented 
FIGURE retreating out into the corridor as Buckaroo turns in time to 
see Rawhide's assailant dive into a hole in the floor!  A hole in the 
floor?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
You okay?

RAWHIDE
Yeah. Just grazed me.  The Professor's under the floor too...with the 
Overthruster...

Buckaroo edging toward that strange orifice in the linoleum, going into 
it himself...

INT.  DOWNSTAIRS CORRIDOR - NIGHT	289

As Penny rushes in, her ears picking up weird noises...THE SOUND OF 
PEOPLE in the acoustical tiles overhead...Penny trying to follow the 
racket down the first-floor hallway...

INT.  CRAWL SPACE - NIGHT	290

Buckaroo in the dim light of the crawl space, making his way past air-
conditioning ducts toward the sound of someone or something crawling up 
ahead...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Professor--!?

PROF. HIKITA'S VOICE
Here, Buckaroo!

SOUNDS IN THE DARKNESS, Buckaroo holding his pistol still at the ready 
but useless in these cramped quarters...Buckaroo finding a worklight, 
flicking it on...

INT.  DOWNSTAIRS OFFICE - NIGHT	291

Penny meanwhile following the NOISES AND VOICES OVERHEAD into an empty 
office, grabbing a ladder and knocking out a ceiling panel...

PENNY PRIDDY
Buckaroo!  Rawhide!  Reno?  Anybody?

	292
ANOTHER POV...unfortunately someone else is watching Penny from inside 
that very office...the wounded John O'Connor sitting in a swivel desk 
chair behind the door, oozing blood of a strange color and consistency, 
staring ferociously at Penny...MORE CLATTER OVERHEAD...as Penny 
elevates herself partially into the hole...

INT.  CRAWL SPACE - NIGHT	293

PENNY'S POV...Professor Hikita only yards away, on his belly, able to 
come no further, unable to wedge himself beneath a large duct...the 
arachtoid John Bigbooté closing in behind the professor...Buckaroo 
closing in behind Bigbooté.

PROF.  HIKITA
Take it, young lady!  Grab it!

	294
Unseen by John Bigbooté, the OVERTHRUSTER skittering across the crawl 
space and into Penny's hands!

INT.  DOWNSTAIRS OFFICE - NIGHT	295

Penny stepping down off the chair and onto the desk top, her back still 
to the wounded John O'Connor as she quickly stuffs the OVERTHRUSTER 
into her purse...an action unseen by the ghastly, bleeding thug who...

	296
...EXTENDS HIS ARM UP AND ACROSS THE ROOM...HIS HUMAN HAND TIGHTENING 
AROUND HER MOUTH...

INT.  CRAWL SPACE - NIGHT	297

Buckaroo advancing toward the professor...

PROF. HIKITA'S VOICE
Go back, Buckaroo!

The arachtoid John Bigbooté whirling, firing a STINGER that whizzes 
past Buckaroo's head, missing by inches...as Buckaroo FIRES 
twice...John Bigbooté screaming...kicking at a small fresh air vent, 
somehow squeezing his huge body out the tiny opening like a rat.

INT.  DRAFTING ROOM - NIGHT	298

Buckaroo helping Professor Hikita up out of the floor...Rawhide lying 
very still now, surrounded by Reno, Perfect Tommy and New Jersey...

...one look between New Jersey and Buckaroo sufficient to tell us that 
Rawhide hasn't got a chance...Buckaroo kneeling beside his old pal, 
Rawhide forcing a smile...

RAWHIDE
You're a welcome sight...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Just 'grazed' you, huh?

New Jersey extracting a strange MANY-PRONGED STINGER from Rawhide's 
back.  Buckaroo looking at it...Rawhide maintaining a sense of humor...

RAWHIDE
Apache?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Arachtoid.

RAWHIDE
So I was right.  That's nice to know...

Across the room, Pinky Carruthers comes in with Casper and Scooter 
Lindley, and that black man from Planet 10, John Parker...

PINKY CARRUTHERS
We found the guy, Rawhide, sucker dug a hole and tried to...

Pinky's words catching in his throat as he sees Rawhide's condition.

	299
Buckaroo turning, seeing not a 'guy' but A GIANT ARACHTOID standing 
there...

	300
Rawhide fading fast, Buckaroo lobbing the STINGER to "John Parker"...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Any antidote for these things?

John Parker holding the stinger in his palm...

JOHN PARKER
No, none.

...as it suddenly comes alive!  He drops it to the floor, stomps it to 
death...

PERFECT TOMMY
That mean you're on our side?

RAWHIDE
(sinking)
We gotta stop 'em, Buckaroo.

Buckaroo turning from the BLACK ARACHTOID to his dying buddy...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
We will, old fried, we will.

RAWHIDE
Sure do pack a mean wallop...let's go...

BUT RAWHIDE CLOSING HIS EYES FOR THE FINAL TIME, as Buckaroo feels for 
a pulse...the look in the great man's eyes saying it all...sadness 
mixed with anger...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
There's another one we owe 'em.

...THE SOUND OF A HELICOPTER STARTING UP...

CASPER LINDLEY
They're stealing my chopper!

The Cavaliers racing for the window...

RENO
And they got Penny!  Look!

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Don't shoot!

PROF. HIKITA
She has the Overthruster!

JOHN PARKER
Then your planet is doomed.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
No!
(calmer)
We'll get it back.

Buckaroo shoving Perfect Tommy aside, at the window himself now.

BUCKAROO'S POV...a fleeting glimpse of THE STOLEN LINDLEY CHOPPER...

INT.  WALTER REED ARMY HOSPITAL - NIGHT	302

CLOSE ON the familiar face of the Secretary of Defense seen from an 
unusual angle...PULLING BACK TO REVEAL PRESIDENT WIDMARK lying on his 
belly, surrounded by the electronics of his temporary set of 
government, staring down at a special mirror that reflects his 
Secretary of Defense, the Secretary pressing a point further an 
igniting a Camel with a lighter from the President's nightstand.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
It's not Buckaroo Banzai per se, Mr. President. It's his men...some of 
then foreigners...Asiatics, their names changed, their true backgrounds 
shrouded in secrecy! I mean, when you come right up against it, what do 
we really know about any of 'em?

A NURSE appears with two little pills...

NURSE
These'll make you a tenny bit drowsy, Mr. President.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
That's okay, Bonnie, I won't be operating any heavy machinery today.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
(desperate)
We've never had a weapon like the Jet Car in the past, Mr. President.  
Light-weight, highly mobile, stick on some anti-tank missiles, a couple 
grenade launchers, hell, we could buy ourselves two hundred Jet Cars 
for the price of ten tanks, send 'em swarming all over Ivan like bumble 
bees, sir, right clear through their precious little Iron Curtain like 
it was Swiss cheese!  They gotta be just scared shitless!

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
As are all sane men today.

SECREATRY OF DEFENSE
Hey, and me too.  That's why I'm saying until Buckaroo Banzai agrees to 
submit his boys to at least a routine government security check, that 
Jet Car should be in the hands of Defense, and if they won't sell us 
the technology, then Mr. President, by God, sir, we have got to take 
it!  In the national interest.

The lighter in the Secretary's hand suddenly BEEPING, startling him and 
prompting the President to claim the gizmo and point it at...

	303
...an astounding TV-telephone where the FACE OF BUCKAROO BANZAI 
APPEARS...

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
World Watch One.  Direct incoming transmission.

BUCKAROO BANZAI ON TV
Hello, Mr. President.  How's my favorite patient?  Any tenderness?

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
That which does not kill us makes us stronger, Buckaroo.  What's it 
like out there in the real world?

Secretary of Defense McKinley stepping around behind the bed, coming 
into Buckaroo's field of vision...

BUCKAROO BANZAI ON TV
Not too terrific, sir.  I apologize for the interruption but something 
very unusual has reared its ugly head in outer space, and it looks like 
the Earth's caught in a crossfire.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
You're gonna have to repeat that, I think, Buckaroo.

EXT.  BUCKAROO'S BUS - NIGHT	304

On a highway somewhere near the Eastern seaboard, Buckaroo's bus speeds 
toward Yoyodyne...

INT.  WORLD WATCH ONE/BUS - NIGHT	305

Buckaroo standing at a TV-telephone in his MOBILE ELECTRONIC NERVE 
CENTER, the arachtoidal John Parker right at his side amid a flurry of 
activity... technicians accumulating INFO on THE ALIEN FATHER SHIP FROM 
PLANET 10...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
To cut right to the bottom line on this, sir, we have reason to believe 
that there are moving freely among us, vicious red aliens disguised as 
the owners and operators of Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems.

...Perfect Tommy, Reno, even Casper Lindley, coming in and out of the 
picture, transforming themselves into a crack commando unit donning 
assault/chemical-warfare uniforms...little Scooter Lindley among them, 
too, doing like his dad.

	306
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE ON TV
Yoyodyne Propulsion?  The people working on our Truncheon bomber?  
Under control of alien nationals?  Reds?  Commies, you say?

	307
...New Jersey studying an initial computer enhancement of THE AWESOME 
BLACK ARACHTOID SHIP HEADED TOWARD EARTH...

	308
BUCKAROO BANZAI
Not exactly, Mr. Secretary, no.  Real aliens.  Giant red arachtoids 
camouflaged as human beings...and what they're really building, forget 
your Truncheon bomber, Mr. Secretary, is this enormous rocketship to 
escape back through the Eighth Dimension and then on to Planet 10.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE ON TV
Now wait one second...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
The gentleman standing here with me is called John Parker, and he can 
corroborate everything I've said because he's from Planet 10 too.

INT.  WALTER REED ARMY HOSPITAL - NIGHT	309

The President dumbfounded...John Parker on TV appearing as nothing more 
than a wild and wooly Rastafarian...

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
Buckaroo...you and I, we go back a long, long way together...but...

JOHN PARKER ON TV
(interrupting)
Time is short, Mr. President. To prevent John Whorfin's escape, my 
comrades are at this moment taking up a geostationary position over New 
Jersey. This situation is explosive!

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
Explosive? What are you saying, man? Some kind of race war in New 
Jersey--?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
No, sir.  This 'man' as you call him, is not a human being, Mr. 
President.  He's a black arachtoid.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
That's some kind of spider, isn't it?

INT.  WORLD WATCH ONE/BUS - NIGHT	310

New Jersey joins Professor Hikita at a microscope, analyzing a slide 
smeared with that weird alien 'blood'...

PRESIDENT WIDMARK ON TV
Buckaroo, my good friend...I'd like to help you...but don't you think I 
would've heard from my SAC radar by now if...

INT.  WALTER REED ARMY HOSPITAL - NIGHT	311

BUCKAROO BANZAI ON TV
SAC wouldn't know what to look for, sir.  Because these black 
arachtoids are cleverly hidden inside a huge thundercloud.

The Secretary of Defense takes action, picks up a phone...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Get me John Bigboote at Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems, Inc.  Then...
(to the President)
...the FBI.  Let's see if this spade's wanted.  What the hell's his 
name again?  Jackson?

JOHN PARKER ON TV
Parker.  I have delivered a hologram from my president, John Emdall, 
who has made it clear that unless John Whorfin is destroyed at once, 
she intends to fire an atomic beam from your American airspace...

BUCKAROO BANZAI ON TV
...hit Smolensk and precipitate a thermonuclear war, Mr. President.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
A what?

BUCKAROO BANZAI ON TV
A thermonuclear holocaust, sir.  These creatures from Planet 10 are 
ready to exploit Soviet-American tensions and get us to blow each other 
off the face of the earth, sir, if necessary.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
You're quite serious about this, aren't you, Buckaroo.  We know each 
other pretty well, I think.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
John...?  John Bigboote?  Right, Bigbooté, sorry.  Anyway, hey, guy, 
how's everything over there at Yoyodyne?  How's my big bomber coming?  
Nothing out of the, you know, ordinary?  Spiders?  I know you're 
busy...lunch?  Sounds good...when's good for you?  Next Tuesday?  I'm 
writing it down in my book.  See you then...Uncle Sam's treat.

The Secretary writes nothing down, hangs up, looking unsatisfied with 
the conversation just concluded.

INT.  WORLD WATCH ONE/BUS - NIGHT	312

Buckaroo glancing over at Professor Hikita and New Jersey, the latter 
squinting into the microscope...

PRESIDENT WIDMARK ON TV
Well.  I don't know what to say, Buckaroo...aliens from Planet 10, 
nuclear extortion, spiders in thunder clouds, a girl named "John"...

NEW JERSEY
There's your answer!  Electromagnetic bacterial crap!

PROF. HIKITA
Programmable!

NEW JERSEY
We inhale the bacteria.  It swims to our cerebral cortex and reprograms 
our consciousness.  Diabolical.  We only see what they want us to see.

PROF. HIKITA
Electric brainwashing.

John Parker nearby, helping Reno synthesize more of Professor Hikita's 
ARACHTOIDAL ANTIDOTE and pour the liquid into GAS MASK FILTERS...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE McKINLEY STEPPING CLOSER INTO THE PICTURE...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE ON TV
Just curious, Buckaroo, but where's the Jet Car at these days?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I've got it, Mr. Secretary.  But unfortunately the Oscillation 
Overthruster is in Penny Priddy's possession and she's been kidnapped 
and taken to Yoyodyne, further exacerbating the situation. We're on our 
way there right now.

INT.  WALTER REED ARMY HOSPITAL - NIGHT	313

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
Who the hell's Penny Priddy?

The Secretary of Defense giving the President a sly 'I told you so' 
look...

INT.  WORLD WATCH ONE/BUS - NIGHT	314

Perfect Tommy coming over, interrupting...

PERFECT TOMMY
Buckaroo, John Parker has the arachtoid cloud on line 2!

INT.  WALTER REED ARMY HOSPITAL - NIGHT	315

BUCKAROO BANZAI ON TV
Excuse me a moment, Mr. President.  We're talking to the cloud right 
now.

And his image fades.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
Good God...

The President picks up the phone...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Well, if it wasn't Buckaroo Banzai, I'd say commit the man.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
Get me SAC HQ: Omaha, NORAD, and the Strategic Space Command. I want 
some hard data on that cloud. We got any killer satellites over Jersey-
-?

INT.  WORLD WATCH ONE/BUS - DAY	316

Everyone studying a much MORE DETAILED COMPUTER ENHANCEMENT of the 
alien cloud...

The Alien John Parker on the phone, whispering...	317

RENO 
They're armed for bear, Buckaroo.  Check out those radiation levels.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
(to John Parker)
John Parker, tell them we're doing our best.  Stall.

JOHN PARKER
(into phone)
Buckaroo Banzai says patience is a virtue, Wing Commander, sir.

Perfect Tommy interrupting again, holding yet another telephone...

PERFECT TOMMY
It's Whorfin, Buckaroo.  Line 3.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Whorfin?  Does he know we're coming?

INT.  SPEED OPERATOR'S PULPIT (YOYODYNE) - NIGHT	318

Meanwhile in a grimy narrow control booth high above the factory floor, 
a terrified Penny Priddy sits BOUND and GAGGED, John O'Connor SPREADING 
THE CONTENTS FROM A HONEY-BEAR SQUEEZE BOTTLE over her naked arms while 
long trails of ORDINARY PICNIC ANTS make their way up her legs...John 
Bigbooté looking on...

Penny's UNOPENED big clear plastic purse on Doctor Lizardo's desk, the 
OVERTHRUSTER right under his nose and he doesn't even know it as he 
speaks into the phone handed to him by an ASSISTANT.  BEGIN 
INTERCUTTING.

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Well, well...Dr. Banzai. Perhaps you don't remember me?  Ah, I'm 
flattered.  We know the same people.  In fact, one of them is here with 
me now...your associate, Doctor Penny Priddy.

	319
BUCKAROO BANZAI
"Doctor"--?

	320
DOCTOR LIZARDO
May I pass along my congratulations for your great achievement.  In the 
miserable annals of the Earth, you will be duly enshrined! However...
(a pause)
...Miss Priddy claims to be unable to solve my problem. And provide the 
crucial missing circuit for my Overthruster.  Perhaps you can convince 
her to try.

Lizardo holding the phone toward Penny, ripping her gag off...

PENNY PRIDDY
I'm not worth it, Buckaroo! Forget me! 

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Penny--?!  Are you all right?

Doctor Lizardo yanking the phone from Penny, remaining silent for a 
second to torture Buckaroo's soul...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
She knows nothing, Lizardo.

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Then shall we say "A Penny for your thoughts?" You can come in her 
place. Yoyodyne, Dr. Banzai. Come alone, with your Overthruster!
(hanging up)
He'll bring it.  I know his type.

Penny glancing surreptitiously at her large transparent purse, THE 
OVERTHRUSTER IN A JUMBLE OF COSMETICS!

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Take her to the pit!  Use more honey.  Find out what she knows.

Smiling smugly, Lizardo heads for the door, Penny squirming in her seat 
as the TINY ANTS dig in...

PENNY PRIDDY
Who are you?  Hanoi Shan?  The Scourge of Burma!  The Pivot of Mystery?  
Well, you're not destroying me like you did my sister!

Lizardo simply sneering at her as he goes out the door...

INT.  PASSENGER SECTION/BUS - NIGHT	321

A flurry of well-ordered activity taking place...Hong Kong Cavaliers 
and Blue Shield Irregulars along with Pinky Carruthers.  Casper and 
Scooter...sitting up front like paratroopers, cleaning their back-pack 
FLAMETHROWERS...SAWED-OFF SHOTGUNS...Buckaroo giving them a chalk talk, 
an aerial photograph of Yoyodyne on the clear plexiglas 'blackboard'...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
These antidote filters the Professor's whipped up will let you to see 
them like I have since yesterday, as arachtoidal creatures. They won't 
be pretty, nothing personal, John Parker.  But just remember...if we 
fail tonight, there's no tomorrow.

JOHN PARKER
They will never surrender.  They will fight to the end.

Buckaroo nodding...THE CAVALIERS BREATING THEIR ANTIDOTE FILTERS, 
SEEING NOW "THE ALIEN" JOHN PARKER WITH A MIXTURE OF DISBELIEF AND 
HORROR...Casper and Scooter Lindley especially unsettled...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I'm working under the assumption that Penny still has the Overthruster.  
That'll be my job: get it back in one piece.  Here's the main gate.  
I'll pass through first, alone.  The rest of you divide into two strike 
groups-Apache Team...that's you, Reno...and Chaparral Team, Perfect 
Tommy.  John Parker'll ride with Chaparral.

Perfect Tommy not too thrilled about that.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Top priority is the Overthruster. Whorfin can't escape without it. The 
built-in tracking device should make it relatively simple to 
locate...maybe hard to get.

INT.  BOWELS OF YOYODYNE - NIGHT	322

Penny being dragged by John O'Connor through a slimy underground 
corridor, past a strange piece of machinery.

INT.  WALTER REED HOSPITAL - NIGHT	323

The President of the United States talks into a cigarette lighter and 
peeks up a nurse's skirt by means of his floor mirror...

	324
MIRRORED POV:  The nurse's reflection replaced by that of his NATIONAL 
SECURITY ADVISOR...

	325
PRESIDENT WIDMARK
Buckaroo, come in...over.  How does this damn thing work?  Can anybody 
figure this lighter out?

NATIONAL SECURITY MAN
No, sir.  I think the flint...

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
What's happening with my call to SAC?

NATIONAL SECURITY MAN
Still no confirmation either from SAC or Strategic Space Command.  They 
report all surveillance satellite communication jammed.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
Jammed--? By who? Whom by?

NATIONAL SECURITY MAN
Possible atmospheric condition, sir...solar.  It's unusual, but no 
cause for alarm.  Intelligence reports the Soviets are having the same 
problem.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
Should we be on Code Red?

GENERAL CATBURD
We go to Code Red, the Russians go to Code Red...no sense jumping off 
half-cocked, Mr. President.

The President twisting around to glower at Catburd eating an orange, 
sitting near a table of flowers and fruit baskets.

SENATOR CUNNINGHAM
I don't know...Buckaroo Banzai's never been wrong before.

Senator Cunningham pacing nervously...

GENERAL CATBURD
The man went through solid matter, for crying out loud. Who knows what 
it did to his brain...maybe scrambled his molecules. All I'm saying is, 
let's not panic here!  I'm sure there's a rational explanation...

NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
(turning from a strange phone)
Russian radar is down, sir.  They've just gone to Code Red.

Silence.  And then calmly and quietly:

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
We've got no choice then.  Call my wife.

The National Security Advisor turning back to his telephone:

NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
Code Red.  "Butch says we're crimson."

GENERAL CATBURD
Mr. President, none of us here are lunatics or irrational men...
(looking at Cunningham)
...or persons.  I'm a soldier and I'm a damn good one, enough 
decorations to snap a Christmas tree, but I don't mind telling you, I'm 
sure I speak for everyone in this room when I say I am scared. I'm 
barely holding my fudge right now.

SENATOR CUNNINGHAM
Stop acting like a goddamn schoolgirl, General, and pull yourself 
together.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
I'm glad someone has the balls to face facts!
(pause)
Forget we're the good guys and we'd never attack first.  They think 
we're godless monsters just like them.  Put yourself in their 
samovars...sitting in the dark without radar, bells ringing all over 
the damn Kremlin, little men in fedora hats getting out of Zils, coming 
into the Great Hall of the People.  Now, do you think they're gonna 
listen to reason?  I'll give Buckaroo his Planet 10 space cloud, but do 
you think they will?

NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
(being handed a dispatch)
Soviet radar is down, sir, and so is ours.  We're both totally 
defenseless.  More or less.

GENERAL CATBURD
Hail Mary.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
So what's our counter option, General Catburd?  Earn your salary.

GENERAL CATBURD
I guess we have to prick this boil and take the heat, sir.  Hit 'em 
primero...blast 'em off the face of the Earth before they lose their 
heads and do it to us first.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
Larry, where's my Football?

NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
Out in the hall, sir.

INT.  WALTER REED HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT	326

An apple-cheeked Marine Lieutenant sits watching a television soap 
opera, only the sinister BLACK BRIEFCASE chained to his wrist setting 
him apart from missions of other viewers...General Catburd sticking his 
head out of the President's room...

GENERAL CATBURD
What're you waiting for, boy?  Get in here with that thing.

...as an out-of-breath Mrs. Johnson rounds the corner on rollerskates, 
out-foxing SECRET SERVICE AGENTS and the rest of the President's 
entourage, cutting through, clutching the YELLOW RECORD...

MRS. JOHNSON
For the President!  From Buckaroo Banzai!

EXT.  RENDEZVOUS POINT - NIGHT	327

A dimly lighted parking lot not far from Yoyodyne.  A KOLODNY BROS. 
PLUMBING VAN arrives, disgorging several tough BLUE SHIELDS as Buckaroo 
and Professor Hikita confer...the alien John Parker doing some highly 
unusual warm-up exercises on the tarmac...Reno telling the arriving 
Blue Shields:

RENO
We're waiting for the Jet Car.  Billy's bringing it.

PERFECT TOMMY
Asshole probably got lost.

NEW JERSEY
Or nailed for speeding.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Can I have everyone's attention?  I'm not a rah-rah kinda guy, and I'm 
not much for speeches, but things could get rough out there tonight.  
It's a fight we didn't ask for, but it's a fight we're stuck with and 
we all saw what happened to Rawhide.  So if for any reason this is 
good-bye, I want you all to know that...well...that...you crazy lugs...

Buckaroo finding it difficult to put into words what they all mean to 
him, the Cavaliers smiling, needling him...

RENO
What, Buckaroo?  You trying to tell us something?

The JET CAR racing up, skidding to a stop, Billy jumping out, the big 
engine still running.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Let's just fry those arachtoids.

Buckaroo embracing Professor Hikita, turning back to his men, pulling 
on his helmet:

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Give me thirty minutes.  Then come in and mop up.

Buckaroo tossing a quick Blue Shield salute, shutting himself into his 
speed machine.

Mrs. Johnson lifting the needle off the SMOKING RECORD...as the 
President's National Security Advisor places a call on that ominous 
STRANGE PHONE, a palpable tension rising, urgency bordering on panic...

...General Catburd and the young Marine lieutenant rummaging through a 
confusion of envelops in the BLACK BRIEFCASE.

NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
No answer at the Kremlin, sir. Just dead silence.

GENERAL CATBURD
Here you go, Mr. President...the Sealed Authenticators.  The Plan D 
Documents for your eyes only...John-Hancock these, and we got ourselves 
a knockout little force posture...

SENATOR CUNNINGHAM
You know, on second thought, maybe we should think this through a bit 
more so that future generations of...

THE LIGHTS IN THE ROOM START TO BLINK ON AND OFF...silencing the 
Senator...Catburd handing the President a writing implement...pulling 
out a special writing tray from the bed...

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
"Name of the enemy"?  What, Planet 10?  My hand's shaking.  How on 
earth can I even...have to stay awake, alert...that's my job.  That's

with his hands on Lizardo's mike cord, trying to get up enough nerve to 
pull the plug on his boss...

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Blacks are on this planet! Here in New Jersey! Coming to destroy us! We 
must move! Escape or die!

OVER LIZARDO'S SHOULDER: A view down below on the littered floor of a 
huge aircraft factory that houses a GIANT SPOACESHIP OF BIZARRE DESIGN, 
a customized 747, wingless, jagged, the entire vehicle suspended twenty 
feet off the floor on movable cranes, work ladders stretching up to its 
several doors...

DOCTOR LIZARDO
You must work faster to finish the Great Vehicle. So that we can enter 
the Eighth Dimension and free our trapped comrades! So we can return to 
our homeland and seize power once again! 

...Lizardo's followers extending their three-fingered hands in fascist 
salutes as he whips them into a feverish state:

HUGE YELLOW SPIKES, his eyes taking in everything, from the last-minute 
preparation of the GIANT SPACECRAFT to:

BUCKAROO'S POV...the evil figures of Dr. Lizardo and John Bigbooté 
standing high in the speed operator's pulpit...

Buckaroo yanked out of the cockpit...John Gomez poking at the JET CAR'S 
dashboard, ripping out its cassette deck, finding the crucial 
Overthruster missing and shaking his head in Lizardo's direction.

JOHN GOMEZ
Not here!

An angry John Bigbooté racing down the stairs toward the Jet Car...as 
over the PUBLIC ADDRESS BOOMS:

BACK TO:	342

BUCKAROO BANZAI

For that seemingly flippant but honest answer, Buckaroo gets punched by 
John Bigbooté...doubling him over...

Solve them! The shock tower is a lie detector. Any untruth triggers a 
brutal charge to your auditory meatus...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
You're not getting a damn thing outta me until Penny's safe.

DR. LIZARDO
Curse you, Banzai! Don't you realize what you're saying? Your planet's 
about to be destroyed, and you're wasting time like this...

The missing circuit's in your head, Whorfin.

DR. LIZARDO
Whorfin?  How do you know that's my real name?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
John Emdall told me.

Buckaroo smiles at Lizardo's surprise, Lizardo signaling John Bigbooté 
who turns on the voltage, ZAPPING Buckaroo!

INT.  BUCKAROO'S BUS (PARKED) - NIGHT	350

The Secretary of Defense pacing the aisle of the bus, looking at his 
watch while the Cavaliers and newly arrived Blue Shields conceal their 
eagerness for battle...checking watches, cleaning weapons.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Anybody got a report-anybody got anything?  Or are we still blacked 
out?

Perfect Tommy looking back into World Watch One...

PERFECT TOMMY
Light precipitation.  Partly cloudy tomorrow.

SECREATARY OF DEFENSE
This bus should be in the hands of Defense.

...Scooter Lindley, wearing a gas mask, approaches the alien John 
Parker with a BLUE SHIELD BALLPOINT PEN and a piece of paper...

SCOOTER LINDLEY
Could I have your autograph, Mr. Parker?

John Parker at first not understanding the nature of the 
request...looking at the ball-point pen, Scooter flipping the point for 
him...

SCOOTER LINDLEY
Say, "To my best friend Scooter..."

JOHN PARKER
You got it.

...the Secretary of Defense, NERVOUSLY CRACKING HIS KNUCKLES...moving 
up the aisle, suddenly screaming:

SCRETARY OF DEFENSE
What the hell are we doing?!  I don't believe this...what're we waiting 
for?  Christmas?

PROF. HIKITA
(checking his watch)
Ten minutes more.  Buckaroo's orders.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Damn Buckaroo!  I'm the eyes and ears of the President of these United 
States of America!  In loco presidentis!  Which means I'm in charge 
here!

PERFECT TOMMY
Not on this bus, you're not.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Who the hell do you think you are?

PERFECT TOMMY
Perfect Tommy.

That answer alone enough to drive the Secretary up the wall...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Well let me tell you something, Mr. Perfect Tommy: I don't need this 
shit.  I could be on Easy Street with a cushy job in the private 
sector.  But instead,  I got me a nine-hundred-million-dollar way-the-
hell-behind-schedule top-secret bomber being built down there by 
Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems and I don't intend to set twiddling thumbs 
in a bus while Buckaroo Banzai goes crashing around my airplane looking 
for his damn girlfriend, driving a car that itself is probably worth 
more to this country than all the tea in China!  I'm talking National 
Security risk and we are going in there like gentlemen and straighten 
this thing out before somebody gets hurt!  You got that?

...the Secretary suddenly grabbing a weapon from a surprised Blue 
Shield and turning it toward the driver...

REVERSE ANGLE...THE SECRETARY CRACKING A SHOT OFF AT THE WINDSHIELD!
	351

	352
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Hit it, soldier boy!  Move this buggy!  That's a goddamn executive 
order!

With his weapon trained on the driver, who's to stop him?

PERFECT TOMMY
Go ahead, Louie, do like the man says.

EXT.  HIGHWAY NEAR YOYODYNE - NIGHT	353

The double bus leaping forward, heading down the long approach road to 
Yoyodyne...past a BILLBOARD touting the aerospace achievements 
of...YOYODYNE-AN EXCITING, GROWING COMPANY...JUST ONE MILE 
AHEAD...PATROLLED BY AIRCRAFT.

INT.  BUCKAROO'S BUS - NIGHT	354

The Cavaliers letting the Secretary of Defense call the shots for the 
moment, talking among themselves, Perfect Tommy squelching any notion 
of knocking off their hysterical hijacker:

PERFECT TOMMY
(whispering)
Hey, so we get into action quicker this way.  We tell Buckaroo our 
watches were fast.

Ordinary citizen John Parker taking a step toward the Secretary, 
offering him a gas mask...the Secretary turning on him...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
That's far enough, black boy...

A mystified John Parker stepping back.

	355
ANGLE TOWARD WINDSHIELD...the Secretary peering through the windshield 
at the chain link gates coming into view...YOYODYNE-AN EQUAL 
OPPORTUNITY EMPLOYER.

REVERSE ON	356

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
I'll handle the negotiations here...
(to the driver)
Slow her down.

EXT.  GUARD GATE/YOYODYNE - NIGHT	357

The Secretary getting out, coming around to the REDHEADED YOYODYNE 
GUARDS who try to peer in through the bus' tinted windows...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
You fellas got a phone?  Ring ahead and get me John Bigboote.  Tell 
him...

GUARD
It's Bigbooté.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
What? Hell, I'll do it yourself if I want it done right, huh?

The Secretary pushing the astonished guards aside and picking up the 
telephone, the guards trying to stop him and in the process turning 
their backs on the bus as it SILENTLY CRUISES PAST THE GATE INTO 
YOYODYNE...

EXT.  DESERTED AREAS (YOYODYNE) - NIGHT	358

...the bus coming to a stop in a scrap metal dump inside the big 
compound, Cavaliers and Blue Shields piling out, going with their 
assigned groups...Perfect Tommy's Chaparral Team following John Parker 
toward a normal looking building...

JOHN PARKER
Under here, I think.

PERFECT TOMMY
Under where?  Hold on...

But John Parker entering a crawl space beneath the huge 
building...Chaparral Team having no choice, following.

EXT.  YOYODYNE GATE - NIGHT	359

The Secretary of Defense struggling with the guards for possession of 
the phone, drawing his stolen weapon...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Now you get this straight...you're up to your ass in alligators, and 
I'm here to drain the swamp.  So I'm gonna use this phone...because it 
is all over for you, Baby Blue...
(picking up the phone)
This is the Secretary of Defense at the poorly guarded west gate.  I 
wanna speak to John Bigbooté, person to person.  Okay, okay...Bigbooté.

EXT.  UNDERGROUND ENTRANCE/YOYODYNE - NIGHT	360

Reno's Apache Team (Casper and Scooter on board), finds yet ANOTHER 
UNDERGROUND ENTRANCE to the main building, slips in...

INT.  UNDERGROUND BUILDING - NIGHT	361

Chaparral Team (the alien, John Parker, Perfect Tommy) in the strange 
labyrinth of dark, low-ceilinged passageways, making their way 
cautiously...

PERFECT TOMMY
Hope you know where you're going, John Parker.  Because my nose is 
starting to whistle...

A FORM suddenly dropping from the ceiling, landing on Perfect Tommy, a 
fierce struggle in the darkness...John Parker to the rescue, garroting 
a RED ARACHTOID, Perfect Tommy helping himself up...

PERFECT TOMMY
Thanks.

JOHN PARKER
Don't mention it.

PERFECT TOMMY
Then I won't.

INT.  BIVOUAC ROOM - NIGHT	362

...John Parker leading the way again, up some unusual stairs...into the 
MAIN BIVOUAC ROOM, RED ARACHTOIDS apparently asleep in bizarre tents, 
others hanging from the ceiling like sloths, A STRANGE HEAVY HUMMING 
NOISE starting to fill the room...

JOHN PARKER
They sense us.  Hurry.

John Parker breaking into a run for the far end of the room, Perfect 
Tommy and the others following, John Parker hitting the door...and AN 
ALARM GOES OFF...Perfect Tommy opening fire at a HUGE GENERATOR...THE 
POWER DROPPING EVERYWHERE!

INT.  YOYODYNE SHOCK TOWER - NIGHT	363

LIGHTS PULSING...ELECTIRICITY FAILING in the murky torture chamber 
giving Buckaroo just the change he needs to break free of the shock 
tower.

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Stop him!  Get him!

INT.  CORRIDOR - NIGHT	364

Buckaroo ducking into a recessed doorway, taking cover against a wall 
wet with strange algae as various ARACHTOID GUARDS scramble past, ALARM 
BELLS AND SIRENS GROANING...

DOCTOR LIZARDO
(to Bigbooté)
Kill the girl! 

...Buckaroo losing sight of the swift arachtoid John Bigbooté, 
resorting instead to his ELECTRONIC TRACKING DEVICE while...

INT.  FLOODED CORRIDOR - NIGHT	365

...Reno, New Jersey and Pinky Carruthers bring Apache Team down a 
flooded corridor, meeting some opposition.

INT.  DARK CORRIDOR - NIGHT	366

Buckaroo spotting New Jersey in the confusion, the two of them tracking 
Penny electronically, descending concrete steps, moving down a dark 
corridor that we recognize...

INT.  LAUNCH HANGER - NIGHT	367

The Secretary of Defense meanwhile reaching the big hangar, confused, 
alarmed, chaos everywhere, shouting over the din:

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Bigboote!

...spotting John Bigbooté across the hangar floor, going after him, 
staring bug-eyed at the MONSTROUS-LOOKING SPACECRAFT suspended above 
the hangar floor...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
What the hell...that ain't no Truncheon bomber, my friend.  I never 
approved that!

INT.  CORRIDOR - NIGHT	368

The Secretary following the speedy John Bigbooté around a bend, unable 
to keep up...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Bigboote!

Bigbooté giving no indication of seeing him, rounding a corner ducking 
into his office...

...the Secretary rounding the corner too but seeing no sign of 
Bigbooté...instead just an office door, a nameplate reading JOHN 
BIGBOOTÉ, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT...the Secretary of Defense opening 
the door...

INT.  BIGBOOTÉ'S OFFICE - NIGHT	369

...moving past a vacant receptionist's desk to John Bigbooté's 
cavernous, strangely furnished chamber...EMPTY.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Bigboote?!  You can run, but you can't hide.  I want some facts!

...but no sign of John Bigbooté.

INT.  CORRIDOR - NIGHT	370

Buckaroo and New Jersey still tracking Penny, moving through another 
flooded, slimy corridor we remember...

INT.  BIGBOOTÉ'S OFFICE - NIGHT	371

...the Secretary spying a phone on the receptionist's desk amid 
scattered Oreo cookies, picking the phone up, clicking it a couple of 
times to get a dial tone...totally ignoring AN AMAZING FRAMED PICTURE 
OF A RED ARACHTOID MOTHER AND CHILD ON THE DESK RIGHT IN FRONT OF 
HIM...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Operator...operator...how the hell does a person get an outside line 
around here?

...his gaze now focusing squarely on that cheap framed photograph of 
the RED ARACHTOIDS...Secretary McKinley losing his bearings...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Oh, Lord.  Never mind...forget it...

...his mind reeling, refusing to accept the obvious, the oddly designed 
furniture and chairs in the room, somehow insect-like...a sudden 
sound...a WOMAN'S SCREAM that seems to come from...underneath the 
floor?

...the Secretary cocking his weapon and stepping around the desk as an 
amazing thing occurs...A TRAPDOOR IN THE OFFICE FLOOR opening, the 
Secretary going to investigate, able to observe...

	372
HIS POV of...John O'Connor coming up a ladder and, in the room below, a 
barely conscious Penny still in her private hell, trussed and taped, 
ANTS CRAWLING ON HER ARMS...the lurid specter of John Bigbooté staring 
at her...

INT.  THE PIT - NIGHT	373

PENNY'S CLEAR PLASTIC PURSE UNOPENED ON THE DESK BESIDE HER, as the 
Secretary of Defense suddenly knocks John O'Connor down the ladder and 
jumps into the room, injuring his ankle...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
What the hell's is going on here, Bigboote? Where's my bomber? 

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
That's 'Bigbooté'.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
I don't give a flying handshake what it is! Where's my bomber?

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ 
Let's just climb upstairs to my office and discuss this like two 
reasonable... 

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Your private life's your own concern, pal.  Where the hell is my 
bomber?  Look at this place...where's your pride?  It's like a pigsty 
down here!

	374
THE TELESCOPING ARM of John Bigbooté suddenly shooting out and lifting 
the Secretary off the floor, banging him into the wall...

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
It's not my goddamn planet!  Understand, monkey boy!? 

...BIZARRE LAMPS SWAYING as GUNFIRE upstairs prompts Bigbooté to 
release the Secretary, to urge O'Connor to head for a door off the 
hallway...

JOHN O'CONNOR
But John Whorfin said kill her. 

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
Damn John Whorfin--! 

INT.  CORRIDOR - NIGHT	375

Bigbooté and O'Connor emerging in the hallway...seen by Buckaroo Banzai 
and New Jersey as RED ARACHTOIDS...

JOHN PARKER
Look out, Buckaroo Banzai!

Buckaroo turning and just in time, the alien JOHN GOMEZ right behind 
him...and behind Gomez, John Parker and Perfect Tommy with flame 
throwers...

...Buckaroo and New Jersey hitting the deck as the RED ARACHTOID gets 
smoked, the aliens John Bigbooté and John O'Connor escaping in the 
confusion...

INT.  THE PIT - NIGHT	376

The Secretary of Defense still on the floor, spotting the OVERTHRUSTER 
in Penny's purse, taking it just as Buckaroo and New Jersey rush into 
the room...lights swaying...shadows dancing...

...the Secretary struggling to his feet as Buckaroo cuts Penny 
down...spraying her with a white insecticide, New Jersey checking her 
vital signs, Buckaroo shocking New Jersey accidentally with a jolt of 
STATIC ELECTRICITY, as the Secretary slips the OVERTHRUSTER under his 
coat...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
(to no one in particular)
It's not over yet...I'll bounce back...always have.  I'll come through 
this thing smelling like a goddamn rose-just watch me.

The Secretary limping out of the room...New Jersey trying to get 
penny's pulse while Buckaroo peels back her eyelids...

NEW JERSEY
Leave her to me. You take care of business. 

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Thanks.

Buckaroo looking at New Jersey, knowing he can trust him, rummaging 
through Penny's purse...no Overthruster...

INT.  YOYODYNE SHOCK TOWER - NIGHT	377

Dr. Lizardo and the alien John O'Connor and the alien John Bigbooté 
seeing their deteriorating position OVER A CLOSED-CIRCUIT TV...VIDEO 
IMAGES OF THE INVADING FORCES...

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Sound the call to board ship!

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
Without the crucial missing circuit?  We'll never make it! 

JOHN O'CONNOR
They are only monkey boys!  We can still crush them here--! 

Lizardo picking up a primitive INCOMPLETE OVERTHRUSTER THE SIZE OF AN 
APPLE CRATE...

DOCTOR LIZARDO
You heard my orders!  Activate the Special Horns!

INT.  FLOODED CORRIDOR - NIGHT	378

Buckaroo joining the alien John Parker, the two of them tearing down 
one of the flooded passages...suddenly covering their ears from those 
PAINFUL, EAR-SPLITTING HORNS!

INT.  ANOTHER CORRIDOR - NIGHT	379

Secretary of Defense McKinley makes his way through several RED 
ARACHTOIDS running in blind panic...SIRENS WAILING...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Coming through!  Clear it!

INT.  LAUNCH HANGAR - DAWN	380

...the light of a new day starting to glow through grimy windows...as 
down on the floor, Dr. Lizardo is about to scale a spindly ladder into 
his BIG SUSPENDED SPACESHIP...Lizardo spotting Buckaroo, John Parker 
and Hong Kong Cavaliers entering this sacred space...

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Massacre them! Without quarter! 

Dr. Lizardo pushing his own soldiers aside, scurrying into his 
SPACESHIP with John Bigbooté and John O'CONNOR.

INT.  LIZARDO'S BIG SPACESHIP - DAWN	381

no sooner inside than a cowardly order is issued to John O'Connor:

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Close the doors! 

INT.  LAUNCH HANGAR - DAWN	382

Meanwhile, the floor of the hangar...the alien John Parker using 
strange judo, the amazing Blue Shields fighting like Samurai, ducking 
STINGERS, FIREING into the enemy at point blank range...

	383
BUCKAROO SEEING Dr. Lizardo's engine start up, CLOUDS OF BLACK SMOKE 
pouring from the exhaust pipes...

	384
John Parker fighting his way toward the ship...

	385
WHILE OVER YONDER the Secretary of Defense spots the JET CAR unattended 
amid that field of weird yellow totems...

ANOTHER ANGLE	386

John Parker reaching the BIG SPACESHIP to find Buckaroo already there, 
Buckaroo taking the lead up a tall ladder that seems to reach to a REAR 
ENTRANCE.

INT.  THERMOPOD - DAWN	387

Buckaroo settling into a weird little chair, John Parker at his side, 
facing the opposite direction in a love-seat arrangement...at a wall 
cluttered with confusing instruments and a framed photo of LIZARDO...NO 
WAY INTO THE BIG SHIP FROM HERE...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
What is this thing?  A fighter?

JOHN PARKER
Don't look at me, Buckaroo Banzai.  I failed flight school.

INT.  LIZARDO'S BIG SPACESHIP - DAWN	388

John Bigbooté in the co-pilot's seat, as Doctor Lizardo attempts to 
connect his clumsy overthruster.

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Overthruster in place. 

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
It won't work! It won't! 

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Shut up, John Bigboote, you coward! 

John O'Connor pushing John Bigbooté aside as Lizardo hits another 
switch and for a fraction of a second ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE, A BLINDING 
GREEN LIGHT!

INT.  LAUNCH HANGAR - DAWN	389

The spacecraft lurches forward twelve feet!  Stops.

INT.  LIZARDO'S BIG SPACESHIP - DAWN	390

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Again, John O'Connor!  Again!

INT.  LAUNCH HANGAR - DAWN	391

...AS WITHOUT WARNING LIZARDO'S BIG SHIP LURCHES AGAIN LIKE A TETHERED 
BEAST!

ANGLE ON THE WALL PULSING!	392

INT.  THERMOPOD - DAWN	393

BUCKAROO BANZAI
They haven't got enough power.  They'll never penetrate!

INT.  LIZARDO'S BIG SPACESHIP - DAWN	394

Dr. Lizardo, a raging madman in the cockpit, using a RADIO MIKE:

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Almost!  Almost!  Lower my vehicle onto the runway!

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
No!  Please!

INT.  THERMOPOD - DAWN	395

THE DOOR SLAMMING SHUT, TRAPPING THEM...

JOHN PARKER
We're going down!  Onto the runway!

BUCKAROO BANZAI
The door's locked.

INT.  JET CAR/LAUNCH HANGAR - DAWN	396

Meanwhile, unnoticed, Secretary of Defense John McKinley reaches the 
JET CAR, starts to climb in...

SMALL VOICE
Another step, I'll drink your blood--!

The Secretary turning, not seeing anyone at first...then little Scooter 
Lindley with an M-14 trained on him...

SCOOTER LINDLEY
Get 'em up!

Scooter means business...as he suddenly demonstrates, blowing away an 
oncoming ARACHTOID before turning the gun back on the Secretary, who 
raises his hands...

SCOOTER LINDLEY
What's that?

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Can opener...just a...

Scooter taking the CURIOUS OBJECT from his prisoner, not fooled for a 
second.

INT.  LIZARDO'S BIG SPACESHIP - DAWN	397

AWFUL THUMPING VIBRARIONS as John O'Connor hits the Overthruster switch

INT.  THEMOPOD - DAWN	400

Buckaroo and John Parker rattling in their seats!  No escape...

INT.  HANGER WALL - DAWN	401

The sudden "expulsion" by the wall of a TWEEDY, FLESHY OBJECT 
RESEMBLING A LUMP OF CLAY which rapidly begins to define itself as the 
real, 1938-MODEL BLACK-HAIRED DOCTOR LIZARDO, standing in total 
bewilderment, SEVERAL 15th CENTURY BUCCANEERS spit out next, equally 
disoriented...

INT.  LIZARDO'S BIG SPACESHIP - DAWN	402

The "other Lizardo" (Whorfin) meanwhile undergoing a painful reverse 
transformation: FROM OLD MAN BACK TO RED ARACHTOID!  HIS EYES 
GLOWING...LIGHT ENERGY GLOWING INSIDE HIS MOUTH!

JOHN WHORFIN (LIZARDO)
Full speed ahead!

JOHN BIGTOOTE
We haven't a chance.  Your Overthruster's for shit!  We'll all just...

JOHN WHORFIN
One more word out of you, Bigboote...

JOHN BIGTOOTE
Bigbooté.

WHORFIN'S ARM ELONGATING, FLASHING OUT, breaking John Bigbooté's neck!  
John O'Connor moving up a notch at Yoyodyne.

INT.  THERMOPOD - DAWN	403

Buckaroo and John Parker picking up all of Whorfin's intraship 
communications...

WHORFIN'S VOICE
Full speed ahead!  Battle stations!

	404
THEIR POV OF THE HANGER AREA:  nightmarish excitement down below!  The 
floor rushing up as...

INT.  LAUNCH HANGAR - DAWN	405

The BIG SPACESHIP makes violent contact with its runway, rocketing 
ahead!

	406
THE COCKPIT POV AS THE SHIP RUSHES TOWARD THE WALL...the real Doctor 
Emillio Lizardo barely ducking out of the way!  Buccaneers scattering!

EXT.  HANGAR WALL/YOYODYNE - DAWN	407

THE BIG SPACESHIP CRASHING THROUGH THE HANGAR WALL, clumsy, heavy...

REVERSE ANGLE...WHORFIN'S BIG SPACESHIP lifting off into the dark 
morning sky, taking Buckaroo and John Parker with it on its WOBBLY, 
UNCERTAIN FLIGHT...BANKING VIOLENTLY...

INT.  FATHER SHIP - DAWN	409

The crew of BLACK ARACHTOIDS aboard the ethereal father ship also at 
their battle stations...

BLACK ARACHTOID COMMANDER
Banzai has failed!  John Whorfin is airborne!

BLACK ARACHTOID OFFICER
but not in the Eighth Dimension.  Shouldn't we wait?  Maybe John 
Parker-

BLACK ARACHTOID COMMANDER
I have my order from John Emdall!  8000 miles.  Mark.  Activate 
particle beam.  Lock on Smolensk.

INT.  THERMOPOD - DAWN	410

John Parker fiddling with a RADIO, homing in on the black ship's 
frequency, overhearing:

BLACK ARACHTOID CHATTER
Particle beam activated...lock on Smolensk...one minute to rapid 
rupture...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Tell them to stop.  They're your friends!

JOHN PARKER
I lack the authority, Buckaroo Banzai.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
At least tell them I'm trying!  Tell 'em something--!

John Parker talking to the father ship as Buckaroo struggles to unlock 
the strange little saucer from Whorfin's big vehicle.

	411
BUCKAROO'S POV (SIDE OF SHIP)...THE PROBLEM.  A SERIES OF ODD SUCTION 
DEVICES outside holding the thermopod in place.

	412
CLOSE ON DASHBOARD.  Buckaroo finally finding the proper release 
switch!

EXT.  WHORFIN'S BIG SPACESHIP - DAWN	413

CLOSE ON the SUCTION BOLTS disengaging!  Freeing the small craft!

EXT.  THERMOPOD - DAWN	414

His vehicle falling sideways, John Parker trying to ignite its ENGINES!

INT.  THERMOPOD - DAWN	415

In a free fall, the engines finally igniting and the thermopod 
rocketing upward!

INT.  FATHER SHIP - DAWN	416

BLACK ARACHTOID OFFICER
Sir, a thermopod has peeled off from Whorfin's ship!

BLACK ARACHTOID COMMANDER
So what?  Big deal.  Stand by to incinerate Smolensk.

INT. THERMOPOD - DAWN	417

Buckaroo struggling to master the strange craft...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Does this thing have guns, John Parker?

JOHN PARKER
Boy, I hope so, Buckaroo Banzai.

John Parker trying a likely button.

	418
ANGLE THROUGH WINDSHIELD...ACTIVATING THE OVERTHRUSTER BEAM WHICH 
BLASTS OUT HARMLESSLY INTO THE MORNING SKY RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM.

EXT.  SUBURBAN SKIES - DAWN	419

SPACESHIPS THUNDER over the lights of the awakening city below...

INT.  THEMOPOD - DAWN	420

BLACK ARACHTOID CHATTER

Twenty seconds to rapid rupture.  Two zero.  Prepare the heat shields!

Time running out...Buckaroo receiving fire from Whorfin's big 
spaceship, THE SMALL VEHICLE LURCHING...THE TWO VEHICLES ON A COLLISION 
COURSE!

EXT.  THERMOPOD - DAWN	421

The little ship dropping like a stone, barely avoiding a head-on with 
Whorfin and company!

INT.  THERMOPOD - DAWN	422

Buckaroo unhappy with John Parker's marksmanship...their "love seat" 
rotating, reversing their functions...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Take the throttle, John Parker!

INT.  WHORFIN'S BIG SPACESHIP - DAWN	423

John Whorfin and John O'Connor scrambling into evasive action, but it's 
too late.

INT.  THERMOPOD - DAWN	424

Buckaroo Banzai and John Parker diving toward them, their OVERTHRUSTER 
FIRING!  FIRING!

INT.  WHORFIN'S BIG SPACESHIP - DAWN	425

Whorfin shaking his RED FIST in defiance...

JOHN WHORFIN
Banzai!  I'll see you in hell!

INT.  THERMOPOD - DAWN	426

FLYING ON A COLLISION COURSE once again, THE OVERTHRUSTER BEAM FINALLY 
HITTING HOME AND THE BIG SPACESHIP DISINTEGRATING, VAPORIZING...John 
Whorfin and his ilk history...

	427
REVERSE ANGLE ON John Parker...still on a collision course with the 
GIANT BALL OF HOT VAPOR THAT WAS LORD WHORFIN...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Pull up!  We did it!  Holy shit, we did it!  Pull up!

JOHN PARKER
Now, Buckaroo Banzai?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Now!

EXT.  YOYODYNE - DAWN	428

As the Cavaliers and Blue Shields anxiously watch, THE SKY CRACKLES AND 
THE CLOUDS GLOW!

INT.  FATHER SHIP - DAWN	429

BLACK ARACHTOID RADAR
John Whorfin destroyed!

BLACK ARACHTOID COMMANDER
Deactivate particle beam!  Tracking zero zero zero!

EXT.  SKY - DAWN	430

The sun coming up...and as we wonder what terrible fate has befallen 
Buckaroo Banzai and John Parker...A TINY FIGURE APPEARS high in the 
clouds!  A BIZARRE PARACHUTE catching the wind, floating lazily to 
earth.

	431
CLOSER SHOT: Buckaroo!  Safe and sound, looking up and SALUTING John 
Parker as the little THERMOPOD flip-flops, tumbles heavenward AT AN 
INCREDIBLE RATE OF SPEED...heading home.

EXT.  YOYODYNE - DAWN	432

Buckaroo touching down...Professor Hikita among the victorious Blue 
Shields scarcely able to believe his eyes as he spots...no, it can't 
be...rising from the debris...

PROF. HIKITA
Emilio!

Now it's the young Doctor Lizardo's turn to stare incredulously...

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Toichi--?  I'll be damned.

The two scientists approaching one another...afraid to touch as if the 
other might prove a mirage...

	433
RENO FINDING A CUTLASS ON THE GROUND...as Buckaroo, face blackened with 
soot, his clothing torn, hurries toward several Blue Shields (gas masks 
off) herding a half-dozen "HUMAN" PRISONERS while other Shields and 
Cavaliers share congratulatory handshakes...RED STINGERS still stuck in 
their bullet-proof vests...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
All accounted for?  Where's Penny?

PERFECT TOMMY
New Jersey brought her back to the bus through heavy fire.  Quite a guy 
if you want my opinion.

Perfect Tommy and Reno pacing Buckaroo...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Got a casualty list?

RENO
Just their side.  What're we gonna do with these people?  They're 
illegal aliens, the way I figure, been here forty years, you could 
throw the book at 'em...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
And ask the American taxpayer to foot the bill?  No way.  Send 'em back 
to the Eighth Dimension as soon as we find the Overthruster.  It wasn't 
in Penny's purse...so if we have to run this joint upside down and 
inside out...

Perfect Tommy whistling...

PERFECT TOMMY
Hey, Scooter Lindley, fall in!

Scooter's eyes lighting up as he runs over...

SCOOTER LINDLEY
Is this what you're looking for, Buckaroo?

The Oscillation Overthruster, safe and sound.  Buckaroo amazed, 
receiving the precious object, giving Scooter a Blue Shield 
salute...the Secretary of Defense watching jealously from a short 
distance, his clothing disheveled...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Looks like one Junior Shield is in line for a ride in The Jet Car.

SCOOTER LINDLEY
Wow, you know it!
(suddenly crestfallen)
I'll have to ask my dad.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Well, go ahead, what're you waiting for?

Scooter running off.

	434
A dour-faced, shaken New Jersey appears in the doorway of the big bus, 
Buckaroo's smile immediately vanishing...

NEW JERSEY
I did all I could.  I did my best...

Buckaroo racing past new Jersey and into the bus...

INT.  PASSENGER SECTION/BUT - DAWN	435

Buckaroo hurrying through the front section.

INT.  WORLD WATCH ONE/BUS - DAWN	436

Buckaroo hurrying through the COMMUNICATIONS NERVE CENTER...

RADAR SHIELD ONE
Buckaroo, Reno said check with you - something about "pirates"?  He 
mean the baseball team?

No response.

RADAR SHIELD TWO
Buckaroo, the President's on line on.  Calling about is everything okay 
with the alien space cloud and Planet Ten...or should he just go ahead 
and destroy Russia...? 

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Tell him yes on "1" and no on "2". 

Buckaroo going into his PRIVATE REAR SECTION of the bus...

RADAR SHIELD TWO
Which was "yes"? Destroy Russia? Or "2"...?

INT. BEDROOM/BUS - DAWN	437

Buckaroo reaching his private quarters, finding Penny on his cot, a 
sheet pulled over her face...ethereal morning light caressing her still 
body...

...Buckaroo distraught, pulling the sheet back to reveal Penny in final 
repose, speckled with dead ants, honey and powdery white insecticide... 
Buckaroo leaning toward her in wordless anguish.

	438
His lips moving toward hers...when suddenly a SPARK LEAPS OUT, ARCING 
FROM THE TIP OF BUCKAROO'S NOSE TO THE TIP OF PENNY'S!

	439
And she stirs...a faint nerve response, Buckaroo seizing her with both 
hands...SPARKS...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Penny!

...shaking her, exhorting her...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Open your eyes!  Look at me!  Penny!

...but nothing, no more signs of life...

	440
...Buckaroo kissing her in despair, pressing his lips against her 
lips...the kiss of the century, A POWERFUL ELECTRIC JOLT!

	441
...the fire of life as Penny opens her eyes, sees her haggard hero 
before her.

PENNY PRIDDY
Buckaroo...you look awful.

	442
And indeed they both do, but who cares?  ANOTHER GALVANIC KISS, 
CRACKLING GOOD as the tiny bedroom heats up and we do the decent 
thing...IRIS OUT...as CREDITS ROLL and the FANTASTIC VOICE OF Dr. 
Buckaroo Banzai serenades us home...

...the Hong Kong Cavaliers harmonizing like honey, the world once again 
a safe, snug harbor.

               FADE IN:

               INT. C-130 HERCULES TURBO-PROP - NIGHT

               Eighteen combat-ready special forces, wearing assault black, 
               jump packs and combat gear, stare down the deep end of a 
               greasy ramp into the night sky.  Village lights flicker 19,000 
               feet below.

               The STRIKE FORCE LEADER signals to his team.

               Without a moment's hesitation, they dive into the darkness 
               and plummet toward earth.

               EXT. MANSION - NIGHT

               A military GUARD, old Soviet-style uniform, rounds the corner 
               of the large estate toting an AK-47.

               A red laser dot appears briefly on his forehead and, after a 
               beat, the red dot seems to bleed.  The Guard collapses dead.  
               Two other GUARDS are dispatched with single, silenced shots.

               A Strike Team member at a junction box awaits a signal.

               Through infra-red binoculars the strike Force Leader watches 
               his assault troops as they take positions.

                                     STRIKE FORCE LEADER
                              (into headset/in 
                              Russian)
                         GO!

               On the estate - as the power goes out.  The team on the 
               mansion's front porch pops the door and pours in.

               INT. MANSION - NIGHT

               FOLLOWING - the FIVE TEAM MEMBERS as they rush a stairway in 
               phalanx formation.  They nearly knock over an old lady, who 
               in turn lets out a blood curdling scream.

               UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR -

               The team kicks open a door.  Rushes into the room.

               INT. BEDROOM -

               Assault weapons pointed at the bed.  The soldiers yank back 
               bedsheets to reveal IVAN STRAVANAVITCH, a middle-aged man 
               and his half-naked 18-year-old concubine.

                                     SOLDIER
                              (in Russian)
                         Get up, now!  Up!

               The soldiers pull Stravanavitch to his feet and haul him out 
               of the room.

               FOLLOWING -  As they push down the hallway.

               MANSION SECURITY GUARDS rally with haphazard gunfire.

               Out come the strike force's flash-bang grenades.  Exploding 
               everywhere, disorienting Stravanavitch's men.

               EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

               Signal flares burn as a helicopter descends on the position.  
               The Strike Team evacuates across the field and forces a 
               struggling Stravanavitch into the low-hovering copter.

               The commandos swiftly board the craft as a handful of 
               Stravanavitch's guards break into the clearing.  They open 
               fire.

               And the mounted machine guns on the helicopter return.

               One of the Strike Team members takes a bullet to the neck.  
               He's' pulled by his comrades into the chopper as it lifts 
               into the sky, its guns spitting lead...

                         The SOUNDS of a dinner banquet.  
                         Forks clanking against plates and 
                         the din of a hundred conversations, 
                         broken by...

               The DING, DING, DING of a SPOON tapping against a wine glass.

               FADE IN:

               INT. BANQUET ROOM - NIGHT

               Hundreds of men and women in formal evening wear sit at round 
               banquet tables.  A HUSH falls over the guests as the DINGING 
               continues.  All attention turns to the front table.

               A rotund, silver haired-man in his late sixties rises and 
               sidles past U.S. and Russian flags up to the podium 
               microphone.  He is STOLI PETROV, President of Russia.

                                     PETROV
                              (in Russian)
                         Thank you for joining us this evening.

               Petrov's harsh Russian issues through the room.  But over it 
               we hear a young woman's voice translating.

                                     TRANSLATOR (V.0.)
                         Tonight we are honored to have with 
                         us a man of remarkable courage, who, 
                         despite strong international 
                         criticism...

               AT THE FRONT TABLE -

               A translator's words ring in the earpiece of a handsome man 
               in his mid-forties.  Worry lines crease his forehead and the 
               touch of gray at his temples attest to three very difficult 
               years in office.

               This man is JAMES MARSHALL, and he is the PRESIDENT of the 
               UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.  He busily makes last minute changes 
               to his speech.

                                     TRANSLATOR
                              (V.0. earpiece)
                         Has chosen to join our fight against 
                         tyranny in forging a new world 
                         community.  Ladies and gentlemen, I 
                         give you the President of the United 
                         States of America...

               Mr. President.

               Thunderous applause as Marshall rises and approaches the 
               podium.

               At the back of the room, DOHERTY, a senior policy adviser 
               whispers to the President's Chief of Staff ED SHEPHERD...

                                     DOHERTY
                         Maybe we should consider running him 
                         for re-election instead of the U.S.

               The applause dies as Marshall begins to speak.

                                     MARSHALL
                              (in Russian with 
                              subtitles)
                         Good evening and thank you.  First I 
                         would ask you to join me in a moment 
                         of silence for the victims of the 
                         Turkmenistan massacres.

               The room remains silent a few beats.  Most guests respectfully 
               bow their heads.

               Marshall begins again, but this time in English.  The young 
               woman translates simultaneously for the Russian audience.

                                     MARSHALL
                         As you know, three weeks ago American 
                         Special Forces, in cooperation with 
                         the Russian Republican Army, secured 
                         the arrest of Turkmenistan's self-
                         proclaimed dictator, General Ivan 
                         Stravanavitch, whose brutal sadistic 
                         reign had given new meaning to the 
                         word horror.  I am proud to say our 
                         operation was a success.

               Applause from the audience.  Marshall turns the page on his 
               speech.

                                     MARSHALL
                         And now, yesterday's biggest threat 
                         to world peace... today awaits trial 
                         for crimes against humanity.

               During the applause, Marshall pulls a page from the speech, 
               folds it and slides it into his pocket.  He removes his 
               glasses and looks out into the crowd.  His tone becomes more 
               personal.

               He's not reciting the speech anymore.

                                     MARSHALL
                         What we did here was important.  We 
                         finally pulled our heads out of the 
                         sand, we finally stood up to the 
                         brutality and said "We've had enough.  
                         Every time we ignore these atrocities-- 
                         the rapes, the death squads, the 
                         genocides- every time we negotiate 
                         with these, these thugs to keep them 
                         out of gig country and away from gig 
                         families, every time we do thiS.E. 
                         we legitimize terror.

               Terror is not a legitimate system of government.  And to 
               those who commit the atrocities I say, we will no longer 
               tolerate, we will no longer negotiate, and we will no longer 
               be afraid.  It's your turn to be afraid.

               Applause rolls through the crowd.

               EXT. MOSCOW INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - NIGHT

               Sprawling terminals spread out to runways like tentacles.

               ON THE TARMAC -

               Bathed in floodlights, perched majestically on the runway, 
               dwarfing nearby commuter and military jets, stands...

                                     AIR FORCE ONE
                         The President's own Boeing 747-200, 
                         dubbed "the flying White House".  
                         The distinctive royal blue stripe 
                         over a thin gold line tapers to a 
                         tail adorned with the American flag 
                         and the Presidential Seal Secret 
                         Service agents and Marines stand 
                         guard at the aircraft's perimeter.

               A RUSSIAN NEWS VAN emerges from the darkness and pulls to a 
               stop by a Secret Service barricade.

               SPECIAL AGENT GIBBS greets the Russian news team that emerges.

                                     GIBBS
                         Gentlemen, welcome to Air Force One.

               Please present your equipment to Special Agent Walters for 
               inspection.

               The news team's segment producer, a crusty old Russian named 
               KORSHUNOV raises his big bushy eyebrows.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         We've already been inspected.

                                     GIBBS
                         Sir, this plane carries the President 
                         of the United States.

               Though we wish to extend your press service every courtesy, 
               you will comply with our security measures to the letter.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Of course.  I'm sorry.

               Korshunov and the FIVE MEMBERS of his news crew present their 
               video cameras, sound equipment and supplies to Special Agent 
               WALTERS for inspection.  Secret Service DOGS sniff through 
               the baggage.

                                     GIBBS
                         Please place your thumbs on the ID 
                         pad.

               Korshunov puts his thumb on the ID pad of a portable computer.

               The computer matches up his thumbprint with his dossier and 
               photograph.  "CLEARED" flashes on the computer screen.

               INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

               The President, walking with his entourage.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         *                     CBS said they'll 
                         give us four minutes.  They thought 
                         the Russian was a nice touch.

                                     MARSHALL
                         I always wondered if my freshman 
                         Russian class would come in handy.

                                     DOHERTY
                         Sir, you threw out page two.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Goddamn right I did.  I asked for a 
                         tough-as-nails speech and you gave 
                         me diplomatic bullshit.  What's the 
                         point in having a speech if I have 
                         to ad-lib?

                                     DOHERTY
                         It was a good ad-lib, sir.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Thanks.  Wrote it last night.

               The President exits the building and enters his limousine.

               EXT. TARMAC - AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT

               Walters hands the bags back to the Russians.

                                     WALTERS
                         Equipment checks out.

               A striking woman in her early thirties descends Air Force 
               One's stairway.  MARIA MITCHELL.

                                     GIBBS
                         Gentlemen, this is Maria Mitchell.

               Press Relations for the Presidential Flight Office.  She'll 
               take you from here.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Ms.  Mitchell.  So nice to finally 
                         meet you in person.

                                     MITCHELL
                         The President and I were delighted 
                         that we could accommodate you.  Now 
                         if you're all cleared?
                              (Gibbs nods)
                         You can follow me then.

               They ascend into the belly of Air Force One.

                                     MITCHELL
                         *                    I'll be giving 
                         you a brief tour, then during the 
                         flight, two members of your crew 
                         will be allowed out of the press 
                         area at a time for filming.  You 
                         will have exactly ten minutes with 
                         the President and twenty with the 
                         crew...

               EXT. STREETS OF MOSCOW, PRESIDENT'S MOTORCADE - NIGHT

               Winding its way down narrow cobblestone streets onto a major 
               thoroughfare.

               INT. PRESIDENTIAL LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

               The limousine is packed with advisers, aides, military staff, 
               including LT. COL. PERKINS, the keeper of the NUCLEAR FOOTBALL 
               handcuffed to his wrist.  In the b.g. on the limo's television 
               set, the LARRY KING SHOW indulges in its normal banter.

               Marshall wearily rubs his temples as he stifles a yawn.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         You wanna knock of f?

                                     MARSHALL
                         No, no.  I'm fine.  What did the 
                         Speaker say?

                                     SHEPHERD
                         He and the NRA don't like the wording.

                                     DOHERTY
                         Apparently taking uzis away from 
                         sixth graders isn't as popular as we 
                         thought it'd be.  Representative 
                         Taylor is working on a compromise.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Put together a score sheet.  I'll 
                         make some calls.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         With all due respect, sir, maybe you 
                         should give them this one.  Your 
                         numbers are still pretty low and you 
                         called in a lot of chips to nail 
                         Stravanavitch.

                                     MARSHALL
                         I might still have a few chips left.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         *                     We could always 
                         put you in a duck blind with a twelve 
                         gauge.  The second amendment types'll 
                         love that.

                                     MARSHALL
                         This is a crime bill, Shep.  Killing 
                         a couple ducks won't get it through 
                         committee.  Besides, Shep, I told 
                         you...  I don't shoot babies and I 
                         don't kiss guns.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         Other way around, sir.

                                     MARSHALL
                              (realizing what he 
                              said)
                         Right... Christ I'm tired.  Do me a 
                         favor and keep me away from the press.

               Marshall's watch alarm beeps and he automatically reaches 
               into his breast pocket, pulls out a medicine vial and downs 
               two pills with a coffee chaser.

               On the T.V.

                                     LARRY KING (T.V.)
                         ... and your reaction to the 
                         President's trip to Moscow.  Good or 
                         bad?

               Shepherd turns up the volume.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         This is the part I wanted you to 
                         see.

                                     REP. DANFORTH (T.V.)
                         Criminal.  One of our boys died in 
                         Marshall's little publicity stunt 
                         and for what?  So we could claim 
                         victory over another country's 
                         problems instead of our own?  And 
                         now he's got the nerve to prance 
                         around Moscow gloating, while that 
                         poor boy's family is left to bury 
                         him.  If I were Marshall, I'd be 
                         ashamed of myself.

                                     LARRY KING
                         There you have it.  Harsh words for 
                         the President from Michael Danforth, 
                         the Speaker of the House.

               Marshall mutes the television.  A quiet moment.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         *                     My opinion.  
                         We can't let him get away with that 
                         kind of language.

               Marshall considers.  Then decides.

                                     MARSHALL
                         It's bait.  Don't take it.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked 
                         this administration on national 
                         television.  You can't afford to 
                         leave that hanging.

                                     MARSHALL
                              (ignoring Shepherd)
                         Did we tape the Duke game?

                                     AIDE
                         It's waiting on the plane.  The ending 
                         was pretty...

                                     MARSHALL
                              (interrupting)
                         Please don't tell me.  Just for once, 
                         *                     let me be 
                         surprised.

               INT. AIR FORCE ONE, CORRIDOR, TRAVELING - NIGHT

               Maria Mitchell escorts the Russians down the plane's length.  
               As they pass the galley, Maria motions up a set of stairs.

                                     MITCHELL
                         Up on the upper deck is the cockpit 
                         and the Mission Communication Center.  
                         The MCC, as we call it, can place 
                         clear and secure phone calls to 
                         anywhere on earth.  We're linked to 
                         a network of military and civilian 
                         satellites and ground stations.  We 
                         could run the country or run a war 
                         from there if we had to.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         This is a remarkable aircraft.

                                     MITCHELL
                         You don't know the half of it.  Did 
                         you know this entire plane is shielded 
                         from radiation?  We could fly through 
                         a mushroom cloud completely unharmed 
                         if necessary.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         A dubious distinction, no?

                                     MITCHELL
                         I guess it depends on your 
                         perspective.

               They walk by several conference rooms, running down the 
               starboard side of the plane.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         And all these rooms here?

                                     MITCHELL
                         Conference rooms, though some have 
                         other functions.  The one up front 
                         doubles as an emergency medical 
                         center.

               Past the conference rooms, they walk by a small side room 
               where SECRETARIES work on computers, generating documents.

                                     MITCHELL
                         As you can see, back here's more 
                         like a regular plane.  Security and 
                         Secret Service take this cabin.
                         You'll be in the rear with the press 
                         pool.

               The REAR PRESS CABIN, just ahead of the rear galley and bank 
               of bathrooms.  A handful of disgruntled reporters feign sleep.

                                     MITCHELL
                         Here's a press kit.  I'll let you 
                         guys get comfortable and once we're 
                         airborne I'll be able to schedule 
                         the interviews.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Thank you.

               Mitchell exits forward.  One of the reporters stirs and looks 
               up at the news team.  He groans.  Space is a premium back 
               here.

                                     REPORTER
                         You fellas win some sort of fly-with-

                                     KORSHUNOV

                         my row.  You'll have to sit over 
                         there.

               Korshunov trades looks with his news team.

               EXT. MOSCOW INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - NIGHT

               The President's motorcade pulls up in front of Air Force 
               One.

               INT. AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT

               The President and his entourage ascend from the lower deck 
               platform onto the main deck.  COL. DANIEL AXELROD, Air Force 
               One's pilot, snaps off a salute as he passes.

                                     COL. AXELROD
                         Welcome aboard, Mr. President.

                                     MARSHALL
                              (returns salute)
                         Hey Danny.  How's it look tonight?

                                     COL. AXELROD
                         Glassy, sir.  Care to take the wheel?

                                     MARSHALL
                         You keep offering, one of these days 
                         I'll take you up on it.
                              (to no one in 
                              particular)
                         Rose and Alice back yet?

                                     AIDE
                         No, Mr. President.  The ballet ran 
                         late.  Their ETA is seventeen minutes.

               Marshall nods as he pulls off his bow tie and enters his 
               stateroom.  Shepherd follows two steps behind.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         Mr. President?

               Marshall halts Shepherd with a gesture.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Thirty seconds.

               Shepherd nods and waits by the door.  Lt. Col. Perkins takes 
               a seat outside the Presidents stateroom and opens the latest 
               Tom Clancy thriller, using the nuclear football as a lap 
               desk.

               INT. PRESIDENT'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

               Marshall collapses on the couch, rubs his eyes, then closes 
               them.  A moment of peace in a breakneck day.

               The knock at the door jars him.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Yes.

               Shepherd enters.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         Can I at least issue a press release 
                         objecting to the Speaker's choice of 
                         wording?

               President Marshall picks up one of the many phones in his 
               office.

                                     MARSHALL
                         I said it's not worth the fight.
                              (into phone)
                         Steward, please.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         We'll just say it was in bad taste.

               *                               MARSHALL

               Forget it, Shep.  The kid gave his life for his country and 
               the

               Speaker's a bastard for turning him into a sound bite.  I'll 
               take the heat.  Understood?

                                     SHEPHERD
                         You give me ulcers.

                                     MARSHALL
                         That's my job.

               A STEWARD enters the room.

                                     STEWARD
                         Mr. President?

                                     MARSHALL
                         Hey Mike.  Could you get me a 
                         Heineken?

                                     SHEPHERD
                         No, wait.  Get him one of the Russian 
                         beers.

               The steward nods and disappears from the room.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         We've got those Russian news guys on 
                         board and it'll look good in the 
                         papers.

               Marshall picks up a stack of policy reports.  Thumbs through 
               them.

                                     MARSHALL
                         C'mon Shep.  I've been eating borscht 
                         and drinking vodka for days.  Isn't 
                         that enough?
                              (off paper)
                         New home starts are down.

               The steward arrives with the Russian beer.  Marshall takes a 
               swig.  He swallows hard.  Piss-water.  Marshall crosses to 
               his sink and pours the beer out.  He hands the bottle to the 
               steward.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Fill this with Heineken.

               The steward nods...

                                     STEWARD
                         Yes, Mr. President.

               AND SLINKS AWAY WITH THE BOTTLE. MARSHALL CATCHES HIMSELF --

                                     MARSHALL
                         I don't believe this.  I'm playing 
                         politics with a bottle of beer.  A 
                         goddamn bottle of beer.  I've been 
                         in office too long.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         Look on the bright side... if the 
                         polls don't change, you won't have 
                         that problem, sir.

               Marshall picks up the phone again.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Yeah.  Put the Duke game on in my 
                         room.

               INT. AFO'S MISSION COMMUNICATION CENTER - NIGHT

               THREE Air Force SPECIALISTS man the elaborate communication 
               system occupying much of the upper deck.  Top-of-the-line 
               computers, communication systems, video decks, and satellite 
               receivers.

                                     AIR FORCE SPECIALIST
                         Yes, Mr. President.

               He slides in a videotape and channels the feed to the *         
               president's stateroom.

               INT. PRESIDENT'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

               A monitor comes to life with a basketball game.

                                     MARSHALL
                              (to Shepherd)
                         Defense and State Department in the 
                         conference room in one hour.  I want 
                         to review the Iraq situation.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         Yes, sir.

               Shepherd exits as Marshall settles into his leather chair 
               and dives into work.  He punches a button on the speakerphone.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Get me the Housing Secretary...

               EXT. AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT

               The Marine Guards snap to attention once again as the First 
               Lady's motorcade arrives.

               ROSE MARSHALL, a self-assured woman with an aristocratic 
               gleam, alights from her limo.  She takes a few steps, then 
               turns, tapping her foot impatiently.

                                     ROSE
                         C'mon Alice, we're 20 minutes late.

               Your father's gonna have a fit.

               ALICE, the President's 13-year-old daughter, straggles out 
               of the car, rolling her eyes.

                                     ALICE
                         It's not like he hasn't made us wait 
                         a few times.

                                     ROSE
                         Well, you aren't the President, dear.

                                     ALICE
                         Yeah, no duh.

               INT. MAIN DECK, AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT

               As the First Lady's entourage enters.

                                     ROSE
                         Why don't you go say hi?

               Again, Alice rolls her eyes.

                                     ROSE
                         What is wrong with you tonight?  
                         Come here.

               Rose pulls Alice aside.

                                     ROSE
                         You don't want to say hi to your 
                         father?

                                     ALICE
                         I'm sure he's busy.

                                     ROSE
                         Don't you even want to ask?

               Alice toes her foot into the carpet as she releases an 
               exasperated sigh.  She is, in this moment, the patron saint 
               of know-it-all 13-year-old girls.  Alice waves toward the 
               Presidential Suite.

                                     ALICE
                         If I go over there to say hi to daddy 
                         President, Mike's going to tell me 
                         he's in a meeting and can't be 
                         disturbed.  Then when the plane starts 
                         to taxi, he'll come out and say "Hey, 
                         are you guys back?  Did you enjoy 
                         the ballet?"  But he'll be on his 
                         way to another meeting and won't 
                         wait for an answer.  Then you'll get 
                         pissed at him and he'll get pissed 
                         at you.  It's like you guys rehearse 
                         or something.

               With the weight of the entire world on her shoulders, Alice

               Collapses into one of the many leather chairs.  It seems to 
               swallow her.  JORY, a steward passes.

                                     ALICE
                         Hey Joey, how `bout a cocoa, double 
                         whip cream.

                                     ROSE
                         Alice...

                                     ALICE
                         Mom, just this once, give it a rest.

                                     ROSE
                         You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about 
                         this back...

                                     ALICE
                         Back at The Fishbowl?

               Alice eyes the swirl of Aides who are pretending to work 
               nearby.

               But it's obvious that they're eavesdropping.  Alice smiles 
               and waves at them dramatically.

                                     ROSE
                         We'll talk at home.
                              (beat)
                         You know, most girls aren't as lucky 
                         as you.  For most girls seeing the 
                         Bolshoi ballet would be the experience 
                         of a lifetime.

                                     ALICE
                         I know, Mom.
                              (sees the hurt in her 
                              mom's eyes and softens)
                         It was great... really.

               Rose nods, smiling a half-smile.  After a thoughtful beat, 
               Alice gets up and crosses to the Presidential suite.  She 
               exchanges words with the Aide standing outside the door and 
               comes back, covering her disappointment.

                                     ALICE
                         He's in a meeting.  He can't be 
                         disturbed.

                                     ROSE
                         I'm sorry, honey.

                                     ALICE
                         No, it's okay.  After all, he is the 
                         President, right?

               Joey the steward hands her her cocoa with a wink and a smile.

               Her eyes light up at the mound of whip cream on top.

                                     ALICE
                         When I write my memoirs I think I'll 
                         devote an entire chapter to the cocoa 
                         aboard Air Force One.

                                     ROSE
                         Your father never means to be so...

                                     ALICE
                         I know...
                              (beat)
                         But lotsa times I feel like it's me 
                         versus the world.  Some kid at school 
                         teases me and the same day a plague 
                         breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it 
                         doesn't take a genius to figure which 
                         is more important.

                                     ROSE
                         Some kids were teasing you?

                                     ALICE
                         That's not really the point.

               A quiet pause, then...

                                     ROSE
                         You're right and I'll tell you a 
                         secret.  I know exactly how you feel.

                                     ALICE
                         Big secret.  You said the same thing 
                         to Newsweek.

               The plane jolts forward as it begins to taxi.

                                     ALICE
                         We're taxiing.  Ready.  And... five...  
                         four... three.. two... one... Cue 
                         Daddy.

               Alice points.  And as if on cue, Marshall exits from his 
               office and checks his watch.

                                     ALICE
                         Oooooh, I'm good.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Hey, you guys back already?

               Alice nods.

                                     MARSHALL
                         How was...
                              (thinks, then remembers)
                         ...the ballet?

                                     ALICE
                              (theatrically)
                         It was the experience of a lifetime.

                                     MARSHALL
                         How `bout a hug for the old man.

               Alice rises and hugs her father.  A White House PHOTOGRAPHER 
               snaps off a few shots for the papers.  Alice makes a face at 
               them.  A second later, Shepherd comes up the corridor, 
               breaking up the pair.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         Mr. President... they're ready for 
                         you in the conference room.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Okay.  Hey, pumpkin, you'll tell me 
                         all about it later, right?

                                     ALICE
                         Sure.

               As Marshall moves toward the conference room, he bends and 
               gives Rose a quick peck on the cheek.  It all reeks of 
               formality.

                                     ROSE
                         May I speak to you for a moment?

                                     MARSHALL
                         Can't it wait?

                                     ROSE
                         No, Mr. President.  It can't.

               INT.  PRESIDENT'S OFFICE.

               Rose shuts the door behind them.  As she starts to speak, 
               Marshall pulls her into a long passionate kiss.  Rose pulls 
               away.

                         Don't.  I know spin control when I 
                         feel it.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Rose, I don't have time for this.

               I've gotta go stop a war.

                                     ROSE
                         For godsakes, Jim, slow down and 
                         stop acting like the little dutch 
                         boy.  Not even you can plug all the 
                         world's leaks.  Don't you think it's 
                         a sign you're pushing too hard when 
                         your daughter sees more of you on 
                         MTV news than in person.

                                     MARSHALL
                         She's a big girl.  She understands.

                                     ROSE
                         How do you know she understands?  
                         You haven't spent more than five 
                         minutes with her, or me, in weeks.

                                     MARSHALL
                         And when have I had five minutes?
                         When I wake up in the morning and 
                         I'm already three hours behind 
                         Schedule.  What do you want me to 
                         do, Rose, tell the G7 to fuck off 
                         because I'm a family man?

                                     (BEAT)
                         I'm sorry. That wasn't fair.

                                     ROSE
                         No. It wasn't.

               He takes her in his arms.

                                     MARSHALL
                         You know what?

                                     ROSE
                         What?

                                     MARSHALL
                         I miss you. And I miss her.

                                     ROSE
                         But that's the point, Jim. We're                     
                         right here.

                                     MARSHALL
                         I wish it were that easy...

               Long beat. He smiles at her, it's the same sweet smile that 
               won her heart, the same smile that got him elected. She 
               softens.

                                     MARSHALL
                         I'll make it up to you, I promise.

                                     ROSE
                         I should trust that promise? Because 
                         you know the voters are still waiting 
                         for that middle class tax cut.

                                     MARSHALL
                         This promise isn't subject to 
                         Congressional approval.

               She smiles. The tension breaks.

                                     ROSE
                         How did your speech go?

                                     MARSHALL
                         Well, they aren't burning me in 
                         effigy. That's always a good sign.

               They kiss again, this time for real. But... a knock on the 
               door.

                                     SHEPHERD (0.5.)
                         Mr. President.

               Shepherd opens the door.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Look on the bright side, hon. Shep 
                         here thinks I'll be a one termer.

                                     ROSE
                         Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to 
                         schedule your daughter in?

                                     SHEPHERD
                         She is scheduled. Her school play's 
                         Tuesday night.

               Rose rolls her eyes.

                                     MARSHALL
                         The First Lady was making a joke, 
                         Shep. I'll make some time, Rose. I 
                         promise.

               Marshall heads for his meeting.

               EXT. COCKPIT - NIGHT

               Col. Axelrod and his co-pilot LT. COL. ARTHUR INGRAHAMS are 
               at the wheel.

               RUSSIAN AIR TRAFFIC (V.0)

                                     (THICK ACCENT)
                         United States Air Force One, this is 
                         tower. It's an honor to clear you 
                         for immediate take-off on runway 
                         three.

                                     COL. AXELROD
                         Roger, Tower. And thank you for the 
                         hospitality.

               Axeirod eases up the throttle and the four GE-F103 Turbofan 
               engines spring to life.

               EXT. RUNWAY - NIGHT

               A picture perfect take-off as Air Force One slides through 
               the moonlight and skates upward on a sheet of air.

               INT. AIR FORCE ONE, GALLEY - NIGHT

               Aircraft engines drone.

               CLOSE ON - A coffee pot pouring piping joe into a mug 
               emblazoned with ubiguitou Presidential Seal. The mug is placed 
               on a tray with a half-dozen other mugs and passed to a STEW. 
               He carries the tray down the corridor past passenger cabins.

               Drowsiness has overtaken the plane. Many of the passengers 
               and aides are asleep. CNN plays On T.V. sets, entertaining 
               the few night owls and news junkies.

                                     CNN REPORTER (T.V.)
                         In an unusually aggressive speech, 
                         the President characterized the 
                         Stravanavitch regime as thugs whose 
                         brutality will no longer be tolerated.  
                         Meanwhile, in Turkmenistan, 
                         Stravanavitch's ouster has sent the 
                         country into turmoil.  Tens of 
                         thousands of refugees continue to 
                         huddle in U.N. safe havens, as rival 
                         Stravanavitch loyalists fight among 
                         themselves for control. But at least 
                         for the time being, the ethnic 
                         cleansing has been stopped.

               Toward the front of the plane, the steward enters the 
               conference room.

               INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

               As the steward closes the door behind him, all background 
               noise disappears. We are in a sound shielded room. Even the 
               engines' drone cannot be heard.

               The lights in the room are dim as MAJOR CALDWELL, a military 
               advisor, projects satellite photos of Iraqi military bases 
               onto a screen.

               The steward serves coffee as unobtrusively as he can while 
               the meeting continues.

                                     MAJOR CALDWELL
                         Our KH-ll's took this one at 0100 
                         hours. What you see here is the 
                         mobilization of two mechanized 
                         brigades.

                                     MARSHALL
                         They've gotta be joking.

                                     DOHERTY
                         The Iraqi ambassador is claiming 
                         it's just an exercise.

                                     MARSHALL
                         An exercise in futility. Send the 
                         Nimitz back in.

                                     MAJOR CALDWELL
                         The northern border's gotten a bit 
                         hairy. Their MiGs are playing tag 
                         with our Tomcats and our boys are 
                         just itching to engage.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Tell our boys to cool their jets. I 
                         don't need `em creating policy for 
                         me.

               We follow the steward as he slips out of the conference room 
               and back into the...

               INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               with a few coffees left on his tray. One of them is scooped 
               up by Gibbs as he passes, his nose is buried in a fax.

               INT. SECRET SERVICE CABIN - NIGHT

               Gibbs leans in the cabin.

                                     GIBBS
                         Hey Walters, you and Johnson come 
                         here a second. Reykjavik just sent 
                         the advance team report.

               Special Agents Walters and JOHNSON rise and follow Gibbs 
               into an adjoining office.

               INT. OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

               Gibbs closes the door behind the two agents. As Walters and 
               Johnson take their seats, Gibbs WITHDRAWS HIS WEAPON and...

               SHOOTS each of the agents in THE BACK OF THE HEAD.

               Silenced pistol. Blood all over the desk. Gibbs removes each 
               of the agent's weapons and slips them into his waistband. He 
               waits a few beats, takes a long sip of coffee, then exits 
               the office.

               INT. SECRET SERVICE CABIN - NIGHT

               As he passes through the cabin he takes a silent inventory. 
               Five other agents working, sleeping, on the phone.

               INT. PRESS CABIN - NIGHT

               Gibbs nods to Korshunov. Korshunov nods one of his men.  
               NEVSKY removes one of his videotapes, pops the front cover 
               exposing the tape. Across the face of the tape is a thin 
               strip of a rubbery substance. Nevsky pulls the strip up and 
               out, making a kind of fuse. He reaches for a pack of 
               matches... courtesy matches, sporting the Seal of the 
               President.

               Nevsky nods and lights the fuse.

               IN A RAPID SUCCESSION -

               GIBBS tosses his two extra weapons to Korshunov's men, pivots 
               the corner and begins firing at his colleagues. The SECRET 
               SERVICE AGENTS try to get at their weapons, but Gibbs has 
               caught them completely off-guard.

               Several silenced central nervous system shots (head and neck) 
               and the five agents slump back, their red blood cascading 
               down the creases of the fine Corinthian leather chairs.

               Nevsky tosses the cassette up the corridor... smoke pours 
               out of it. Smoke screen.

               BAZYLEV and ZEDECK catch the guns Gibbs tossed and hold them 
               on the reporters.

                                     BAZYLEV
                         UP! GET UP NOW!

               Bazylev grabs the stunned reporters, yanking them into the 
               aisle.

                                     BAZYLEV
                         Walk in front of us. Go! Go! Go!

               Human shields. A half dozen of them.

               Behind the terrorists, one of the bathroom doors swings open. 
               A SECRET SERVICE AGENT emerges. Sees what's happening. Reaches 
               for his gun. ZEDECK fells him with a well placed unsilenced 
               GUN SHOT. SCREAMS ensue...

               INT. FORWARD CABIN - NIGHT

               A sleeping SECRET SERVICE AGENT bolts upright. HEARS MORE 
               SHOTS.

               He springs up and moves toward the gunshots, his weapon drawn.

                                     SECRET SERVICE AGENT
                         SHOTS FIRED! SECURE BOY SCOUT!
                              (screaming out and 
                              into his lapel mike)
                         SHOTS FIRED! SHOTS FIRED!

               INT. SECRET SERVICE CABIN - NIGHT                           

               Bazylev and Zedeck lay down a suppressing fire outside the 
               door.

                                     GIBBS
                         Come on! Quickly.

               Korshunov, Nevsky and VLAD follow Gibbs into the Secret 
               Service office. Gibbs opens a locker and pulls out a stash 
               of MP5 automatic assault rifles and bullet-proof vests.

               Korshunov raises his bushy eyebrows in delight.

                                     GIBBS
                         The Secret Service believes in being 
                         prepared for any eventuality.

               INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               The Secret Service agent fights his way through the smoke to 
               a wall panel. Punches a red buttoned intercom.

               INT. AIR FORCE ONE'S FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT

               A red light on the security panel lights up...

               Hunched over a control terminal, the AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER 
               tracks Air Force One's radar image.

                         Fuck me. GO WAKE THE GENERAL. NOW!

               The WATCH OFFICER springs into action, picking up a phone.

                         We are scrambling our fighters.

               The controller hits a red button on his console. Sirens flare 
               up and klaxons wail across the base.

               The controller looks down to his runways. In the light of 
               the moon he sees a half-dozen men rushing toward F-15 Eagles.

                         Understood?

               The once sleepy midnight control room cranks into full crisis 
               mode.

               INT. AIR FORCE ONE, MISSION COMMUNICATIONS CENTER - NIGHT

               Pandemonium. GUNFIRE pops in the b.g. Air Force Specialists 
               try to get the word out.

               AIR FORCE SPECIALIST 

                A.F. SPECIALIST #2

               INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

               The conference room door bursts open and TWO SECRET SERVICE 
               AGENTS, weapons drawn, enter the room and run to Marshall.

               The once quiet room floods with light. The sounds of a 
               gunfight and a blanket of smoke sweeps into the cabin.

                                     MARSHALL
                         What's going on?

                                     SECRET SERVICE AGENT
                         We're under attack.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Where's my family?

                                     SECRET SERVICE AGENT
                         We're handling it, sir.

               The agents lift Marshall to his feet, and practically carry 
               him from the room, leaving the other high ranking officials 
               to scramble for themselves in a cacophony of shouts.

                                     MARSHALL
                         The launch codes! Who's protecting 
                         the football?

               FORWARD CORRIDOR -

               Perkins, carrying the nuclear football, ducks and weaves his 
               way down the corridor into the fray. He takes a bullet to 
               the shoulder, which fells him.

               NEAR THE FORWARD GALLEY -

               Alice is nearly trampled by agents responding to the gunfire.

               One agent grabs her and shoves her into a bathroom.

                                     SECRET SERVICE AGENT
                         Don't open the door!

               GUNFIRE pops all around her.

               INT. CORRIDOR, REAR CABINS - NIGHT

               Smoke, automatic weapons fire. Secret service agents battling 
               the terrorists. Aides, diplomats, crew and personnel caught 
               in the crossfire.

                                     ZEDECK
                         Down! Everybody down.

               A spray of weapons fire overhead and everyone hits the floor.

                         Yes sir.

               Ingrahams locks the cockpit door.

               EXT. SKY - NIGHT

               Air Force One banks into a curve and descends through broken 
               clouds.

               INT. PRESIDENTIAL STATEROOM - NIGHT

               The sounds of gunfire have reached the the nose of the plane.

               Rose peers out to see what's the matter. An armed Secret 
               Service agent runs toward her.

                                     SECRET SERVICE AGENT
                         Get back! Get back!

               A spray of bullets mows him down. He collapses in the door 
               frame. Terrified, Rose tries to close the door, but the dead 
               agent is in the way.

               INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               Filled with smoke and gunfire. The agents rush the President 
               behind a forward bulkhead.

                                     SECRET SERVICE AGENT
                              (into mike)
                         We have Boy Scout, traveling forward.

                                     VOICE (OVER MIKE)
                         Negative... negative... they're up

                                     SECRET SERVICE AGENT
                         Roger. We're going to the chute.

               Marshall looks up the hallway toward his stateroom.

                                     MARSHALL
                              (calling out)
                         ROSE! ALICE!

               DOWN THE CORRIDOR -                                       

               Gibbs fires.

               HITS - One of the Secret Service agents in the shoulder. 
               Blood blossoms through his clothes but he winces it off.

                                     SECRET SERVICE AGENT
                         Come on, sir.

               The Secret Service agents whisk the President to the front 
               stairwell. They pull up a floor panel, revealing stairs 
               descending toward the baggage deck.

               INT. BATHROOM -

               Alice, huddled atop the commode.

                                     MARSHALL (O.S.)
                         Alice!

                                     ALICE
                         Daddy...

               Alice opens the door and rushes...

               INTO THE CORRIDOR...

               Tripping and falling over Joey, the steward. His dead eyes 
               swim in a pool of blood that was his face. Alice screams, 
               scrambling to her feet.

               MID-PLANE CORRIDOR -

               Perkins manages to push himself to his feet and stumbles 
               down the hall into the computer room. Terrorist SERGE spots 
               the nuclear football dangling from his wrist. He pursues.

               INT. COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT

               Hysterical SECRETARIES feverishly dump classified documents 
               into a shredder, while Perkins struggles to open the black 
               leather briefcase handcuffed to his wrist.

               Bullets tear up the doorknob lock arid SERGE kicks in the 
               door.

                                     SERGE
                         Down! Everyone down!

               The Fawn Halls hit the floor as gunfire sprays overhead. But 
               Perkins swings around brandishing his sidearm. He opens fire 
               on Serge, but the bullets smack harmlessly against the SWAT 
               vest.

               Serge returns fire, ripping up Perkins who collapses over 
               the shredder, and with his last bit of strength, he dumps 
               out the briefcase.

               Papers containing NUCLE WAR STRATEGIES and MISSILE LAUNCH 
               CODES slide into the hungry Shredding machine. Perkins manages 
               a slight smile before he keels over dead, his duty fulfilled. 
               The shredded remains of the nuclear football rain over his 
               head like tickertape at a hero's parade.

               EXT. SKY - NIGHT

               The pale moon catches shiny streaks of metal that descend 
               through the broken clouds. The Squadron of F-15 Eagles drops 
               into formation around Air Force One.

               INT. FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT

               Gun shots right Outside the cockpit door.

                                     COT. CARLTON (RADIO)
                         Air Force One, this is Squadron

               INT. COCKPIT F-LB EAGLE - NIGHT

               Encased in a helmet, mask, and visor, Carlton watches the

               flashes of gunfire in the dark windows of the plane.

               COt. CARLTON Copy. Delta Force has been mobilized.

                                     COT. AXELROD (V.0.)
                         Roger that.

               INT. LOWER DECK OF AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT

               Beneath the main cabin, the Secret Service agents run the 
               President through the forward baggage compartment and the 
               lower galley: a large room with compartments, storage freezers 
               and food preperation tables.

               On the far side of the galley, the agents fling open a 
               hatchway and enter...

               A NARROW GANGWAY - running between the lower galley and the 
               rear baggage hold, flanked on either side by the landing 
               gear bays.

               They duck under wing supports until they come to a mesh 
               grating.

               The uninjured agent lifts the grating revealing an ESCAPE 
               POD.

                                     SECRET SERVICE AGENT
                         Get in!   

               Marshall freezes.

                                     SECRET SERVICE AGENT
                         Get in, sir.

               A second later gunfire rips Up the agent's face. The new 
               volley sends Marshall under the cover of a wing strut. The 
               second agent takes Position and returns fire. He quells the 
               incoming volley for a moment.

                                     MARSHALL
                         What about my family?

                                     SECRET SERVICE AGENT #
                         I have a family, too, sir. Now get 
                         in the fucking pod.

               The firing begins again. Marshall struggles with the decision.

                                     SECRET SERVICE AGENT #
                         Mr. President... MR. PRESIDENT! You 
                         have to do this! The pod, on three.
                         Ready?

               The agent shoves in a fresh clip...

                                     SECRET SERVICE AGENT
                         One.

                                     MARSHALL
                         But...

                                     SECRET SERVICE AGENT
                              (cutting him off)
                         Two... THREE. GO!

               The agent combat-rolls into the open and fires. He advances 
               down the gangway acting as a shield for the president, 
               shooting blindly.  Marshall watches as he's hit repeatedly, 
               but it gives him the time he needs to dive for the pod.

               REVERSE ANGLE - VLAD AND NEVSKY

               behind the bulkhead. When the agent drops, Nevsky and Viad 
               rush down the gangway. They arrive at the closed pod just as 
               it begins to slide on its rails. They let loose dozens of 
               rounds from their MP55, but the bullets just plink off.

               The pod-lock doors slide shut. The President is on his way 
               to safety.

               EXT. SKY - NIGHT

               Small bay doors open in the belly of Air Force One, and a 
               human sized cannister drops from the bottom, its parachute 
               Opening instantly.

                         Daddy? Dad?

               Her voice comes closer, filled with choking fear and panic.  
               She rounds the corner and Nevsky catches her hair with a 
               vice-tight grip shoving his MP5 into the small of her back.

               INT. PRESIDENTIAL STATEROOM - NIGHT

               Korshunov kicks open the door.

                                     ROSE
                         NO!

               Gunfire from ROSE, who holds the dead secret service agent's 
               weapon. She empties the clip at the doorway. Click, click.  
               No more bullets. Korshunov steps into the room, brandishing 
               his automatic, smiling. Rose backs against the wall and raises 
               her hands.

               EXT. WHITE HOUSE LAWN - DAY

               A Marine helicopte touches down on the greenway. Marines 
               salute and escort KATHERINE CHANDLER from the chopper' 
               interior to the South entrance of the White House. She is 
               the VICE PRESIDENT of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

               INT. AIR FORCE ONE, MISSION COMNUNICATIONS CENTER - NIGHT

               Zedeck steps over the three dead Communications Specialists, 
               on his way to the cockpit door. Tries the door. It's locked.  
               He pounds on it.

                                     ZEDECK
                         Open! Now!

               INT. FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT

               Through the cockpit window, the glowing landing lights of 
               Ramstein Base are visible in the distance, cutting a wedge 
               through the German towns and fields.

               Zedeck's pounding continues.

                                     COT. AXELROD
                         Ramatein, we are fifteen miles away 
                         on final approach. I'm coming in 
                         fast and will need every inch of 
                         runway.

               RAMSTEIN A.B. CONTROLLER (V.0.)

               Copy, Air Force One. Wind is twelve knots from the east. 
               Tactical and emergency are in position.

               EXT. RANSTEIN AIR FIELD - NIGHT

               Rescue vehicle sirens gyre in the darkness. A team of black-
               faced commandos unload from troop truck. Snipers take position 
               atop rescue vehicles, barracks, and the control tower.

               High-powered rifles with infra-red scopes.

               INT. MISSION COMMUNICATIONS CENTER - NIGHT

               Zedeck aims his MP5 at the flight door. Fires off a dozen 
               rounds. Nickel sized indentations blossom across the steel 
               surface.

               INT. FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT

               Dull thuds of bullet impacts.

                                     COT. AXELROD
                         Let's get this crate on the ground.

               They're some real good men waiting to help us.

               EXT. AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT

               The plane sprouts landing gear as it descends over the city.

               Coming in fast and low.

               INT. MISSION COMMUNICATIONS CENTER - NIGHT

               Gibbs shoves Zedeck aside. Produces a thumb-sized amount of 
               C-4.

               INT. FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT

               Final approach... the landing strip not far at all.

                                     COL. AXELROD
                         Almost there.

               He raises his flaps. Air speed and altitude drop.

               EXT. RAPISTEIN AIR FIELD - NIGHT

               Spotters find Air Force One's navigation lights visible in 
               the sky, descending from the distant darkness. Followed by 
               the cluster of F-lSs.

               INT. MISSION COMMUNICATIONS CENTER - NIGHT

               Gibbs rolls out the C-4 like a kid making a snake in pottery 
               class. He presses it along the door seal.

               INT. FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT

               Altitude decreasing. 300 feet... 200 hundred feet...

               The runway coming up to meet them.

               EXT. RAMSTEIN AIR FIELD - NIGHT

               As the entire airbase collectively holds its breath. Air 
               Force One's tires hover 50 feet above the ground... 40 feet...   
               30...

               INT. MISSION COMMUNICATIONS CENTER - NIGHT

               Gibbs raises his pistol. Aims at the C-4. Fires. BAM!

               INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT

               A BLINDING FLASH. The door blows in.

               EXT. RANSTEIN AIR FIELD - NIGHT

               The wheels touchdown.

               INT. MISSION COMMUNICATIONS CENTER - NIGHT

               Gibbs and Zedeck storm the cockpit.

               RNT. FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT

               Axeirod gropes at the plane's controls, trying to retain the 
               wheel. Gibbs dispatches Axeirod with one shot. Zedek is a 
               little messier with Ingrahams. But both pilot and co-pilot 
               slump over their controls.

               EXT. RANSTEIN AIR FIELD - NIGHT

               The taxiing Boeing 747 suddenly veers to the right cutting 
               across runways. Emergency vehicles give chase.

               The plane bounces. Is airborne for a second. Touches down 
               again with a jolt.

               INT. CORRIDOR - AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT

               Terrorists lead hostages to the conference room. Everyone is 
               bounced around, slamming against walls, spilling over chairs.

               A MASTER SERGEANT seizes the opportunity and grabs for 
               Bazylev's gun, but Bazylev shoots him almost point blank.

                                     BAZYLEV
                         Keep moving!

               INT. FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT

               Chaos. Gibbs tries to pull Axelrod off the controls.

                                     GIBBS
                         Throttle up. Throttle up!

               Zedek slams the throttle all the wa up. Spotlights and sirens 
               swirl outside the cockpit window.

               EXT. RMMSTEIN FIELD - NIGHT

               The Flying White House careens toward the barracks, then 
               edges toward a hangar. The jet engines strain to reach full 
               power.

               INT. RAMSTEIN CONTROL TOWER - NIGHT

               The controller stares down at the out-of-control plane.

                                     RAMSTEIN A.B. CONTROLLER
                         Aw Fuck. We're losing it!

               INT. FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT

               Gibbs pulls Axeirod's body out of the pilot's seat. Looks 
               out the cockpit window and sees...

                                     A C-141 STARLIFTER
                         in his path. A monstrous plane, every 
                         bit as big as Air Force One. Gibbs 
                         eases back on the wheel and the 747 
                         sluggishly responds, its nose creeping 
                         upward.

                                     GIBBS
                         Come on.

               Adjusts the flaps...

               EXT. RAMSTEIN AIRFIELD - NIGHT

               Air Force One closes in on the Starlifter. She's struggling 
               off

               the ground like some injured bird. The straining metal defies 
               gravity.

               INT. FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT

               Gibbs senses that he's too close. He pulls way back on the 
               stick, risks stalling her out... but the bird responds.

               EXT. RAMSTEIN FIELD - NIGHT

               Air Force One barely clears the Starlifter, the edge of her 
               wing just missing the top of the C-141's tail.

               The sharpshooters, the emergency crews, the commandos from 
               Delta Force...  Nothing they can do but watch her rise out. 
               of sight.

               INT. FLIGHT DECK - LATER

               Gibbs and Zedeck. Gibbs checks over all the instruments.

                                     GIBBS
                         Okay, 30,000 feet. Give me my heading.

                                     ZEDECK
                         Bearing 110 point eight two.

               Gibbs banks the plane into a curve, then activates the auto-
               pilot.

                                     GIBBS
                         Call me if something changes.

                                     ZEDECK
                         That's it?

                                     GIBBS
                         To fly a 747 you need to know three 
                         things. How to take of f, how to 
                         land, and how to engage the autopilot.

               INT. AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT

               SERIES OF SHOTS--

               The terrorists, from every corner of the plane, lead the 
               stunned survivors, hands on heads, to the central conference 
               room.

               As Korshunov walks Rose up the corridor, he meets up with 
               Gibbs, descending from the upper deck.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         The rest of the secret service?

                                     GIBBS
                         Dead.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         How many others killed?

                                     GIBBS
                         Nine.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Any of us?

               Gibbs touches his bulletproof vest.

                                     GIBBS
                         No damages.

                                     ROSE
                         Where's my daughter?

                                     GIBBS
                         She's alive, ma'am, for the time 
                         being.

               Rose allows herself a half-sob of relief.

                                     ROSE
                         And my husband?

                                     GIBBS
                         The secret service did their job, 
                         ma'am. The President is safely off 
                         the plane.
                              (to Korshunov)
                         But that still leaves us plenty to 
                         bargain with.

               Eyes filled with hatred... Rose SLAPS Gibbs face.

                                     ROSE
                         Mr. Gibbs. You, of all people...

               Gibbs doesn't react.

                                     GIBBS
                         Follow me, ma'am.

               INT. WHITE HOUSE SITUATION ROOM - DAY

               High-tech maps and communications systems line the walls, 
               surrounding an austere main conference table. Laptop computers 
               and secure telephones by every seat. Side tables. Tele-type 
               machines spitting out classified information.

               VICE PRESIDENT CHANDLER analyzes the projected course of Air 
               Force One on the tactical vid-map.

                                     V.P. CHANDLER
                         We should have the President secure 
                         within minutes. Do we know who these 
                         terrorists are or where they're going?

               GENERAL NORTHWOOD, head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff...

                                     GENERAL NORTHWOOD
                         General Greely says it looks like 
                         the Middle East.

                                     V.P. CHANDLER
                         Does your office have anything to 
                         add, Mr. Dean?

               National Security Advisor WALTER DEAN leans forward.

                                     DEAN
                         The garners believe that, given the 
                         scenario, there's an 86% chance that

               we'll be dealing with a hostage situation and not an 
               assassination attempt. Not much else until there's more data.

                                     V.P. CHANDLER
                         If we're dealing with an airborne 
                         hostage situation what's our 
                         procedure?

               The Under-Secretary of Defense, THOMAS LEE, punches up a 
               scenario on the lap-top.

                                     LEE
                         Our only policy assumes the plane is 
                         on the ground. Our hands are 
                         completely tied while they're in the 
                         air.

                                     V.P. CHANDLER
                         Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action 
                         until we confirm that the president 
                         is off the plane... Lee, go huddle 
                         with the D.O.D. I want an options 
                         paper on this in 20 minutes.

                                     LEE
                         Twenty minutes?

                         You heard me.
                              (points to an aide)
                         You. Congress and cabinet heads.

               The aide nods and picks up a telephone.

                                     AIR FORCE COLONEL
                         Madame Vice-President?

               Chandler turns toward the door. The Colonel enters the room, 
               holding a black briefcase identical to Perkins'.

                                     V.P. CHANDLER
                         Yes?

                         now.

                                     V.P. CHANDLER
                         Thank you, Colonel. Have a seat.

               EXT. GERMAN FARMLAND - NIGHT

               A HUEY, flanked by a pair of APACHES, skims the surface of 
               wheat fields at maximum velocity.

               INT. HUEY COCKPIT - NIGHT

               The pilot checks his instruments. He's honing in on a signal.

               EXT. GERMAN FARKD - NIGHT

               The swirling spotlights of the Apaches finally illuminate 
               the Seal of the President atop the EMERGENCY DEPLOYMENT POD.

               The Huey drops in for a landing and a half dozen Army Rangers 
               in full combat gear deploy to the pod. They open it.

               But.........

               IT'S EMPTY.

               INT. BAGGAGE DECK GANGWAY - NIGHT

               Bruised and battered, some blood smeared across his tuxedo 
               shirt... PRESIDENT JAMES MARSHALL lowers himself from one of 
               the overhead wing struts.

               He emerges into the bowels of Air Force one.

               He stands quietly a moment, listening... for footsteps, for 
               gunfire. All quiet except for the whine of the jet engines.

               He tak9s a moment to think. Considers his situation. His 
               eyes find the dead agent who risked his life so he could 
               make it to the pod. He trots down the gangway toward the 
               lower galley.

               EXT. SKY - NIGHT

               Air Force One hovers atop billowy peaks. The smaller F-15s 
               cluster around her in a loose formation.

               FIGHTER PILOT #1 (0.5. RADIO)

               Sir, isn't there something we can do besides escort?

               COL. CARLTON (O.S. RADIO)

               Like what, son... shoot our own plane down?

                                     FIGHTER PILOT #1
                         No sir. I just wish...

                                     COL. CARLTON
                         Roger. We all wish... Now shut the 
                         fuck up and escort.

               INT. LOWER GALLEY - NIGHT

               Marshall looks around for a weapon... half-full coffee pot,

               stove, walk-in freezer, plates and silverware. Marshall picks 
               up a butcher knife.

               INT. CORRIDOR, AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT

               Nevsky and Bazylev guard the conference room door as Korshunov 
               and Vlad enter. Nevsky hands Korshunov a copy of the plane's 
               manifest.

                                     NEVSKY
                         Every weapon and every person is 
                         accounted for.

               Korshunov nods and enters the room.

               INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

               Korshunov surveys the hostages. Viad covers them at gunpoint.

               Rose holds Alice, comforting her.  shepherd, Doherty, Aides, 
               Advisors, Crew... Fifty of them huddle like sardines.

               The plane's doctor administers to the wounded.

               Korshunov stares down his captives.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Fear will keep you alive. Any one 
                         who is not afraid is bound to do 
                         something foolish, and bound to die.

                                     ROSE
                         What do you want with us?

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Cooperation. If you try to escape, 
                         you will be met with automatic gunfire 
                         and a barricade of your comrade's 
                         bodies will prevent you from exiting. 
                         Good day.

               Korshunov exits, with Viad backing out behind him. Leaving 
               the hostages alone. The sound of the door locking.

               A mournful beat. Everyone looks at each other and the dead 
               and wounded victims of this heinous act...

               Hushed conversation breaks out all over the room.

                                     DOHERTY
                         This can't be happening. You just 
                         don't pull this shit with the United 
                         States. You just don't.

                                     MAJOR CALDWELL
                         Keep your heads.

               Caldwell paces, looks around the room.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         Mrs. Marshall, are you okay?

                                     ROSE
                         We're alive.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         That's all that matters. Thank god 
                         the President got of f the plane.

                                     ROSE
                         Yes... thank God.
                              (to caldwell)
                         You there... Caidwell, right? What's 
                         on your mind?  caldwell takes a beat, 
                         then crosses to Rose and Shepherd.

                                     MAJOR CALDWELL
                              (hushed)
                         I don't want to get anybody here 
                         excited, but if we can get out of 
                         this room, I can get us to safety.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         We're thirty five thousand feet up.

                                     MAJOR CALDWELL
                         Yes, sir, that's a problem, but if 
                         we can somehow get to a lower 
                         altitude, the rear loading ramp on 
                         the baggage deck is equipped with 
                         parachutes in case of an engine 
                         failure. Now we can either wait for 
                         a political resolution, or try to 
                         resolve this thing ourselves.

                                     DOHERTY
                         You're goddamn right we can resolve 
                         this ourselves. We'll negotiate.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         You know the President's policy.

                                     DOHERTY
                         The President isn't here.

                                     ROSE
                         Right now we are an enormous liability 
                         to the United States. We can't just 
                         sit and do nothing.

               INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               The terrorists move toward the nose of the plane leaving 
               Nevsky to guard the conference room.

               INT. BAGGAGE HOLD - NIGHT

               President Marshall reaches the front stairway. Cautiously 
               climbs to the main cabin. As he reaches the top stairs, he 
               hears Russian conversation approaching. He ducks back into 
               the stairwell.

               He can't see them, but he can hear them.

               The terrorists pass within a few feet as they ascend to the 
               Mission Communications Center on the upper deck.

               Marshall waits a few beats, listens to the silence. Then re-
               mounts the stairs and almost runs into the back of...

                                     VIAD
                         Standing guard, facing the opposite 
                         direction.

               Marshall FREEZES... looks past Viad down the corridor where 
               Nevsky guards the main conference room floor.

               Unaware of Marshall, Viad reaches into his pocket and pulls 
               out a cigarette. Lights it. On the first puff he feels a 
               presence behind him.

               VLAD slowly turns around...

               Nothing there.

               He smiles at his jittery nerves, turns back round.

               REVERSE ANGLE -

               Over Vlad's shoulder...

               MARSHALL, flattened behind the edge of the galley divider. 
               He creeps away from Vlad toward the Presidential Suite...  
               stepping gingerly over dead secret service agents.

               INT. MISSION COMMUNICATIONS CENTER -

               *       Korshunov pulls a handkerchef from his breast pocket 
               and wipes the blood from a telephone headset.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Proceed.

               Gibbs works the communications board, dialing in a series of 
               numbers. Telephone ringing...

               INT. WHITE HOUSE SITUATION ROOM - DAY

               A map of Air Force One's flight trajectory is displayed on 
               the rear screen. Moscow to Berlin and back toward the Black 
               Sea.

               The assembled brass listens as Korshunov's voice slithers 
               off the speaker phone.

                                     KORSHUNOV (SPEAKER)
                         ...the Chief of Staff, the First 
                         Lady, and the First Daughter.  Our 
                         demands are simple. Arrange the 
                         release of Ivan Stravanvitch.  Once 
                         our leader is returned to Turkuenistan 
                         soil, Air Force One and it's occupants 
                         will be allowed safe passage to 
                         Switzerland. You have one hour before 
                         we start killing hostages.

               The phone clicks off. A silent beat in the room.

                                     V.P. CHANDLER
                         Find that voice for me, I want to 
                         know who we're dealing with. And get 
                         President Petrov on the phone.

               GENERAL CHARLES GREELY, head of the 87th Mechanized Air Wing, 
               the unit responsible for Air Force One, enters the room.

                                     GENERAL GREELY
                         Madame Vice-President, we just got 
                         word from Ramstein... The nod was 
                         UntiL Chandler stands.

                                     V.P. CHANDLER
                         Empty?

                                     GENERAL GREELY
                         The President... he must still be 
                         onboard.

                                     V.P. CHANDLER
                         Play back that call.

                                     TECHNICAL OFFICER
                         Yes, sir.

               The Tech Officer indexes back on his computer.

                                     KORSHUNOV (V.0. TAPE)
                         The plane is under our command, and 
                         those we did not kill we hold as 
                         hostages, including the Chief of 
                         Staff, the First Lady, and the First 
                         Daughter.

                                     V.P. CHANDLER
                         but not the President. Not the 
                         President.

               A silent beat.

                                     GENERAL NORTHWOOD
                         He's dead then. They must have killed 
                         him.

                                     DEAN
                         We don't know that.

                                     GENERAL NORTHWOOD
                         Holding the president hostage is not 
                         something that slips your mind when 
                         you're making demands.

                                     V.P. CHANDLER
                         And if he's dead? Do you really think 
                         they'd risk telling us?

                                     DEAN
                         There is a possibility we're 
                         overlooking.

               All eyes turn to Dean.

                                     DEAN
                         When I ran Specops in `Nam, I ordered 
                         the destruction of a V.C.  munitions 
                         dump. During insertion, the plane 
                         was shot down and the entire team 
                         was killed, or so we thought. Two 
                         days later the dump

               BLEW AND A WEEK AFTER THAT, THIS 19-

               year-old kid, the pilot... he walks out of the jungle in 
               pretty bad shape. He survived the crash and finished the 
               mission... alone.

                                     GENERAL NORTHWOOD
                         Walter, if you have a point, make 
                         it.

                                     DEAN
                         That kid's name was Jim Marshall.

               Most of the President's service record makes for dull reading 
               because most of what he did iarLZ ULirn.   History remembers 
               him for what he did aflar he got back to the states -- the 
               protests, the rallies -- But he was a soldier once, a damn 
               fine one.

                                     V.P. CHANDLER
                         So what are you saying?

                                     DEAN
                         Maybe he's alive on that plane and 
                         those bastards don't even know it.

                                     V.P. CHANDLER
                         Mr. Dean, may I remind you that the 
                         President is not 19 anymore.

               INT. PRESIDENT'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

               Marshall cautiously enters the room. Ready for action.

               The room is empty, but it's been trashed by the firefight.

               The sound of voices... coming from the Duke game which still 
               plays. Marshall hustles over to one of the secure phones.

               It's dead. He tries the regular phone. Dead. Hangs it up in 
               disgust.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Goddamnit.

               He steps on some glass. It's a broken frame holding a 
               PHOTOGRAPH of Alice and Rose. He picks up the photo and lays 
               it on a table.

               He thinks for a beat... glances around the room, searching...

               Then he crosses to the closet, opens it and begins rifling 
               through his wardrobe.

               INT. MAIN CONFERENCE ROOM.

               Caldwell stands on the conference table. The hostages have 
               removed one of the ceiling panels. Air supply ducts and 
               bundles of wiring run through the ten-inch space between the 
               ceiling and the shielding plates.

                                     MAJOR CALDWELL
                         This is a dead end.

               Rose looks around the room. Hopeless. Her eyes land on the 
               carpet...

               INT. CORRIDOR.

               Marshall opens the stateroom door and slowly slides into the 
               corridor.

               Vlad still faces the opposite direction.

               Marshall creeps down the hallway, when...

               Beep... Beep... Beep...

               Marshall's watch alarm goes off.

               Marshall dives for the nearest doorway. Vlad swings round to 
               see a figure slip into the senior staff cabin.

               Vlad, unsure of what he saw., cautiously heads toward the 
               staff cabin. As he nears, he bends over a dead Secret Service 
               agent and pulls up the lifeless wrist revealing abeening 
               watch. It wasn't Marshall's after all. No matter. Vlad 
               continues to the staff Cabin.

               INT. STAFF CABIN - NIGHT

               Marshall frantically searches for something he can use as a 
               weapon. In the room: some video monitors, leather chairs and 
               phones. stainless steel cabinets run the length of one of 
               the walls.

               Marshall throws the cabinet doors open, revealing...

               A fully stocked MEDICAL CENTER... fold-down operating

               table... high-intensity lights. Equipped to deal with any 
               medical emergency the president might encounter.

               But too late. Vlad kicks the door open.

                                     VLAD
                         Get on the floor, now!

               Marshall yanks down the operating table, and it smashes into 
               Vlad, knocking him down. Marshall lunges with his knife, but 
               Vlad OPENS FIRE. A HALF DOZEN ROUNDS pump into Marshall's 
               belly. He's thrown back against the wall, then slumps to the 
               floor.

               Vlad approaches the crumpled body. Leans down to examine his 
               victim. He cups his hand under the man's chin and lifts his 
               head. Recognizes him.

                                     VIAD
                              (wonderment)
                         The President.

               But Marshall's eyes flash open.

                                     MARSHALL
                         That's right, asshole.

               He springs, shoving the butcher knife under the flack jacket 
               and into Vlad's spleen. Vlad freezes, unsure of what just 
               happened.

               Marshall is on his feet. Never letting go of the twisting 
               knife, he grabs Vlad by the back of the head and slams his 
               face against the mirror above the surgical scrub sink. The 
               mirror shatters and streams of blood erupt cn the terrorist's 
               face. The blood drips down into the white porcelain sink, 
               swirling into the drain.

               Vlad elbows Marshall in the neck, stunning him momentarily.

               He wipes the blood from his face, spins and hits Marshall 
               with a devastating right cross. Marshall reels back against 
               the wall, and Vlad follows, shoving the MP5 into Marshall's 
               throat. Marshall grabs the gun near the trigger...

               *                               VLAD

               Don't move or I'll blow your head off.

                                     MARSHALL
                         I don't think so.

               Marshall presses the saftey button on the gun with his 
               forefinger, then knees Vlad in the balls. Viad pulls the 
               trigger repeatedly as he goes down, but nothing happens.

               Instead he comes up swinging his gun butt against Marshall's 
               face. Like a bat hitting a baseball, it knocks Marshall into 
               the medical closet. The gun goes flying, skittering

               UNDERNEATH A CABINET.

               Marshall pulls himself up the shelves trying to keep his 
               legs from buckling. Vlad grabs some I.V. tubing and wraps it 
               around Marshall's neck. Marshall struggles for breath, clawing 
               at the tube.

               HE SPOTS A DEFIBRILLATOR, REACHES AND SWITCHES IT ON. LOW-

               pitched hum and beeping.

               Marshall pulls his head forward, straining against the plastic 
               tubing. Then slams back into Vlad's head. Viad releases his 
               grip just for a moment...

               The beeping becomes a steady whine.

               ... but a moment is all Marshall needs as he grabs the def 
               ib's CARDIAC PADDLES, turns, and SLAMS them on either side 
               of Vlad's head.

               Vlad convulses from the shock for a full five seconds... his 
               eyeballs roll, his hair stands on end.  then he collapses to 
               the floor.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Clear.

               Marshall catches his breath for a moment. Pulls open his 
               shirt. Beneath it he wears a bulletproof Kevlar vest. He 
               lifts the vest and a half-dozen angry welts have blossomed 
               across his skin. The stuff may be bulletproof, but each of 
               Vlad's shots sting like a motherfucker.

               EXT. CORRIDOR.

               Nevsky walks down the corridor. Sees that Vlad is away from 
               his post.

                                     NEVSKY
                         Viad?

               *       INT. STAFF CABIN.

               Marshall opens the medical cabinets, rifling through them.

               Pulls out hypodermics, adrenalin, rubbing alcohol... arming

               himself.

                                     NEVSKY (O.S.)
                         Vlad? Vlad?

               EXT. CORRIDOR.

               Nevsky works his way up the corridor, peeking in rooms.

               As he enters the...

               INT. STAFF CABIN.

               he's blinded by the high intensity surgical lights.

               Marshall cracks a tank of anesthesia across Nevsky's heu 
               Nevsky goes down.

               Marshall rips Nevsky's MP5 off of him. Holds it to Nevsky's 
               throat.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Where are th*y? fly tamily, the 
                         crew.... where are they?

               Nevsky says nothing.

               The conference room, right? Right?

               Marshall jerks him to his feet.

                                     MARSHALL
                         o'11 unlocli the door for me or I'll 
                         kill you.

               INT. CORRIDOR -

               Marshall walks flevsky toward the mj vonteronve room3 As 
               they pass the stairs to the upper deck, Nevsky breaks away.

                                     NEVSKY
                         KORSKUNOV!

               Marshall fires. Killing him.

                                     SHIT1
                         INT. CORRIDOR.

               No time for remorse. Marshall tries the Main conference Room 
               door. Locked. He knows the others will be coming so he 
               flattens himself against the corridor wall. Trains his gun 
               on the stairs.

               Just as the terrorists descend, Marshall squeezes off a few 
               rounds. The terrorists edge back up the steps, returning 
               fire.

               Marshall checks his clip, not many bullets left. He fires 
               off a few more shots to buy some time then ducks round the 
               corner and pulls out the bottle of rubbing alcohol and some 
               gauze.

               The terrorists seize the moment of quiet, descending the 
               stairs to take position.

               Marshall lights the gauze fuse of his new made Molatov

               cocktail and throws it down the corridor. The bottle crashes 
               into a BALL OF FLAME. Catching Bazylev on fire. He yells, 
               drops and rolls. FIRE SUPPRESSING FOAM immediately sprays 
               down from overhead.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Go after him.

               Serge hops Bazylev's burning body and heads down the corridor, 
               looking for this new wildcard. Korshunov grabs a fire 
               extinguisher from the galley and attends to Bazylev.

               INT. CORRIDOR, TOWARD THE REAR OF AIR FORCE ONE.

               Marshall retreats behind a divider. Sees Serge coming. Fires 
               a few rounds, then retreats to the next divider. Working 
               toward the rear of the plane.

               Serge picks his way through the rear cabins, advancing 
               cautiously.

               INT. REAR GALLEY/BATHROOMS.

               Marshall's out of plane. Nowhere to hide in the galley.

               Marshall eyes the bathrooms, doors flapping.

               FOLLOWING SERGE...

               as he reaches the rear galley and bathrooms. Marshall is 
               nowhere to be seen. But the bathroom doors are all closed.

                                     SERGE
                         I know you're in there. Come on out.
                              (a few beats)
                         Okay. Have it your way.

               Time for a deadly version of the shell game. serge fires 
               several rounds into the first closed bathroom door. The 
               bullets slice easily through the thin doors. He kicks the 
               riddled door open. The stall is empty.

               Serge moves to the next one. Same procedure. It's empty.

               Moves to the last bathroom, confident he's got him. He wails 
               with his MP5, turning the hatch into swiss cheese. Waits a 
               beat, then...

               Kicks it in. It's empty too.

               Serge looks around. Where the hell is this guy?

                                     KORSHUNOV (O.S.)
                              (calling down)
                         Serge?

               Serge reluctantly returns to his group.

               INT. LOWER GALLEY, BAGGAGE LEVEL -

               Marshall tumbles out of the cramped galley dumbwaiter, 
               breathing heavy. He slumps against the bulkhead and slides

               down to the ground.

               He takes a moment to pull himself together, to clear his 
               head. He hefts the MP5, refamiliarizing himself with the 
               weight and texture of a gun. He checks the clip. Only a 
               handfull of rounds left. He slaps it back in and switches 
               from automatic fire to single-shot then pantomimes firing.

                                     MARSHALL
                         The NRA'll love this.

               Looking down the barrel of the gun, he notices bins loaded 
               with luggage.

                         We've got four hours before they 
                         make it into Turkienistan airspace.

               I've got a satellite passing overhead in twenty minutes. We 
               can narrow down the landing site choices based on runway 
               length and any unusual activity.  With luck we'll only have 
               to capture three or four sites.

                         Eight percent is better than zero.

               Oh shit... what is that?

               Chandler refers to a monitor in the rear of the room.

               CNN REPORTER (V.0. T.V.)

               *.. the Presidential Aircraft was enroute from Moscow when 
               it began its mayday hail. But in a startling turn of events, 
               the seemingly out of control plane aborted its landing and 
               took off again. We haven't been able to confirm its status 
               or whether or not the first family was onboard at the time.

                         Would someone get the Press Secretary!

                         He's been holding on line four.

               Air Force One, lit up by moonlight.

               INT. CORRIDOR.

               The fire is extinguished. Zedeck squats over Nevsky's body.

               Gibbs and Serge maintain a defensive position, guns ready.

               Bazylev emerges from the Senior staff Conference room. He 
               shakes his head "no". Korshunov nods and furrows his brow.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Who did this?

                         We checked the manifest. Everyone 
                         was accounted for.

                         A secret service agent. It must be.

               Wounded but alive. Serge, Bazylev...

               Find him.

               Serge and Bazylev lock and load, head off in separate 
               directions.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         The conference room is no longer 
                         secure. We'll take the First Lady 
                         and the girl up top where we can 
                         keep a closer eye on them.

               INT. MAIN CONFERENCE ROOM -

               The hostages have torn up a section of carpeting. Caidwell 
               and Shepherd examine the floor. Smooth sheets of steel riveted 
               together. Pointless.

                                     MAJOR CAL DWELL
                         We're not getting out that way.

               The door swings open and Gibbs and Korshunov enter. They 
               spots the ripped up carpeting.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Admirable, but you're wasting your

                         daughter please come here.

               They don't move. Korshunov raises his gun, points it a 
               Shepherd's head.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Now, or he dies, please.

                                     ROSE
                         Come on, Alice.

                         I'm scared.

               Doherty steps forward. Shepherd tries to pull him back, to 
               no

                                     DOHERTY
                         You've got the better part of the 
                         White House locked in this room, you 
                         know. If you want to negotiate, we're 
                         the ones to do it with.

               Korshunov SHOOTS Doherty through the head. Screams from some 
               of the hostages. Korshunov squeezes off a few shots to quiet 
               everyone.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Mrs. Marshall. Alice. If you please.

               Rose turns to the other hostages.

                                     ROSE
                         It's okay. Do what you're told. It's 
                         okay. We'll be okay.

               She locks eyes with Caldwell. HKeep working.N He nods.

               INT. REAR BAGGAGE HOLD -

               The President hunts through luggage. Overturned garment bags 
               and suitcases around him, belongings littered all over the 
               bulkhead. He sifts through heaps of clothing and finally 
               recovers what he's been looking for...

               A CELLULAR PHONE...

               He flips it open, starts to dial... but freezes.

               Bazylev, moving like a commando, slowly and methodically 
               works his way into the lower galley.

               INT. PILOT'S REST AREA - NIGHT

               The rest area consists of a couple of bunks behind the

               cockpit area, still soiled black from the earlier C-4 
               explosion. Korshunov pours a cup of coffee and offers it to 
               Alice.

                                     ALICE
                         I don't drink coffee.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         You must be tired. It'll wake you 
                         up.

                                     ALICE
                         No, thank you. The gunfire did that.

               Gibbs wraps Rose's hands behind her back with duct tape.

                                     ROSE
                         Leave my daughter alone.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?
                              (beat, he chuckles)
                         But I admire your courage. Your 
                         husband, on the other hand...

                                     ROSE
                         What do you know of my husband?

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         I know he left you behind.

                                     ROSE
                         My husband is a very courageous man.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Your husband is a coward. He sends 
                         soldiers half-way around the world 
                         to steal a man from his home in the 
                         middle of the night.

               Alice sits up, attentive.

                                     ALICE
                         You're one of Stravanavitch's men.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         So, you study world events, little 
                         one. That's good for a girl your 
                         age.

                                     ALICE
                         Yeah, I study world events. Five 
                         thousand Turkienistan Muslims were 
                         slaughtered in Stravanvitch's 
                         cleansings... along with 15 American 
                         school kids. You know hQw I studied 
                         that. I went to their funerals with 
                         my dad. I met their parents.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Smart for your age, eh? Top of your 
                         class? Tell me, do you know what the 
                         word "propaganda" means?

                                     ALICE
                         Yeah. Do you know what the word 
                         "asshole" means.

                                     ROSE
                         Alice!

               Rose doesn't know whether to be pissed at Alice or proud of 
               her. Korshunov smiles, nods his head and lifts his gun.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Yes, I have heard that word.

               He aims his gun at Alice.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Yes, I am an asshole.

               A long beat, the Korshunov lovers the gun.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Your father is a reasonable man.

               Once he hears our simple demand, I'm sure he will acquiesce. 
               For your sake.

               Korshunov smiles. Gibbs grabs Alice's hands and pulls them 
               behind her back. Begins wrapping them with the tape.

               INT. MAIN CABING, REAR GALLEY.

               Serge searches through the galley cabinets, spots the galley 
               dumbwaiter. Now he knows where his quarry went.

               He angrily grabs a service cart and shoves it into the 
               dumbwaiter, disabling it.

               INT. GANGWAY -

               Bazylev hears the beeps of a phone dialing. He moves toward 
               the aft portal of the gangway.

               The switchboard operator thinks for a moment. Maybe she can 
               have some fun with this nutcase.

               Bazylev appears behind Marshall. Raises his gun.

               Bazylev points the machine gun at Marshall's head.

                         Hands away from your weapon.

               Marshall doesn't move, his np5 hanging at his waist... his

               Marshall... with no options... slowly moves his hands away 
               from the gun.

               Bazylev motions Marshall to get on his knees. Marshall 
               complies.

               Marshall pulls his shirt aside revealing his Kevlar vest.

               The group listens intently. The call modulates, distorts,

                         So a single missile launched from a

               automatic pressed against Marshall's forehead, disarms 
               Marshall before stepping away. He slings Marshall's MP5 over 
               his own neck. Studies Marshall a beat.

                                     BAZ YLEV
                         So you're the President. Somehow, I 
                         thought you'd be smaller.

               Marshall stares straight ahead tn silent defiance. Bazylev 
               kicks him in the gut. Marshall doubles over, wheezing.

                         Not so powerful now, eh? No aides to

                         protect you, no armies to command.

               Bazylev grabs Marshall's hair and tugs his head back. He 
               holds Marshall with his eyes.

                                     BAZYLEV

               Bazylev slams Marshall's face against his knee. Marshall 
               slumps forward.

                         Up. Get up now!

               Marshall slowly rises to his feet. Bazylev swings wide around 
               him.

               tumbling down the gangway into the rear baggage hold.

               Marshall manages to pull himself up the grating and into the 
               galley. He's free, for the moment.

               INT. AFO, COCKPIT.

               Gibbs steadies the plane as the shock wave from the explosion 
               *        subsides.

                         Well it worked.

               Korshunov smiles and puts his hand on Gibbs shoulder.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Relax, my friend. Apparently they 
                         cannot harm us. Even if they wanted

               Marshall Struggles to assemble the hypodermic and the 
               container of adrenalin.

               INT. REAR BAGGAGE HOLD.

               Bazylev pulls to his feet, heads back down the gangway.

               INT. FRONT GALLEY.

               Marshall greets Bazylev with a spray of hot coffee from the 
               Simmering pot as he enters. Bazylev covers up, but the spray 
               sears him pretty bad. He yells in pain, turning.

               Marshall springs, imbedding the hypodermic needle into 
               Bazylev's neck. A full dose of adrenalin. Bazylev pulls the 
               empty needle from his neck. Marshall steps back, waiting for 
               a reaction.

               A pregnant pause as they both wait to see what happens.

               Then Bazylev smiles and slowly turns toward Marshall.

               Marshall backs away as Bazylev levels his gun.

               He fires once, hitting Marshall in the arm. Marshall winces 
               off the pain.

                                     BAZYLEV
                              (disgust)
                         The leader of the free world.

               He backs Marshall against a wall and holds him in his sights.

               But he doesn't shoot. His breathing becomes faster and faster 
               as the adrenalin takes hold. Building... building... He 
               screams and clutches at his throat.

               His eyes spin back and then his heart explodes.

               Bazylev is caught frozen, suspended in a moment of disbelief.

               Death reflex. He fires off several rounds from the gun as he 
               collapses.

               Marshall waits a beat, half-expecting Bazylev to rise. He 
               slowly approaches the body and retrieves the KP5.

               Marshall rips his sleeve off, swabs the blood off his arm.

               Bazylev's bullet took out a good chunk of flesh when it grazed 
               him.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Did they say anything about my family?

                         They're still alive, but the loyalists 
                         plan to start killing hostages in 
                         forty minutes.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Then tell me there's a rescue 
                         operation underway.

               Marshall opens a travel bottle of Vodka and pours it over 
               the wound. He winces from the pain.

               V.p CHANDLER                      69.

               I think we're okay, sir. flow that we know You're alive we 
               can force Petrov to release Stravanavitch.

                         and if that means negotiating...

                                     MARSHALL
                         You know my policy. We don't negotiate 
                         with terrorists. If we start now, 
                         all of America becomes a target.

                                     V.P. CHANDLER
                         But this is different, sir. You're

               And what happens when Stravanavitch is freed and discovers 
               he's got the President? You think for a second that that 
               crazy bastard is just gonna turn me over? He'll ask for the 
               goddamn moon before he's done.

                                     V.P. CHANDLER
                         Please, Mr. President. You're going 
                         to get yourself killed. Is that your

                                     MARSHALL
                         Freeing Stravanavitch is gonna get 
                         tens of thousands killed. I can't 
                         live with that.

                         official and the integrity of the 
                         office of the President is infinitely 
                         more important than the man who holds

                         flow, is there a rescue operation 
                         under way or not?

               Lee shakes his head at Chandler, signalling "don't tell."

                                     DEAN
                         We can't do anything until that plane 
                         lands. And when it does land, sir, 
                         it's going to be in hostile *

                         we don't know what the hell to do.

               It's going to take a miracle to figure this one out.

               A long beat. We hold on Marshall's determined face.

               Serge comes across Bazylev. Checks for any sign of life.

               Stone cold dead. He looks around and grips his gun a little 
               tighter as he backs out of the room.

               Marshall sees that the stairway hatch has been sealed.

               INT. LOWER GALLEY - NIGHT

               Marshall hits the button for the dumbwaiter. The dumbwaiter 
               begins to descend then snags on the service cart. Its motor 
               grind to a halt. Marshall slumps dQwn. His hopes dashed.

               Nothing to do now but wait.

               INT. MAIN CONFERENCE ROOM.

               Serge looks over the crowd of hostages like a bouncer at a 
               hip dance club. His eyes fall on Maria Mitchell.

                         What the hell...

               He opens up a pack and puts the cigarette in his mouth. He 
               snags one of the Presidential lighters, tries to light it 
               several times but it only sparks. XC shakes it. It's out of 
               tial. He tosses it aside and reaches for a book of matches, 
               but he FREEZES in mid-reach. A thought occurs to him.

               Serge leads Maria Mitchell up the stairway. Korshunov nods.

               Maria Mitchell's voice echos over throughout Air Force One.

                                     MITCHELL
                         You're pointing a gun at me.

               INT. MISSION COMMUNICATIONS CENTER -

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.

               Did you hear her? She said I'm pointing a gun at her.

               INT. AVIONICS COMPARTMENT -

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Now, to the secret service agent in 
                         the baggage deck. I'm giving you ten 
                         seconds to surrender, or this women 
                         will die.

               Marshall's eyes widen.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         One...

               Oh shit. Marshall tries to decide what to do.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Two...

               He climbs out of the avionics compartment and hurries to the 
               front baggage compartment.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Three...

               INT. MAIN CABIN.

               Zedeck and Serge wait by the stairway hatch.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Four...

               INT. MAIN CONFERENCE ROOM.

               Hostages wait, expectantly.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Five...

               INT. FRONT BAGGAGE HOLD.

               Marshall frozen near the bottom of the steps. To go up would 
               be to betray everything he believes in, and lose any chance 
               to save the others. But if he stays...

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Six...

               INT. MISSION COMMUNICATIONS CENTER.

               Tears stream down Maria Mitchell's face. She's trying so 
               hard to be brave in front of Rose and Alice.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Seven...

               INT. FRONT BAGGAGE HOLD.

               For Marshall, this is the hardest decision of his life. His 
               face a mask of anguish as he wrestles with his conscience.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Eight...

               He starts toward the stairs.

               INT. MISSION COMMUNICATIONS CENTER.

               Korshunov looking down the barrel of the gun.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Nine...

               INT. FRONT BAGGAGE HOLD.

               It takes every bit of training and will to stop Marshall 
               from going up those stairs. He knows what's going to happen. 
               He closes his eyes tight as if that will stop it from 
               happening.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Ten...

               A long silent beat. Then... BAAAAM!

                                     MARSHALL
                         NO!

               Marshall sinks to to his knees.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Aw, Jesus.

               INT. MAIN CONFERENCE ROOM.

               Hostages hold each other tight for comfort. A mournful silence 
               fills the room.

               INT. FRONT BAGGAGE HOLD.

               Marshall, silhouetted in the half light, craddles his head 
               head in his hands. The shaft of light disappears as the main 
               cabin hatch closes, sealing him off once again.

                                     KORSFL3NOV (V.0.)
                         I'll give you a few minutes to think 
                         about that one and then we'll try 
                         again. Perhaps soon I will choose 
                         somebody important.

                                     MARSHALL
                              (to himself)
                         She was important.

               INT. MISSION COMMUNICATIONS CENTER.

               zedeck and Serge drag the dead woman out of the compartment.

               Alice sobs quietly.

                                     ROSE
                         Do you have to be so brutal?

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Yes

                                     ROSE
                         Why? Do you enjoy it?

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do 
                         what is necessary.

                                     ROSE
                         How can you? I mean they're people.

                         But they are not ny people. You look 
                         at me as if I am a monster, but answer 
                         me this -- when your planes bombed 
                         the oil fields of Iraq, did You cry 
                         for those dark skinned men whose 
                         names you do not know and who's faces 
                         You will never see? Did You cry for 
                         their wives and children. They were 
                         people too, yes... but they were not 
                         your people.

                                     ROSE
                         That was war.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         So is this.
                              (beat)
                         Come now, you're upsetting the little 
                         one.

                                     ALICE
                         The woman you shot. She was my friend.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         That's the way of the world, little 
                         one. Didn't they teach you that in 
                         school?

               INT. FORWARD BAGGAGE HOLD.

               Marshall crosses back to the avionics compartment, talking 
               on the phone.

                                     VOICE
                              (through static)
                         Chief Mechanic, 87th Air. How can I 
                         help you?

                                     MARSHALL
                         You can talk me through an emergency 
                         fuel dump.

               INT. MAIN CONFERENCE ROOM.

                         Led off to slaughter one at a time.

               Next time I say we rush `em. They can't shoot us all.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         They can shoot enough of us.

                         eventually Who's with me?

               Several of the hostages raise their hands.

               INT. AFO'S MAINTENANCE HANGER/ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE - DAY

               The Chief Mechanic has Air Force One schematics open in front 
               of him. He and his staff are huddled around them.

                                     CHIEF MECHANIC
                         Do you see the maintenance panel?

                                     MARSHALL
                         Got it.

                                     CHIEF MECHANIC
                         Pop it open. There should be a red 
                         switch, toggle it up.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Okay, it's on. We've got some 
                         indicator lights here.

                                     CHIEF MECHANIC
                         Okay, you're aerated. To dump the 
                         fuel you have to close the circuit 
                         for the pump. There's no switch in 
                         Avionics so you'll have to cross the 
                         wires. There should be five wires, 
                         just to your left. Do you see them?

               INT. AVIONICS COMPARTMENT - NIGHT

               Marshall finds the wires: red, white, blue, green and yellow.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Got `en.

               Static blankets the conversation.

                                     CHIEF MECHANIC
                         Okay, hang on. Let me double check

               here, because if you get the wrong ones, you'll cut the engine 
               feeds and stall the plane.

                                     MARSHALL
                         I'll wait.

               The static worsens.

                                     CHIEF MECHANIC
                         First... cut... green wire.

               Marshall, Using a kitchen knife, slices the green wire. Heavy 
               static. The phone beeps... lOsing batteries.

                                     MARSHALL
                         It's cut.

                                     CHIEF MECHANIC
                         cross it...  The static overwhelms 
                         the voice, then cuts out.

                                     MARSHALR'
                         Hello? Hello? Goddamnit.

               Static comes roaring back and garbled voices...

               MARSHAlj Hello? Are YOU there?

               Dead. Marshall tries to activate it again.

               MARSHAIJi Hello? Hello?

               Nothing. He tosses the dead phone aside.

               Marshall stares. Cross the green wires with the... what?

               Red, white, blue... or the yellow. His choice is obvious. He 
               cuts the yellow wire and crosses it with the green, leaving 
               the red, white and blue standing.

               He waits. The engines continue to groan. He allows himself a 
               smile.

                                     MARSHALL
                         An emergency landing in friendly 
                         territory... there's your goddamn 
                         miracle.

               EXT. AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT

               Beneath the plane a trickle of gasoline appears and grows 
               into a strong steady stream.

               INT. FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT

               A red warning light flashes on the plane's panel.

                                     GIBBS
                         Goddamnit it. We're losing fuel.

               Korshunov crosses to the flight deck.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         How?

                                     GIBBS
                         Avionics compartment! It's the only 
                         place. You better get Zedeck down 
                         there fast Unless, of course, you'd 
                         rather be a martyr than a savior.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                              (to Zedeck)
                         Go! Take Serge.. and watch your backs.

               Zedeck nods and dashes out of the cabin.

               INT. MAIN CABIN.

               Zedeck pulls open the hatch cover to the forward front stairs. 
               Descends into the dimly lit underneath.

               Serge descends right behind Zedeck.

               INT. FORWARD BAGGAGE COMPARTMENT - NIGHT

               Zedeck, Spooked by the dark shadows, senses he's being 
               watched.

                                     ZEDECK
                         He's down here. I can feel it.

                                     SERGE
                         Shut up and do your job.

               Zedeck hastens toward the Avionics compartment, gun at the 
               ready. Serge sweeps the area behind.

               They hear a metallic clank echo and reverberate around him.

               They both check left... right... behind them...

               Nothing.

               It's creepy being a walking target.

               From behind a water storage tank, Marshall watches down the 
               barrel of his Mp5. With all the equipment in the way, it's 
               almost impossible to line up a clear shot.

               And they're both well armed. He looks toward the stairway 
               instead.

               Zedeck enters the Avionics compartment. Serge takes a 
               defensive position outside the door.

                                     ZEDECK (O.S.)
                         The valve is shut. This guy sure 
                         knew what he was doing.

               Serge hears a noise and opens tire.                                                         
               80.

                                     ZEDECK
                         You see him?

                         it will crash. The hostages are

               Marshall grabs a piece of paper and a pen. Scribbles a note.

                         Someone should give you a raise.

                                     SECRETARY
                         Actually, sir, you could be that 
                         someone.

               They wait... will it work? A few beats, a few beats more. 
               The machine pulls the paper in and begins scanning.

                                     MARSHALL

               INT. WHITE HOUSE SITUATION ROOM.

               Marshall's note spits out of one of the fax machines. But in 
               the bevy of activity, will it be noticed?

               Caidwell assists everyone in strapping on their packs. He

               Zedeck looks around. Crosses to the lower rear galley.

               He kicks open the panel on the stove. Rips out the propane

               of the ramp he grabs its hydraulic strut.

               Plummeting death.

               His grip is all that separates his dangling body from a long 
               Serge tumbles by Marshall, limbs flailing, and with a scream 
               Woven from a thousand nightma5, he loses his grip and slides 
               off the ramp into the jetblack sky, falling endlessly.

               Shepherd and Caldwell manage to hang to safety webbing as 
               the

               Without chutes also manage to hang on.

               As the plane depressurizes, it BUCKS like a wild bronco.

               Marshall looks down into the sky. Below his dangling legs, 
               parachutes blossoij. He's straining... he can't hold on 
               forever.

               INT. COCKPIT -

               Gibbs fights the wheel.

               Oxygen masks spring out from an overhead compartment as air 
               is sucked out of the cockpit...

               The plane shudders and jumps badly....

               KC-135 PILOT (V.0. RADIO)

               Air Force One, back off. I repeat, back off.

               Gibbs wrestles with the yoke, to no avail.

                                     GIBBS
                         She's bucking. I can't hold her!

               KC-135 PILOT (V.0. RADIO)

               What are you doing? Back off! Back off!

               EXT. SKY -

               Air Force One jerks upward, snapping off the fueling arm of 
               the KC-135.

                                     KC-135 PILOT
                         LOOK OUT!

               The broken edge of the fueling arm scrapes along the top of 
               Air Force One... metal against metal... tearing a gash in 
               the plane... Sparks fly.

               ONE OF THE SPARKS

               ignites the river of gasoline being pumped from the refueling 
               craft's belly.

               INT. AIR FORCE ONE, COCKPIT -

               Gibbs Sees the fueling arm catch fire. It doesn't take a 
               rocket scientist to figure what's coming. The flames creep 
               up toward the gas tanks.

                                     GIBBS
                         Holy Shiti Gibbs pushes the stick 
                         down and Air Force One begins to 
                         dive to safety.

               EXT. SKY -

               Air Force One descends.

               Whipping fire trails the KC-135.

               Slowly rolls it way into the plane's main tank.

               A burning fuse.

               BARRROOOOOOOM! A FIRECLOUD ERUPTS ACROSS THE SKY.

               Sky like daylight.

               From this incredible firecloud, the burned out skeleton of 
               an airplane emerges, falling toward earth.

               The F-15 escort zoom toward the unexpected fireball.

                                     COL. CARLTON
                         Everybody break. Now! Now! Now!

               Carlton's planes go into emergency climb, standing on their 
               afterburners to escape the inferno.

               INT. EMERGENCY PARACHUTE LAUNCH RAMP -

               Marshall hangs on to the strut for dear life as the 
               pressurized air swooshes by him, taking with it everything 
               that isn't nailed down including some of the spare parachutes.

               Fire rains down from the heavens, the sky like one giant 
               napalm nightmare.

               The shock wave hits the plane, slamming it violently.

               Almost yanking the hyraulic arm from Marshall's grasp.

               The military aides without parachutes lose their footing and 
               tumble off the platform. SCREAMING as they fall into fire.

               EXT. SKY -

               The burning KC-135 shell, an apocalyptic Flying Dutchman in 
               a vengeful Kamikazee dive at Air Force One.

               It's gonna be close.

               The flaming shell passes only a few hundred yards to the 
               rear of the 747.

               EXT. PARACHUTE LAUNCH RAMP -

               Marshall's got a great view. Flames dance in his eyes as he 
               watches the refueling plane descend.

               The brightness subsides, and the sky grows dark again.

               The wave of pressurized air subsides leaving Zedeck, Marshall, 
               Shepherd and Caldwell on the ramp. Caldwell begins edging 
               toward Marshall.

                                     ZEDECK
                         Don't move.

                                     MAJOR CALDWELL
                         Let me save him.

               Marshall barely hangs on.

                                     ZEDECK
                         That man, he is the president, no?

                                     SHEPHERD
                         Yes. Yes he is.

               Zedeck motions to Caidwell with his gun. "Go get him."

               Caldwell crawls down the ramp and extends his hand to 
               Marshall.

               THE PRESSURE DOOR SLAMMING SHUT -

               zedeck leads Marshall, shepherd and Caldwell away.

               IPRR. AFO'S FLIGHT DECK -

               Gibbs steadies the plane.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Fuel?

               Gibbs checks the guages.

                                     GIBBS
                         More than enough to get us home.

               EXT. WHITE HOUSE - EVENING

               The sun begins to set along the Potomac in long streaks of 
               red and pink. The White House lights flicker on uminating 
               the long staunch columns, the pillars of democracy.

               RNT. WHITE HOUSE SITUATION ROOM - EVENING

               Tired. Strung out. Bickering within the small workgroups.

               Chandler crosses to General Northwood, who has just hung up 
               the phone.

                                     V.P. CHANDLER
                         They still have the President, it's 
                         past their deadline and they haven't 
                         called. What do you think it means?

                                     GENERAL NORTHWOOD
                         Like any good poker player, they're 
                         checking over their hand seeing which 
                         cards to play and which to discard.

               INT. AFO, MISSION COMMUNICATION CENTER - NIGHT

               Zedeck leads the three hostage into the M.C.C.

               Rose and Marshall - their eyes meet. Enormous relief for the 
               both of them. Marshall smiles at his wife, as she fights 
               back her tears.

                                     ALICE
                              (to Korshunov)
                         He didn't leave us.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         You are a resilient man, Mr.

               President.

               Zedeck grabs Caldwell's hands and tapes them behind his back 
               with duct tape. Rose and Alice already have their hands taped.

                                     KORSHUNQV
                         You must forgive the tape, but we 
                         were starting to feel outnumbered...

               Gibbs!

               INT. FLIGHT DECK -

               Gibbs puts the plane on automatic pilot. Rises to join the 
               group.

               INT. MISSION COMMUNICATIONS CENTER -

               Korshunov separates Marshall from his family. Waves him into 
               the Com Officer's chair. His hands are now wrapped too.

               Gibbs enters looking down.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Special Agent Gibbs. You helped do 
                         this?

                                     GIBBS
                         Yes, Mr. President.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Why?

                                     GIBBS
                         Because it is my duty.

                                     MARSHALL
                         You're duty to what? The country you 
                         served doesn't exist anymore.

                                     GIBBS
                         My loyalty was never to my country.

               I serve my commanding officers.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         You don't think the leaders of the 
                         KGB would allow peristroika to ruin 
                         years of infiltration? No, when the 
                         Soviet Union collapsed, we took our 
                         sleepers with us.

               Korshunov holds up a telephone.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Now since we've had very little luck 
                         getting Washington or Moscow to 
                         cooperate, I wondered if you would 
                         be so kind.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Over my dead body.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         No. But since I only have a few of 
                         your staff left to kill, perhaps I 
                         will start with your family instead... 
                         Gibbs.

               Gibbs grabs Alice and shoves her into a chair. She fights 
               him off, and he smacks her across the face and shoves his 
               gun into her neck.

               Marshall and Rose struggle against their bonds.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         The world is such a dangerous place 
                         and we can't always protect our 
                         children.

                                     ROSE
                         Please. You can kill me but leave my 
                         daughter alone.

               Korshunov runs his finger down Alice's cheek.

                                     MARSHALL
                         She isn't a part of this. This is 
                         between you and me.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Call up Petrov and order 
                         Stravanavitch' S release.

               Marshall looks to Alice, then Rose, then back to Alice.

                                     MARSHALL
                         This administration does not negotiate 
                         with terrorists.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Pity. Mr. Gibbs.

               Gibbs withdraws his pistol. Places it against Alice's temple.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Perhaps a President does not 
                         negotiate, but does a father?
                              (beat)
                         An interesting choice. Your daughter 
                         versus your world vision. The implicit 
                         trust of a family against your oath 
                         of office.

               Tears of fears are streaming down Alice's face. She looks 
               into her father's eyes.

                                     ALICE
                         Daddy...

                                     MARSHALL
                         Alice... I...

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         And once the trigger is pulled, she 
                         is gone forever. Then, I wonder, how 
                         do you live, knowing you could've 
                         saved her?

               Marshall struggles with his duty. His honor.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         And could you ever forget the look 
                         on her face as she ceases to exist... 
                         Late at night, when you think about 
                         her, will Stravanavitch really matter 
                         anymore?

               Marshall tries to look away, but Zedeck forces him to watch.

                                     ALICE
                         Daddy. Daddy, please...

                                     ROSE
                         Jim... for godsake!

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Look inside your heart. No one will 
                         think you weak. Five...

               Alice's face, trying to be brave.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Four...

                                     ROSE
                         Jim...

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Three...

               Rose looks away.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Two. .

               Alice looks at her father for the very last time. Then shuts 
               her eyes tight.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         One...

               Gibbs begins to squeeze the trigger.

                                     MARSHALL
                         NO!

               Korshunov smiles.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Stop.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         You'll do it?

                                     MARSHALL
                         Yes, I'll do it.
                              (broken)
                         Just leave my family alone.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Good. Good.

               Gibbs withdraws the gun from Alice's temple. Alice opens her 
               eyes and gasps for breath.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Bring him the phone...

               You are true to your nature, Mr.

               President.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Someday, you'll regret my nature.

                         You don't like seeing people get 
                         hurt. Now in morality, that is a 
                         virtue. In politics, however, that 
                         is weakness.

               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

               A sleepless Petrov paces back and forth, smoking a cigarette.

               The phone RINGS. He looks up expectantly as his aide answers.

                                     AIDE
                         Sir, the President of the United 
                         States wishes to speak with you.

               Petrov stops in mid-pace. Considers his cigarette for a moment 
               and then walks over to the phone.

                                     PETROV
                         Mr. President.

               INT. PRISON CELL - NIGHT

               A guard walks down the cold steel hallway. He rattles the 
               bar of a darkened cage, he pulls out a set of keys and unlocks 
               the door.

                                     GUARD
                         Stravanavitch.

               Stravanavitch awakes, and leans forward into the light. He 
               and the guard trade looks. After a beat, the guard turns and 
               retreats down the the hallway.

               Stravanavitch rises from his bunk and approaches the cell 
               door. He leans against it and it swings open.

               INT. M.C.C. - NIGHT

               Rose stares at Marshall. Her look is hard to read. Distant...  
               cold, perhaps.

                                     ROSE
                         Can my husband sit next to me?

               Korshunov considers the pair. Hands taped behind their back.

               They're harmless. Korshunov nods.

               Marshall rises and joins her on the pilot's rest bunk.

                                     ROSE
                         I don't know why you stayed.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Please... don't start with me.

               Rose moves closer to him, and speaks in a low voice.

                                     ROSE
                         There's something I need to tell 
                         you... and God knows if I'll ever 
                         get another chance.

               From behind, we see her push his taped hands away.

               He looks at her quizically.

                                     ROSE
                         No matter what happens, you have 
                         been and always will be my hero.

               He feels the wall behind him. A dull edge of metal twisted 
               slightly from the earlier cockpit door explosion.

               He understands.

                                     MARSHALL
                         And you have always been my guardian 
                         angel.

               She smiles back at him.

                                     ROSE
                         I will never regret my life with 
                         you.

               Behind Marshall's back, he begins to cut away at the duct 
               tape.

               INT. MOSCOW CENTRAL PRISON, HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Ivan Stravanavitch walks down the long prison hallway. Other 
               PRISONERS see him and begin banging on their bars in rhythm.

               As he parades down the corridor, the banging grows until it 
               becomes deafening. Stravanavitch smiles a cocky smile.

               One by one, guard doors swing open in front of him. In fact, 
               a few of the HACKS salute Stravanavitch as he passes.

               INT. MISSION COMMUNICATION CENTER - AIR FORCE ONE

               The communication board beeps and Zedeck picks up the line.

               He exchanges some words with the caller in Russian, then 
               hangs up the phone.

                                     SERGE
                         It's confirmed. Stravanavitch is on 
                         his way out. Our men are waiting 
                         outside.

               Korshunov smiles and puts his hand on Zedeck's shoulder.

                                     ROSE
                         You got what you wanted. You going 
                         to release us now?

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         You're very valuable. And our nation 
                         needs so many things.

               Marshall leans his head against the wall. Just as he expected.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Could I... Could I have some water?

               Korshunov nods, motions Zedeck to take care of it. Zedeck 
               reluctanty descends to the main cabin.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         The taste of defeat is bitter, no?

                                     MARSHALL
                         One thing I've learned as

               President... all defeats are temporary and all victories are 
               temporary. Today' 5 conquerers are tomorrow's vanquished.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         e                    Very poetic.

               Zedeck arrives with a glass of water.

                                     MARSHALL
                         And there's one thing I've learned 
                         from being a sports fan.

               Zedeck brings the cup of water to Marshall's lips. Marshall 
               tips his head back to receive it.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         And that is?

               Water spills over Marshall's face. He shakes it off.

                                     MARSHALL
                         It ain't over, til it's over.

               With blinding speed, Marshall leaps to his feet and swings 
               his arm around Zedeck's throat. He snaps Zedeck's neck with 
               quiet efficency.

               Gibbs fires at Marshall, but Marshall, using Zedeck as a 
               shield, grabs hold of the terrorist'sMP5 and lets loose...  
               mowing down the former Secret Service agent.

               The rest of Gibb's shots pelt against the cockpit controls 
               sending showers of sparks flying.

               Korshunov whips out his gun and lines up a clean shot at 
               Marshall's head.

                                     MAJOR CALDWELL
                         Mr. President.

               Korshunov fires at Marshall, but...

               Major Caidwell dives in front of the bullet spray taking the 
               rounds in his chest.

               Marshall turns his aim to Korshunov... but Korshunov grabs 
               Alice and presses his pistol to her head.

               Stand-off.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Don't be hasty.

               Marshall holds Korshunov in his sights. Slowly advancing.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         You love your daughter, Mr.

               President. And I love my country.

               It's a fair trade.

               Korshunov backs away to the steps. Marshall does not lower 
               his gun. Korshunov disappears down the staircase.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Shepherd.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         Sir...

               Shepherd stands. Marshall unwraps Shepherd's hands.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Call Petrov...
                              (to Rose)
                         I'll be back.

                                     ROSE
                         Both of you.

               Marshall slowly descends the steps to the main cabin. As 
               soon as Shepherd gets her hands loose, Rose rushes to 
               Caidwell's aid. Shepherd crosses to the communications panel 
               and picks up a headset. Begins dialing numbers

               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

               In his nightdress, Stoli Petrov nurses a vodka on ice. His

               PHONE RINGS.

                                     PETROV
                         Petrov.

               Petrov's eyes widen.

               EXT. MOSCOW PRISON EXERCISE YARD - NIGHT

               A wall of bars part and Stravanavitch walks through. Into 
               the main exercise yard.

               The main gate separates him from...

               A group of men wait in the street by a limousine.

               The main gate opens slowly.

               When the men sees Stravanavitch they come to attention and 
               salute him. Stravanavitch returns the salute. And then starts 
               his march toward his limousine...

               A SIREN WAILS. LIGHTS FLOOD THE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF THE 
               PRISON.

               The front gate begins to close. Worry crosses Stravanavitch's 
               face. His men rush toward him, take position by the gate.

               Stravanavitch breaks into a run toward his limousine.

                                     GUARD
                         Halt! Halt!

               Stravanvitch looks behind him. Guards rushing toward him 
               from the yard... the limousine fifty yards ahead of him... 
               closing fast...

               On the limo... the back door open and waiting.

               A shot rings out from the guard tower, followed by another, 
               and another. Like popcorn starting to pop. Stravanavitch's 
               men return fire. A minor war breaks out. Loyal guards battling 
               Stravanavitch sympathizers.

               Stravanavitch caught in the middle, hit by one bullet, then 
               another, then another. He makesit to the open rear door of 
               the limousine, but collapses dead.

               Everyone stops firing. Stravanavitch's men rush to his side..

               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Petrov slips under the covers as an aide knocks on his door.

                                     PETROV
                         What is it?

                                     AIDE
                         It's about Stravanvaitch.

                                     PETROV
                         What about him?

                                     AIDE
                         He's dead, sir. Shot while trying to 
                         escape.

               A beat.

                                     PETROV
                         So be it. The world will sleep easier.

               Petrov turns out his bedside light.

               INT. AIR FORCE ONE, MAIN CABIN - NIGHT

               Marshall ascends down from the upper deck. Spots Korshunov 
               by the front stairway. Korshunov pushes Alice down the stairs 
               to the underdeck.

               INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT

               Autopilot engaged. A shower of sparks erupts from one of the 
               bulletholes in the panel.

               Directional compass... the course heading drifts off to the 
               south.

               INT. PILOT'S REST AREA.

               Unaware of the course drift, Shepherd and Rose lift Caldwell 
               onto a bunk.

                                     ROSE
                         Easy, Major. Easy.

                         You saved his life.

               Caidwell smiles, settles peacefully back in the cot. He dies.

               Rose reaches up and shuts his eyes.

               INT. LOWER GALLEY - NIGHT

               Marshall makes his way through the dimness. Stepping 
               cautiously.

               A shot rings out and richochets off a piece of piping right 
               over Marshall's head.

               Undaunted Marshall advances.

                                     MARSHALL
                         It's over, Korshunov. You won. Now 
                         let her go.

               He listens, footsteps ahead of him.

               ON Korshunov - holding Alice by her hair, practically dragging 
               her over the mid-section wing cross-braces.

               As Marshall appears in the gangway he fires off another shot, 
               hitting a cooling vent. Steam fills the' gangway area, bathed 
               in red auxiliary lighting.

               Korshunov retreats toward the rear of the plane.

                                     MARSHALL (O.S.)
                         There's nowhere to go.

                         The Iraqi Ambassador won't take our 
                         calls. We're trying to get through 
                         to their Central Command.

                                     DEAN
                         To tell them what? The great infidel 
                         himself is flying overhead, Go get 
                         him? This is a man they burn in effigy 
                         daily.

                         If challenged, our fighters are to 
                         state that they are on a rescue 
                         mission.

                                     GENERAL NORTHWOOD
                         Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're 
                         already in on this or they'll think 
                         we're spying.

                                     V.P. CHANDLER
                         If fired upon, tell our fighters 
                         that they are ordered to engage.

               INT. REAR BAGGAGE HOLD - NIGHT

               Marshall checks behind the racks of stored goods and luggage.

               P.O.V. LOOKING DOWN A GUNSIGHT AS MARSHALL WALKS INTO THE

               open.

               A finger on the trigger.

                                     ALICE
                         Dad, look out.

               Korshunov fires and Marshall dives out of the way. He cones 
               up in defensive crouch ready to shoot, but all he can see is 
               Alice.

                                     MARSHALL
                         How you doing, sweetie?

                                     ALICE
                         Been better, Dad... You?

               Marshall smiles briefly. But Alice is yanked around the 
               corner. Marshall hears foatsteps. He junps to his feet and 
               cautiously follows.

               INT. WHITE HOUSE SITUATION ROOM - EVENING

               On the tactical display as a second group of fighters appear.  
               ready to challenge the F-l5's.

               EXT. SKY - NIGHT

               Air Force One and the cluster of F-15's zoom by.

                                     COL. CARLTON
                         Air Force one... please respond. Air 
                         Force One, you are entering hostile 
                         air space. Air Force one...

               All Carlton receives is static.

               INT. AFO'S COCKPIT.

               Nobody at the wheel. The automatic pilot is still engaged.

               INT. F-15 EAGLE COCKPIT.

               Con. CARLTON Okay, guys, time to earn your paychecks. Stay 
               in protective formation, and do not engage, I repeat, do not 
               engage... unless you are fired upon. All wings acknowledge.

                         Halo two, acknowledged.

               The rest of the pilots chime in.

               INT. AIR FORCE ONE, LOWER AFT GALLEY - NIGHT

               Marshall swings into the cubicle... empty.

               He crosses to the cargo bay/parachute launch ramp hatchway.

               Looks through the porthole.

               Korshunov straps on one of the few remaining parachutes. He 
               tosses the rest of the spares out onto the platform.

               Marshall steps onto the platform. Korshunov fires off a round 
               forcing him behind the door for cover.

               Korshunov pulls Alice in front of him and yanks down the 
               ramp activation lever.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Stay where you are.

               The ramp lowers, and Alice gets her first look at the drop.

               Marshall watches the remaining parachutes slide off the ramp 
               and into the stormy sky.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         There goes your ride.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Let my daughter go or I'll take you 
                         out!

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         If you put down the gun, I promise 
                         not to drop her on the way down.

               Korshunov backs toward the edge of the ramp, pulling a 
               struggling and fighting Alice.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Let her go now! Or I will kill you.

               Korshunov is a foot away from the edge of the ramp... two 
               steps back, he and Alice will take the plunge.

               Marshall lines up his shot. Korshunov laughs as he presses 
               his pistol to Alice's ear.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         No you won't. You'll compromise...  
                         like always.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Hold on, Alice.

               Marshall fires, his bullet ripping apart a good deal of 
               Korshunov's face and snapping his body back.

               Korshunov tumbles off the platform, but his limbs are caught.  
               in Alice's. She's knocked to her belly and his dead weight 
               drags her off the edge of the platform.

                                     ALICE
                         NO!

               Marshall dives down the sloping platform, reaching out for 
               her...

               Alice tries to grip the platform with her hands, but she 
               can't hold on. Her hand slip off the metallic lip.

               But as she falls, she's caught by the wrist. Strong arms 
               pull her up. Her father's arms. He carries her back to the 
               safety of the plane. She's sobs uncontrollably.

                                     ALICE
                         Oh NY god... oh my god... oh my god...

                                     MARSHALL
                         It's okay, honey. I got you. I got 
                         you. You're okay.

               Shepherd and Rose appear. Marshall locks eyes with Rose...  
               smiles. Shepherd crosses to the parachute bins.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Gone. They're all gone.

               The plane shakes with the thunder of a supersonic boom.

               EXT. SKY - NIGHT

               A half dozen MiGs race by the cluster of American aircraft 
               at breakneck speeds.

               INT. IRAQI CONTROL TOWER - NIGHT

               GENERAL CERALLOS eyes the radar.

                                     IRAQI SOLDIER
                         The Americans say they are escorting 
                         a damaged plane. Our pilots confirm 
                         they are surrounding a 747.

                                     CERALLOS
                         Did we warn them off?

                                     IRAQI SOLDIER
                         Yes. They refused to alter course 
                         and the 747 would not answer our 
                         hails.

               Cerallos takes a moment, looking at the screen.

                                     CERALLOS
                         It's some kind of trick... a 
                         preliminary airstrike in response to 
                         our troop movement.

                                     IRAQI SOLDIER
                         They are in our airspace. We would 
                         be within our rights.

                                     CERALLOS
                         The world would not look on us kindly 
                         if we shot down a civilian airliner.

               The Soldier listens to chatter coning over his headset.

                                     IRAQI SOLDIER
                         The pilot says it is does not have 
                         the markings of a commercial jet.

                                     CERALLOS
                         Warn then again. If they don't 
                         respond... shoot them down. We will 
                         not be intimidated.

               EXT. AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT

               INT. MISSION COMMUNICATION CENTER - NIGHT

               Another sonic boom.

                                     MARSHALL
                         What is that sound?

               Marshall makes his way to the cockpit.

               Through the cockpit window, a MiG accelerates out of the 
               darkness coming straight at us. At the last second it pulls 
               up slightly, riding over the top of the 747.

               Its sonic boom rocks the jumbo jet.

                                     MARSHALL
                         My god. I think that was a MiG.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         A MiG? Where the hell are we?

               Marshall rushes back to one of the rear upper deck windows.

               He looks out at the F-l5s.

                                     MARSHALL
                         They're flying a protection formation.

                         This is your last warning. You are 
                         violating our airspace. Leave 
                         immediately.

                                     COL. CARLTON
                         I said back off and hold your fire.

               We are on a rescue mission. Do not engage. I repeat, do not 
               engage.

               EXT. SKY - NIGHT

               A MiG loops into position behind Carlton.

               INT. MIG COCKPIT - NIGHT

               switches his targeting computer on. Finds carlton in his 
               sights. Good tone.

               The pilot pulls the trigger.

               EXT. SKY - NIGHT

               The missile detaches from the MiG and slides toward Carlton.

               Carlton breaks formation, leading the missile astray. His 
               plane tucks into a tight little roll. The missile misses 
               over Carlton's rolling wings.

                                     COL. CARLTON
                         Halo Team, this is group leader.

               Halo Team is cleared to engage. I repeat, you are cleared to 
               engage.

               Carlton pulls his plane into a monster climb.

                                     COL. CARLTON
                         This is the real thing boys. Let's

               INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT

               Marshall settles into the pilot's chair. Shepherd comes in.

                         Iraq, sir. We're over Iraq.

                         Iraq? Shep, you're fired.

               Marshall looks at the plane's bearing. The instruments are 
               shot to hell.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Shit.

               Looking forward from underneath an F-15, the MiG heads toward 
               Air Force One. The F-15 fires a sidewinder.

               On the MIG... as it fires its missile. The F-15's sidewinder 
               blows the MIG up, taking the missile with it.

                         you took office.

               Marshall checks out the tactical display.

                                     MARSHALL
                         I'm sure it's like riding a bicycle... 
                         downhill with no brakes and somebody 
                         shooting at you.

               Marshall finds the throttle, pushes it up all the way. He 
               feels the plane out, gently nudges it into a turn.

               EXT. SKY - NIGHT

               Two MiGs flare out of an engagement with the F-15's and break 
               toward Air Force One.

                                     COL. CARLTON
                         We got two on the loose. Someone get 
                         on them.

                                     COL. CARLTON
                         Bullshit. Do it.

               The two MiGs lock onto Air Force One. Each fires a missile 
               at the President's plane, before breaking in opposite 
               directions.

               INT. AFO COCKPIT - NIGHT

               A red buzz. It's all Marshall can do to keep the plane flying 
               straight.

                                     MARSHALL

               EXT. AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT

               Brightly burning flares launch from either side of Air Force 
               One's wings and descend toward earth.

               The missiles follow the heat of the flares, plummeting 
               harmlessly to earth.

               INT. AIR FORCE ONE COCKPIT - NIGHT

               The shock waves from a nearby MiG explosion shakes the plane.

               In the aftermath, Marshall takes a moment and pulls on the 
               pilot's headset.

                                     MARSHALL

               EXT. SKY - NIGHT

               On the two MiG's heading for Air Force One.

               An F-15 drops in behind them. The MiGs scissor and break in 
               OPPosite directions. The F-l5 can only follow one of them.

                                     FIGHTER PILOT 11
                         I'm tight on one, the other's loose.

               I need help down here.

               The other MiG comes up on the 747 and opens fire with his 
               CANNONS. The shells rip up the surface of the aircraft's 
               wing. The MiG swoops past Air Force One and jerks into a *         
               vertical.

               On the damaged wing - Fuel starts leaking out and the outer 
               jet engine catches fire.

               INT. COCKPIT, AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT

               Red warning light flashes on the control panel.

                                     MARSHALL
                         We're hit. We've got an engine on 
                         fire.

                                     COT. CAALTON (V.0.)
                         Shut it down. Shut it down.

               Marshall reaches over and toggles the shutoff switch.

               EXT. AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT

               The engine whirs to a halt and the rushing wind blows out 
               the fire. But now she's only got three engines.

               INT. AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT

               Through the cockpit window, an F-15 settles in front of Air 
               Force One... Flames pouring out of its tail. Under any other 
               condition, it would be pretty. Alice, Rose and Shepherd watch 
               Marshall fly.

                         This is President Marshall. I know 
                         you guys are busy, but we need some

                         Mr. President, it's an honor. Now 
                         with your permission can we lead you 
                         the fuck out of here.

                         You read my mind.

                                     COL. CARLTON
                         Put your pilot on.

                                     MARSHALL
                         He's busy being dead.

               Carlton breaks left, lines up a MiG and fires. He nails the 
               Iraqi aircraft.

                                     COL. CARLTON
                         Who's flying the fucking plane?

                                     MARSHALL
                         I'm doing what I can.

                                     COL. CAELTON
                         Can you, can you change your heading 
                         to Zero Four One point six?

                                     MARSHALL
                         Negative. We've lost navagition. I 
                         don't know where that is.

               Buzzer sounds in Carlton's cockpit. He's been locked on.

                                     COL. CARLTON
                         Oh shit. Hang on. Somebody help me 
                         out. I got one up my ass.

               EXT. SKY - NIGHT

               Carlton puts his plane into a triple canopy roll then slams 
               on his airbreaks. The MiS shoots by him and Carlton lets 
               loose with his CANNONS. The MiG pulls up and disengages.

                                     COL. CARLTON
                         Two and three are heading toward the 
                         Boeing.

                                     COL. CARLTON
                         Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to 
                         the right. Got it?

                                     MARSHALL
                         Got it.

                         Stay cool.

               Canton's plane edges around to the right... and Marshall 
               follows. The 747 leans at an angle and continues the turn 
               until the F-15 is dead ahead. Another plane explodes ahead 
               of him at three o'clock.

                                     MARSHALL
                         How we doing, Colonel?

                                     COL. CARLTON
                         We still got three MiGs running around 
                         and six more on the way.

               Marshall struggles with his stick turning the aircraft to 
               the right.

               EXT. SKY - NIGHT

               Of course its pointless. The Boeing is a fucking sloth 
               compared to these fighters.

               Alice's touch activates offensive mode.

               The F-15 takes the bullet in its mid-section. BOOM!

               The blast slams bits of the fighter plane against Air Force

                         Sir, we're going to pound pavement 
                         in less than three minutes.

               Marshall holds the yoke in one hand and unclips the snatch 
               harness from the dead ranger in the co-pilot's seat.

               The last red light on the engine control panel starts to 
               flash.

                                     MARSHALL
                         I'M LOSING NUMBER FOUR!

               Marshall, still fighting the yoke, stands. He takes a deep 
               breatn, drops the wheel and runs like a motherfucker for the 
               stairs.

               EXT. SICY,  AIR FORCE ONE.

               Drops into a banking twist.

               The cable line runs taut.

               The KC-lO tries to compensate.

                         for the door.

               INT. MAIN CABIN -

               The taut straining cable snaps one corner of the metal clasp.

               The clasp starts to bend.

               IN SLOW MOTION -

               MARSHALL sprinting to the open door.

               The clasp twisting. The cable hook ready to slip of f it.

               Marshall clips on, and dives out of the door. He slides forty 
               feet down, when....

               The clasp gives. The cable line snaps away from the plane...  
               one end connected to the KC-l0, the other connected to...

               Nothing.

               EXT. SKY

               Marshall slides down the cable, gripping at it, trying to 
               break his fall.

               Air Force One plummets toward the water.

               Marshall sliding, right behind it, running out of cable.

               At the end of his rope, literally. Marshall's harness snags 
               on the end clasp. He hangs on for dear life.

               Moments later Air Force One impacts.

               A huge EXPLOSION, water and flames blows sky high into the 
               night.

               feet below.

               The STRIKE FORCE LEADER signals to his team.

               Without a moment's hesitation, they dive into the darkness 
               and plummet toward earth.

               EXT. MANSION - NIGHT

               A military GUARD, old Soviet-style uniform, rounds the corner 
               of the large estate toting an AK-47.

               A red laser dot appears briefly on his forehead and, after a 
               beat, the red dot seems to bleed.  The Guard collapses dead.  
               Two other GUARDS are dispatched with single, silenced shots.

               A Strike Team member at a junction box awaits a signal.

               Through infra-red binoculars the strike Force Leader watches 
               his assault troops as they take positions.

               The soldiers pull Stravanavitch to his feet and haul him out 
               of the room.

               FOLLOWING -  As they push down the hallway.

               MANSION SECURITY GUARDS rally with haphazard gunfire.

               Out come the strike force's flash-bang grenades.  Exploding 
               everywhere, disorienting Stravanavitch's men.

               Signal flares burn as a helicopter descends on the position.  
               The Strike Team evacuates across the field and forces a 
               struggling Stravanavitch into the low-hovering copter.

               The commandos swiftly board the craft as a handful of 
               Stravanavitch's guards break into the clearing.  They open 
               fire.

               And the mounted machine guns on the helicopter return.

               One of the Strike Team members takes a bullet to the neck.

               continues.  All attention turns to the front table.

               A rotund, silver haired-man in his late sixties rises and 
               sidles past U.S. and Russian flags up to the podium

               we hear a young woman's voice translating.

                                     TRANSLATOR (V.0.)
                         Tonight we are honored to have with

               AT THE FRONT TABLE -

               A translator's words ring in the earpiece of a handsome man 
               in his mid-forties.  Worry lines crease his forehead and the 
               touch of gray at his temples attest to three very difficult 
               years in office.

               This man is JAMES MARSHALL, and he is the PRESIDENT of the 
               UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.  He busily makes last minute changes 
               to his speech.

               Mr. President.

               Thunderous applause as Marshall rises and approaches the 
               podium.

               At the back of the room, DOHERTY, a senior policy adviser 
               whispers to the President's Chief of Staff ED SHEPHERD...

                         Maybe we should consider running him 
                         for re-election instead of the U.S.

               The applause dies as Marshall begins to speak.

                                     MARSHALL

                         Good evening and thank you.  First I 
                         would ask you to join me in a moment 
                         of silence for the victims of the 
                         Turkmenistan massacres.

               The room remains silent a few beats.  Most guests respectfully 
               bow their heads.

               Marshall begins again, but this time in English.  The young 
               woman translates simultaneously for the Russian audience.

                         As you know, three weeks ago American 
                         Special Forces, in cooperation with 
                         the Russian Republican Army, secured 
                         the arrest of Turkmenistan's self-
                         proclaimed dictator, General Ivan 
                         Stravanavitch, whose brutal sadistic 
                         reign had given new meaning to the 
                         word horror.  I am proud to say our 
                         operation was a success.

               Applause from the audience.  Marshall turns the page on his 
               speech.

                                     MARSHALL
                         And now, yesterday's biggest threat 
                         to world peace... today awaits trial 
                         for crimes against humanity.

               During the applause, Marshall pulls a page from the speech, 
               folds it and slides it into his pocket.  He removes his 
               glasses and looks out into the crowd.  His tone becomes more 
               personal.

               He's not reciting the speech anymore.

                                     MARSHALL
                         What we did here was important.  We 
                         finally pulled our heads out of the 
                         sand, we finally stood up to the 
                         brutality and said "We've had enough.  
                         Every time we ignore these atrocities-- 
                         the rapes, the death squads, the 
                         genocides- every time we negotiate 
                         with these, these thugs to keep them 
                         out of gig country and away from gig 
                         families, every time we do thiS.E. 
                         we legitimize terror.

               Terror is not a legitimate system of government.  And to 
               those who commit the atrocities I say, we will no longer 
               tolerate, we will no longer negotiate, and we will no longer 
               be afraid.  It's your turn to be afraid.

               Applause rolls through the crowd.

               EXT. MOSCOW INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - NIGHT

               Sprawling terminals spread out to runways like tentacles.

               ON THE TARMAC -

               Bathed in floodlights, perched majestically on the runway, 
               dwarfing nearby commuter and military jets, stands...

                                     AIR FORCE ONE
                         The President's own Boeing 747-200, 
                         dubbed "the flying White House".  
                         The distinctive royal blue stripe 
                         over a thin gold line tapers to a 
                         tail adorned with the American flag 
                         and the Presidential Seal Secret 
                         Service agents and Marines stand 
                         guard at the aircraft's perimeter.

               A RUSSIAN NEWS VAN emerges from the darkness and pulls to a 
               stop by a Secret Service barricade.

               SPECIAL AGENT GIBBS greets the Russian news team that emerges.

                                     GIBBS
                         Gentlemen, welcome to Air Force One.

               Please present your equipment to Special Agent Walters for 
               inspection.

               The news team's segment producer, a crusty old Russian named 
               KORSHUNOV raises his big bushy eyebrows.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         We've already been inspected.

                                     GIBBS
                         Sir, this plane carries the President 
                         of the United States.

               Though we wish to extend your press service every courtesy, 
               you will comply with our security measures to the letter.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Of course.  I'm sorry.

               Korshunov and the FIVE MEMBERS of his news crew present their 
               video cameras, sound equipment and supplies to Special Agent 
               WALTERS for inspection.  Secret Service DOGS sniff through 
               the baggage.

                                     GIBBS
                         Please place your thumbs on the ID 
                         pad.

               Korshunov puts his thumb on the ID pad of a portable computer.

               The computer matches up his thumbprint with his dossier and 
               photograph.  "CLEARED" flashes on the computer screen.

                         *                     CBS said they'll 
                         give us four minutes.  They thought 
                         the Russian was a nice touch.

                                     MARSHALL
                         I always wondered if my freshman 
                         Russian class would come in handy.

                                     DOHERTY
                         Sir, you threw out page two.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Goddamn right I did.  I asked for a 
                         tough-as-nails speech and you gave 
                         me diplomatic bullshit.  What's the 
                         point in having a speech if I have 
                         to ad-lib?

                                     DOHERTY
                         It was a good ad-lib, sir.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Thanks.  Wrote it last night.

               The President exits the building and enters his limousine.

                         Gentlemen, this is Maria Mitchell.

               Press Relations for the Presidential Flight Office.  She'll 
               take you from here.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Ms.  Mitchell.  So nice to finally 
                         meet you in person.

                                     MITCHELL
                         The President and I were delighted 
                         that we could accommodate you.  Now 
                         if you're all cleared?
                              (Gibbs nods)
                         You can follow me then.

               They ascend into the belly of Air Force One.

                         *                    I'll be giving 
                         you a brief tour, then during the

                         will be allowed out of the press 
                         area at a time for filming.  You 
                         will have exactly ten minutes with 
                         the President and twenty with the 
                         crew...

               EXT. STREETS OF MOSCOW, PRESIDENT'S MOTORCADE - NIGHT

               Winding its way down narrow cobblestone streets onto a major 
               thoroughfare.

               INT. PRESIDENTIAL LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

               The limousine is packed with advisers, aides, military staff, 
               including LT. COL. PERKINS, the keeper of the NUCLEAR FOOTBALL 
               handcuffed to his wrist.  In the b.g. on the limo's television 
               set, the LARRY KING SHOW indulges in its normal banter.

               Marshall wearily rubs his temples as he stifles a yawn.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         You wanna knock of f?

                                     MARSHALL
                         No, no.  I'm fine.  What did the 
                         Speaker say?

                                     SHEPHERD
                         He and the NRA don't like the wording.

                         Apparently taking uzis away from 
                         sixth graders isn't as popular as we 
                         thought it'd be.  Representative 
                         Taylor is working on a compromise.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Put together a score sheet.  I'll 
                         make some calls.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         With all due respect, sir, maybe you 
                         should give them this one.  Your 
                         numbers are still pretty low and you 
                         called in a lot of chips to nail 
                         Stravanavitch.

                                     MARSHALL
                         I might still have a few chips left.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         *                     We could always 
                         put you in a duck blind with a twelve 
                         gauge.  The second amendment types'll 
                         love that.

                                     MARSHALL
                         This is a crime bill, Shep.  Killing 
                         a couple ducks won't get it through 
                         committee.  Besides, Shep, I told 
                         you...  I don't shoot babies and I 
                         don't kiss guns.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         Other way around, sir.

                                     MARSHALL
                              (realizing what he 
                              said)
                         Right... Christ I'm tired.  Do me a 
                         favor and keep me away from the press.

               Marshall's watch alarm beeps and he automatically reaches 
               into his breast pocket, pulls out a medicine vial and downs 
               two pills with a coffee chaser.

               On the T.V.

                         ... and your reaction to the 
                         President's trip to Moscow.  Good or 
                         bad?

               Shepherd turns up the volume.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         This is the part I wanted you to 
                         see.

                         Criminal.  One of our boys died in 
                         Marshall's little publicity stunt 
                         and for what?  So we could claim 
                         victory over another country's 
                         problems instead of our own?  And 
                         now he's got the nerve to prance 
                         around Moscow gloating, while that 
                         poor boy's family is left to bury 
                         him.  If I were Marshall, I'd be 
                         ashamed of myself.

                         the President from Michael Danforth, 
                         the Speaker of the House.

               Marshall mutes the television.  A quiet moment.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         *                     My opinion.  
                         We can't let him get away with that 
                         kind of language.

               Marshall considers.  Then decides.

                                     MARSHALL
                         It's bait.  Don't take it.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked 
                         this administration on national 
                         television.  You can't afford to 
                         leave that hanging.

                                     MARSHALL
                              (ignoring Shepherd)
                         Did we tape the Duke game?

                         It's waiting on the plane.  The ending 
                         was pretty...

                                     MARSHALL
                              (interrupting)
                         Please don't tell me.  Just for once, 
                         *                     let me be 
                         surprised.

                         if necessary.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         A dubious distinction, no?

                                     MITCHELL
                         I guess it depends on your 
                         perspective.

               They walk by several conference rooms, running down the 
               starboard side of the plane.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         And all these rooms here?

                                     MITCHELL
                         Conference rooms, though some have 
                         other functions.  The one up front 
                         doubles as an emergency medical 
                         center.

               Past the conference rooms, they walk by a small side room 
               where SECRETARIES work on computers, generating documents.

                                     MITCHELL
                         As you can see, back here's more 
                         like a regular plane.  Security and 
                         Secret Service take this cabin.
                         You'll be in the rear with the press 
                         pool.

               The REAR PRESS CABIN, just ahead of the rear galley and bank 
               of bathrooms.  A handful of disgruntled reporters feign sleep.

                                     MITCHELL
                         Here's a press kit.  I'll let you 
                         guys get comfortable and once we're 
                         airborne I'll be able to schedule 
                         the interviews.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Thank you.

               Mitchell exits forward.  One of the reporters stirs and looks 
               up at the news team.  He groans.  Space is a premium back 
               here.

                                     REPORTER
                         You fellas win some sort of fly-with-
                         POTUS contest?

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Potus?  What is Potus?

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Ah, no.  We won nothing.  We are

                         Right.  Listen, this here... This is 
                         my row.  You'll have to sit over 
                         there.

               Korshunov trades looks with his news team.

               EXT. MOSCOW INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - NIGHT

               The President's motorcade pulls up in front of Air Force 
               One.

               INT. AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT

               The President and his entourage ascend from the lower deck 
               platform onto the main deck.  COL. DANIEL AXELROD, Air Force 
               One's pilot, snaps off a salute as he passes.

                                     COL. AXELROD
                         Welcome aboard, Mr. President.

                                     MARSHALL
                              (returns salute)
                         Hey Danny.  How's it look tonight?

                                     COL. AXELROD
                         Glassy, sir.  Care to take the wheel?

                                     MARSHALL
                         You keep offering, one of these days 
                         I'll take you up on it.
                              (to no one in 
                              particular)
                         Rose and Alice back yet?

                                     AIDE
                         No, Mr. President.  The ballet ran 
                         late.  Their ETA is seventeen minutes.

               Marshall nods as he pulls off his bow tie and enters his 
               stateroom.  Shepherd follows two steps behind.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         Mr. President?

               Marshall halts Shepherd with a gesture.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Thirty seconds.

               Shepherd nods and waits by the door.  Lt. Col. Perkins takes 
               a seat outside the Presidents stateroom and opens the latest 
               Tom Clancy thriller, using the nuclear football as a lap 
               desk.

               INT. PRESIDENT'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

               Marshall collapses on the couch, rubs his eyes, then closes 
               them.  A moment of peace in a breakneck day.

               The knock at the door jars him.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Yes.

               Shepherd enters.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         Can I at least issue a press release 
                         objecting to the Speaker's choice of 
                         wording?

               President Marshall picks up one of the many phones in his 
               office.

                                     MARSHALL
                         I said it's not worth the fight.
                              (into phone)
                         Steward, please.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         We'll just say it was in bad taste.

               *                               MARSHALL

               Forget it, Shep.  The kid gave his life for his country and 
               the

               Speaker's a bastard for turning him into a sound bite.  I'll 
               take the heat.  Understood?

                                     SHEPHERD
                         You give me ulcers.

                                     MARSHALL
                         That's my job.

               A STEWARD enters the room.

                                     STEWARD
                         Mr. President?

                                     MARSHALL
                         Hey Mike.  Could you get me a 
                         Heineken?

                                     SHEPHERD
                         No, wait.  Get him one of the Russian 
                         beers.

               The steward nods and disappears from the room.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         We've got those Russian news guys on 
                         board and it'll look good in the 
                         papers.

               Marshall picks up a stack of policy reports.  Thumbs through 
               them.

                                     MARSHALL
                         C'mon Shep.  I've been eating borscht 
                         and drinking vodka for days.  Isn't 
                         that enough?
                              (off paper)
                         New home starts are down.

               The steward arrives with the Russian beer.  Marshall takes a 
               swig.  He swallows hard.  Piss-water.  Marshall crosses to 
               his sink and pours the beer out.  He hands the bottle to the 
               steward.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Fill this with Heineken.

               The steward nods...

                                     STEWARD
                         Yes, Mr. President.

               AND SLINKS AWAY WITH THE BOTTLE. MARSHALL CATCHES HIMSELF --

                                     MARSHALL
                         I don't believe this.  I'm playing 
                         politics with a bottle of beer.  A 
                         goddamn bottle of beer.  I've been 
                         in office too long.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         Look on the bright side... if the 
                         polls don't change, you won't have 
                         that problem, sir.

               Marshall picks up the phone again.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Yeah.  Put the Duke game on in my 
                         room.

               INT. AFO'S MISSION COMMUNICATION CENTER - NIGHT

               THREE Air Force SPECIALISTS man the elaborate communication 
               system occupying much of the upper deck.  Top-of-the-line 
               computers, communication systems, video decks, and satellite 
               receivers.

                                     AIR FORCE SPECIALIST
                         Yes, Mr. President.

               He slides in a videotape and channels the feed to the *         
               president's stateroom.

               INT. PRESIDENT'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

               A monitor comes to life with a basketball game.

                                     MARSHALL
                              (to Shepherd)
                         Defense and State Department in the 
                         conference room in one hour.  I want 
                         to review the Iraq situation.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         Yes, sir.

               Shepherd exits as Marshall settles into his leather chair 
               and dives into work.  He punches a button on the speakerphone.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Get me the Housing Secretary...

               EXT. AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT

               The Marine Guards snap to attention once again as the First 
               Lady's motorcade arrives.

               ROSE MARSHALL, a self-assured woman with an aristocratic 
               gleam, alights from her limo.  She takes a few steps, then 
               turns, tapping her foot impatiently.

                                     ROSE
                         C'mon Alice, we're 20 minutes late.

               Your father's gonna have a fit.

               ALICE, the President's 13-year-old daughter, straggles out 
               of the car, rolling her eyes.

                                     ALICE
                         It's not like he hasn't made us wait 
                         a few times.

                                     ROSE
                         Well, you aren't the President, dear.

                                     ALICE
                         Yeah, no duh.

               INT. MAIN DECK, AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT

               As the First Lady's entourage enters.

                                     ROSE
                         Why don't you go say hi?

               Again, Alice rolls her eyes.

                                     ROSE
                         What is wrong with you tonight?  
                         Come here.

               Rose pulls Alice aside.

                                     ROSE
                         You don't want to say hi to your 
                         father?

                                     ALICE
                         I'm sure he's busy.

                                     ROSE
                         Don't you even want to ask?

               Alice toes her foot into the carpet as she releases an 
               exasperated sigh.  She is, in this moment, the patron saint 
               of know-it-all 13-year-old girls.  Alice waves toward the 
               Presidential Suite.

                                     ALICE
                         If I go over there to say hi to daddy 
                         President, Mike's going to tell me 
                         he's in a meeting and can't be 
                         disturbed.  Then when the plane starts 
                         to taxi, he'll come out and say "Hey, 
                         are you guys back?  Did you enjoy 
                         the ballet?"  But he'll be on his 
                         way to another meeting and won't 
                         wait for an answer.  Then you'll get 
                         pissed at him and he'll get pissed 
                         at you.  It's like you guys rehearse 
                         or something.

               With the weight of the entire world on her shoulders, Alice

               Collapses into one of the many leather chairs.  It seems to 
               swallow her.  JORY, a steward passes.

                                     ALICE
                         Hey Joey, how `bout a cocoa, double 
                         whip cream.

                                     ROSE
                         Alice...

                                     ALICE
                         Mom, just this once, give it a rest.

                                     ROSE
                         You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about 
                         this back...

                                     ALICE
                         Back at The Fishbowl?

               Alice eyes the swirl of Aides who are pretending to work 
               nearby.

               But it's obvious that they're eavesdropping.  Alice smiles 
               and waves at them dramatically.

                                     ROSE
                         We'll talk at home.
                              (beat)
                         You know, most girls aren't as lucky 
                         as you.  For most girls seeing the 
                         Bolshoi ballet would be the experience 
                         of a lifetime.

                                     ALICE
                         I know, Mom.
                              (sees the hurt in her 
                              mom's eyes and softens)
                         It was great... really.

               Rose nods, smiling a half-smile.  After a thoughtful beat, 
               Alice gets up and crosses to the Presidential suite.  She 
               exchanges words with the Aide standing outside the door and 
               comes back, covering her disappointment.

                                     ALICE
                         He's in a meeting.  He can't be 
                         disturbed.

                                     ROSE
                         I'm sorry, honey.

                                     ALICE
                         No, it's okay.  After all, he is the 
                         President, right?

               Joey the steward hands her her cocoa with a wink and a smile.

               Her eyes light up at the mound of whip cream on top.

                                     ALICE
                         When I write my memoirs I think I'll 
                         devote an entire chapter to the cocoa 
                         aboard Air Force One.

                                     ROSE
                         Your father never means to be so...

                                     ALICE
                         I know...
                              (beat)
                         But lotsa times I feel like it's me 
                         versus the world.  Some kid at school 
                         teases me and the same day a plague 
                         breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it 
                         doesn't take a genius to figure which 
                         is more important.

                                     ROSE
                         Some kids were teasing you?

                                     ALICE
                         That's not really the point.

               A quiet pause, then...

                                     ROSE
                         You're right and I'll tell you a 
                         secret.  I know exactly how you feel.

                                     ALICE
                         Big secret.  You said the same thing 
                         to Newsweek.

               The plane jolts forward as it begins to taxi.

                                     ALICE
                         We're taxiing.  Ready.  And... five...  
                         four... three.. two... one... Cue 
                         Daddy.

               Alice points.  And as if on cue, Marshall exits from his 
               office and checks his watch.

                                     ALICE
                         Oooooh, I'm good.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Hey, you guys back already?

               Alice nods.

                                     MARSHALL
                         How was...
                              (thinks, then remembers)
                         ...the ballet?

                                     ALICE
                              (theatrically)
                         It was the experience of a lifetime.

                                     MARSHALL
                         How `bout a hug for the old man.

               Alice rises and hugs her father.  A White House PHOTOGRAPHER 
               snaps off a few shots for the papers.  Alice makes a face at 
               them.  A second later, Shepherd comes up the corridor, 
               breaking up the pair.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         Mr. President... they're ready for 
                         you in the conference room.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Okay.  Hey, pumpkin, you'll tell me 
                         all about it later, right?

                                     ALICE
                         Sure.

               As Marshall moves toward the conference room, he bends and 
               gives Rose a quick peck on the cheek.  It all reeks of 
               formality.

                                     ROSE
                         May I speak to you for a moment?

                                     MARSHALL
                         Can't it wait?

                                     ROSE
                         No, Mr. President.  It can't.

               INT.  PRESIDENT'S OFFICE.

               Rose shuts the door behind them.  As she starts to speak, 
               Marshall pulls her into a long passionate kiss.  Rose pulls 
               away.

                                     ROSE
                         Don't.  I know spin control when I 
                         feel it.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Rose, I don't have time for this.

               I've gotta go stop a war.

                                     ROSE
                         For godsakes, Jim, slow down and 
                         stop acting like the little dutch 
                         boy.  Not even you can plug all the 
                         world's leaks.  Don't you think it's 
                         a sign you're pushing too hard when 
                         your daughter sees more of you on 
                         MTV news than in person.

                                     MARSHALL
                         She's a big girl.  She understands.

                                     ROSE
                         How do you know she understands?  
                         You haven't spent more than five 
                         minutes with her, or me, in weeks.

                                     MARSHALL
                         And when have I had five minutes?
                         When I wake up in the morning and 
                         I'm already three hours behind 
                         Schedule.  What do you want me to 
                         do, Rose, tell the G7 to fuck off 
                         because I'm a family man?

                                     (BEAT)
                         I'm sorry. That wasn't fair.

                                     ROSE
                         No. It wasn't.

               He takes her in his arms.

                                     MARSHALL
                         You know what?

                                     ROSE
                         What?

                                     MARSHALL
                         I miss you. And I miss her.

                                     ROSE
                         But that's the point, Jim. We're                     
                         right here.

                                     MARSHALL
                         I wish it were that easy...

               Long beat. He smiles at her, it's the same sweet smile that 
               won her heart, the same smile that got him elected. She 
               softens.

                                     MARSHALL
                         I'll make it up to you, I promise.

                                     ROSE
                         I should trust that promise? Because 
                         you know the voters are still waiting 
                         for that middle class tax cut.

                                     MARSHALL
                         This promise isn't subject to 
                         Congressional approval.

               She smiles. The tension breaks.

                                     ROSE
                         How did your speech go?

                                     MARSHALL
                         Well, they aren't burning me in 
                         effigy. That's always a good sign.

               They kiss again, this time for real. But... a knock on the 
               door.

                                     SHEPHERD (0.5.)
                         Mr. President.

               Shepherd opens the door.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Look on the bright side, hon. Shep 
                         here thinks I'll be a one termer.

                                     ROSE
                         Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to 
                         schedule your daughter in?

                                     SHEPHERD
                         She is scheduled. Her school play's 
                         Tuesday night.

               Rose rolls her eyes.

                                     MARSHALL
                         The First Lady was making a joke, 
                         Shep. I'll make some time, Rose. I 
                         promise.

               Marshall heads for his meeting.

                         United States Air Force One, this is

                         for immediate take-off on runway

               Axeirod eases up the throttle and the four GE-F103 Turbofan

               CLOSE ON - A coffee pot pouring piping joe into a mug 
               emblazoned with ubiguitou Presidential Seal. The mug is placed 
               on a tray with a half-dozen other mugs and passed to a STEW. 
               He carries the tray down the corridor past passenger cabins.

               Drowsiness has overtaken the plane. Many of the passengers 
               and aides are asleep. CNN plays On T.V. sets, entertaining 
               the few night owls and news junkies.

                                     CNN REPORTER (T.V.)
                         In an unusually aggressive speech, 
                         the President characterized the 
                         Stravanavitch regime as thugs whose 
                         brutality will no longer be tolerated.  
                         Meanwhile, in Turkmenistan, 
                         Stravanavitch's ouster has sent the 
                         country into turmoil.  Tens of 
                         thousands of refugees continue to 
                         huddle in U.N. safe havens, as rival 
                         Stravanavitch loyalists fight among 
                         themselves for control. But at least 
                         for the time being, the ethnic 
                         cleansing has been stopped.

               Toward the front of the plane, the steward enters the 
               conference room.

               INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

               As the steward closes the door behind him, all background 
               noise disappears. We are in a sound shielded room. Even the 
               engines' drone cannot be heard.

               The lights in the room are dim as MAJOR CALDWELL, a military 
               advisor, projects satellite photos of Iraqi military bases 
               onto a screen.

               The steward serves coffee as unobtrusively as he can while 
               the meeting continues.

                                     MAJOR CALDWELL
                         Our KH-ll's took this one at 0100 
                         hours. What you see here is the 
                         mobilization of two mechanized

                         The Iraqi ambassador is claiming 
                         it's just an exercise.

                                     MARSHALL
                         An exercise in futility. Send the 
                         Nimitz back in.

                                     MAJOR CALDWELL
                         The northern border's gotten a bit 
                         hairy. Their MiGs are playing tag 
                         with our Tomcats and our boys are 
                         just itching to engage.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Tell our boys to cool their jets. I 
                         don't need `em creating policy for 
                         me.

               We follow the steward as he slips out of the conference room 
               and back into the...

               INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               with a few coffees left on his tray. One of them is scooped 
               up by Gibbs as he passes, his nose is buried in a fax.

               INT. SECRET SERVICE CABIN - NIGHT

               Gibbs leans in the cabin.

                                     GIBBS
                         Hey Walters, you and Johnson come 
                         here a second. Reykjavik just sent 
                         the advance team report.

               Special Agents Walters and JOHNSON rise and follow Gibbs 
               into an adjoining office.

               INT. OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

               Gibbs closes the door behind the two agents. As Walters and 
               Johnson take their seats, Gibbs WITHDRAWS HIS WEAPON and...

               SHOOTS each of the agents in THE BACK OF THE HEAD.

               Silenced pistol. Blood all over the desk. Gibbs removes each 
               of the agent's weapons and slips them into his waistband. He 
               waits a few beats, takes a long sip of coffee, then exits 
               the office.

               INT. SECRET SERVICE CABIN - NIGHT

               As he passes through the cabin he takes a silent inventory. 
               Five other agents working, sleeping, on the phone.

               INT. PRESS CABIN - NIGHT

               Gibbs nods to Korshunov. Korshunov nods one of his men.  
               NEVSKY removes one of his videotapes, pops the front cover 
               exposing the tape. Across the face of the tape is a thin 
               strip of a rubbery substance. Nevsky pulls the strip up and 
               out, making a kind of fuse. He reaches for a pack of 
               matches... courtesy matches, sporting the Seal of the 
               President.

               Nevsky nods and lights the fuse.

               IN A RAPID SUCCESSION -

               GIBBS tosses his two extra weapons to Korshunov's men, pivots 
               the corner and begins firing at his colleagues. The SECRET 
               SERVICE AGENTS try to get at their weapons, but Gibbs has 
               caught them completely off-guard.

               Several silenced central nervous system shots (head and neck) 
               and the five agents slump back, their red blood cascading 
               down the creases of the fine Corinthian leather chairs.

               Nevsky tosses the cassette up the corridor... smoke pours 
               out of it. Smoke screen.

               BAZYLEV and ZEDECK catch the guns Gibbs tossed and hold them 
               on the reporters.

                                     BAZYLEV
                         UP! GET UP NOW!

               Bazylev grabs the stunned reporters, yanking them into the 
               aisle.

                                     BAZYLEV
                         Walk in front of us. Go! Go! Go!

               Human shields. A half dozen of them.

               Behind the terrorists, one of the bathroom doors swings open. 
               A SECRET SERVICE AGENT emerges. Sees what's happening. Reaches 
               for his gun. ZEDECK fells him with a well placed unsilenced 
               GUN SHOT. SCREAMS ensue...

               INT. FORWARD CABIN - NIGHT

               A sleeping SECRET SERVICE AGENT bolts upright. HEARS MORE 
               SHOTS.

               He springs up and moves toward the gunshots, his weapon drawn.

                                     SECRET SERVICE AGENT
                         SHOTS FIRED! SECURE BOY SCOUT!
                              (screaming out and 
                              into his lapel mike)
                         SHOTS FIRED! SHOTS FIRED!

               INT. SECRET SERVICE CABIN - NIGHT                           

               Bazylev and Zedeck lay down a suppressing fire outside the 
               door.

                                     GIBBS
                         Come on! Quickly.

               Korshunov, Nevsky and VLAD follow Gibbs into the Secret 
               Service office. Gibbs opens a locker and pulls out a stash 
               of MP5 automatic assault rifles and bullet-proof vests.

               Korshunov raises his bushy eyebrows in delight.

                                     GIBBS
                         The Secret Service believes in being 
                         prepared for any eventuality.

               INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               The Secret Service agent fights his way through the smoke to 
               a wall panel. Punches a red buttoned intercom.

               INT. AIR FORCE ONE'S FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT

               A red light on the security panel lights up...

                                     SECRET SERVICE AGENT (V.0.)

               Hunched over a control terminal, the AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER 
               tracks Air Force One's radar image.

               The controller hits a red button on his console. Sirens flare 
               up and klaxons wail across the base.

               The controller looks down to his runways. In the light of 
               the moon he sees a half-dozen men rushing toward F-15 Eagles.

               Pandemonium. GUNFIRE pops in the b.g. Air Force Specialists 
               try to get the word out.

               INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

               The conference room door bursts open and TWO SECRET SERVICE 
               AGENTS, weapons drawn, enter the room and run to Marshall.

               The once quiet room floods with light. The sounds of a 
               gunfight and a blanket of smoke sweeps into the cabin.

                                     MARSHALL
                         What's going on?

                         We're handling it, sir.

               The agents lift Marshall to his feet, and practically carry 
               him from the room, leaving the other high ranking officials 
               to scramble for themselves in a cacophony of shouts.

               Perkins, carrying the nuclear football, ducks and weaves his 
               way down the corridor into the fray. He takes a bullet to 
               the shoulder, which fells him.

               NEAR THE FORWARD GALLEY -

               Alice is nearly trampled by agents responding to the gunfire.

               One agent grabs her and shoves her into a bathroom.

                                     SECRET SERVICE AGENT
                         Don't open the door!

               GUNFIRE pops all around her.

               INT. CORRIDOR, REAR CABINS - NIGHT

               Smoke, automatic weapons fire. Secret service agents battling 
               the terrorists. Aides, diplomats, crew and personnel caught 
               in the crossfire.

               clouds.

               INT. PRESIDENTIAL STATEROOM - NIGHT

               The sounds of gunfire have reached the the nose of the plane.

               Rose peers out to see what's the matter. An armed Secret 
               Service agent runs toward her.

                                     SECRET SERVICE AGENT
                         Get back! Get back!

               A spray of bullets mows him down. He collapses in the door 
               frame. Terrified, Rose tries to close the door, but the dead 
               agent is in the way.

               INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               Filled with smoke and gunfire. The agents rush the President 
               behind a forward bulkhead.

                                     SECRET SERVICE AGENT

               Marshall looks up the hallway toward his stateroom.

               DOWN THE CORRIDOR -                                       

               Gibbs fires.

               HITS - One of the Secret Service agents in the shoulder. 
               Blood blossoms through his clothes but he winces it off.

                                     SECRET SERVICE AGENT
                         Come on, sir.

               The Secret Service agents whisk the President to the front 
               stairwell. They pull up a floor panel, revealing stairs 
               descending toward the baggage deck.

               INT. BATHROOM -

               Alice, huddled atop the commode.

               Alice opens the door and rushes...

               INTO THE CORRIDOR...

               Tripping and falling over Joey, the steward. His dead eyes 
               swim in a pool of blood that was his face. Alice screams, 
               scrambling to her feet.

               MID-PLANE CORRIDOR -

               Perkins manages to push himself to his feet and stumbles 
               down the hall into the computer room. Terrorist SERGE spots 
               the nuclear football dangling from his wrist. He pursues.

               INT. COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT

               Hysterical SECRETARIES feverishly dump classified documents 
               into a shredder, while Perkins struggles to open the black 
               leather briefcase handcuffed to his wrist.

               Bullets tear up the doorknob lock arid SERGE kicks in the 
               door.

                                     SERGE
                         Down! Everyone down!

               The Fawn Halls hit the floor as gunfire sprays overhead. But 
               Perkins swings around brandishing his sidearm. He opens fire 
               on Serge, but the bullets smack harmlessly against the SWAT 
               vest.

               Serge returns fire, ripping up Perkins who collapses over 
               the shredder, and with his last bit of strength, he dumps 
               out the briefcase.

               Papers containing NUCLE WAR STRATEGIES and MISSILE LAUNCH 
               CODES slide into the hungry Shredding machine. Perkins manages 
               a slight smile before he keels over dead, his duty fulfilled. 
               The shredded remains of the nuclear football rain over his 
               head like tickertape at a hero's parade.

               EXT. SKY - NIGHT

               The pale moon catches shiny streaks of metal that descend 
               through the broken clouds. The Squadron of F-15 Eagles drops 
               into formation around Air Force One.

               INT. FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT

               Gun shots right Outside the cockpit door.

                         Air Force One, this is Squadron

               Encased in a helmet, mask, and visor, Carlton watches the

               INT. LOWER DECK OF AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT

               Beneath the main cabin, the Secret Service agents run the 
               President through the forward baggage compartment and the 
               lower galley: a large room with compartments, storage freezers 
               and food preperation tables.

               On the far side of the galley, the agents fling open a 
               hatchway and enter...

               A NARROW GANGWAY - running between the lower galley and the 
               rear baggage hold, flanked on either side by the landing 
               gear bays.

               They duck under wing supports until they come to a mesh 
               grating.

               The uninjured agent lifts the grating revealing an ESCAPE 
               POD.

                                     SECRET SERVICE AGENT
                         Get in!   

               Marshall freezes.

                                     SECRET SERVICE AGENT
                         Get in, sir.

               A second later gunfire rips Up the agent's face. The new 
               volley sends Marshall under the cover of a wing strut. The 
               second agent takes Position and returns fire. He quells the 
               incoming volley for a moment.

                                     MARSHALL
                         What about my family?

                                     SECRET SERVICE AGENT #
                         I have a family, too, sir. Now get 
                         in the fucking pod.

               The firing begins again. Marshall struggles with the decision.

                                     SECRET SERVICE AGENT #
                         Mr. President... MR. PRESIDENT! You 
                         have to do this! The pod, on three.
                         Ready?

               The agent shoves in a fresh clip...

                                     SECRET SERVICE AGENT
                         One.

                                     MARSHALL
                         But...

                                     SECRET SERVICE AGENT
                              (cutting him off)
                         Two... THREE. GO!

               The agent combat-rolls into the open and fires. He advances 
               down the gangway acting as a shield for the president, 
               shooting blindly.  Marshall watches as he's hit repeatedly, 
               but it gives him the time he needs to dive for the pod.

               REVERSE ANGLE - VLAD AND NEVSKY

               behind the bulkhead. When the agent drops, Nevsky and Viad 
               rush down the gangway. They arrive at the closed pod just as 
               it begins to slide on its rails. They let loose dozens of 
               rounds from their MP55, but the bullets just plink off.

               The pod-lock doors slide shut. The President is on his way 
               to safety.

               EXT. SKY - NIGHT

               Small bay doors open in the belly of Air Force One, and a

               Her voice comes closer, filled with choking fear and panic.  
               She rounds the corner and Nevsky catches her hair with a 
               vice-tight grip shoving his MP5 into the small of her back.

               Gunfire from ROSE, who holds the dead secret service agent's 
               weapon. She empties the clip at the doorway. Click, click.  
               No more bullets. Korshunov steps into the room, brandishing 
               his automatic, smiling. Rose backs against the wall and raises 
               her hands.

               EXT. WHITE HOUSE LAWN - DAY

               A Marine helicopte touches down on the greenway. Marines

               Zedeck steps over the three dead Communications Specialists, 
               on his way to the cockpit door. Tries the door. It's locked.  
               He pounds on it.

               Spotters find Air Force One's navigation lights visible in

               the cluster of F-lSs.

               Gibbs rolls out the C-4 like a kid making a snake in pottery 
               class. He presses it along the door seal.

               Axeirod gropes at the plane's controls, trying to retain the 
               wheel. Gibbs dispatches Axeirod with one shot. Zedek is a 
               little messier with Ingrahams. But both pilot and co-pilot 
               slump over their controls.

               EXT. RANSTEIN AIR FIELD - NIGHT

               The taxiing Boeing 747 suddenly veers to the right cutting 
               across runways. Emergency vehicles give chase.

               The plane bounces. Is airborne for a second. Touches down 
               again with a jolt.

               INT. CORRIDOR - AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT

               Terrorists lead hostages to the conference room. Everyone is

               A MASTER SERGEANT seizes the opportunity and grabs for 
               Bazylev's gun, but Bazylev shoots him almost point blank.

                         Throttle up. Throttle up!

               Zedek slams the throttle all the wa up. Spotlights and sirens 
               swirl outside the cockpit window.

               EXT. RMMSTEIN FIELD - NIGHT

               The Flying White House careens toward the barracks, then

               INT. FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT

               Gibbs pulls Axeirod's body out of the pilot's seat. Looks 
               out the cockpit window and sees...

                                     A C-141 STARLIFTER
                         in his path. A monstrous plane, every 
                         bit as big as Air Force One. Gibbs 
                         eases back on the wheel and the 747 
                         sluggishly responds, its nose creeping 
                         upward.

               Air Force One closes in on the Starlifter. She's struggling 
               off

               the ground like some injured bird. The straining metal defies 
               gravity.

               INT. FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT

               Gibbs senses that he's too close. He pulls way back on the 
               stick, risks stalling her out... but the bird responds.

               EXT. RAMSTEIN FIELD - NIGHT

               Air Force One barely clears the Starlifter, the edge of her 
               wing just missing the top of the C-141's tail.

               The sharpshooters, the emergency crews, the commandos from 
               Delta Force...  Nothing they can do but watch her rise out. 
               of sight.

                         To fly a 747 you need to know three 
                         things. How to take of f, how to 
                         land, and how to engage the autopilot.

                         The rest of the secret service?

                                     GIBBS
                         Dead.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         How many others killed?

                                     GIBBS
                         Nine.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Any of us?

               Gibbs touches his bulletproof vest.

                                     GIBBS
                         No damages.

                                     ROSE
                         Where's my daughter?

                                     GIBBS
                         She's alive, ma'am, for the time 
                         being.

               Rose allows herself a half-sob of relief.

                                     ROSE
                         And my husband?

                                     GIBBS
                         The secret service did their job, 
                         ma'am. The President is safely off 
                         the plane.
                              (to Korshunov)
                         But that still leaves us plenty to 
                         bargain with.

               Eyes filled with hatred... Rose SLAPS Gibbs face.

                                     ROSE
                         Mr. Gibbs. You, of all people...

               Gibbs doesn't react.

                                     GIBBS
                         Follow me, ma'am.

               INT. WHITE HOUSE SITUATION ROOM - DAY

               High-tech maps and communications systems line the walls, 
               surrounding an austere main conference table. Laptop computers 
               and secure telephones by every seat. Side tables. Tele-type 
               machines spitting out classified information.

               VICE PRESIDENT CHANDLER analyzes the projected course of Air 
               Force One on the tactical vid-map.

                                     V.P. CHANDLER
                         We should have the President secure 
                         within minutes. Do we know who these 
                         terrorists are or where they're going?

               GENERAL NORTHWOOD, head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff...

                                     GENERAL NORTHWOOD
                         General Greely says it looks like 
                         the Middle East.

                                     V.P. CHANDLER
                         Does your office have anything to 
                         add, Mr. Dean?

               National Security Advisor WALTER DEAN leans forward.

                                     DEAN
                         The garners believe that, given the 
                         scenario, there's an 86% chance that

               we'll be dealing with a hostage situation and not an 
               assassination attempt. Not much else until there's more data.

                                     V.P. CHANDLER
                         If we're dealing with an airborne 
                         hostage situation what's our 
                         procedure?

               The Under-Secretary of Defense, THOMAS LEE, punches up a 
               scenario on the lap-top.

                                     LEE
                         Our only policy assumes the plane is 
                         on the ground. Our hands are 
                         completely tied while they're in the 
                         air.

                                     V.P. CHANDLER
                         Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action 
                         until we confirm that the president 
                         is off the plane... Lee, go huddle 
                         with the D.O.D. I want an options 
                         paper on this in 20 minutes.

                                     LEE
                         Twenty minutes?

                                     V.P. CHANDLER
                         You heard me.
                              (points to an aide)
                         You. Congress and cabinet heads.

               The aide nods and picks up a telephone.

                                     AIR FORCE COLONEL
                         Madame Vice-President?

               Chandler turns toward the door. The Colonel enters the room, 
               holding a black briefcase identical to Perkins'.

                                     V.P. CHANDLER
                         Yes?

                                     AIR FORCE COLONEL
                         National Command Authority. All 
                         previous launch codes have been 
                         cancelled. You're carrying the ball 
                         now.

                                     V.P. CHANDLER
                         Thank you, Colonel. Have a seat.

               EXT. GERMAN FARMLAND - NIGHT

               A HUEY, flanked by a pair of APACHES, skims the surface of 
               wheat fields at maximum velocity.

               INT. HUEY COCKPIT - NIGHT

               The pilot checks his instruments. He's honing in on a signal.

               EXT. GERMAN FARKD - NIGHT

               The swirling spotlights of the Apaches finally illuminate 
               the Seal of the President atop the EMERGENCY DEPLOYMENT POD.

               The Huey drops in for a landing and a half dozen Army Rangers 
               in full combat gear deploy to the pod. They open it.

               But.........

               IT'S EMPTY.

               INT. BAGGAGE DECK GANGWAY - NIGHT

               Bruised and battered, some blood smeared across his tuxedo 
               shirt... PRESIDENT JAMES MARSHALL lowers himself from one of 
               the overhead wing struts.

               He emerges into the bowels of Air Force one.

               He stands quietly a moment, listening... for footsteps, for 
               gunfire. All quiet except for the whine of the jet engines.

               He tak9s a moment to think. Considers his situation. His 
               eyes find the dead agent who risked his life so he could 
               make it to the pod. He trots down the gangway toward the 
               lower galley.

               EXT. SKY - NIGHT

               Air Force One hovers atop billowy peaks. The smaller F-15s 
               cluster around her in a loose formation.

               FIGHTER PILOT #1 (0.5. RADIO)

               Sir, isn't there something we can do besides escort?

               COL. CARLTON (O.S. RADIO)

               Like what, son... shoot our own plane down?

                                     FIGHTER PILOT #1
                         No sir. I just wish...

                                     COL. CARLTON
                         Roger. We all wish... Now shut the 
                         fuck up and escort.

               INT. LOWER GALLEY - NIGHT

               Marshall looks around for a weapon... half-full coffee pot,

               stove, walk-in freezer, plates and silverware. Marshall picks 
               up a butcher knife.

               INT. CORRIDOR, AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT

               Nevsky and Bazylev guard the conference room door as Korshunov 
               and Vlad enter. Nevsky hands Korshunov a copy of the plane's 
               manifest.

                                     NEVSKY
                         Every weapon and every person is 
                         accounted for.

               Korshunov nods and enters the room.

               INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

               Korshunov surveys the hostages. Viad covers them at gunpoint.

               Rose holds Alice, comforting her.  shepherd, Doherty, Aides, 
               Advisors, Crew... Fifty of them huddle like sardines.

               The plane's doctor administers to the wounded.

               Korshunov stares down his captives.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Fear will keep you alive. Any one 
                         who is not afraid is bound to do 
                         something foolish, and bound to die.

                                     ROSE
                         What do you want with us?

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Cooperation. If you try to escape, 
                         you will be met with automatic gunfire 
                         and a barricade of your comrade's 
                         bodies will prevent you from exiting. 
                         Good day.

               Korshunov exits, with Viad backing out behind him. Leaving 
               the hostages alone. The sound of the door locking.

               A mournful beat. Everyone looks at each other and the dead 
               and wounded victims of this heinous act...

               Hushed conversation breaks out all over the room.

                                     DOHERTY
                         This can't be happening. You just 
                         don't pull this shit with the United 
                         States. You just don't.

                                     MAJOR CALDWELL
                         Keep your heads.

               Caldwell paces, looks around the room.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         Mrs. Marshall, are you okay?

                                     ROSE
                         We're alive.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         That's all that matters. Thank god 
                         the President got of f the plane.

                                     ROSE
                         Yes... thank God.
                              (to caldwell)
                         You there... Caidwell, right? What's 
                         on your mind?  caldwell takes a beat, 
                         then crosses to Rose and Shepherd.

                                     MAJOR CALDWELL
                              (hushed)
                         I don't want to get anybody here 
                         excited, but if we can get out of 
                         this room, I can get us to safety.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         We're thirty five thousand feet up.

                                     MAJOR CALDWELL
                         Yes, sir, that's a problem, but if 
                         we can somehow get to a lower 
                         altitude, the rear loading ramp on 
                         the baggage deck is equipped with 
                         parachutes in case of an engine 
                         failure. Now we can either wait for 
                         a political resolution, or try to 
                         resolve this thing ourselves.

                                     DOHERTY
                         You're goddamn right we can resolve 
                         this ourselves. We'll negotiate.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         You know the President's policy.

                                     DOHERTY
                         The President isn't here.

                                     ROSE
                         Right now we are an enormous liability 
                         to the United States. We can't just 
                         sit and do nothing.

               INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               The terrorists move toward the nose of the plane leaving 
               Nevsky to guard the conference room.

               INT. BAGGAGE HOLD - NIGHT

               President Marshall reaches the front stairway. Cautiously 
               climbs to the main cabin. As he reaches the top stairs, he 
               hears Russian conversation approaching. He ducks back into 
               the stairwell.

               He can't see them, but he can hear them.

               The terrorists pass within a few feet as they ascend to the 
               Mission Communications Center on the upper deck.

               Marshall waits a few beats, listens to the silence. Then re-
               mounts the stairs and almost runs into the back of...

                                     VIAD
                         Standing guard, facing the opposite 
                         direction.

               Marshall FREEZES... looks past Viad down the corridor where 
               Nevsky guards the main conference room floor.

               Unaware of Marshall, Viad reaches into his pocket and pulls 
               out a cigarette. Lights it. On the first puff he feels a 
               presence behind him.

               VLAD slowly turns around...

               Nothing there.

               He smiles at his jittery nerves, turns back round.

               REVERSE ANGLE -

               Over Vlad's shoulder...

               MARSHALL, flattened behind the edge of the galley divider. 
               He creeps away from Vlad toward the Presidential Suite...  
               stepping gingerly over dead secret service agents.

               INT. MISSION COMMUNICATIONS CENTER -

               *       Korshunov pulls a handkerchef from his breast pocket 
               and wipes the blood from a telephone headset.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Proceed.

               Gibbs works the communications board, dialing in a series of 
               numbers. Telephone ringing...

               INT. WHITE HOUSE SITUATION ROOM - DAY

               A map of Air Force One's flight trajectory is displayed on 
               the rear screen. Moscow to Berlin and back toward the Black 
               Sea.

               The assembled brass listens as Korshunov's voice slithers 
               off the speaker phone.

                                     KORSHUNOV (SPEAKER)
                         ...the Chief of Staff, the First 
                         Lady, and the First Daughter.  Our 
                         demands are simple. Arrange the 
                         release of Ivan Stravanvitch.  Once 
                         our leader is returned to Turkuenistan 
                         soil, Air Force One and it's occupants 
                         will be allowed safe passage to 
                         Switzerland. You have one hour before 
                         we start killing hostages.

               The phone clicks off. A silent beat in the room.

                                     V.P. CHANDLER
                         Find that voice for me, I want to 
                         know who we're dealing with. And get 
                         President Petrov on the phone.

               GENERAL CHARLES GREELY, head of the 87th Mechanized Air Wing, 
               the unit responsible for Air Force One, enters the room.

                                     GENERAL GREELY
                         Madame Vice-President, we just got 
                         word from Ramstein... The nod was 
                         UntiL Chandler stands.

                                     V.P. CHANDLER
                         Empty?

                                     GENERAL GREELY
                         The President... he must still be 
                         onboard.

                                     V.P. CHANDLER
                         Play back that call.

                                     TECHNICAL OFFICER
                         Yes, sir.

               The Tech Officer indexes back on his computer.

                                     KORSHUNOV (V.0. TAPE)
                         The plane is under our command, and 
                         those we did not kill we hold as 
                         hostages, including the Chief of 
                         Staff, the First Lady, and the First 
                         Daughter.

                                     V.P. CHANDLER
                         but not the President. Not the 
                         President.

               A silent beat.

                                     GENERAL NORTHWOOD
                         He's dead then. They must have killed 
                         him.

                                     DEAN
                         We don't know that.

                                     GENERAL NORTHWOOD
                         Holding the president hostage is not 
                         something that slips your mind when 
                         you're making demands.

                                     V.P. CHANDLER
                         And if he's dead? Do you really think 
                         they'd risk telling us?

                                     DEAN
                         There is a possibility we're 
                         overlooking.

               All eyes turn to Dean.

                                     DEAN
                         When I ran Specops in `Nam, I ordered 
                         the destruction of a V.C.  munitions 
                         dump. During insertion, the plane 
                         was shot down and the entire team 
                         was killed, or so we thought. Two 
                         days later the dump

               BLEW AND A WEEK AFTER THAT, THIS 19-

               year-old kid, the pilot... he walks out of the jungle in 
               pretty bad shape. He survived the crash and finished the 
               mission... alone.

                                     GENERAL NORTHWOOD
                         Walter, if you have a point, make 
                         it.

                                     DEAN
                         That kid's name was Jim Marshall.

               Most of the President's service record makes for dull reading 
               because most of what he did iarLZ ULirn.   History remembers 
               him for what he did aflar he got back to the states -- the 
               protests, the rallies -- But he was a soldier once, a damn 
               fine one.

                                     V.P. CHANDLER
                         So what are you saying?

                                     DEAN
                         Maybe he's alive on that plane and 
                         those bastards don't even know it.

                                     V.P. CHANDLER
                         Mr. Dean, may I remind you that the 
                         President is not 19 anymore.

               INT. PRESIDENT'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

               Marshall cautiously enters the room. Ready for action.

               The room is empty, but it's been trashed by the firefight.

               The sound of voices... coming from the Duke game which still 
               plays. Marshall hustles over to one of the secure phones.

               It's dead. He tries the regular phone. Dead. Hangs it up in 
               disgust.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Goddamnit.

               He steps on some glass. It's a broken frame holding a 
               PHOTOGRAPH of Alice and Rose. He picks up the photo and lays 
               it on a table.

               He thinks for a beat... glances around the room, searching...

               Then he crosses to the closet, opens it and begins rifling 
               through his wardrobe.

               INT. MAIN CONFERENCE ROOM.

               Caldwell stands on the conference table. The hostages have 
               removed one of the ceiling panels. Air supply ducts and 
               bundles of wiring run through the ten-inch space between the 
               ceiling and the shielding plates.

                                     MAJOR CALDWELL
                         This is a dead end.

               Rose looks around the room. Hopeless. Her eyes land on the 
               carpet...

               INT. CORRIDOR.

               Marshall opens the stateroom door and slowly slides into the 
               corridor.

               Vlad still faces the opposite direction.

               Marshall creeps down the hallway, when...

               Beep... Beep... Beep...

               Marshall's watch alarm goes off.

               Marshall dives for the nearest doorway. Vlad swings round to 
               see a figure slip into the senior staff cabin.

               Vlad, unsure of what he saw., cautiously heads toward the 
               staff cabin. As he nears, he bends over a dead Secret Service 
               agent and pulls up the lifeless wrist revealing abeening 
               watch. It wasn't Marshall's after all. No matter. Vlad 
               continues to the staff Cabin.

               INT. STAFF CABIN - NIGHT

               Marshall frantically searches for something he can use as a 
               weapon. In the room: some video monitors, leather chairs and 
               phones. stainless steel cabinets run the length of one of 
               the walls.

               Marshall throws the cabinet doors open, revealing...

               A fully stocked MEDICAL CENTER... fold-down operating

               table... high-intensity lights. Equipped to deal with any 
               medical emergency the president might encounter.

               But too late. Vlad kicks the door open.

                                     VLAD
                         Get on the floor, now!

               Marshall yanks down the operating table, and it smashes into 
               Vlad, knocking him down. Marshall lunges with his knife, but 
               Vlad OPENS FIRE. A HALF DOZEN ROUNDS pump into Marshall's 
               belly. He's thrown back against the wall, then slumps to the 
               floor.

               Vlad approaches the crumpled body. Leans down to examine his 
               victim. He cups his hand under the man's chin and lifts his 
               head. Recognizes him.

                                     VIAD
                              (wonderment)
                         The President.

               But Marshall's eyes flash open.

                                     MARSHALL
                         That's right, asshole.

               He springs, shoving the butcher knife under the flack jacket 
               and into Vlad's spleen. Vlad freezes, unsure of what just 
               happened.

               Marshall is on his feet. Never letting go of the twisting 
               knife, he grabs Vlad by the back of the head and slams his 
               face against the mirror above the surgical scrub sink. The 
               mirror shatters and streams of blood erupt cn the terrorist's 
               face. The blood drips down into the white porcelain sink, 
               swirling into the drain.

               Vlad elbows Marshall in the neck, stunning him momentarily.

               He wipes the blood from his face, spins and hits Marshall 
               with a devastating right cross. Marshall reels back against 
               the wall, and Vlad follows, shoving the MP5 into Marshall's 
               throat. Marshall grabs the gun near the trigger...

               *                               VLAD

               Don't move or I'll blow your head off.

                                     MARSHALL
                         I don't think so.

               Marshall presses the saftey button on the gun with his 
               forefinger, then knees Vlad in the balls. Viad pulls the 
               trigger repeatedly as he goes down, but nothing happens.

               Instead he comes up swinging his gun butt against Marshall's 
               face. Like a bat hitting a baseball, it knocks Marshall into 
               the medical closet. The gun goes flying, skittering

               UNDERNEATH A CABINET.

               Marshall pulls himself up the shelves trying to keep his 
               legs from buckling. Vlad grabs some I.V. tubing and wraps it 
               around Marshall's neck. Marshall struggles for breath, clawing 
               at the tube.

               HE SPOTS A DEFIBRILLATOR, REACHES AND SWITCHES IT ON. LOW-

               pitched hum and beeping.

               Marshall pulls his head forward, straining against the plastic 
               tubing. Then slams back into Vlad's head. Viad releases his 
               grip just for a moment...

               The beeping becomes a steady whine.

               ... but a moment is all Marshall needs as he grabs the def 
               ib's CARDIAC PADDLES, turns, and SLAMS them on either side 
               of Vlad's head.

               Vlad convulses from the shock for a full five seconds... his 
               eyeballs roll, his hair stands on end.  then he collapses to 
               the floor.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Clear.

               Marshall catches his breath for a moment. Pulls open his 
               shirt. Beneath it he wears a bulletproof Kevlar vest. He 
               lifts the vest and a half-dozen angry welts have blossomed 
               across his skin. The stuff may be bulletproof, but each of 
               Vlad's shots sting like a motherfucker.

               EXT. CORRIDOR.

               Nevsky walks down the corridor. Sees that Vlad is away from 
               his post.

                                     NEVSKY
                         Viad?

               *       INT. STAFF CABIN.

               Marshall opens the medical cabinets, rifling through them.

               Pulls out hypodermics, adrenalin, rubbing alcohol... arming

               himself.

                                     NEVSKY (O.S.)
                         Vlad? Vlad?

               EXT. CORRIDOR.

               Nevsky works his way up the corridor, peeking in rooms.

               As he enters the...

               INT. STAFF CABIN.

               he's blinded by the high intensity surgical lights.

               Marshall cracks a tank of anesthesia across Nevsky's heu 
               Nevsky goes down.

               Marshall rips Nevsky's MP5 off of him. Holds it to Nevsky's 
               throat.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Where are th*y? fly tamily, the 
                         crew.... where are they?

               Nevsky says nothing.

               The conference room, right? Right?

               Marshall jerks him to his feet.

                                     MARSHALL
                         o'11 unlocli the door for me or I'll 
                         kill you.

               INT. CORRIDOR -

               Marshall walks flevsky toward the mj vonteronve room3 As 
               they pass the stairs to the upper deck, Nevsky breaks away.

                                     NEVSKY
                         KORSKUNOV!

               Marshall fires. Killing him.

                                     SHIT1
                         INT. CORRIDOR.

               No time for remorse. Marshall tries the Main conference Room 
               door. Locked. He knows the others will be coming so he 
               flattens himself against the corridor wall. Trains his gun 
               on the stairs.

               Just as the terrorists descend, Marshall squeezes off a few 
               rounds. The terrorists edge back up the steps, returning 
               fire.

               Marshall checks his clip, not many bullets left. He fires 
               off a few more shots to buy some time then ducks round the 
               corner and pulls out the bottle of rubbing alcohol and some 
               gauze.

               The terrorists seize the moment of quiet, descending the 
               stairs to take position.

               Marshall lights the gauze fuse of his new made Molatov

               cocktail and throws it down the corridor. The bottle crashes 
               into a BALL OF FLAME. Catching Bazylev on fire. He yells, 
               drops and rolls. FIRE SUPPRESSING FOAM immediately sprays 
               down from overhead.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Go after him.

               Serge hops Bazylev's burning body and heads down the corridor, 
               looking for this new wildcard. Korshunov grabs a fire 
               extinguisher from the galley and attends to Bazylev.

               INT. CORRIDOR, TOWARD THE REAR OF AIR FORCE ONE.

               Marshall retreats behind a divider. Sees Serge coming. Fires 
               a few rounds, then retreats to the next divider. Working 
               toward the rear of the plane.

               Serge picks his way through the rear cabins, advancing 
               cautiously.

               INT. REAR GALLEY/BATHROOMS.

               Marshall's out of plane. Nowhere to hide in the galley.

               Marshall eyes the bathrooms, doors flapping.

               FOLLOWING SERGE...

               as he reaches the rear galley and bathrooms. Marshall is 
               nowhere to be seen. But the bathroom doors are all closed.

                                     SERGE
                         I know you're in there. Come on out.
                              (a few beats)
                         Okay. Have it your way.

               Time for a deadly version of the shell game. serge fires 
               several rounds into the first closed bathroom door. The 
               bullets slice easily through the thin doors. He kicks the 
               riddled door open. The stall is empty.

               Serge moves to the next one. Same procedure. It's empty.

               Moves to the last bathroom, confident he's got him. He wails 
               with his MP5, turning the hatch into swiss cheese. Waits a 
               beat, then...

               Kicks it in. It's empty too.

               Serge looks around. Where the hell is this guy?

                                     KORSHUNOV (O.S.)
                              (calling down)
                         Serge?

               Serge reluctantly returns to his group.

               INT. LOWER GALLEY, BAGGAGE LEVEL -

               Marshall tumbles out of the cramped galley dumbwaiter, 
               breathing heavy. He slumps against the bulkhead and slides

               down to the ground.

               He takes a moment to pull himself together, to clear his 
               head. He hefts the MP5, refamiliarizing himself with the 
               weight and texture of a gun. He checks the clip. Only a 
               handfull of rounds left. He slaps it back in and switches 
               from automatic fire to single-shot then pantomimes firing.

                                     MARSHALL
                         The NRA'll love this.

               Looking down the barrel of the gun, he notices bins loaded 
               with luggage.

                         I understand your dilemma, Vice 
                         President Chandler. But unless you 
                         can confirm that your President is 
                         indeed a hostage, I cannot release 
                         Stravanavitch. If Marshall is dead, 
                         no good will come of meeting this 
                         demand. We both know he would agree.

                         for a civilian. Do you see my point?

               INT. WHITE HOUSE SITUATION ROOM - DAY

               Each member of the crisis team is either on the phone or 
               huddled with staff. A secure fax machine spits out papers 
               which Lee slips into files.

               Lee interrupts Chandler on the phone.

                         Madame Vice president. We have an

                         options paper, waves off Lee, and 
                         reads it as she talks.

                         Yes. You've made yourself quite clear.

                         But I will deploy forces to a staging 
                         area near the Turkmenistan border. 
                         When you have more information, we 
                         can decide how to proceed.

                                     V.P. CHANDLER
                         By then I'll be President.

               Chandler hangs up the phone.

                         you brief General Northwood?

               Northwood pops out of his huddle.

               GENERAL NORTHWOOD

               I'M INCLINED TO TRY THIS PART -

               Anticipate their landing site and get strike teams in place.

                                     V.P. CHANDLER
                         Can we do that?

                                     GENERAL NORTHWOOD
                         We've got four hours before they 
                         make it into Turkienistan airspace.

               I've got a satellite passing overhead in twenty minutes. We 
               can narrow down the landing site choices based on runway 
               length and any unusual activity.  With luck we'll only have 
               to capture three or four sites.

                         I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll 
                         sacrifice pawns before kings. It may 
                         take them some time to kill their 
                         way up to senior staff.

                         Okay. Also, I want you to put our 
                         bases in Turkey on alert, and have 
                         the Kitty Hawk prepare a retaliatory 
                         air strike.

                         No... I got the new numbers from our 
                         gamers. They believe that there's 
                         only an eight percent chance that 
                         the President is still alive.

                                     V.P. CHANDLER
                         Eight percent is better than zero.

               Oh shit... what is that?

               Chandler refers to a monitor in the rear of the room.

               it began its mayday hail. But in a startling turn of events, 
               the seemingly out of control plane aborted its landing and 
               took off again. We haven't been able to confirm its status

               The fire is extinguished. Zedeck squats over Nevsky's body.

               Gibbs and Serge maintain a defensive position, guns ready.

               Bazylev emerges from the Senior staff Conference room. He 
               shakes his head "no". Korshunov nods and furrows his brow.

               Serge and Bazylev lock and load, head off in separate 
               directions.

                         and the girl up top where we can 
                         keep a closer eye on them.

               INT. MAIN CONFERENCE ROOM -

               The hostages have torn up a section of carpeting. Caidwell 
               and Shepherd examine the floor. Smooth sheets of steel riveted 
               together. Pointless.

                                     MAJOR CAL DWELL
                         We're not getting out that way.

               The door swings open and Gibbs and Korshunov enter. They 
               spots the ripped up carpeting.

                         daughter please come here.

               They don't move. Korshunov raises his gun, points it a 
               Shepherd's head.

                                     KORSHUNOV

                         know. If you want to negotiate, we're 
                         the ones to do it with.

               Korshunov SHOOTS Doherty through the head. Screams from some 
               of the hostages. Korshunov squeezes off a few shots to quiet 
               everyone.

                                     KORSHUNOV

               Rose turns to the other hostages.

                         No, thank you. The gunfire did that.

               Gibbs wraps Rose's hands behind her back with duct tape.

                         Your husband is a coward. He sends 
                         soldiers half-way around the world 
                         to steal a man from his home in the 
                         middle of the night.

               Alice sits up, attentive.

                         age.

                                     ALICE
                         Yeah, I study world events. Five 
                         thousand Turkienistan Muslims were 
                         slaughtered in Stravanvitch's 
                         cleansings... along with 15 American 
                         school kids. You know hQw I studied 
                         that. I went to their funerals with 
                         my dad. I met their parents.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Smart for your age, eh? Top of your 
                         class? Tell me, do you know what the 
                         word "propaganda" means?

                                     ALICE
                         Yeah. Do you know what the word 
                         "asshole" means.

                                     ROSE
                         Alice!

               Rose doesn't know whether to be pissed at Alice or proud of 
               her. Korshunov smiles, nods his head and lifts his gun.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Yes, I have heard that word.

               He aims his gun at Alice.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Yes, I am an asshole.

               A long beat, the Korshunov lovers the gun.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Your father is a reasonable man.

               Once he hears our simple demand, I'm sure he will acquiesce. 
               For your sake.

               Korshunov smiles. Gibbs grabs Alice's hands and pulls them 
               behind her back. Begins wrapping them with the tape.

               INT. MAIN CABING, REAR GALLEY.

               Serge searches through the galley cabinets, spots the galley 
               dumbwaiter. Now he knows where his quarry went.

               He angrily grabs a service cart and shoves it into the 
               dumbwaiter, disabling it.

               INT. GANGWAY -

               Bazylev hears the beeps of a phone dialing. He moves toward 
               the aft portal of the gangway.

               Marshall waits as the phone rings...

               INT. WHITE HOUSE, SWITCHBOARD ROOM - DAY

               A chipper woman in her mid-20s picks up the call.

                         Yeah, right.

                         Sir, the President does not call

                         You don't understand. This is an 
                         emergency. Let me talk to anyone.

               The switchboard operator thinks for a moment. Maybe she can 
               have some fun with this nutcase.

                                     SWITCHBOARD
                         Okay... if you're the President,

                                     MARSHALL
                         Look lady, I don't have time for

                         No. no. no. Wait. Wait.

               Bazylev appears behind Marshall. Raises his gun.

                                     MARSHALL
                         I should know this.

                         It's June.

               Gunfire in the background.

                                     SWITCHBOARD
                         Sir? Are you there? Sir? Sir?

               Her face says N. The Switchboard operator pulls out a call 
               sheet and finds a number.

               INT. REAR BAGGAGE HOLD -

               On the phone, lying open on a heap of clothing.

               Bazylev points the machine gun at Marshall's head.

                                     BAZ YLEV
                         Hands away from your weapon.

               Marshall doesn't move, his np5 hanging at his waist... his 
               hand inches from it.

                                     BAZYLEV
                         Come now. You don't want to die.

               Marshall... with no options... slowly moves his hands away 
               from the gun.

                                     BAZYLEV
                         On your knees...

                         Hello. Is anyone there?

               Bazylev motions Marshall to get on his knees. Marshall 
               complies.

                                     BAZYUV
                         What's that in your shirt? Open it.

               Marshall pulls his shirt aside revealing his Kevlar vest.

                                     BAZYLEV
                         Take it off. Now.

               Chandler on the phone. An aide waves, trying to get her 
               attention.

                         My intention is not to escalate the

                         The switchboard says that someone 
                         called in claiming to be the 
                         President, then she heard gunfire.

               Caller's gone, but the line's still active.

                         Hang on, Toni.

               The call comes in on speaker phone, distorted muffled voices 
               and the whine of an aircraft in the background.

                         What's going on in the background?

               Can we hear what's going on?

               Dean picks up a phone.

               INT. NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY,  LISTENING POST - DAY

               WILLIS, a grossly overweight man in his late forties 
               surrounded by a monolith of high-tech, starts working his

                         it. Ten seconds, Mr. Dean.

               Audio waveforms appear over Willis' console. He implements 
               digital filtering routines, cleaning up the sounds.

               INT. WHITE HOUSE SITUATION ROOM - DAY

               The group listens intently. The call modulates, distorts, 
               dissolves... then clarifies.

                                     BAZYLEV (V.0.)

                         And if you make any sudden moves, I 
                         will not hesitate to shoot.

                         Maybe they don't have him yet.

               Northwood stares up at the tactical board. Air Force One...  
               surrounded by the F-l5s.

                         And maybe we aren't so helpless.

               General Northwood picks up a secure phone and dials.

                         Everything we own is in that plane.

                         So a single missile launched from a 
                         distance should be a mere distraction.

                                     GENERAL GREELY
                         Theoretically.

                         But the effect could be jarring.

               Marshall on his knees, hands behind his head. Bazylev, his 
               automatic pressed against Marshall's forehead, disarms 
               Marshall before stepping away. He slings Marshall's MP5 over 
               his own neck. Studies Marshall a beat.

                                     BAZ YLEV
                         So you're the President. Somehow, I 
                         thought you'd be smaller.

               Marshall stares straight ahead tn silent defiance. Bazylev 
               kicks him in the gut. Marshall doubles over, wheezing.

                                     BAZYLEV
                         Not so powerful now, eh? No aides to 
                         advise you, no secret service to 
                         protect you, no armies to command.

               Bazylev grabs Marshall's hair and tugs his head back. He 
               holds Marshall with his eyes.

                                     BAZYLEV
                         You'll suffer for what you've done.

                         *                    So will you.

               Bazylev slams Marshall's face against his knee. Marshall 
               slumps forward.

                                     BAZYLEV
                         Up. Get up now!

               Marshall slowly rises to his feet. Bazylev swings wide around 
               him.

                                     BAZYLEV
                         You will walk ahead... slowly. Do

                         Do you know what's going to happen 
                         to you because of this? Do you know

               sears him pretty bad. He yells in pain, turning.

               Marshall springs, imbedding the hypodermic needle into 
               Bazylev's neck. A full dose of adrenalin. Bazylev pulls the 
               empty needle from his neck. Marshall steps back, waiting for 
               a reaction.

               A pregnant pause as they both wait to see what happens.

               Then Bazylev smiles and slowly turns toward Marshall.

               Marshall backs away as Bazylev levels his gun.

               He fires once, hitting Marshall in the arm. Marshall winces 
               off the pain.

               He backs Marshall against a wall and holds him in his sights.

               But he doesn't shoot. His breathing becomes faster and faster 
               as the adrenalin takes hold. Building... building... He 
               screams and clutches at his throat.

               His eyes spin back and then his heart explodes.

               Bazylev is caught frozen, suspended in a moment of disbelief.

               Death reflex. He fires off several rounds from the gun as he 
               collapses.

               Marshall waits a beat, half-expecting Bazylev to rise. He 
               slowly approaches the body and retrieves the KP5.

               MARSHAlj Whoever said that, shut up. Walter, are you there?

                                     DEAN
                         I'm here, Mr. President.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Where's the cavalry?

                                     DEAN
                         We can't do anything until that plane 
                         lands. And when it does land, sir, 
                         it's going to be in hostile *                      
                         territory. To be perfectly honest, 
                         we don't know what the hell to do.

               It's going to take a miracle to figure this one out.

               A long beat. We hold on Marshall's determined face.

                                     MARSHALL
                         I'll see what I can do.

               INT. GALLEY.

               Serge comes across Bazylev. Checks for any sign of life.

               Stone cold dead. He looks around and grips his gun a little 
               tighter as he backs out of the room.

               INT. MAIN CABIN.

               Serge closes the stair access panel to the baggage deck.

               Sealing Marshall off.

               INT. MISSION COMMUNICATIONS CENTER - NIGHT

               Serge comes trotting up the stairs and collects new clips.

                                     SERGE
                         Bazylev is dead.

               Korshunov swallows hard...

               AND THE 

                                     SERGE
                         Trapped On the baggage deck. Let me 
                         go finish him.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         No. He has the advantage down there.

               Bring me a hostage. A woman.

               INT. FORWARD BAGGAGE HOLD.

               Marshall sees that the stairway hatch has been sealed.

               INT. LOWER GALLEY - NIGHT

               Marshall hits the button for the dumbwaiter. The dumbwaiter 
               begins to descend then snags on the service cart. Its motor 
               grind to a halt. Marshall slumps dQwn. His hopes dashed.

               Nothing to do now but wait.

               INT. MAIN CONFERENCE ROOM.

               Serge looks over the crowd of hostages like a bouncer at a 
               hip dance club. His eyes fall on Maria Mitchell.

                                     SERGE
                         You. Come with me.

               INT. LOWER GALLEY.

               Marshall, seated on the floor. The cabinet next to him is 
               stacked with packs of complimentary cigarettes, all with the 
               seal of the President.

                                     MARSHALL
                         What the hell...

               He opens up a pack and puts the cigarette in his mouth. He 
               snags one of the Presidential lighters, tries to light it 
               several times but it only sparks. XC shakes it. It's out of 
               tial. He tosses it aside and reaches for a book of matches, 
               but he FREEZES in mid-reach. A thought occurs to him.

                                     MARSHALL
                              (murmuring)
                         Out of fuel.

               INT. FORWARD BAGAGE HOLD - NIGHT

               Marshall, lacking a screwdriver, levers open the hatch to 
               the Avionics compartment with the barrel of his gun.

               RUT. AVIONICS COMPARTMENT - NIGHT

               Marshall sees the stacks of panels, piping, Wiring, 
               electronics.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Come on, where are you...

               He searches up and down.

               INT. MISSION COMMUNICATIONS CENTER - NIGHT

               Serge leads Maria Mitchell up the stairway. Korshunov nods.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Ms. Mitchell. Hello again.

               Maria is scared, she says nothing. She looks over to the 
               First Lady and Alice.

                                     ROSE
                         Maria.

               Korshunov switches on the airplane's P.A.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         *                     Please tell me 
                         your name.

                              (frightened)
                         Maria... Maria Mitchell.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         And what is it you do, Ms. Mitchell.

               Maria Mitchell's voice echos over throughout Air Force One.

               INT. AVIONICS COMPARTMENT.

               Marshall halts his search to listen.

                                     MITCHELL (V.0.)
                         I'm responsible for Press Relations 
                         for the Flight Office.

                                     KORSHUNOV (V.0.)
                         How are your fellow hostages feeling, 
                         Ms. Mitchell?

                                     MITCHELL
                         Scared. We're scared.

               INT. MISSION COMMUNICATIONS CENTER - NIGHT

               Rose cradles Alice, both of them looking away, as Korshunov 
               raises his gun, pointing it at Mitchell.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         And why are you scared?

                                     MITCHEL*L
                         Because... because I don't want to 
                         die.

               INT. MAIN CONFERENCE ROOM.

               The hostages, listening.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         And what am I doing at this very 
                         moment.

               INT. AVIONICS COMPARTMENT - NIGHT

               Marshall listens, helpless to do anything.

                                     MITCHELL
                         You're pointing a gun at me.

               INT. MISSION COMMUNICATIONS CENTER -

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.

               Did you hear her? She said I'm pointing a gun at her.

               INT. AVIONICS COMPARTMENT -

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Now, to the secret service agent in 
                         the baggage deck. I'm giving you ten 
                         seconds to surrender, or this women 
                         will die.

               Marshall's eyes widen.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         One...

               Oh shit. Marshall tries to decide what to do.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Two...

               He climbs out of the avionics compartment and hurries to the 
               front baggage compartment.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Three...

               INT. MAIN CABIN.

               Zedeck and Serge wait by the stairway hatch.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Four...

               INT. MAIN CONFERENCE ROOM.

               Hostages wait, expectantly.

                         Five...

               INT. FRONT BAGGAGE HOLD.

               Marshall frozen near the bottom of the steps. To go up would 
               be to betray everything he believes in, and lose any chance 
               to save the others. But if he stays...

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Six...

               INT. MISSION COMMUNICATIONS CENTER.

               Tears stream down Maria Mitchell's face. She's trying so 
               hard to be brave in front of Rose and Alice.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Seven...

               INT. FRONT BAGGAGE HOLD.

               For Marshall, this is the hardest decision of his life. His 
               face a mask of anguish as he wrestles with his conscience.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Eight...

               He starts toward the stairs.

               INT. MISSION COMMUNICATIONS CENTER.

               Korshunov looking down the barrel of the gun.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Nine...

               INT. FRONT BAGGAGE HOLD.

               It takes every bit of training and will to stop Marshall 
               from going up those stairs. He knows what's going to happen. 
               He closes his eyes tight as if that will stop it from 
               happening.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Ten...

               A long silent beat. Then... BAAAAM!

                                     MARSHALL
                         NO!

               Marshall sinks to to his knees.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Aw, Jesus.

               INT. MAIN CONFERENCE ROOM.

               Hostages hold each other tight for comfort. A mournful silence 
               fills the room.

               INT. FRONT BAGGAGE HOLD.

               Marshall, silhouetted in the half light, craddles his head 
               head in his hands. The shaft of light disappears as the main 
               cabin hatch closes, sealing him off once again.

                                     KORSFL3NOV (V.0.)
                         I'll give you a few minutes to think 
                         about that one and then we'll try 
                         again. Perhaps soon I will choose 
                         somebody important.

                                     MARSHALL
                              (to himself)
                         She was important.

               INT. MISSION COMMUNICATIONS CENTER.

               zedeck and Serge drag the dead woman out of the compartment.

               Alice sobs quietly.

                                     ROSE
                         Do you have to be so brutal?

                         what is necessary.

               Several of the hostages raise their hands.

               INT. AFO'S MAINTENANCE HANGER/ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE - DAY

               The Chief Mechanic has Air Force One schematics open in front 
               of him. He and his staff are huddled around them.

                                     CHIEF MECHANIC
                         Do you see the maintenance panel?

                                     MARSHALL
                         Got it.

                                     CHIEF MECHANIC
                         Pop it open. There should be a red 
                         switch, toggle it up.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Okay, it's on. We've got some 
                         indicator lights here.

                                     CHIEF MECHANIC
                         Okay, you're aerated. To dump the 
                         fuel you have to close the circuit 
                         for the pump. There's no switch in 
                         Avionics so you'll have to cross the 
                         wires. There should be five wires, 
                         just to your left. Do you see them?

               INT. AVIONICS COMPARTMENT - NIGHT

               Marshall finds the wires: red, white, blue, green and yellow.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Got `en.

               Static blankets the conversation.

                                     CHIEF MECHANIC
                         Okay, hang on. Let me double check

               here, because if you get the wrong ones, you'll cut the engine 
               feeds and stall the plane.

                                     MARSHALL
                         I'll wait.

               The static worsens.

                                     CHIEF MECHANIC
                         First... cut... green wire.

               Marshall, Using a kitchen knife, slices the green wire. Heavy 
               static. The phone beeps... lOsing batteries.

                                     MARSHALL
                         It's cut.

                                     CHIEF MECHANIC
                         cross it...  The static overwhelms 
                         the voice, then cuts out.

                                     MARSHALR'
                         Hello? Hello? Goddamnit.

               Static comes roaring back and garbled voices...

               MARSHAlj Hello? Are YOU there?

               Dead. Marshall tries to activate it again.

               MARSHAIJi Hello? Hello?

               Nothing. He tosses the dead phone aside.

               Marshall stares. Cross the green wires with the... what?

               Red, white, blue... or the yellow. His choice is obvious. He 
               cuts the yellow wire and crosses it with the green, leaving 
               the red, white and blue standing.

               He waits. The engines continue to groan. He allows himself a 
               smile.

                                     MARSHALL
                         An emergency landing in friendly 
                         territory... there's your goddamn 
                         miracle.

               EXT. AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT

               Beneath the plane a trickle of gasoline appears and grows 
               into a strong steady stream.

               INT. FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT

               A red warning light flashes on the plane's panel.

                                     GIBBS
                         Goddamnit it. We're losing fuel.

               Korshunov crosses to the flight deck.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         How?

                                     GIBBS
                         Avionics compartment! It's the only 
                         place. You better get Zedeck down 
                         there fast Unless, of course, you'd 
                         rather be a martyr than a savior.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                              (to Zedeck)
                         Go! Take Serge.. and watch your backs.

               Zedeck nods and dashes out of the cabin.

               INT. MAIN CABIN.

               Zedeck pulls open the hatch cover to the forward front stairs. 
               Descends into the dimly lit underneath.

               Serge descends right behind Zedeck.

               INT. FORWARD BAGGAGE COMPARTMENT - NIGHT

               Zedeck, Spooked by the dark shadows, senses he's being 
               watched.

                                     ZEDECK
                         He's down here. I can feel it.

                                     SERGE
                         Shut up and do your job.

               Zedeck hastens toward the Avionics compartment, gun at the 
               ready. Serge sweeps the area behind.

               They hear a metallic clank echo and reverberate around him.

               They both check left... right... behind them...

               Nothing.

               It's creepy being a walking target.

               From behind a water storage tank, Marshall watches down the 
               barrel of his Mp5. With all the equipment in the way, it's 
               almost impossible to line up a clear shot.

               And they're both well armed. He looks toward the stairway 
               instead.

               Zedeck enters the Avionics compartment. Serge takes a 
               defensive position outside the door.

                                     ZEDECK (O.S.)
                         The valve is shut. This guy sure 
                         knew what he was doing.

               Serge hears a noise and opens tire.                                                         
               80.

                         You see him?

                                     SERGE
                         Erring on the side of caution.

               Zedeck opens a panel and rips out some wiring.

                                     ZEDECK
                         I'm going to deactivate the by-pass 
                         pump. It'll take a minute.

                         We've stopped dumping... but we've 
                         only got about twenty minutes of

                         make Syria or Iraq.

                         Over the Black Sea. I can probably 
                         get us to Turkey or Georgia.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         No! If we land this plane anywhere 
                         else, we will end up another Entebe.

                         you from your little wargames, but 
                         I've just added another demand to my 
                         very short list. I assure you it's

                         I'm sure we can strike some sort of 
                         arrangement. Land the plane and we'll 
                         trade you hostages for fuel.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         No. The plane lands when I say, or 
                         it will crash. The hostages are 
                         released when I say, or they will

                         will execute a member of the senior

                         or until a refueling plane arrives.

               Murmuring and hushed discussion floats over the airwaves.

               A long silence. Korshunov looks toward Alice.

                         It would be a pity to squander such 
                         a strong personality.

               Across from him, against the cabin divider, Marshall peers 
               down the sight of his gun.

               Serge freezes.

               Serge raises his hands. Marshall reaches over and pulls out 
               the clip to his MP5.

               Caldwell, Shepherd and a few other aides hear the key turn 
               in the lock. They quickly take position around the door. As 
               Marshall marches Serge in, they're both tackled and smothered 
               by the group. They wrest the guns away and shut the door

                         They took `em out. They're probably 
                         on the upper deck.

                         has a plan to get these hostages of 
                         f the plane.

                         I dumped most of the fuel. They'll 
                         land soon and Delta will take its 
                         shot.

                         A refueling plane is already on it's 
                         way so we won't be landing until we 
                         reach Turkmenistan. Your best course 
                         of action is to release me. I will 
                         be merciful.

               MAJOR CALDWELL                   84.

               Sir, maybe we can use this. Turn it to our advantage.

                         Mr. Caidwell, the ground's a few 
                         miles away. How do you propose getting 
                         us from here to there?

                         Of the three dozen airports in 
                         Turkmenistan, only five have 
                         sufficient runways for a 747. Of 
                         those five, only these three have 
                         shown any activity.

                         But this one here, see this. It's a 
                         satellite dish and it wasn't there 
                         two weeks ago. Basic communications 
                         uplink, which suggests extensive 
                         communicatins ability. I'd say this 
                         was the one.

                         out.

                         If we can get to a lower altitude, 
                         we can use parachutes, but at this 
                         altitude, we'll pass out from Oxygen 
                         deprivation.

                                     MARSHALL
                         We've already played our cards, Major. 
                         There's no turning back.

                         We can't jump from here or at this 
                         speed. But if we could get a message 
                         out - tell the refueling plane...

                                     MARSHALL
                         They've cut communication, and I 
                         spent a good bit of time looking for 
                         alternatives. My only solution ran 
                         out of batteries.

                         No good. I said they disabled the 
                         communications system.

                                     SECRETARY
                         No. I thought about this, Mr.

               President. Voice lines and faxes are on two completely 
               different systems of encryption. It'd be easy to overlook 
               the data systems.

               What do they have to lose?

                                     MARSHALL
                              (to Caldwell)
                         Get `em ready.
                              (to secretary)
                         You... come with me.

                                     MAJOR CALDWELL
                         Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two 
                         hundred knots... otherwise it's 
                         suicide.

               the conference room, and move to the stairway.

               Marshall and the secretary rush the opposite direction toward 
               the equipment room.

                         Someone should give you a raise.

                         Actually, sir, you could be that 
                         someone.

               They wait... will it work? A few beats, a few beats more. 
               The machine pulls the paper in and begins scanning.

               Zedeck reaches the emergency pressure door. Through the 
               porthole he sees the hostages getting away. He tries the 
               door hatch. Locked.

               Zedeck looks around. Crosses to the lower rear galley.

               He kicks open the panel on the stove. Rips out the propane 
               tank. He runs back and wedges the tank into the door lock.

               He backs off 50 feet, turns and opens fire on the tank.

               The tank explodes, blowing the door out.

               The pressure door blows open and an explosion of pressurized 
               air blasts through the platform.

               The remaining parachutists are blown out the rear. Chutes 
               deploying.

               Marshall and Serge are knocked down the ramp, tumbling toward 
               oblivion. Just as Marshall's about to slide off the corner 
               of the ramp he grabs its hydraulic strut.

               Plummeting death.

               His grip is all that separates his dangling body from a long 
               Serge tumbles by Marshall, limbs flailing, and with a scream 
               Woven from a thousand nightma5, he loses his grip and slides 
               off the ramp into the jetblack sky, falling endlessly.

               Shepherd and Caldwell manage to hang to safety webbing as 
               the

               wind whips around them. The two other air force crew members 
               Without chutes also manage to hang on.

               As the plane depressurizes, it BUCKS like a wild bronco.

               Marshall looks down into the sky. Below his dangling legs, 
               parachutes blossoij. He's straining... he can't hold on 
               forever.

               Sky like daylight.

               From this incredible firecloud, the burned out skeleton of

               pressurized air swooshes by him, taking with it everything 
               that isn't nailed down including some of the spare parachutes.

               Fire rains down from the heavens, the sky like one giant 
               napalm nightmare.

               The shock wave hits the plane, slamming it violently.

               Almost yanking the hyraulic arm from Marshall's grasp.

               The military aides without parachutes lose their footing and 
               tumble off the platform. SCREAMING as they fall into fire.

               Marshall's got a great view. Flames dance in his eyes as he 
               watches the refueling plane descend.

               The brightness subsides, and the sky grows dark again.

               The wave of pressurized air subsides leaving Zedeck, Marshall, 
               Shepherd and Caldwell on the ramp. Caldwell begins edging 
               toward Marshall.

                         Now since we've had very little luck 
                         getting Washington or Moscow to 
                         cooperate, I wondered if you would 
                         be so kind.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Over my dead body.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         No. But since I only have a few of 
                         your staff left to kill, perhaps I 
                         will start with your family instead... 
                         Gibbs.

               Gibbs grabs Alice and shoves her into a chair. She fights 
               him off, and he smacks her across the face and shoves his 
               gun into her neck.

               Marshall and Rose struggle against their bonds.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         The world is such a dangerous place 
                         and we can't always protect our 
                         children.

                                     ROSE
                         Please. You can kill me but leave my 
                         daughter alone.

               Korshunov runs his finger down Alice's cheek.

                                     MARSHALL
                         She isn't a part of this. This is 
                         between you and me.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Call up Petrov and order 
                         Stravanavitch' S release.

               Marshall looks to Alice, then Rose, then back to Alice.

                                     MARSHALL
                         This administration does not negotiate 
                         with terrorists.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Pity. Mr. Gibbs.

               Gibbs withdraws his pistol. Places it against Alice's temple.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Perhaps a President does not 
                         negotiate, but does a father?
                              (beat)
                         An interesting choice. Your daughter 
                         versus your world vision. The implicit 
                         trust of a family against your oath 
                         of office.

               Tears of fears are streaming down Alice's face. She looks 
               into her father's eyes.

                                     ALICE
                         Daddy...

                                     MARSHALL
                         Alice... I...

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         And once the trigger is pulled, she 
                         is gone forever. Then, I wonder, how 
                         do you live, knowing you could've 
                         saved her?

               Marshall struggles with his duty. His honor.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         And could you ever forget the look 
                         on her face as she ceases to exist... 
                         Late at night, when you think about 
                         her, will Stravanavitch really matter 
                         anymore?

               Marshall tries to look away, but Zedeck forces him to watch.

                                     ALICE
                         Daddy. Daddy, please...

                                     ROSE
                         Jim... for godsake!

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Look inside your heart. No one will 
                         think you weak. Five...

               Alice's face, trying to be brave.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Four...

                                     ROSE
                         Jim...

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Three...

               Rose looks away.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Two. .

               Alice looks at her father for the very last time. Then shuts 
               her eyes tight.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         One...

               Gibbs begins to squeeze the trigger.

                                     MARSHALL
                         NO!

               Korshunov smiles.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Stop.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         You'll do it?

                                     MARSHALL
                         Yes, I'll do it.
                              (broken)
                         Just leave my family alone.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Good. Good.

               Gibbs withdraws the gun from Alice's temple. Alice opens her 
               eyes and gasps for breath.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Bring him the phone...

               You are true to your nature, Mr.

               President.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Someday, you'll regret my nature.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         You don't like seeing people get 
                         hurt. Now in morality, that is a 
                         virtue. In politics, however, that 
                         is weakness.
                              (beat)

               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

               A sleepless Petrov paces back and forth, smoking a cigarette.

               The phone RINGS. He looks up expectantly as his aide answers.

                                     AIDE
                         Sir, the President of the United 
                         States wishes to speak with you.

               Petrov stops in mid-pace. Considers his cigarette for a moment 
               and then walks over to the phone.

                                     PETROV
                         Mr. President.

               INT. PRISON CELL - NIGHT

               A guard walks down the cold steel hallway. He rattles the 
               bar of a darkened cage, he pulls out a set of keys and unlocks 
               the door.

                                     GUARD
                         Stravanavitch.

               Stravanavitch awakes, and leans forward into the light. He 
               and the guard trade looks. After a beat, the guard turns and 
               retreats down the the hallway.

               Stravanavitch rises from his bunk and approaches the cell 
               door. He leans against it and it swings open.

               INT. M.C.C. - NIGHT

               Rose stares at Marshall. Her look is hard to read. Distant...  
               cold, perhaps.

                                     ROSE
                         Can my husband sit next to me?

               Korshunov considers the pair. Hands taped behind their back.

               They're harmless. Korshunov nods.

               Marshall rises and joins her on the pilot's rest bunk.

                                     ROSE
                         I don't know why you stayed.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Please... don't start with me.

               Rose moves closer to him, and speaks in a low voice.

                                     ROSE
                         There's something I need to tell 
                         you... and God knows if I'll ever 
                         get another chance.

               From behind, we see her push his taped hands away.

               He looks at her quizically.

                                     ROSE
                         No matter what happens, you have 
                         been and always will be my hero.

               He feels the wall behind him. A dull edge of metal twisted 
               slightly from the earlier cockpit door explosion.

               He understands.

                                     MARSHALL
                         And you have always been my guardian 
                         angel.

               She smiles back at him.

                                     ROSE
                         I will never regret my life with 
                         you.

               Behind Marshall's back, he begins to cut away at the duct 
               tape.

               INT. MOSCOW CENTRAL PRISON, HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Ivan Stravanavitch walks down the long prison hallway. Other 
               PRISONERS see him and begin banging on their bars in rhythm.

               As he parades down the corridor, the banging grows until it 
               becomes deafening. Stravanavitch smiles a cocky smile.

               One by one, guard doors swing open in front of him. In fact, 
               a few of the HACKS salute Stravanavitch as he passes.

               INT. MISSION COMMUNICATION CENTER - AIR FORCE ONE

               The communication board beeps and Zedeck picks up the line.

               He exchanges some words with the caller in Russian, then 
               hangs up the phone.

                                     SERGE
                         It's confirmed. Stravanavitch is on 
                         his way out. Our men are waiting 
                         outside.

               Korshunov smiles and puts his hand on Zedeck's shoulder.

                                     ROSE
                         You got what you wanted. You going 
                         to release us now?

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         You're very valuable. And our nation 
                         needs so many things.

               Marshall leans his head against the wall. Just as he expected.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Could I... Could I have some water?

               Korshunov nods, motions Zedeck to take care of it. Zedeck 
               reluctanty descends to the main cabin.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         The taste of defeat is bitter, no?

                                     MARSHALL
                         One thing I've learned as

               President... all defeats are temporary and all victories are 
               temporary. Today' 5 conquerers are tomorrow's vanquished.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         e                    Very poetic.

               Zedeck arrives with a glass of water.

                                     MARSHALL
                         And there's one thing I've learned 
                         from being a sports fan.

               Zedeck brings the cup of water to Marshall's lips. Marshall 
               tips his head back to receive it.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         And that is?

               Water spills over Marshall's face. He shakes it off.

                                     MARSHALL
                         It ain't over, til it's over.

               With blinding speed, Marshall leaps to his feet and swings 
               his arm around Zedeck's throat. He snaps Zedeck's neck with 
               quiet efficency.

               Gibbs fires at Marshall, but Marshall, using Zedeck as a 
               shield, grabs hold of the terrorist'sMP5 and lets loose...  
               mowing down the former Secret Service agent.

               The rest of Gibb's shots pelt against the cockpit controls 
               sending showers of sparks flying.

               Korshunov whips out his gun and lines up a clean shot at 
               Marshall's head.

                                     MAJOR CALDWELL
                         Mr. President.

               Korshunov fires at Marshall, but...

               Major Caidwell dives in front of the bullet spray taking the 
               rounds in his chest.

               Marshall turns his aim to Korshunov... but Korshunov grabs 
               Alice and presses his pistol to her head.

               Stand-off.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Don't be hasty.

               Marshall holds Korshunov in his sights. Slowly advancing.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         You love your daughter, Mr.

               President. And I love my country.

               It's a fair trade.

               Korshunov backs away to the steps. Marshall does not lower 
               his gun. Korshunov disappears down the staircase.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Shepherd.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         Sir...

               Shepherd stands. Marshall unwraps Shepherd's hands.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Call Petrov...
                              (to Rose)
                         I'll be back.

                                     ROSE
                         Both of you.

               Marshall slowly descends the steps to the main cabin. As 
               soon as Shepherd gets her hands loose, Rose rushes to 
               Caidwell's aid. Shepherd crosses to the communications panel 
               and picks up a headset. Begins dialing numbers

               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

               In his nightdress, Stoli Petrov nurses a vodka on ice. His

               PHONE RINGS.

                                     PETROV

               Petrov's eyes widen.

               EXT. MOSCOW PRISON EXERCISE YARD - NIGHT

               A wall of bars part and Stravanavitch walks through. Into 
               the main exercise yard.

               The main gate separates him from...

               A group of men wait in the street by a limousine.

               The main gate opens slowly.

               When the men sees Stravanavitch they come to attention and 
               salute him. Stravanavitch returns the salute. And then starts 
               his march toward his limousine...

               A SIREN WAILS. LIGHTS FLOOD THE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF THE 
               PRISON.

               The front gate begins to close. Worry crosses Stravanavitch's 
               face. His men rush toward him, take position by the gate.

               Stravanavitch breaks into a run toward his limousine.

                                     GUARD
                         Halt! Halt!

               Stravanvitch looks behind him. Guards rushing toward him 
               from the yard... the limousine fifty yards ahead of him... 
               closing fast...

               On the limo... the back door open and waiting.

               A shot rings out from the guard tower, followed by another, 
               and another. Like popcorn starting to pop. Stravanavitch's 
               men return fire. A minor war breaks out. Loyal guards battling 
               Stravanavitch sympathizers.

               Stravanavitch caught in the middle, hit by one bullet, then 
               another, then another. He makesit to the open rear door of 
               the limousine, but collapses dead.

               Everyone stops firing. Stravanavitch's men rush to his side..

               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Petrov slips under the covers as an aide knocks on his door.

                         It's about Stravanvaitch.

                                     PETROV
                         What about him?

                                     AIDE
                         He's dead, sir. Shot while trying to 
                         escape.

               A beat.

                         So be it. The world will sleep easier.

               Marshall ascends down from the upper deck. Spots Korshunov 
               by the front stairway. Korshunov pushes Alice down the stairs 
               to the underdeck.

               INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT

               Autopilot engaged. A shower of sparks erupts from one of the

               Unaware of the course drift, Shepherd and Rose lift Caldwell 
               onto a bunk.

               Caidwell smiles, settles peacefully back in the cot. He dies.

               Rose reaches up and shuts his eyes.

               INT. LOWER GALLEY - NIGHT

               Marshall makes his way through the dimness. Stepping 
               cautiously.

               A shot rings out and richochets off a piece of piping right 
               over Marshall's head.

               Undaunted Marshall advances.

                                     MARSHALL
                         It's over, Korshunov. You won. Now 
                         let her go.

               He listens, footsteps ahead of him.

               ON Korshunov - holding Alice by her hair, practically dragging 
               her over the mid-section wing cross-braces.

               As Marshall appears in the gangway he fires off another shot, 
               hitting a cooling vent. Steam fills the' gangway area, bathed 
               in red auxiliary lighting.

               Korshunov retreats toward the rear of the plane.

                                     MARSHALL (O.S.)

               Marshall checks behind the racks of stored goods and luggage.

               P.O.V. LOOKING DOWN A GUNSIGHT AS MARSHALL WALKS INTO THE

               open.

               A finger on the trigger.

                         Dad, look out.

               Korshunov fires and Marshall dives out of the way. He cones 
               up in defensive crouch ready to shoot, but all he can see is 
               Alice.

                                     MARSHALL
                         How you doing, sweetie?

                                     ALICE
                         Been better, Dad... You?

               Marshall smiles briefly. But Alice is yanked around the 
               corner. Marshall hears foatsteps. He junps to his feet and 
               cautiously follows.

               INT. WHITE HOUSE SITUATION ROOM - EVENING

               On the tactical display as a second group of fighters appear.

               The rest of the pilots chime in.

               INT. AIR FORCE ONE, LOWER AFT GALLEY - NIGHT

               Marshall swings into the cubicle... empty.

               He crosses to the cargo bay/parachute launch ramp hatchway.

               Looks through the porthole.

               Korshunov straps on one of the few remaining parachutes. He 
               tosses the rest of the spares out onto the platform.

               Marshall steps onto the platform. Korshunov fires off a round 
               forcing him behind the door for cover.

               Korshunov pulls Alice in front of him and yanks down the 
               ramp activation lever.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Stay where you are.

               The ramp lowers, and Alice gets her first look at the drop.

               Marshall watches the remaining parachutes slide off the ramp 
               and into the stormy sky.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         There goes your ride.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Let my daughter go or I'll take you 
                         out!

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         If you put down the gun, I promise 
                         not to drop her on the way down.

               Korshunov backs toward the edge of the ramp, pulling a 
               struggling and fighting Alice.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Let her go now! Or I will kill you.

               Korshunov is a foot away from the edge of the ramp... two 
               steps back, he and Alice will take the plunge.

               Marshall lines up his shot. Korshunov laughs as he presses 
               his pistol to Alice's ear.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         No you won't. You'll compromise...  
                         like always.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Hold on, Alice.

               Marshall fires, his bullet ripping apart a good deal of 
               Korshunov's face and snapping his body back.

               Korshunov tumbles off the platform, but his limbs are caught.  
               in Alice's. She's knocked to her belly and his dead weight 
               drags her off the edge of the platform.

                                     ALICE
                         NO!

               Marshall dives down the sloping platform, reaching out for 
               her...

               Alice tries to grip the platform with her hands, but she 
               can't hold on. Her hand slip off the metallic lip.

               But as she falls, she's caught by the wrist. Strong arms 
               pull her up. Her father's arms. He carries her back to the 
               safety of the plane. She's sobs uncontrollably.

                                     ALICE
                         Oh NY god... oh my god... oh my god...

                                     MARSHALL
                         It's okay, honey. I got you. I got 
                         you. You're okay.

               Shepherd and Rose appear. Marshall locks eyes with Rose...  
               smiles. Shepherd crosses to the parachute bins.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Gone. They're all gone.

               The plane shakes with the thunder of a supersonic boom.

                         The Americans say they are escorting

                         they are surrounding a 747.

                         Yes. They refused to alter course

                         What is that sound?

               Marshall makes his way to the cockpit.

               Through the cockpit window, a MiG accelerates out of the 
               darkness coming straight at us. At the last second it pulls 
               up slightly, riding over the top of the 747.

               Its sonic boom rocks the jumbo jet.

                                     MARSHALL
                         My god. I think that was a MiG.

                         A MiG? Where the hell are we?

               Marshall rushes back to one of the rear upper deck windows.

               He looks out at the F-l5s.

                                     MARSHALL

               The pilot pulls the trigger.

               EXT. SKY - NIGHT

               The missile detaches from the MiG and slides toward Carlton.

               Carlton breaks formation, leading the missile astray. His 
               plane tucks into a tight little roll. The missile misses 
               over Carlton's rolling wings.

                         Iraq? Shep, you're fired.

               Marshall looks at the plane's bearing. The instruments are 
               shot to hell.

                                     MARSHALL

               Looking forward from underneath an F-15, the MiG heads toward 
               Air Force One. The F-15 fires a sidewinder.

               On the MIG... as it fires its missile. The F-15's sidewinder 
               blows the MIG up, taking the missile with it.

               Air Force One is clear... for the time being.

                         shooting at you.

               Marshall finds the throttle, pushes it up all the way. He 
               feels the plane out, gently nudges it into a turn.

                         Bullshit. Do it.

               The two MiGs lock onto Air Force One. Each fires a missile 
               at the President's plane, before breaking in opposite 
               directions.

               The missiles follow the heat of the flares, plummeting

               The shock waves from a nearby MiG explosion shakes the plane.

               In the aftermath, Marshall takes a moment and pulls on the

               EXT. SKY - NIGHT

               On the two MiG's heading for Air Force One.

               An F-15 drops in behind them. The MiGs scissor and break in 
               OPPosite directions. The F-l5 can only follow one of them.

                         I'm tight on one, the other's loose.

               I need help down here.

               The other MiG comes up on the 747 and opens fire with his 
               CANNONS. The shells rip up the surface of the aircraft's 
               wing. The MiG swoops past Air Force One and jerks into a *         
               vertical.

               On the damaged wing - Fuel starts leaking out and the outer 
               jet engine catches fire.

               Marshall reaches over and toggles the shutoff switch.

               EXT. AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT

               The engine whirs to a halt and the rushing wind blows out 
               the fire. But now she's only got three engines.

               Through the cockpit window, an F-15 settles in front of Air

               Carlton breaks left, lines up a MiG and fires. He nails the 
               Iraqi aircraft.

                         don't know where that is.

               Buzzer sounds in Carlton's cockpit. He's been locked on.

               Carlton puts his plane into a triple canopy roll then slams 
               on his airbreaks. The MiS shoots by him and Carlton lets 
               loose with his CANNONS. The MiG pulls up and disengages.

                         Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to 
                         the right. Got it?

                         Stay cool.

               Canton's plane edges around to the right... and Marshall 
               follows. The 747 leans at an angle and continues the turn 
               until the F-15 is dead ahead. Another plane explodes ahead 
               of him at three o'clock.

                         We still got three MiGs running around

               dogfight. They listen to the radio traffic.

                         We're at full throttle.

               FIGHTER PILOT #1 (V.0.)

               Air Force One, MiGs four and five are on your tail.

               Break right.

               Marshall struggles with his stick turning the aircraft to 
               the right.

               EXT. SKY - NIGHT

               Of course its pointless. The Boeing is a fucking sloth 
               compared to these fighters.

               INT. AIR FORCE ONE COCKPIT - NIGHT

               The familiar buzz. Tactical computer. "RADAR LOCK"

               Alice notices the computer. At the upper right hand of the 
               screen, the computer displays Defensive Mode/Offensive Mode.

               Defensive Mode is highlighted.

                                     ALICE
                         Daddy, look. It says...

               Alice reaches out and touches the screen.

                         Not now, pumpkin.

               Alice's touch activates offensive mode.

               EXT. AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT

               Along the belly of the aircraft, two hatches pivot open, 
               revealing a series of missiles.

               SKY - AS THE F-15 JOCKEYS WITH THE `NO MIGS

                         Take the shot.

               The F-15 fires, but the Sidewinder screams past the turning 
               HiGs.

               INT. AIR FORCE ONE, COCKPIT - NIGHT

               The Flying White House launches two sparrow missiles. The 
               MiGs release flares, but the Sparrows don't flinch.

               Twin FIREBALLS erupt in the sky as the Mics evaporate.

               But from the fireball, a MISSILE emerges coming right at Air 
               Force One.

               Closing fast.

                                     FIGHTER PILOT #2

               EXT. SKY - NIGHT

               The missile has Air Force One dead to rights, crawling right 
               up its tail pipe.

               Just before its about to hit the plane...

                                     FIGHTER PILOT 11
                         YAAAAAAAAH!

               An F-15 swoops up from below. Like a Secret Service agent 
               during an assassination attempt...

               The F-15 takes the bullet in its mid-section. BOOM!

               The blast slams bits of the fighter plane against Air Force 
               One. Rocking it badly. Chunks of the plane rip away metal 
               sheeting on the 747's wings and tail section.

               A squadron of Navy F-14s drops into the theatre. The cavalry.

               NAVY SQUADRON LEADER (V.0.)

               You Air Force boys get that plane out of here. We'll take 
               care of those MiGs.

                                     COL. CARLTON
                         Roger that. Kick ass, Navy.

               NAVY SQUADRON LEADER (V.0.)

               That's affirmative.

               INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT

               Marshall works the controls of the 747. Tries to engage the 
               automatic pilot. The system is fried. Marshall wrestles with 
               the yoke.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Uh, we got a problem here.

                         Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take 
                         you all the way in.

                                     MARSHALL
                         No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's 
                         not responding.

                         Lemme take a look.

               EXT. SKY - NIGHT

               Canton pulls up and drops back over the plane. He looks down 
               at the Boeing's wing.

                                     COL. CARLTON
                         Aw, man. You're torn up pretty bad 
                         out here, sir. Do you have any 
                         elevater control.

               Sir, I got some bad news. Air Force One... there's no way 
               they can bring it down. Plane's damaged, it's unlandable.

               INT. AIR FORCE ONE, COCKPIT - NIGHT

               Marshall looks out the side cockpit window, sees Carlton's F-
               15 fly steady with his.

                                     COL. CARLTON
                         I'm sorry, sir.

               Carlton salutes Marshall. Marshall returns it.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Thanks for your help, Colonel.

                         They've got no chutes. They can't 
                         control the plane, their engines are 
                         failing and they're losing fuel.

                         That's game, set, and match. There's 
                         nothing to do, except call the Chief 
                         Justice.

                         To swear you in as President.

               Dead silence in the room.

               General Greely ambles over to the tactical map and just stares 
               at it. He loosens his tie and scratches his head.

                                     GENERAL GREELY
                         Where's your strike team, General?

                         We're now over the Black Sea, so 
                         even if they could get us chutes 
                         we'd drown or die of hypothermia

               planes are connected by a hundred yards of cable.

               FIVE ARMY RANGERS in snatch harnesses slide down the cable 
               bridge onto Air Force Onefr As they hit the open doorway, 
               they unclip and sail into the main cabin.

               INT. MAIN CABIN -

               Three Army Rangers harness themselves `to the survivors. One 
               to Alice, one to Rose and one to Shepherd. The other two 
               head for the cockpit.

               Alice and her Ranger are ready.

                                     ARMY RANGER
                         We're set.

                         Hold on tight. The first step's a 
                         bitch.

               Alice takes a deep breath, closes her eyes...

               The soldier clips on the cable, and shoves off the lip of 
               the doorway, SAILING DOWN THE WIRE.

               They plummet, Alice screaming. The line goes taut.

               The pair slide the hundred yards to the KC-lO. Rangers grab 
               them and bring them into the transport.

               INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - EVENING

               Shoppers listen to television sets, galvanized.

               Two Army Rangers approach the cockpit.

                         Mr. President!

               Army Ranger #2 slides into the co-pilot's seat.

                                     ARMY RANGER #2
                         I'll take it, sir. You get going.

               INT. MAIN CABIN - NIGHT

               Rose clips on to a Ranger's harness.

                         Ready!

               They clip on the wire, move to the lip, and rappel off the 
               side of the plane.

               INT. AFO UPPER DECK - NIGHT

               As the first Ranger leads Marshall through the M.C.C.

               WHEN A SHOT RINGS OUT...

               The soldier at the flight yoke slumps over dead.

               Marshall and the first Ranger swing around to see...

               A bloody but smiling Gibbs, lying on the deck, clutching an

               MP5.

               The Ranger draws his weapon...

               But Gibbs swings his rifle around. Pulls the trigger. BAM.

               BAM. BAM. Hitting the Ranger.

               The Ranger returns fire, shooting round after round at Gibbs 
               before pitching over, dead.

               Gibbs draws a bead on the President, smiles... but he doesn't 
               have any strength left to pull the trigger. He expires.

               And the plane begins to dive. Marshall runs for the cockpit.

               EXT. SKY - NIGHT

               Rose and her Ranger are pulled aboard the transport.

               HANG ON.   KC-LO PILOT (V.0.)

               EXT. SN - NIGHT

               The KC-lO transport dips lower and lower, trying to maintain 
               its position under the descending plane.

                         We've lost two of your men. There's 
                         no one to fly the plane.

                         He's on his way.

               With the KC-lO back in the Position, Shepherd and his Ranger 
               shove off the dying plane toward safety.

                                     KC-LO PILOT
                         Sir, we're going to pound pavement 
                         in less than three minutes.

               Marshall holds the yoke in one hand and unclips the snatch 
               harness from the dead ranger in the co-pilot's seat.

               The last red light on the engine control panel starts to 
               flash.

                                     MARSHALL
                         I'M LOSING NUMBER FOUR!

               Marshall, still fighting the yoke, stands. He takes a deep 
               breatn, drops the wheel and runs like a motherfucker for the 
               stairs.

               EXT. SICY,  AIR FORCE ONE.

               Drops into a banking twist.

               The cable line runs taut.

               The KC-lO tries to compensate.

               INT. MAIN CABIN -

               The taut straining cable snaps one corner of the metal clasp.

               The clasp starts to bend.

               IN SLOW MOTION -

               MARSHALL sprinting to the open door.

               The clasp twisting. The cable hook ready to slip of f it.

               Marshall clips on, and dives out of the door. He slides forty 
               feet down, when....

               The clasp gives. The cable line snaps away from the plane...  
               one end connected to the KC-l0, the other connected to...

               Nothing.

               EXT. SKY

               Marshall slides down the cable, gripping at it, trying to 
               break his fall.

               Air Force One plummets toward the water.

               Marshall sliding, right behind it, running out of cable.

               At the end of his rope, literally. Marshall's harness snags 
               on the end clasp. He hangs on for dear life.

               Moments later Air Force One impacts.

               A huge EXPLOSION, water and flames blows sky high into the

     past a couple of tough-looking soldier ants who stand at the

     tunnel that snakes this way and that, past a row of ants
     plodding along...

     ...and into the MAIN CHAMBER of the colony, a huge, teeming

     rushing here and there on their business.  We see -- a
     "traffic cop" directing foot traffic, waving his arms like
     crazy so both sides move at once -- a column of soldier ants
     marching along in formation -- a chain of ants letting down
     a matchbox elevator filled with workers.

                         Z (V.O.)
               ...which is kind of a problem, since
               I've always felt uncomfortably in
               crowds.

     INT. MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR'S OFFICE - DAY

     We join Z, a worker ant with issues.  He's lying on a couch,
     recounting his woes.

                         Z
               I feel...isolated.  Different.  I've
               got abandonment issues.  My father
               flew away when I was just a larva.
               My mother didn't have much time for
               me...when you have five million
               siblings, it's difficult to get
               attention.
                      (pause)
               I feel physically inadequate -- I've
               never been able to lift more than ten
               times my own weight.  Sometimes I
               think I'm just not cut out to be a
               worker.  But I don't have any other
               options.  I was assigned to trade
               school when I was just a grub.  The
               whole system just...makes me
               feel...insignificant.

                         MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
                      (enthusiastic)
               Terrific!  You should feel
               insignificant!

     For the first time, we see the ant MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR.
     He's a mixture of Tony Robbins and Ron Popiel (the
     hyperactive late-night TV huckster, and founder of "Ronco").

                         Z
               ...I should?

                         MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
                      (hopping around
                       enthusiastically)
               YES!!!  You know, people ask me,
               "Doctor, why are you always happy?"
               And I tell them it's mind over
               matter.  I don't mind that I don't
               matter!  Do you get it?  Do you get
               it?

     Z gives a fake smile.

                         MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
                      (incredibly "up")
               Z, we're part of the fastest growing
               species in the whole world!

     The counsellor rolls down a chart from the wall.  An arrow
     shows ant population going up, up, up.

                         MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
               Ask me why we're so successful.

                         Z
               Why are we so successful?

                         MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
               I'm glad you asked me that question!

     The motivational counsellor opens some blinds...and we see a
     vista of the ant-filled chamber below.

                         MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
               What do you see out there?

                         Z
               ...Ants...

                         MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
               Right!  Ants!  Millions of creatures,
               each with his assigned task, all
               pulling together!

     Down below, we see a group of ants carrying a boulder up an
     incline.  One worker ants slips, and the boulder rolls down,
     crushing his leg.  The other ants rush over -- it looks like
     they're going to help their fallen comrade, but instead, they
     climb right over him, and pick up the boulder, continuing
     with their task.

                         MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
               You see?  Being an ant is being able
               to say, "Hey -- I'm meaningless,
               you're meaningless."

                         Z
               But -- but I've always felt life was
               about finding meaning...and then
               sharing it with someone special,
               someone you love.

     The motivational counsellor puts his arm on Z's shoulder...he
     seems to understand...

                         MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
               Z...you need help.
                      (looking at a clock)
               Whoops!  We're gonna have to stop
               there.  Your minute is up!

     The counsellor ushers Z out of his seat and towards the door.

                         MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
               Now back to work!  We've made real
               progress!  Remember -- let's be
               best superorganism we can be!

     INT. EARLY MEGA-TUNNEL - DAY

     A gigantic tunnel, with the size and scale of the "Chunnel".
     A banner strung overhead reads: "The Mega-Tunnel -- Tunneling
     Our Way to a Bright Future!"  Along the walls hang 50's work-
     incentive style posters with messages like, "You asked for
     it, you got it -- more work!" and "TWO MEALS A WEEK IS
     ENOUGH!!!"  Line after line of ants is working on the tunnel,
     digging, passing clumps of dirt from ant to ant, everyone
     synchronized.

     CLOSE on a clump of DIRT being passed from hand to hand.
     PULL OUT TO REVEAL

     AZTECA, a feisty, cynical, female worker ant, who stands
     there, waiting to pass the dirt on.  Z is daydreaming behind
     her, with clumps of dirt starting to pile up in front of him.

                         AZTECA
               Hello?!  Earth to Z!  You better snap
               out of it, or there's gonna be a lot
               of pissed off ants!

     Z looks back, and sees the ants behind staring at him angrily.

                         Z
                      (snapping out of it)
               Sorry Azteca.  Here you go, fellas!
               Fresh dirt!  Alley oop!
                      (looking at the dirt)
               Shouldn't we be wearing gloves?  I
               mean this dirt is very...dirty.
               Doesn't anyone think of hygiene?
                      (Z's stomach growls)
               Boy am I hungry.  I'm so hungry I'm
               seeing double.  It looks like there's
               two million ants in here.  When's
               lunch?  Tomorrow, or the day after?

                         AZTECA
                      (sweetly)
               Z, old pal...
                      (shouts)
               SHUT UP!!!  It's bad enough there's
               a food shortage without you
               complaining about it every day.

                         Z
               The squeaky wheel gets the oil.

                         AZTECA
               No, Z.  The squeaky wheel gets thrown
               away, alright?  You're a good ant, Z,
               even though you are a pain in my rear-
               segment.  I don't wanna see
               anything happen to you.  So quit
               mouthing off, before you get in
               trouble.

     A WHISTLE BLOWS.

                         Z
               Thank goodness.  Breaktime.

     All the ants put down their tools.  A beat.  Then the WHISTLE
     BLOWS AGAIN.  All the ants pick up their tools again.

                         AZTECA
                      (resigned)
               Break's over.

                         Z
                      (getting back to work)
               This colony needs another tunnel like
               a hole in the ground.  Why are we
               even digging this thing?

                         AZTECA
               Who cares, Z.  All I know is, we
               gotta dig.  We're not the ones in
               charge.

     INT. TOWN CENTER - DAY

     The huge, spacious main chamber of the colony.  Looming over
     the scene is the royal palace, which seems to be
     inaccessible, perched on top of a hill-like pedestal.

     Around the base of the pedestal, a crew of workers loiters,
     seemingly aimlessly...can these be the only unemployed ants
     in the place?

                         GENERAL FORMICA
               STAIRS!

     The workers look up and GROAN.  Then they start forming a
     stairway with their own bodies, linking arms, stepping on
     each other's shoulders.  It's extremely unpleasant work.  One
     ant is a little tardy, and just manages to get in place
     before...

     GENERAL FORMICA, the Pattonesque military leader of the
     colony, STEPS ON HIS HEAD, using it as the first step as he
     ascends to the palace, his aide-de-camp Carpenter in tow.  As
     Formica mounts the "stairs"  we can hear the workers going,
     "OUCH!  OOF!  YIKES!" etc.

                         GENERAL FORMICA
               Cut the chit-chat down there!
                      (turning to Carpenter)
               We've spoiled these workers,
               Carpenter.  They've never had it so
               good, and listen to them -- always
               grumbling and complaining...

     Formica steps on the foot of one of the "stairway" ants, who
     muffles a yelp.

                         CARPENTER
               ...Yes, sir.

                         GENERAL FORMICA
               What have they got to complain about?
               Three square meals a day...

                         CARPENTER
               Actually, sir, we've cut them down to
               three roughly rectangular meals a
               week.

                         FORMICA
               Don't give me statistics, Carpenter.
               I know what I'm talking about.  DOORS!

     Formica and Carpenter have reached the top of the staircase.
     There, the two guard ants on either side of the massive
     throne room doors pull them open -- and one door hinge
     SQUEAKS.

                         FORMICA
                      (to guard ant, while
                       passing)
               Oil that, soldier.

     INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY

     The QUEEN is on her throne, her huge abdomen sprawled behind
     her.

                         QUEEN
               Ah!  General Formica.

     Formica salutes and marches to her, Carpenter behind him.

     Note:  Throughout this scene, the Queen is giving birth
     repeatedly.  Each birth is accompanied by a herald playing a
     short "Happy Birthday" fanfare on his trumpet.  Mid-wife ants
     bring each baby to the Queen for inspection, who COOS a few
     words.  The midwives put the babies on a moving bassinet-
     line, powered by ants on a treadmill.

                         QUEEN
               General, the severe food shortage
               that faces the colony...pains me.
               The thought of any of my children
               going hungry...
                      (she shudders; then,
                       to baby)
               Who's the cutest widdle worker?  You
               are!  Yes, you!  Don't forget to
               brush your teeth!
                      (to mid-wife)
               Ship 'er out.
                      (back to Formica)
               What steps are you taking to remedy
               the situation?

                         FORMICA
               We are launching a major offensive to
               expand our foraging territory...

                         QUEEN
               Yes, what else?

                         FORMICA
               Please don't worry, your majesty.
               Leave the worrying to me.  As you
               know, I'm not an ant of half-
               measures.  I don't pussyfoot around.
               This crisis is my number one
               priority, and I promise you it's
               being dealt with swiftly, and
               decisively.

     The Queen's attention is interrupted by another baby being
     put in her arms.

                         QUEEN
                      (to baby)
               No snacking between meals!  Off you
               go!
                      (to Formica)
               Now -- what were we saying?

                         FORMICA
                      (Oliver North-style)
               I do not recollect, your majesty.
               Will that be all?

                         QUEEN
               Yes, General Formica.  Carry on, my
               good man!  I don't know what we would
               do without you.

     Formica clicks his heels and bows his head.  Carpenter bows
     low.  Formica smartly about faces --

                         BALA (O.S.)
               General Formica!

     PRINCESS BALA hurries through a second doorway, carrying a
     swatch book.  Something about her sets her apart from the
     HANDMAIDEN ANTS with her.  Her tiara, probably.

     Formica tilts his head quizzically to Carpenter behind him.

                         CARPENTER
                      (sotto)
               Princess Bala, sir.  Your fiancee.

                         FORMICA
               Princess!  You look -- outstanding.
               Is there anything I can do for you?

                         BALA
               Well -- I thought -- since we're
               getting married...it might be nice if
               we...got to know one another.

     Formica looks confused.

                         QUEEN
               Bala has always been a hopeless
               romantic, General.

                         BALA
               It's just that -- well, I'm honored
               that you selected me, and everything,
               I just thought the marriage might go
               a little more smoothly if -- we had
               a conversation?

                         FORMICA
                      (uncomfortable)
               Conversation...yes...well...
                      (to Carpenter)
               Wasn't she briefed?

                         QUEEN
                      (holding up a baby)
               Look, General!  A darling baby
               soldier!
                      (emotionally, to baby)
               Don't try to be a hero!  Just make
               sure you come back in one piece!
                      (handing it off)
               Next!

                         FORMICA
                      (using the
                       interruption)
               I'll take your suggestion under
               advisement, Princess.  In the
               meanwhile --

     Formica turns to go.

                         BALA
               General -- we have to talk sometime!

                         FORMICA
               Very well.  Carpenter, is there a
               convenient time to talk vis-a-vis:
               relationship?

                         CARPENTER
               Actually, sir, we're ahead of
               schedule.  We have thirty-six seconds
               available right now.

                         FORMICA
               Outstanding.  Princess...?

     Bala's a little fazed...but grabs her chance.

                         BALA
               So, um...how was your day?  What did
               you do?

                         FORMICA
                      (scouring his mind)
               Well...
                      (that's it!)
               I declared war!

                         BALA
                      (sadly)
               Oh...and I was afraid we had nothing
               in common...

                         CARPENTER
                      (under his breath)
               Fourteen-fifty hours, sir.

                         FORMICA
               Duty calls!

     He strides across the floor.  Bala watches him go, her
     antennae drooping unhappily.

                         FORMICA
               No squeak.  Outstanding!

     We see through the now-open doors into the throne-room as
     Formica and Carpenter double-time out of the frame.

     The Queen sees that Bala is unhappy.

                         QUEEN
                      (sympathetically)
               I felt the same way before I got
               married.  Confused.  Scared.

                         BALA
                      (hopefully)
               You did?

                         QUEEN
               Yes -- but I did my duty and sorted
               out all those messy feelings.  The
               wonderful thing about ant life is
               that everything is arranged.  Even
               marriage.  You're lucky -- General
               Formica is a paragon of anthood.

                         BALA
                      (unconvinced)
               Yes...he's wonderful...

     The doors swing shut on them -- revealing the two guard ants
     who were CRUSHED in the wake of Formica's exit.

     INT. BALA'S QUARTERS - DAY

     Bala enters, followed by her handmaidens, who are in a state
     of giggling infatuation over Formica.  Bala is scowling as
     she leafs through a wedding catalogue.

                         HANDMAIDEN #1
                      (swooning over
                       General Formica)
               The General's body segments are
               so...symmetrical.

                         HANDMAIDEN #2
                      (giggling)
               I'd let him order me into battle
               anyday.

     Bala hurls the swatch book against the wall.

                         HANDMAIDEN #1
               Princess?  What's wrong?

                         BALA
               Wrong?  How could anything be wrong?
               I'm going to marry General Formica
               and be a queen and have millions of
               babies, just like my mom.
                      (concerned)
               Do I look fat to you?

                         HANDMAIDEN #2
                      (knowingly, to
                       Handmaiden #2)
               Pre-wedding jitters.

                         HANDMAIDEN #1
               You just need to blow off some steam.
               Let's go to the bar at the Royal Club!

                         BALA
               The Club's so stuffy.  I want to try
               someplace different.

                         HANDMAIDEN #2
               There isn't anyplace else --
                      (making a joke)
               Except the worker bar.

                         BALA
               The worker bar!  Yes!  That's where
               I want to go!

     The handmaidens look shocked.

                         HANDMAIDEN #1
               But -- we can't -- there'll be
               workers there.

     INT. ANT BAR - NIGHT

     A long bar filled with ants.  The bar itself seems to stretch
     for miles, and there are hundreds of ants trying to get a
     drink...unfortunately, there's only one bartender.  Z is at
     the bar with WEAVER, a burly ant soldier.

                         Z
               We declared war again?
                      (off Weaver's nod)
               Are you scared?

                         WEAVER
                      (shrugs)
               I'll be back.

     The BARTENDER, a grizzled veteran, slaps down what looks like
     a couple of large green beer mugs.  Actually, they're aphids,
     little green critters he fills up from a number of kegs
     hanging from the ceiling.  The kegs are specialized ants with
     hugely distended stomachs, which spray liquid into the aphids.

                         APHIDS
                      (as they're slapped
                       on bar)
               Ouch!  Ouch!

                         BARTENDER
               Two aphid beers.

                         Z
                      (as Bartender leaves)
               Did you see that?  How he gave you
               the beers, not me?  I'm telling you,
               he's got something against workers.

                         WEAVER
               I don't know what you're talking
               about, Z.

                         Z
               Come on -- everybody dumps on us
               workers.  You soldiers get all the
               glory.  Plus you get to go out into
               the world, meet interesting insects,
               and kill them.

                         WEAVER
               Yeah, but you get to spend all day
               with those fabulous worker babes.

     We can see that Weaver is eyeing a nearby table of "Worker
     Babes", including Z's friend Azteca.

                         Z
               Weaver, they're career girls.
               They're obsessed with digging.
                      (sighs)
               No, I'll probably never meet the girl
               for me.

                         WEAVER
               Who said there was a girl for you?
               I was talking about a girl for me.
                      (quaffing his aphid
                       beer)
               Don't you want your aphid beer?

                         Z
               I can't help it.  I have a thing
               about drinking from the anus of
               another creature.  Call me crazy.

                         WEAVER
               Z, we've known each other a long
               time, right?

                         Z
               Of course.  You were born two seconds
               after me.

                         WEAVER
               And all the time I've known you,
               you've been grumping and groaning.
               You should quit making waves.  Go
               with the flow.

                         Z
               Weaver, I'm an insect, not a liquid.

     Down the bar, there's a commotion.  A grizzled old SCOUT ant
     has had too much to drink.

                         DRUNK SCOUT
               Have you been to Insectopia?  Have
               you?  No, ya goddam larvas!  But I
               have...
                      (becoming emotional)
               ...Mosquitos n' caterpillars n'
               beetles -- all livin' in peace,
               stuffin their guts with food...No
               rules, no regulations...you can be
               your own ant there...
                      (howling drunkenly)
               It's Insectopia!  Insectopia!

                         Z
               Hey, Weaver, listen!

                         DRUNK SCOUT
               I was cut off from my unit -- found
               it by mistake --
                      (slurring)
               It changed my life!
                      (spraying another
                       soldier with saliva)
               You see -- ya follow the great yellow
               egg, and you come to the land of red
               and white --

                         SOLDIERS
               You've had enough for one night!
               Come on, Gramps, before you get in
               trouble.

     The soldiers pull him from the bar, carrying him out.

                         Z
                      (excited)
               Hey, did you hear what he said?!

                         WEAVER
               Poor guy's had one too many scouting
               missions.

     MUSIC STARTS UP.

     INT. ANT BAR ENTRANCE - NIGHT

     Princess Bala is peering in at the entrance to the ant bar,
     accompanied by her worried-looking handmaidens.

                         HANDMAIDEN #2
               We shouldn't be doing this -- it
               isn't proper!

                         BALA
               I'm the Princess, aren't I?

                         HANDMAIDEN #2
               Of course --

                         BALA
               And do Princesses do improper things?

                         HANDMAIDEN #2
               Of course not --

                         BALA
               Then if I go to the worker bar, it
               isn't improper.  Anyway, don't worry.
               No one will recognize us in our
               disguises.

     She adjusts her "disguise", a hardhat, tied down Jackie O.-
     style with an ant's version of a Chanel scarf.

                         BALA
               I'm just a common worker, cooling off
               after a rough day!

     Music starts.  An ant BARKER takes the mic at one end of the
     dance floor.

                         BARKER
                      (on loudspeaker)
               Okay, folks.  It's six-fifteen, and
               that means it's time to dance.

     Every ant gets up to dance.  Weaver turns to Z.

                         WEAVER
                      (draining his beer)
               Time to cut a rug, Z!

                         Z
               I'm not in the mood.
                      (disgusted)
               Even when they're off work, they
               follow orders.

                         WEAVER
               Well, you just sit here and be a
               party-pooper.

     Weaver joins the rest of the ants who are lining up for the
     dance.  The Barker calls out the steps in a bored monotone --
     all the ants already know the steps.  Everyone dances in
     perfect synch.

                         BARKER
                      (southern twang)
               And a left-right-quarterstep-back
               step-halfstep -- a left-right-
               quarterstep-backstep-halfstep --
               a left-right-quarterstep-backstep
               halfstep --

     AT THE ENTRANCE, Bala smiles mischievously at her handmaidens.

                         BALA
               I'm going to ask one of these
               mindless, primitive worker-types to
               dance with me!

                         HANDMAIDEN #1
               But General Formica would be furious!

                         BALA
                      (enjoying the idea)
               I know.

     The handmaidens are appalled.  Bala whirls away from them,
     sets her sights and searches the crowd -- zeroing in on --

     Z, who's watching the other ants dance.

                         Z
               What a bunch of losers.  Mindless
               zombies capitulating to an oppressive
               system --

                         BALA
               Wanna dance?

     Bala's standing right there.  Z is instantly smitten.

                         Z
               Me?!  Yes!!!  I mean --
                      (regaining suavosity)
               Just let me finish my beer.

     Not breaking eye contact with Bala, Z smiles suavely.
     Reaches suavely for a beer.  Suavely grabs the candle in a
     glass jar off the bar.  Suavely singes his face.

     He plays it off with a rakish little laugh.  A bit
     apprehensive, Bala heads onto the floor.  Z follows her.

                         Z
               So uh -- how come I haven't seen you
               around here before?

                         BALA
                      (covering up)
               I work in the palace, I don't get out
               much.

                         Z
               The palace, hunh?  I bet those royals
               really live it up.  Of course they're
               all a little, you know, from
               inbreeding --

                         BALA
                      (shocked)
               What?

     Z and Bala step onto the dance floor with the rest of the
     ants, but Z can't do any of the steps.

                         Z
               Now, let's see, I -- it's been a
               while since I -- I think you --

     Bala watches Z, trying to follow along.  It's the blind
     leading the blind, as Z tries in vain to follow the barker's
     rapid instructions.

                         Z
               Here, I'll lead.

     Z starts doing his own, individual dance.  With a suave
     expression on his face, he leads Bala in a helter-skelter
     mixture-of Tango, Charleston, and hand-jive.

                         BALA
               Are you sure this is a real dance?

                         Z
               Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of
               making it up --

                         BALA
                      (surprised)
               Really?

                         Z
               Why should everyone dance the same
               way?  It's as exciting as watching
               fungus grow.

                         BALA
               You're right!

                         Z
                      (surprised)
               You -- you think I'm right?

                         BALA
               Why can't I just do whatever I want
               to do?  Why can't I just go wild?!
               Yahoo!

     Bala starts to get into it, making up her own steps in reply
     to Z's, loosening up, having fun.  For a moment, the two of
     them are actually sexy together.  Then they get a little too
     wild -- and the other ants, who are still doing their
     intricate dance, start to collide with Bala and Z.  Z almost
     knocks over a big soldier ant.  We can only see the ant's
     back at the moment.

                         SOLDIER
               Hey!  Watch your step, worker.

     Z has turned around to see the soldier ant, MAJOR MANDIBLE,
     glaring at him.  Mandible is about twice Z's size.  He's got
     one eye missing, and half of his left antenna his been chewed
     off.

                         BALA
               You watch yours, soldier, or my
               worker friend will beat you up!

                         Z
                      (terrified)
               Oh, that's okay, I'll let him off
               this time.
                      (whispering to Bala)
               Are you crazy?  This guy's built like
               a pebble!
                      (ineptly trying to
                       placate the soldier)
               You know they do great prosthetic
               antennas nowadays --

                         BALA
               Aren't you gonna stand up for
               yourself?

     Z's caught between a rock and a hard place.  He doesn't want
     to get beaten up, but on the other hand, he doesn't want to
     lose face in front of Bala.  More soldiers have gathered
     around, looking hostile.

                         SOLDIER
               How come you don't dance like the
               rest of us?

     Z glances over at Bala.  Then, shaking with nervousness, he
     says defiantly...

                         Z
               Because -- because I'm an individual!

                         SOLDIER #2
               An individual?  Never heard of it.

                         MANDIBLE
               You look like a worker to me.

                         WEAVER
               Hey, lay off my little buddy!

     Z, meanwhile, looks far away, ecstatic, as if he's just
     realized something very important.  Unfortunately, just at
     this moment, A soldier pushes Weaver...Weaver pushes him
     back...somebody makes a dive for Z -- and before you know it,
     there's a regular bar brawl going on, with Weaver in the
     middle of it, cracking heads together, punching ants in the
     face, having a great time.  Just then, the Princess'
     handmaidens hurries over.

                         HANDMAIDEN #1
               Princess Bala!  Princess Bala!

     Z, who's scrabbling around on the floor, overhears.

                         Z
               Princess?  You're a Princess?

                         HANDMAIDEN #2
               The police are coming!

                         BALA
               Uh oh.
                      (to Z)
               Goodbye!  Gotta run!

                         Z
               Wait!  When can I see you again?

                         BALA
               Let me think.  Hmmnn...
                      (thinks)
               Never.  Bye!

     Bala rushes off with her handmaiden, just before a squad of
     whistle-blowing POLICE wade into the crowd.

                         Z
               Wait!  Princess!  Wait!

     But she's already gone, leaving Z holding her scarf.

                                              CUT TO:

     INT. DORMITORY - THE NEXT DAY

     Z is talking to Weaver, who's getting ready to go off to war.
     Nearby, columns of ant soldiers march by.

                         WEAVER
               Get real, Z!  She just dropped the
               scarf by accident!

                         Z
               Are you kidding?  There were sparks
               between us!  This scarf is a sign!

                         WEAVER
               It's a sign that you're crazy!  Do
               you know what the penalty for
               impersonating a soldier is?

                         Z
               What's gonna go wrong?!  I take your
               place for the royal inspection.  Bala
               comes strolling down the line, she
               sees me -- bingo!  Love is rekindled,
               and she takes me up to the palace for
               a little...
                      (wags his eyebrows
                       suggestively)
               tea and crumpets... and you take your
               place again, and go march around to
               your heart's content!

     Weaver looks unconvinced.

                         Z
               You have to help me.  Please, Weaver.
               Think of all the things I've done for
               you!

                         WEAVER
                      (thinks)
               I can't think of any.

                         Z
                      (pause)
               Well I'm gonna start doing things for
               you...

                         WEAVER
               Will you introduce me to some worker
               girls?

                         Z
               You bet!  They'll really go for a
               sensitive guy like you!

                         WEAVER
               Maybe I'll get lucky.
                      (Weaver thinks about
                       it)
               You know, Z, I wouldn't do this
               for anyone but you...

     Weaver hands Z has helmet.

                         WEAVER
               Wear this.

                         Z
                      (overjoyed)
               You're a real buddy.

                         WEAVER
                      (sourly)
               Yeah, I know.

                         Z
               What do I do?

                         WEAVER
               Don't tell anyone you're a worker.
               Follow that column over there.  And
               come right back after the inspection!

     Weaver points to a bunch of soldiers hurrying by in formation.

                         Z
                      (overjoyed)
               Thanks!  I owe you!

     Z skips off and joins the column, marching in time with the
     soldiers but too excited to keep from jazzing it up a little.

     INT. TOWN CENTER - NIGHT

     The ant army has gathered in a huge HALL in front of a
     reviewing stand.  We can hear the murmuring of thousands of
     soldiers -- but all we can see is a HUGE POSTER of an ant
     General pointing right at the camera.  The poster reads,
     "GENERAL FORMICA WANTS YOU -- to obey".

     Z turns to some of the soldiers near him.

                         Z
               Any of you guys know when the
               Princess will show up?  She's kind of
               a personal friend.

     The soldiers look at Z like he's nuts.

                         LOUD VOICE
               ATTEN-SHUN!

     MARTIAL MUSIC sounds, and we hear thousands of ant feet as
     they snap to attention.  Z imitates the soldiers awkwardly.

     GENERAL FORMICA struts to the middle 6f the screen, slapping
     his thigh with a swagger stick (the antenna of some
     unfortunate insect)

                         FORMICA
               First of all, let me make one thing
               clear.  Nobody ever won a battle by
               thinking for himself.  All this
               "thinking" stuff is a load of crap.
               If the almighty had wanted you boys
               to think, he wouldn't have given you
               huge mandibles and a brain so small
               you'd misplace it if it wasn't
               trapped inside your head.

     In the audience, Z starts laughing -- he thinks Formica's
     just made a joke.

                         Z
                      (slapping his thigh)
               "Trapped inside your head" -- that's
               a good one --

     Z notices nobody else is laughing.  He stops.

                         Z
               Geez -- tough room.

     From the stage, Formica is squinting at the audience, trying
     to make out who was laughing, but there are just too many
     ants.  He continues.

                         FORMICA
                      (striding back and
                       forth)
               We ants survive as a species because
               we do what we're told.  We survive
               because we work together, as one, we
               get the job done, we do whatever it
               takes to persevere!
                      (dramatic pause)
               Hell, we're not an army of
               ants...we're one giant ant, with
               giant fists, and giant jaws!

     The soldiers CHEER!  Z CHEERS along with the rest of them.

                         Z
                      (to the soldier ant
                       next to him)
               Lays it on a little thick, doesn't
               he?  If you ask me, he's one giant
               bore.

                         FORMICA
               Now I've heard a lot of scuttlebutt
               about a food shortage.  Well you boys
               are gonna be taken care of.  But in
               the meantime we're gonna eat the
               enemy for breakfast, we are gonna
               eat the enemy for lunch, and we are
               gonna eat the enemy for dinner!

                         Z
               Geez, and I forgot my toothbrush.

                         FORMICA
                      (reflective moment)
               Dammit, I'm proud to be an ant.
                      (he looks out at his
                       army)
               And I know each and every one of you
               boys will do your duty.  Dismissed.

     Z applauds and whistles as the other ants look at him in
     confusion.

                         Z
                      (clapping)
               Bravo!  Bring on the Princess!

                         COLONEL
               Stow the gab there, soldier!  Let's
               move 'em out!

     The soldiers turn to the right and start to march out past
     the reviewing stand.

     A COLONEL marches at the head of Z's column as Z looks around
     for the Princess.

                         COLONEL
               Eyes...left!

     Finally, as Z's part of the army marches past the end of the
     reviewing stand, he sees her, looking bored, standing next
     to the Queen, who is giving the royal wave.

                         Z
                      (waving)
               Princess!  Princess Bala!  Hey!  It's
               me!  Z!  I've got your scarf!

     ON THE REVIEWING STAND, Bala sees Z -- that is to say, she
     sees one of the thousands upon thousands of ants marching
     by...

                         BALA
                      (peering out)
               Who is that idiot?

                         QUEEN
               Darling, you must encourage the
               troops -- wave!

     Bala waves unenthusiastically, little more than flopping her
     hand back and forth on her wrist.

     Down below, Z takes this as a sign that Bala has seen him.

                         Z
                      (excited)
               Excuse me, guys -- That's my date.
               Well, it's been fun.  Have a great
               war!

     Z tries to squeeze his way back towards the royals, but he's
     surrounded by a solid wall of soldiers -- and they're
     carrying him along with them.

                         Z
               Hey!  Wait!

     Z loses sight of the Princess as he's carried away.
     BARBATUS, a hard-as-nails "grunt" soldier ant, taps Z on the
     shoulder.

                         BARBATUS
               You new, kid?

                         Z
               I just joined up.  But I'm quitting!
               I got a trial membership!

                         BARBATUS
               Trial membership?  Kid, when you join
               this ant's army, you're in for the
               full hitch.

     At that moment, Z is swept out of the cramped corridor
     they've been marching along, as the army emerges into the
     OPEN AIR outside of the colony.

     EXT. ANT MOUND - NIGHT

     It's a starry, moonlit night.  The shadows crowd around the
     panicked Z, who looks up at the sky as we see the army on the
     march...

                         Z
               Wait a minute, there's been a
               mistake!  I've got to get back to the
               colony!

     Z starts to fall out of line, but Barbatus, looking
     concerned, stops him.

                         BARBATUS
               Are you crazy, kid?  They shoot
               deserters!

     Z swallows hard.

                         BARBATUS
               You just stick by old Barbatus.
               He'll watch out for you.
                      (off Z's look)
               Whatsamatter, kid?  Leave a girl
               behind?

                         Z
               Yeah.  Well -- no.  She's kind of
               playing hard to get.  As a matter of
               fact, she's playing completely
               unattainable.
                      (nervously)
               So, what's on the schedule?  A brisk
               walk?  a foraging expedition?

                         BARBATUS
               No -- we're going to attack the
               termites!

                         Z
                      (alarmed)
               Attack?  But -- I hate attacking!
               It's so hostile!

     Around Z and Barbatus, the ants start up a marching song,
     which we intersperse with dialogue between Barbatus and Z to
     form a montage/time-cut as the ant army marches on to the
     termite capital.

                         ANT SOLDIERS
                      (to the tune of "When
                       Johnny Comes
                       Marching Home")
               We ants go marching one by
               one, hurrah, hurrah!  We slaughter
               termites just for fun, Hurrah!
               Hurrah!

                         Z
               So -- these termites, they're little,
               shy, retiring insects?

                         BARBATUS
                      (grim smile)
               No such luck.  Those dirty terms are
               five times bigger than us, and they
               shoot acid from their foreheads!

                         SOLDIER ANTS
               We ants go marching two by two,
               hurrah!  Hurrah!  We'll all be dead
               before we're through, hurrah!  Hurrah!

     Montage shots of an ant column marching diagonally across the
     screen, fading into another column marching diagonally
     downwards across the screen...

                         Z
               Well, what exactly does our platoon
               do?  Serve beverages?  Process
               paperwork?

                         BARBATUS
               Our platoon has the best assignment
               of all.  We're the first into battle!

                         ANT SOLDIERS
               We ants are marching three by three,
               hurrah!  Hurrah!  Dead ants is what
               we soon will be, hurrah!  Hurrah!

     ...montage shot of Z's column crossing a bridge composed of
     living ants -- all of whom look extremely uncomfortable as
     they're getting stepped on...

                         Z
               So we're going back for more armor,
               right?  I mean, these guys are from
               outer space, how are we supposed to
               beat them?!

                         BARBATUS
               Superior numbers, kid!

     EXT. TERRAIN NEAR TERMITE STUMP - NIGHT

     Z looks up to see...looming high above them...the TERMITE
     CITY, which is built in the stump of a dead tree.  From here
     it looks like a demonic Mount Fuji.  The COLONEL ANT shouts
     an order.

                         COLONEL
               ATTAAAAAAAAACK!!!

     The front line of ants starts rushing towards the termite
     colony...Z is swept along...

                         BARBATUS
               Over the TOOOOOOOOOOOOO-OP!!!

     Z is swept along and up the side of the stump as thousands of
     ants invade the colony through every possible entrance.
     Up...over the lip of the stump...and down inside, to the very
     middle of the termite colony...

     Into a disquietingly peaceful scene.   They're in the middle
     of the hollowed-out trunk, and ants keep pouring in -- but
     there's not a termite to be seen.  Barbatus looks around
     suspiciously.

                         BARBATUS
               It's too damn quiet.

     Then we hear a strange tapping noise.  Barbatus looks over,
     and sees that Z's teeth are chattering with fear.

                         BARBATUS
               Don't be scared, kid.  Barbatus's
               got yer back.

                         Z
                      (petrified)
               Maybe they went out for the evening.
               Let's leave them a message and head
               home.

                         COLONEL
                      (ignoring him)
               Light it up!

     A nearby soldier ant take a firefly out of his knapsack and
     pinches him.  The firefly, yelling "Yipe!  Yipe!  Yipe!",
     shoots into the air like a flare, lighting up the interior of
     the stump with eery, shifting luminescence.

     Then we notice, hollowed into the inside of the stump like
     innumerable pockmarks, termite holes staring out upon the
     stump...and, with an unearthly ROAR, we see the first of
     hundreds of termites emerging to pour into the center of the
     tree, right onto the ant army.

                         COLONEL
               They're here!!!

                         BARBATUS
                      (to Z)
               Keep your head down!

     Within moments, Z finds himself in the middle of a
     BLOODBATH.  The ants have broken into the colony, but are
     taking heavy losses from the gigantic, blind, acid-spewing
     termites.  The battle scene is as sprawling and chaotic as
     something out of Braveheart. In a few QUICK SHOTS from Z's
     perspective, we see:

     -- A squad of ants rushes towards a termite soldier, but are
     literally melted into smoking heaps of flesh by a jet of acid
     from its forehead...

     -- A termite warrior is overwhelmed by a crowd of ants and is
     pulled to pieces with hideous ripping sounds...

     -- Another termite warrior takes on an ant soldier one on one
     and slowly crushes his head in his huge jaws...

                         Z
                      (looking around)
               Guys!  Guys!  It isn't too late for
               all of us to just talk this over!

     Just then, a termite burst up from the ground and turns to
     face Z.  Z is dwarfed by this hulking, roaring, drooling
     monstrosity.

                         Z
               Wait!  Please!  Acid makes me come
               out in spots!  -- Could I just say I
               have always had the greatest respect
               for your species?  I mean, eating
               wood -- why didn't I think of that?
               I --

     The termite rears, getting ready to melt Z, when OOF! he's
     knocked backwards by...

                         Z
               BARBATUS!  You -- you saved my life!

                         BARBATUS
               Don't get all sappy about it!

     As Barbatus and some other soldiers kill the termite, the
     Colonel strides up to Z, puffing on a cigar.

                         COLONEL
               I love the smell of formic acid in
               the morning.

                         Z
               Look out!

     A stream of termite acid engulfs the colonel, instantly
     burning him to a cinder clutching a still-burning cigar; Z's
     paratroop buddies turn in terror to see a herd of termites
     rumbling towards them.  Z, terrified, dives into the hole
     that the huge termite made...

     INT. TERMITE TUNNEL - NIGHT

     ...and tumbles headlong into a corridor of the termite mound.
     The corridors here are primitive, caveman-like, pocked with
     jagged access holes.

     No sooner has Z landed in the tunnel than a termite comes
     burrowing out from one of the side walls, snapping at Z's
     head.  Z just avoids getting decapitated, and digs straight
     through the wall in order to escape...

     INT. TERMITE QUEEN'S CHAMBER - NIGHT

     ...straight into the hub of the entire termite complex -- the
     Queen's chamber.  This is nothing like the civilized court of
     the ant colony -- it's a huge, stinking, fetid dungeon whose
     walls are held up by one massive (to Z) column of piled
     stones.

     The termite queen, a repulsive, slimy, squirming, foot-long
     monster, is attended by a crew of diminutive, blind termite
     nurses.  The queen turns to look Z right in the eye.

                         Z
               Excuse me.  I seem to be lost, and I
               was wondering if you could give me --

     Before Z can say, "directions", the queen gives out a
     piercing, blood-curdling shriek.  The nurses start shrieking
     too.

                         Z
                      (backing away)
               I'll let myself out.

     But the queen's shriek has summoned a soldier termite -- the
     biggest one we've seen yet -- who is charging headlong at Z,
     jaws snapping open and shut like huge scissors.

                         Z
                      (backing away)
               Shoo! -- Torro!  Torro!

     At the last moment, Z jumps out of the way -- and the termite
     runs headfirst into the supporting column of the chamber.  As
     if on a spring release, the termite's jaws clamp shut -- and
     shatter the base of the column.  The walls of the room begin
     to rumble...

     The termite turns to eat Z...but is crushed by a stone
     falling from the ceiling, which gives a final shudder and
     collapses, raining earth and stones down on the queen.

     As the walls of the chamber crumble, melees of ants and
     termites pour into the room from the corridors around and
     above...they keep struggling until...

                         ANT OFFICER
                      (points at Z)
               He's killed their Queen!

                         Z
               Hey, I'm sorry, it was a mistake --

                         ANT OFFICER
               VICTORY!!!

     We can see that the termite warriors, deprived of their
     leader, are suddenly confused and directionless, easy prey
     for the ants.

                         Z
                      (facetious)
               This is terrific!   Let's exact
               crippling war reparations!  Let's set
               up a puppet government!

                         ANT OFFICER
               Let's slaughter them all!

     The ants set about killing the disoriented termites when...we
     hear another rumble coming from the outside...the ants look
     up confusedly...

     ...And a (from the ant's point of view) five-hundred foot
     long tongue bursts through the top of the chamber with a
     CRASH.  The ten or so ants standing directly below are
     smashed by the tongue, which squirts out a spray of saliva
     around the crater.  As quick as it appeared, the tongue
     retracts, with a hideous SLUUURPING sound.  We can now see
     the end of the snout of an ant-eater poking through a hole in
     the ceiling high above...

                         ANT OFFICER
               INCOMING!

     The tongue comes down again, smashing some more ants, whose
     bodies are slurped up by the tongue...the ants scatter, but
     to no avail, as the tongue comes smashing down again and
     again...

     Z heads into a side corridor as the tongue smashes down
     again, barely missing him!

     Z retreats along the corridor as the tongue searches for him,
     across the tunnel from intersecting access-tunnels, getting
     closer and closer to Z, dragging more and more screaming ants
     and struggling termites...

     ....Then the tongue disappears.  Silence.  Z wipes his brow...

     And we hear a thunderous SNIFFING noise as the anteater
     searches for more prey... and the tongue starts rumbling down
     the corridor right towards Z, the tip squirming as it
     ricochets along the walls!

     Z gets up and runs, the tongue lapping towards him,
     reminiscent of the stone sphere that nearly crushed Indiana
     Jones in Raiders of the Lost Ark!  The walls disintegrate
     under the pressure of the tongue, which gets closer to
     Z...closer...

     ...and just misses him as Z tumbles out of the stump and down
     to the ground...Z sits there, dazed, as we see the huge form
     of the anteater withdraw its tongue and, with a final
     contented burp, shuffle off into the distance.

     EXT. TERMITE STUMP - MORNING

     Z makes his way across the corpse-strewn battlefield, an
     expression of horror on his face.

                         BARBATUS (O.S.)
               Z!  Over here!

                         Z
                      (hopeful)
               Barbatus?

     Z looks down at his feet, where Barbatus's still-living,
     decapitated head is looking up at him.

                         Z
                      (shocked)
               Barbatus!

                         BARBATUS
               Be honest, kid -- am I hurt bad?

                         Z
               No, no, you're...lookin' good.
               You've got good color in your cheeks.

                         BARBATUS
               No -- I can see it in your eyes.  I'm
               a goner.  It's alright, Z.  In this
               ant's army, a soldier's life ain't
               worth a sack of fungus.
                      (he winces)
               I can't feel my legs...

                         Z
               Hang in there, buddy!  You can make
               it!  Just -- take deep breaths, I'll
               try and find your body -- it's gotta
               be around here somewhere!

                         BARBATUS
                      (gasping)
               I wonder...what...was it all...for...

                         Z
               Barbatus, hang on -- Barbatus!!

                         BARBATUS
               Don't make my mistake, kid...
               don't...be a grunt...your whole
               life...

     Barbatus dies, leaving Z heartbroken.

                                              CUT TO:

     INT. EARLY MEGA-TUNNEL - DAY

     Weaver is "passing" as a worker, working alongside much
     smaller worker ants.  He actually loves the work.  He's
     throwing up dirt like a bulldozer.  He's so enthusiastic, he
     scoops up a WHOLE ANT in his shovel and tosses him aside.
     Azteca, who's standing next to him in line, is shocked by,
     and a little attracted to, this turbo-worker.

                         AZTECA
               Hey, slow it down, big boy.  You're
               making the rest of us look bad...How
               come I haven't seen you around here
               before?

                         WEAVER
                      (covering)
               I'm new...I was born yesterday.

                         AZTECA
               Tell me about it.

                         WEAVER
               Nobody told me digging was so much
               fun!  You pick up the dirt, you move
               it, you pick it up again, you move it
               again -- lots of repetitions, you
               exercise the forceps, and the
               pincers --

                         AZTECA
                      (ogling him)
               Mmm, yes, I see what you mean...

     While Azteca is checking out the hunky new worker, work has
     effectively stopped...clods are piling up behind Weaver.  A
     Foreman comes striding down the line, furious.

                         FOREMAN
               What's the holdup here?!

     Weaver whips his shovel up to his shoulder and salutes, as if
     he's dealing with a superior officer.

                         WEAVER
               Sorry, sir -- I was just having a
               little chat with my friend --

                         FOREMAN
                      (yelling at Weaver)
               Who said you could have a chat?
               You're not a chatter, you're a
               digger!  So shut up and dig!

                         AZTECA
               Leave him alone!  He's new.

                         FOREMAN
               You  too?  Well just for that, you
               lose your day's rations!  Now get
               back to work!

     The Foreman heads down the line, shoving and berating the
     other workers as he goes along.

                         AZTECA
                      (surprised at herself)
               I don't know what came over me,
               talking back like that.  I must be
               going crazy...

                         WEAVER
               Sorry I got you in trouble.  But
               listen, you can share my rations.

                         AZTECA
                      (flirting)
               Are you asking me out to dinner?

                         WEAVER
                      (blushing)
               No -- I mean yes -- I mean -- if you
               don't have other plans.

                         AZTECA
               I'll make myself available...Listen,
               better watch out with the
               backtalk.  I don't know want you to
               end up like the guy who used to work
               next to me.  I'm afraid he got...
               downsized.

     EXT. ANT MOUND - DAY

     Some guard ants are looking out across the sandy main
     entrance to the hive.

                         GUARD ANT
               Look!  They're back!  The army's
               back!  Alert the colony!

     The other ant starts ringing a bell, rushing down into the
     colony.

                                              CUT TO:

     INT. TOWN CENTER - DAY

     A huge crowd is forming, eager to welcome the army back.  A
     band is striking up a triumphant victory song, confetti and
     streamers are being thrown, as General Formica strides in,
     followed by Carpenter.

                         EXCITED ANTS
               The army's returned!  Our brave boys
               are back! (etc.)

     Everyone waves little flags as the tuba player Oompah-oompah-
     oompahs...

     ...and Z walks into the hall, looking bedraggled and
     exhausted, his helmet hanging over his ears.

     The band slows to a halt.

     At the edge of the crowd, Azteca, sitting on Weaver's
     shoulders, can just about see over the crowd.

                         AZTECA
               It looks like only one soldier made
               it back!

     Weaver looks distraught.

                         WEAVER
                      (to himself)
               Poor Z -- I should never have let you
               go!

     Far down the hall, Z is describing the battle.

                         Z
               It was horrible...a massacre, a
               massacre upon a massacre.  First we
               massacred them, then they massacred
               us, then it was halftime.  I've never
               seen such violence, such
               bloodthirstiness, such bad
               manners...I'm the only one that made
               it!

     The atmosphere is somber.  This is a tough one to try and put
     a spin on...but that doesn't stop Formica from trying.

                         FORMICA
               ONE TO NOTHING!  WE WIN!

     The band strikes up again, and everyone cheers.

                         Z
               No -- you -- you don't understand!

                         FORMICA
               Damn, I'm proud of you, boy.  I wish
               I had a hundred ants of your caliber.
               The world would tremble.  Now, time
               for some R and R.  You're invited to
               the royal victory party!

                         Z
               Royal victory party?  Will...will
               Princess Bala be there?

                         FORMICA
               Of course.  The entire royal family
               will be there to honor you.

                         Z
                      (thinks)
               ONE TO NOTHING!

     Renewed CHEERS, as Z is lifted onto the shoulder of some of
     the soldiers who stayed behind.

                         AZTECA
               Wait a minute, that's no soldier --
               that's Z!

                         WEAVER
               Z?  Our Z?  The little guy made it!

     Z is following Formica away from the cheering crowd.

     EXT. ABOVE TOWN CENTER - DAY

     Z and Formica are going up the royal "stairway" together.

                         FORMICA
               Son, you're an ant after my own
               heart.  A warrior.  An ant that looks
               death right in the face and laughs.

                         Z
               Well, I generally just make
               belittling comments and snicker
               behind death's back.  So, tell me,
               fellow war-monger...do you think
               Princess Bala likes men in uniform?

                         FORMICA
               Well she better -- she's engaged to
               one.  Me!

                         Z
               Engaged?  As in you're getting
               married?

                         FORMICA
               Affirmative.

                         Z
               So...you two are in love?

                         FORMICA
               In love?
                      (shakes his head)
               I'm just a plain old soldier at
               heart.  I'll tell you what I love --
               the field -- blood -- death --
               orders...and the company of other
               warriors.

     Formica gives Z a manly slap on the back.  Z looks a little
     uncomfortable as we...

                                              CUT TO:

     INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY

     Z follows Formica and Carpenter into the throne room.  At the
     end of the hall, a society band is playing.  The room is full
     of courtier ants and officers.

     Waiters are gliding around holding trays of hors d'ouevres.

                         Z
               Wow, what a spread -- you know,
               there's a food shortage in the rest
               of the colony.

                         FORMICA
               Yes, and do you know why there's a
               food shortage?

                         Z
               ...Not enough food?

                         FORMICA
               Negatory.  Too many ants.  And while
               we soldiers go out there, and fight,
               and bleed, and die for the colony,
               the namby-pamby workers live it up
               back home.

     Feeling a little hot, Z wipes his brow.

                         Z
               Well I, I don't think "living it up"
               is the right term -- how about
               "working themselves to death"?

                         FORMICA
               I tell you son, sometimes, at night,
               I see myself in battle, fighting a
               horrible, faceless enemy, with the
               future of our whole species at stake.
               And always, the dream ends with each
               of us plunging his sword into the
               other's heart...

                         Z
                      (spooked)
               Oh, hey, that's great, I think I see
               an old war buddy over there, it's
               been fun chatting.  Good luck with
               the hallucinations.

     Z escapes from Formica, who gazes after him suspiciously.

     Z mingles in with the crowd, then he sees Princess Bala
     standing with a group of officers who are eating hors
     d'oeuvres.

                         OFFICER
                      (telling a joke)
               What do you call it when 10,000
               workers are killed in a tunnel cave-
               in?
                      (a beat)
               Who cares?  They're workers!

     The officers laugh, but Bala looks bored in this stuffy
     social scene.

                         Z
               But...don't you think the worker
               class is the very foundation of the
               colony --
                      (realizes he's
                       getting odd looks)
               I mean, uh, without them, who would
               we stand on?

     More laughter.

                         BALA
               You're the hero of the recent termite
               campaign, aren't you?

                         Z
               Well, if single-handedly vanquishing
               the enemy and slaughtering a whole
               nestful of termites makes someone a
               hero, yes I am.

     Z reaches for a tray of canapes that a waiter is carrying by,
     and KNOCKS the whole thing CLATTERING to the ground.

                         Z
                      (feigning nonchalance)
               And you are...?

                         BALA
               I'm Princess Bala.

                         Z
               Ah, yes.
                      (affected)
               Well, charmed, I'm sure.  So,
               Princess, have you ever danced with
               a hero?

                         BALA
               Yes.

                         Z
                      (deflated)
               Oh...oh well then, one more won't
               matter.

     She moves towards the dance floor.  Z spit-combs his
     antennae, struts after her -- until he trips on his sword.
     He tumbles, falls, but hops to his feet just as Bala turns
     toward him, turning it into a ballet plies.

                         Z
               Just warming up...

     She frowns...there's something familiar about this guy.  But
     then they start dancing.

     ACROSS THE ROOM: The Queen and General Formica watch the
     party.

                         QUEEN
               All these parties are so marvellously
               alike.

                         FORMICA
               They should be...
                      (suspicious)
               But there's something funny about
               that soldier.

     Formica strides over to where Z and Bala are dancing.

                         FORMICA
                      (glowering)
               May I cut in?

                         Z
                      (intimidated)
               Oh, of course --

                         BALA
                      (pulling Z back)
               No, General.  I'm dancing with the
               war hero.

                         Z
                      (trying to placate
                       Formica)
               Uh, sorry, General, I...I've always
               had this animal magnetism, it --

     Bala YANKS Z back onto the dance floor, dancing away from
     Formica.

                         BALA
               You dance...

                         Z
               Divinely?

                         BALA
               No weirdly...You remind me of
               someone...

     Formica catches Bala's eye.  She frowns at him, and decides
     to get a little shocking.

                         BALA
               He was swarthy...primitive...
               earthy...sensual.

     As she says these things, Z tries to act accordingly.

                         BALA
               He was a worker.  I danced with him
               at a worker's bar just the other day.
               I'm not shocking you, am I?

                         Z
                      (proudly)
               No...as a matter of fact...

                         BALA
                      (shocked)
               OH MY GOD, IT'S YOU!  YOU'RE A
               WORKER!!!  A filthy, stupid,
               disgusting WORKER!

     Everybody gasps.  The dancing stops cold.

                         Z
               Gee, uh, could you say it a little
               louder, I think there are some ants
               in the next colony who didn't hear
               you.

                         BALA
               I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!

                         Z
                      (offended)
               That's not what you said the other
               night --

                         BALA
                      (now she's panicked)
               Quiet -- sshhh!!

                         Z
                      (digging it in)
               -- At the worker bar!  You were
               pretty hot to trot then!

                         BALA
               SSHH!!!  SSHH!!!

     A livid Formica is stalking over towards them.

                         FORMICA
                      (furious)
               What's this?  A worker has been
               masquerading as a war hero?!

                         Z
               Well it wasn't a masquerade, really,
               it was more what I'd call a clever
               ruse --

                         FORMICA
               ARREST HIM!

                         Z
               Can't we all settle this like
               adults -- we're not larvae anymore --

     Angry officers begin to surround Z, who hides behind Bala in
     fear, using her as a shield.

                         QUEEN
               Oh my god!  He's taking her hostage!

                         Z
               No I'm not -- I mean -- nobody move!
               Or the Princess gets it!

     People shout and scream, as Z backs up with the
     Princess...into the kitchen.

     INT. KITCHEN - DAY

     Z backs up into the kitchen, still pulling Bala along with
     him.  Here, ant chefs are preparing food for the party,
     vomiting little florets onto a platter.  Formica and the
     soldiers follow them in.

                         Z
                      (to Formica)
               Stay back, you lunatic!  Do you think
               I don't know how to use this?

     Z realizes that he's pointing his finger at them.

                         Z
               Uh-oh.

     The officers rush for...and Z, with Bala in tow, falls
     backwards into an opening marked, "GARBAGE".

     EXT. ANT MOUND - DAY

     HOLD ON: the GARBAGE CHUTE EXIT.  Nothing happens for a
     moment.  Then --

     From a distance, we hear the faint sound of SCREAMING,
     dopplering closer --

     -- and then Z and Bala come flying out of the exit, right
     into the mud, cutting off the scream abruptly.

     Bala sits up, coated in mud.  Z is nowhere to be seen.
     Because she's on top of him.

                         PRINCESS
               This is thoroughly unacceptable!

                         Z
               You're telling me...

     She gets up and runs back towards the colony entrance, where
     soldiers are already issuing to get her...

                         BALA
               I'm coming!  I'm coming!

     But...just as Bala'a about to be rescued...what looks like a
     gigantic LASER BEAM sweeps along the rim of the colony,
     sizzling the ground as it moves along...and IGNITES the lead
     soldier into FLAMES!  Bala looks stunned.

     Z watches in horror as another soldier ant is FRIED, and we
     look up to see a GIGANTIC MAGNIFYING GLASS casting the
     beam...we can just about make out the huge, grotesque figure
     (a seven year old kid) holding it.

     Bala, who has no idea what's really going on, turns from the
     colony and runs the other way.

                         BALA
               I'm going!  I'm going'

     ...unfortunately, this draws the fire of the laser, which
     follows after her in what looks like a strafing run, SIZZLING
     in her footsteps.

     Z, who's running towards the princess, suddenly realizes that
     he's running towards certain doom...and joins Bala in legging
     it away from the colony; under a brown leaf, which bursts
     into flames...between the redwood-like stalks of some
     flowers...and finally into the relative safety of some
     grass...where they throw themselves on the ground, exhausted.

                                              CUT TO:

     EXT. WEED CLUMP - DAY

     Z and Bala dust themselves off.

                         BALA
               What was that thing?

                         Z
               How should I know?

                         BALA
               I order you to find out where we are!

                         Z
               Alright, alright, I'll try to get
               directions from one of the locals.

     Z tries to flag down some passing bees.

                         Z
               Excuse me, I --
                      (it passes him by;
                       he tries the next)
               Pardon me --
                      (same response)
               And they call them social insects.

                         BALA
               Climb up that tree and get a better
               view!

     Bala points to a thin blade of grass.  Gingerly, Z tests the
     grass and starts climbing up it...but his weight bends it, so
     that he's lowered back to the ground, face to upside-down
     face with Bala.

                         BALA
               I've been kidnapped by the village
               idiot.

                         Z
               Who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot
               who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who
               lets herself get kidnapped by the
               idiot?

                         BALA
               How dare you speak to me like that?
               I'm the Princess!

     Z squares up with her.

                         Z
               Theoretically, yes.  But is the
               monarchical hierarchy applicable
               without the underlying social
               structure to support it?

                         BALA
               Of course!  It defines society!  To
               deny the precept is to say that order
               is an arbitrary distinction applied
               by the society itself!

                         Z
               But can there be a society composed
               of just two ants?

                         BALA
               No!  There's no such thing as "just
               two ants."  You never see just two
               ants -- you see a million ants!

                         Z
               Look around, sweetheart.

     She looks around.  She doesn't like what she sees.  She
     glowers at Z.

                         BALA
               I -- hate -- you.

                         Z
               Well I guess that makes us even.

                         BALA
               Ha!  Don't make me laugh.  You're
               crazy about me!  That's why you lied
               and cheated to get near me!

                         Z
               Oh come on, you're the one who came
               after me -- the swarthy, earthy,
               sensual worker!

                         BALA
                      (repulsed)
               I was slumming it!  I danced with you
               because you were the most pathetic
               specimen in the place!

                         Z
               Is that the same standard you used to
               choose General Formica?

                         BALA
               I didn't choose him.  What kind  of
               idiot would...
                      (unconvincingly)
               ...choose who she wanted to marry?

     She shakes herself out of it.

                         BALA
               Now, worker, you shall take me back
               to the colony, and have your head cut
               off and stuck on a sharp pole!

                         Z
               Well, that's an appealing offer,
               but...considering the options...
                      (he decides)
               You go back.  Me, I'm going to
               Insectopia.

                         BALA
               Insectopia?  You stupid worker,
               that's just a fairy tale!

                         Z
               Yeah, well I have it on a reliable
               source...
                      (he knows that was
                       maybe stretching it)
               that it exists.  Now you follow
               the yellow egg...
                      (looking around)
               That direction.

                         BALA
               Worker!  Come back here now!

                         Z
               I've got a name.  It's Z.

                         BALA
               That's not a name!  That's just a
               letter!

     Z, meanwhile, hits the road.  Bala has no idea of where to
     go.  Just then, the scariness of the outside world comes
     through to her.

     We start hearing NOISES -- the equivalent of scary jungle
     sounds in a Tarzan movie -- the HISSING, CROAKING,
     CHIRRUPING... Bala sees eyes looking out at her from all
     directions...and spots a colossal monster (a sparrow) fixing
     her with his beady gaze.

                         BALA
                      (clears her throat)
               Worker?
                      (no response...louder
                       now)
               Oh WORKER?  Where are you?
                      (getting desperate)
               Z?  Z?  Wait for me!!!

     Bala heads off after Z.

     INT. MEGA-TUNNEL - DAY

     The mass of worker ants are swinging pick-axes in the tunnel.
     The foreman moves up the line, BERATING the workers, yelling
     at them to dig faster.

                         AZTECA
               I tell ya, I'm gettin' sick of bein'
               yelled at.

                         WORKER #1
               What do you want, we're just workers.

                         WEAVER
               You know, you're not just workers --
               you can be whatever you want to be!
               Look at Z!  He started as a worker --
               then he became a soldier!

                         AZTECA
               That's right!  He slaughtered
               hundreds of termites single-handedly!

                         WORKER #2
               I heard about this guy.
                      (turning to the other
                       workers)
               He crashed a party at the palace.
               Then he took a hike with one of the
               royal babes!  And when they tried to
               stop him, he just looked at a
               couple'a guards, and they burst into
               flames!

                         WORKER ANT #1
               You're nuts, how could a worker do
               all that?

                         WEAVER
               Well, because he's more than a
               worker...he's a...what did he call
               it, Azteca...

                         AZTECA
               Invisible!

                         WEAVER
               No -- an individual!

                         WORKER #2
               What's that?

                         WEAVER
               Well, it's...someone with his own
               point of view...someone who does what
               he wants, not whatever he's told to
               do!

                         AZTECA
                      (eyes lit up,
                       watching Weaver)
               Someone who follows his heart!

                         WEAVER
                      (taking Azteca's hand)
               Right...because every ant's important!

                         WORKER #2
                      (scoffs)
               But that would mean I'm important.

                         WORKER #1
               I'm outta here, this sounds like
               trouble to me.

     But more ants are gathering 'round.

                         WEAVER
               We can all be individuals!  Just like
               Z!

     Weaver and Azteca hold hands.  More ants are gathering
     around, dropping their tools...

     EXT. BIKE PATH - DAY

     LONG SHOT.  A glimmering desert landscape (think of "The
     Sun's Anvil" in Lawrence of Arabia).  Two small figures can
     be seen, tiny dots moving across the arid whiteness.

     They're Bala and Z, who are crossing a concrete path in the
     park, which they perceive to be a "desert".

                         BALA
               Water...water...

                         Z
               Water...water -- oh, you already said
               that.

                         BALA
                      (walking along)
               My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is
               cracking...I wish I'd never met you,
               you ruined my life.

                         Z
               I ruined your life?  Look, I was
               perfectly happy until I met you --
               alright, I was miserable, but I was
               happily miserable.

     Over Z's line, we can see a GIGANTIC WHEEL, getting larger
     and larger and heading right towards them, a GIGANTIC WHEEL
     (the front wheel of a bicycle which is heading right towards
     them).

                         BALA
               Look out!

     Bala pushes Z out of the way just as the wheel rolls past
     with a cacophonous CRUNCHING, GRINDING noise -- like a
     gigantic millwheel.

                         BALA
               We're going to die!

                         Z
               Come on -- it's gone!  What are the
               chances of that happening again?

     No sooner has he said it than the rear wheel of the bike
     thunders past.

                         Z
               Well I'll be.

     Bala notices that they're clutching one another in fear; she
     pushes him away.

                         BALA
               Why didn't I listen to my mother
               ...why'd I have to go looking for
               trouble? Any ant would have given
               their left legs to be in my
               position...what's wrong with me?

                         Z
               Want a list?

                         BALA
                      (urgent)
               Wait, I hear something!

     We can, in fact, hear a low, musical PLUNK.. there's a pause
     and then we can hear it again...

     Z and Bala walk over a rocky "dune" (the soft shoulder of the
     path).  Beyond, the grass starts up again.  They have come to
     the end of the "desert" (i.e. the other side of the path)
     Through the blades of grass, we can see...

                         Z
               It's...it's...


                         BALA
               WATER!!!

     EXT. LAKE - DAY

     A LAKE (a puddle) stretches before them.  It is, in fact, the
     overflow of a drinking-fountain whose drain is jammed...as Z
     and Bala run to the lake, water dribbles from the fountain
     and into one edge of the pool (to the ants, it's a waterfall).

     Bala and Z run to the edge of the water and start slurping.
     They smile at each other, until they remember that they don't
     like each other.

                         Z
               This lake is huge!  And so close to
               the colony!  Think of the vacation
               potential!

                         BALA
               Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take
               a nap.

                         Z
               Listen, "Princess", you can't order
               me around.  Out here, you're not the
               boss anymore -- out here, you're
               just --

     -- But before he can finish, a water droplet from the
     fountain falls on him.  It may not sound like much, but to Z
     it's as though a ten-foot diameter sphere of jello had
     engulfed him.

     Z's stuck inside because of the surface tension of the
     droplet, which doesn't burst, just quivers up and down.
     Inside, Z is slowly, frantically drowning and screaming for
     help.  But his screams are muffled in the water.

                         BALA
                      (annoyed)
               Out here I'm just what?

                         Z
                      (through the water)
               Hlllllllp!

                         BALA
                      (hands on hips)
               Stop fooling around in there.

     By now the droplet has started rolling, and Z is being turned
     upside-down.  He manages to get one foreleg out of the
     droplet, and, in a frantic attempt to pull himself out, pulls
     Bala in by the leg.

                         BALA
               Let me go!!!

     But it's too late -- they're now both stuck in the droplet,
     and, as Z continues to drown, he also has to deal with Bala
     yelling at him -- though we can't hear exactly what it. is
     she's yelling through the water.

     Then, having run out of air, she too starts thrashing,
     alternately trying to swim and trying to slap him as Z tries
     to defend himself.  Finally all this commotion is enough to
     make the droplet burst, spilling the two coughing,
     sputtering, drenched ants onto the ground.

     They both lie there, miserable, wet, and cold.

                         BALA
                      (chants to herself)
               I'm going to be rescued soon.  I'm
               going to be rescued soon.  I'm going
               to be rescued soon.

     Z watches her incredulously.

                         Z
               Princess, has it ever occurred to you
               that they're not going to rescue you?

                         BALA
               General Formica won't let me die out
               here.  I'm his fiancee.

                         Z
               Look.  How many other Princesses are
               there?

                         BALA
               Five thousand three hundred and
               ninety -- no.  About five thousand
               four hundred by now.

                         Z
               And only you can become a Queen?

                         BALA
               Well...no, but --

                         Z
               So what makes you so special?

                         BALA
                      (hesitates)
               Well...I am the oldest.

     Bala turns from Z.  She's thinking things over, realization
     dawning on her.

                         BALA
               By three seconds...

     She looks out into the grass forest.

                         BALA
                      (to herself)
               You're right.  There are as many
               Princesses...as there are blades of
               grass.

     Z, overhearing her, slowly puts his hand on her shoulder.

     INT. MEGA-TUNNEL - DAY

     Formica and Carpenter are walking into the entrance of the
     tunnel with a squad of soldiers.

                         FORMICA
               Dammit, this tunnel is priority A-1!
               We can't afford any delays on this
               project!

                         CARPENTER
               I've never seen anything like it,
               General, they're they're...well, look!

     Ahead of them, a group of a few hundred workers have stopped
     work and are sitting down, chanting...

                         WORKER ANTS
               Z!  Z!  Z!  Z!

     A worker moves forward to join the strikers, tossing down his
     tool.

                         FOREMAN
                      (yelling at him)
               Where do ya think you're going?  Get
               back to work!

                         WORKER #1
               Buzz off, I'm important!
                      (joining the others)
               Z!  Z!  Z!  Z!


     At the center of the group, Weaver and Azteca are holding
     hands, leading the chant.

                         FORMICA
               Notice the big one, holding hands
               with the female?

                         CARPENTER
               Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?

                         FORMICA
                      (calculating)
               No one should have to.  Have him
               brought to me.

     INT. FORMICA'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT

     A nervous Weaver is sitting across from Formica, flanked by
     a couple of stoic guards.  Carpenter stands smiling by the
     side door.  There is no obvious threat to Weaver, but the
     atmosphere is truly intimidating.

                         FORMICA
               So this Z...he fancies himself an
               individual?

                         WEAVER
               Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know,
               really, sir.

                         FORMICA
                      (patronizing)
               Well now you haven't fallen for this
               silly idea of individuality, have
               you?

                         WEAVER
               Oh, no, sir!

                         FORMICA
               Good.  You're a good soldier.

                         WEAVER
               Thank you, sir.

     Weaver begins to relax a bit.

                         FORMICA
               So tell me.  Where's Z?

                         WEAVER
               I...I have no idea, sir.

                         FORMICA
               Okay, son.

     He pats Weaver on the shoulder.

                         FORMICA
               We know what makes an ant colony
               strong, don't we?  We know that no
               ant can be an individual.  No single
               ant matters, right?

                         WEAVER
                      (enthusiastically)
               That's correct, sir!

                         FORMICA
                      (points at a guard)
               Not that one.
                      (another guard)
               Or that one.

                         WEAVER
               No, sir!

     Formica nods at Carpenter, who smiles and opens a door.  Two
     soldiers walk in, holding Azteca.  The color drains from
     Weaver's face.

                         FORMICA
                      (calmly, with
                       satisfaction)
               Or that one?  Her life doesn't
               matter, does it?

                         AZTECA
               Don't tell that tightass anything,
               Weaver!

     Weaver starts to get up, but the guards behind him hold him
     down.

                         WEAVER
               Wait!  Just let her go!  Z's long
               gone anyway, following some golden
               egg to Insectopia!  You'll never
               catch him!

     Formica's face lights up.

                         FORMICA
               Insectopia, hunh?...See why
               individuality is so dangerous?  It
               can always be used against you.
                      (to the guards)
               If this sissy here wants to dig,
               he'll dig.  Send them both back to
               the tunnel project.  Double their
               workload.

     The guards exit with Weaver and Azteca.

                         FORMICA
               What do we have on this "Insectopia"?

                         CARPENTER
               Scattered reports, sir.  Rumors.
               Nothing reliable.

                         FORMICA
               Desperate times call for desperate
               measures.  Get me Ant Team Six.

                         CARPENTER
                      (frightened)
               Ant Team Six...

     EXT.  GRASS JUNGLE - DAY

     Z and Bala are lost, wandering through the grass

                         BALA
                      (looking hopeless)
               I swear, we've passed this blade of
               grass three times.

     Z keeps marching on.

                         BALA
               Face it, Z, we're lost!  We must have
               walked halfway across the world by
               now!  How did I get into this mess...

                         Z
                      (too shy to look at
                       her)
               Come on...tell me there wasn't just
               a little...something between us that
               first night at the bar.  The night we
               danced.

                         BALA
                      (sadly)
               What difference does it make...we're
               both going to starve to death, or get
               squished, or set on fire...

     But Z is just gawking.  The shot expands to show that they
     have stumbled onto...

                         Z
               ...The land of red and white...

     EXT. FALSE INSECTOPIA - DAY

     A PICNICGROUNDS...A red and white picnic blanket, which to
     the ants looks like a vast, undulating pavilion, stretches
     before them.  They gaze up at two obelisks: a salt and pepper
     shaker.

     Behind that is a gigantic tupperware jar full of potato
     salad, and sandwiches stacked high.  It all looks perfect,
     with the clean lines and monumental proportions of fascist
     architecture.  In fact, it looks a little too perfect.

                         Z
               We've found it!  Insectopia!  Look at
               all this food'

                         BALA
                      (amazed)
               You were right...you were right!
                      (smiling happily)
               Z, it's beautiful!

                         Z
               Let's dig in!

     Z goes over to a gigantic sandwich, but -- BOOIIING! -- he's
     prevented from getting at it by the saran wrap covering it.

                         Z
               There's - there's some kind of force
               field!

     Bala joins him, laboring against the saran wrap.  Then both
     of them hear laughter from above.

                         MALE WASP (O.S.)
                      (lockjawed accent)
               Muffy, look, party-crashers.

                         FEMALE WASP (O.S.)
                      (laughing)
               They're simply too much, Chip!

     Bala and Z look up to see two large, yellow WASPS hovering in
     the air above them.  The husband and wife wasps have
     lockjawed, William F. Buckleyesque accents.

                         MALE WASP
                      (to Z and Bala)
               You down there, haven't you ever been
               to a picnic?

                         Z
               Hunh?

                         FEMALE WASP
               Habla Ingles?
                      (to Male Wasp)
               Well I really don't know who they are.

                         Z
               We're ants!

     The Male Wasp zooms in closer.

                         MALE WASP
               Poopsie, we know some ants, don't we?
                      (to Z)
               Are you related to the Fifth Avenue
               ants?

                         FEMALE WASP
               Darling, do you have to talk to any
               insect from off the street?

                         MALE WASP
               Just being friendly, Poopsie.

                         BALA
               Hello?  I'm not just "any insect".
               My mother is the Queen.
                      (momentously)
               I'm Princess Bala!

                         MALE WASP
                      (under his breath)
               They're Eurotrash, dear.

     We hear a loud RUMBLING noise -- the family is about to sit
     down for their picnic lunch.  Gigantic hands reach down and
     pull away the "force fields".

                         MALE WASP
               Lunch!
                      (to Z)
               A little piece of advice, sport --
               bob and weave!  Bob and weave!

                         BALA
               What do you mean?

                         MALE WASP
               Well -- like my father used to say --
               there's no such thing as a free meal!

     The wasps dive in to the picnic, darting in for a bite, and
     then dashing away again...

                         THE WASPS
               Excuse me -- I'll have some potato
               salad -- thank-you! -- don't mind if
               I do!  After you! (etc.)

     -- But all is not well.  We pull back to reveal that Z and
     Bala are standing in front of a giant sneaker logo, which is
     attached to a giant sneaker.  Which moves.

                         Z
               I sort of imagined Insectopia a
               little differently --

     Just at that moment, we hear a whistling in the air -- and
     the female wasp is crushed by a huge swatter that sweeps out
     of the sky, sending the picnic blanket billowing up in an
     aftershock that throws Bala and Z to the ground.

                         BALA
               Oh...my...God.

                         MALE WASP
                      (shaking her)
               Muffy!  Muffy!  Wake up!

     But she doesn't move.  The Male Wasp stares up at the sky.

                         MALE WASP
                      (heartbroken)
               WHYYYYYYYYYYYYY????

     But Z, also looking up, has no time to commiserate.

                         Z
               Bala, look out!!

     They are only saved by the fact that they are so small - .the
     holes of the swatter pass over them.

     The woman, realizing that the swatter won't work on ants,
     throws it to the side and tries stomping on them...

     Before Bala can get away, a sneaker falls on her with a
     thunderous BOOM that shakes the ground.

                         BALA
               MMMffllmmm...

     The shoe rises, as the person wearing it steps away...and we
     see that Bala is stuck in one of the ridges of the waffle-
     soled sneaker, adhering to a big piece of bubblegum!

                         BALA
               Z!  Help me!!!

     But Bala is carried off on the sneaker in a huge, looping,
     ferris-wheel-like motion.  BOOM.  The sneaker on which Bala
     is stuck falls again, as the woman tries to step on Z, too --

                         Z
               Bala!
                      (mournfully)
               I'll never see her again...

     -- But he does, instantly, as the shoe rises again, showing
     Bala stuck deeper in the bubblegum --

                         BALA
               Z!!!  Get me out of heeeeere!

     -- The woman has decided to walk away from the picnic to get
     the bubblegum off her shoe...Z heart sinks as the shoe Bala's
     stuck on lopes off into the distance...

                         Z
                      (thinks)
               These things always come in twos...

     He sees a SECOND SHOE starting to rise --

                         Z
               Take me to your leader!

     Z runs towards the shoe as it rises... and at the last moment
     catches on to the snaky, swinging shoe-lace.

                         Z
               Whoooooooaaaa!!!

     The sneaker lifts off into the air, with Z holding on for
     dear life to the lace, and getting further and further away
     from Bala as he's drawn to a vertiginous height...the
     landscape can be seen rolling and pitching crazily in the
     background...

                         Z
               Bala!  Come back here!

     For a moment, the sneaker seems to pause in the air...then it
     descends again, in a stomach-churning, roller-coaster free-
     fall as the sneaker on which Bala is stuck rises up again...

                         BALA
               Z!!!!!!!  I'm stuck!

     --  But Z is trying to keep his lunch down as he descends.
     The sneaker hits the ground, and Z can feel himself
     again...it's now or never.

                         Z
                      (Tarzan whoop)
               Aa-ee-ya-ee-yaaaaaaaah!!!!!!!

     As the sneaker rises again, he swings off the lace, hurtling
     through the air and catching one of the laces of Bala's
     sneaker...the momentum swings him up and under the sole...

                         BALA
               Z!  You're here!

     Z gets smashed into the bubblegum next to Bala.  Now he's
     stuck too.

                         Z
                      (ruefully)
               Yeah.  I'm here.

     The sneaker descends again.  Z and Bala hold hands and SCREAM
     as they see the ground rise too meet them...

     THUD!  They're squished deeper into the bubblegum.  The
     sneaker rises again...

                         BALA
                      (emotional)
               Z...if we don't make it...I just want
               you to know....

                         Z
                      (touched)
               Yes?

                         BALA
               This is all your fault!!!

     The sneaker rises, and seems ready to fall again...but
     instead it just hovers there.  (The person wearing it is
     balancing on one leg and about to scrape off the bubblegum
     with a penny).

                         Z
               We're safe...

     Just then, the hand holding the penny looms up...the penny
     is, by ant standards, about sixty feet high.  The huge image
     of Abraham Lincoln stares down at them.

                         Z
               Who the hell is that?!!!

     The penny starts scrapes the bubblegum off the sneaker,
     bringing Bala and Z along with it.  They're carried through
     the air as the penny gets thrown away...turning over and over
     in a lopsided orbit as Bala and Z SCREAM...

     ...and land with a CRASH in total darkness.

     EXT. LAKE - DAY

     The "lake" where Z and Bala were nearly drowned by the water
     droplet.

     The earth shakes as a HUGE, MONSTROUS creature approaches the
     lake - and begins to drink from it.  The creature seems to
     hear something, and, growling, turns its ugly head.  It's a
     Pomeranian, one of those yappy little lap-dogs -- but seen
     from ant perspective, it's something out of a horror movie.

                         TOUGH VOICE (O.S.)
               Ant Team Six -- take him out!

     The monster bears its huge fangs at the approaching
     intruders -- a bunch of flying ants who look as though
     they're attacking the Death Star!

     The monster rears and snaps at two of the ants, who are
     making a diversionary run...

     and then gets it from the rest of the ants, who land on his
     soft, wet nose and start stinging away like crazy.

     The monster rears back in pain -- and runs away, YIPPING!

     The members of ANT TEAM SIX, a crack team of hardcore flying-
     ant commandoes a la Seal Team Six, break off the attack and
     land.

                         MAJOR MANDIBLE
               And don't come back, you sissy!

     MAJOR MANDIBLE, Ant Team Six's lethal commander, steps into
     frame.  He's the one-eyed killer we met in the bar earlier.
     The rest of his team fan out to search the area.

                         MANDIBLE
               Talk to me.

                         COMMANDO ANT
               Z and the Princess were here, sir.
               Signs of a struggle.

                         MANDIBLE
               Let's get a read on that feremone
               track.

                         COMMANDO ANT #1
                      (to the others)
               Get the sniffer!

     Two other commandoes come running up with what looks like a
     piece of machinery on a tripod -- only it's an ant -- a
     highly specialized, blind ant with an incredibly acute sense
     of smell.

                         TRACKER ANT
               Bala...find Bala...

     The tracker, drool running out of its long proboscis, sniffs
     the air and starts signalling like a geiger counter...

                         TRACKER ANT
                      (as he's swivelled)
               Nnononononononoyeahyeahnononononono
               no...

     Finally the tracker stops swivelling, pointing in one
     direction and saying, "Yeahyeahyeahyeah..."

                         COMMANDO ANT #3
               Got 'em!  Ten clicks from here!

                         MANDIBLE
               Z -- you dirt-digging, fancy-dancing,
               wisecracking, royalty-grabbing, rebel
               SCUM!
                      (yelling into the
                       distance)
               I AM COMING FOR YOU!  YOU ARE ONE
               DEAD ANT, MISTER!

     Mandible's muscles bulge.  The veins in his head throb.  This
     is one ass-kicking ant.  Even Mandible's troops look scared
     of him.

                         MANDIBLE
               Let's MOVE!  GO, people!  GO!  GO!
               GO!  GO!  GO!

     Ant Team Six takes to the air, heading in the direction
     indicated by the tracker ant.

     INT. TRASH BAG - DAY

     Darkness.  Out of it we hear the voices of Z and Bala.

                         BALA
               Come on, Z.

                         Z
               Forget it.  You go ahead, I give up.
               I...I don't know what I was thinking.
               "Insectopia".

     In one corner of the screen, we can see an irregular little
     hole through which a shaft of light is falling.  Bala
     proceeds towards it, the hole appears to get bigger and
     bigger...

                         Z
                      (defeated)
               There's only one thing worse than an
               ant who goes around mindlessly
               following orders, and that's an ant
               who's too dumb to go around
               mindlessly following orders.

     Bala stops...she notices that they're being watched.  She's
     emerging from a tied off garbage bag -- the yellow ties loop
     away gracefully.  Bala and Z have been tossed into a garbage
     area.  And above them and below them, peering from garbage
     cans, recycling containers, bags, etc., a multi-cultural
     assortment of insects are regarding them.

     A laid-back FLY voices their thoughts.

                         FLY
               What's with the bummer attitude?

     A nearby BUTTERFLY joins in.

                         BUTTERFLY
               Yeah -- nobody stresses out in
               Insectopia!

                         BALA
               Did you say...

                         Z
                      (joining Bala)
               ...Insectopia?

     Z and Bala look around.  Just to get things straight, the
     garbage dump doesn't look disgusting -- that would be seeing
     it through human eyes.  Instead, we're looking at it through
     ant eyes -- and, reimagined this way, it's Paradise.  Not the
     ordered, sterile, paradise of the picnic, but an earthly land
     of plenty.

     The sides of the plastic garbage bags are sheer, reflective
     walls of smoothest obsidian...the garbage cans are gigantic,
     thick metal columns put there by the gods (think the
     pyramids); a coke bottle, refracting the sunlight into a
     gorgeous rainbow, trickles a fountain of sweet nectar into
     the pink, bittersweet flesh of a grapefruit half, which
     appears as a multi-chambered concave dome.  Everywhere,
     insects are disporting themselves -- a multi- species love-in
     that's like an insect version of Woodstock.

     Bala and Z are awe-struck.  Bala turns to Z.

                         BALA
                      (happily)
               Z, we made it!

                         FLY
                      (alighting on the
                       grapefruit)
               C'mon in!  The nectar's fine!

     Like a kid at an amusement park, Z slides down the smooth
     side of the garbage bag, whooshing this way and that until he
     slides into one end of a straw (a red and white striped
     tunnel), and is shot out...

                         Z
               Yippeeeeee!

     ...into a bottle-cap filled with lemonade, which he
     alternately drinks and swims through...

     Down at the bottlecap, Z is drying himself off.  Then he
     sees, emerging from behind a lemon peel, a gigantic TERMITE.

                         Z
                      (terrified)
               AAAAAGH!!!

     Surprisingly, the termite seems equally terrified...

                         FLY
                      (to Z)
               Hey, take it easy!  There's nothin'
               to be afraid of!

                         Z
               Yeah, well, I make it a practice not
               to trust anyone who shoots acid out
               of their forehead.

                         CRICKET
               Dude, here in Insectopia, we don't
               judge people by how many arms and
               legs we've got.

                         FLY
               Yeah, back home, they called me a
               fruitfly.  But here, I'm known
               as...
                      (with attitude)
               Superfly.

                         CRICKET
               Anyway, big Gus is mellow.

     The termite sticks his hand out.  A drop of acid drips from
     his head and splashes at Z's feet.

                         Z
                      (taking his hand,
                       disgusted)
               Charmed.

     Z reaches out and shakes the termite's hand, as Bala watches,
     smiling.

                                              CUT TO:

     EXT. INSECTOPIA - NIGHT

     The insects are having a cookout, their faces illuminated by
     the still-red ember of a match.  Platters heaped with food
     lie untouched as they pat their bellies...

     Z and Bala sit next to one another, smiling shyly as if they
     had just met for the first time.

                         Z
               So...you never did tell me...what
               made you come out to the worker bar
               that night?

                         BALA
               Just looking for fun, adventure,
               trouble, I guess.

                         Z
               Well, "trouble" is my middle name.
               Actually, my  middle name is .985,
               but I don't tell people.  Hey, Bala,
               I...I actually have something of
               yours...you left it at the bar that
               night.

     Z takes out Bala's scarf, which he's been keeping folded in
     a pocket.

                         Z
               Sorry, it's been through a war, not
               to mention everything else...

                         BALA
               You held onto this all that time?

                         Z
               Well, I...I know it's a little
               strange, but...I thought it might
               come in handy if I...needed a scarf
               someday.
                      (embarrassed)
               Well, to be honest, I just liked
               having it.

     He hands it back to her.  Bala looks at Z, frankly, openly.
     For a moment Z is shy.  Then he looks at her too.  They're
     two lovers, leaning closer, about to have their first kiss,
     when --

                         BEETLE
               Hey Z!

     The moment is wrecked.  Z looks up.  A chubby beetle stands
     there with Gus the termite.

                         BEETLE
               Wanna bring back dessert?  There's a
               thirty foot long blimp in the next
               can, made completely of chocolate!

                         Z
                      (annoyed)
               Sure.  I wasn't busy or anything.

     Z gets up to go with them.

                         Z
               Great timing, guys.  Ever wonder why
               they call you "pests"?

     EXT.  INSECTOPIA, TOP OF CAN - NIGHT

     As Ant Team Six lands and takes up position above the feast.
     The tracker ant is going nuts.

                         TRACKER ANT
               Yesyesyesyesyes --

     One of the commandoes puts his hand over the tracker's mouth
     to shut him up.  Mandible communicates with his troops by
     pulling down his one functional antenna and gruffly
     whispering into it, as though it were one of those commando
     headsets.  His troops do likewise.

                         MANDIBLE
               Talk to me.

                         COMMANDO #1
               I've got a read on the Princess --
               but target Z isn't accounted for.

                         MANDIBLE
               Let's move in.

     EXT. INSECTOPIA - NIGHT

     Back at the feast, a cricket strums on his legs like a
     guitar, opining about life and the universe to a bunch of
     other chilled-out, hippyesque insects...Bala taps her feet to
     the song.

                         CRICKET
               What if, like...we're just these tiny
               little things, and we're just like
               part of this whole other huge
               universe, that's like, so big we
               don't even know it exists?

                         LADYBUG
               Man...that's so deep...

     At that moment Ant Team Six rapels down from the top of the
     garbage bin, landing amongst the insects.

                         MANDIBLE
               EVERYBODY DOWN!

     The cricket gets up to confront Mandible, but Mandible cold
     cocks him with a right to the jaw.  The other insects, too
     surprised to fight, just do as they're told.

                         MANDIBLE
               Alright, you hippy scum!  Make one
               move and I'll exterminate you!

     A couple of commandoes grab Bala by the arms and heave her up.

                         BALA
               Stop!  You don't understand!

                         MANDIBLE
               I don't have to understand, Missy --
               I've got orders.  Now where's Z?

                                              CUT TO:

     INT. INSECTOPIA - NIGHT

     Z, the termite, the beetle and the fly are happily carrying
     a huge M&M back to the feast.

                         FLY
               Man, your girl is fly, know what I'm
               saying?

                         Z
                      (overdoing it)
               Oh, Bala?  I guess she's okay, you
               know, for a princess.  I mean, I
               usually date queens, or you know,
               empresses, because sometimes the
               lesser nobility are too much in awe
               of my smouldering sensuality.  Please
               stop me if I'm making you feel
               inadequate.

     They throw down the M&M, which lands with a THUD.  Z notices
     that the rest of the insects look spooked.

                         Z
               What's the matter?  This place is as
               cheery as a Roach Motel at check-out
               time.

     Z looks around.

                         LADYBUG
               Bala's been kidnapped!  Some flying
               ants took her back to the colony!

                         Z
               She's been kidnapped?!  But I can't
               live without her!

     Z just stands there, heartbroken.

                         Z
                      (determined)
               I'm going back.  I've got to get her.
               Who'll come with me?

     Z looks around.  Nobody's volunteering.  Nothing but sheepish
     looks and shuffling from the insects of Insectopia.

     Z looks disheartened.  He's about to leave when --

                         MALE WASP (O.S.)
               I'll go.

     The male wasp is hovering nearby.

                         Z
                      (surprised)
               You?!

                         MALE WASP
               I know what it's like to lose
               someone...I keep hearing the sound of
               Muffy's flapping wings...so I'll take
               you.

     Z hops on the wasp's back.

                         Z
               Let's go, pal!

     The wasp takes off, leaving the other insects looking a
     little chastized.

                         FLY
               Geez.  I feel like a real stinkbug.

                                              CUT TO:

     EXT. SKY ABOVE COLONY - MORNING

     The wasp and Z fly high above the colony...

                         Z
               Wow...I never saw things this way...

     From here, we can see the whole layout of the land around the
     colony...the "desert" (an asphalt path) and across it, the
     "lake" (the overflowing water fountain)

                         Z
               Things look so close together from up
               here...there's the desert...and the
               lake...
                      (thinking about
                       something)
               it's not far from the colony at all...

     Suddenly, the wasp bounces up and down in the air.

                         MALE WASP
               Sorry.  Turbulence.

     INT. FORMICA'S CHAMBERS - DAY

     Formica sits at his desk, going over some plans.  Formica's
     chambers are located inside a snake skull, with the eye
     sockets serving as windows, and the mouth serving as a door.
     The walls are hung with trophies -- the heads of other
     insects.

     Ant Team Six burst in the doors of Formica's office, carrying
     the struggling and kicking Bala.  One of the commandoes sets
     the tracker ant one the floor...then Formica gets up from his
     desk as the commandoes bring the princess to him.

                         FORMICA
               Princess Bala.  Good.
                      (with urgency)
               Where's Z?

     Bala replies warily.

                         BALA
               He's...he's dead.
                      (covering for Z)
               You don't have to look for him
               anymore.  He was eaten by a praying
               mantis.

                         FORMICA
                      (regretfully)
               It's a shame he died prematurely...I
               was hoping to kill him myself.

                         BALA
               Well you'll never be able to hurt him
               where he is now.
                      (sadly)
               I miss him already.

                         FORMICA
                      (surprised)
               You miss him?  Why?

                         BALA
                      (angry)
               Because...because he's twice the ant
               that you are.  I could never go
               through with marrying you.  I'm --
               I'm an individual, and when I get
               married, it'll be to someone I choose.

     The soldiers look shocked.  For a moment, Formica looks
     furious.  Then he just shrugs.

                         FORMICA
                      (shaking his head)
               Princess Bala, I'm just a simple old
               soldier, and the ways of the feminine
               mind are a little too complex for me.
               But one thing I do know is, there are
               more Princesses where you came from.
               I just hope they're not all like you.
               In the meantime, maybe we can arrange
               for you to see Z again after all.

     He gestures to the commandoes, who drag her out the door.  We
     notice that the tracker ant has been left behind.

     EXT. ANT MOUND - DAY

     Z hops down from the wasp, who has landed near the entrance
     to the colony.

                         MALE WASP
               Good luck, Z.  For a wingless insect,
               you're alright by me.

                         Z
               Thanks, Chip.

     They shake hands and the wasp flies off.

                         Z
                      (to himself)
               How am I going to get in?  The place
               is crawling with soldiers!

     Z starts for the nearest entrance -- but he's spotted by a
     couple of SOLDIER ANTS.

                         SOLDIER ANT
               You there!  Worker!

     Z's caught -- it's over.  He turns around with his hands up.

                         Z
               Don't bite!  I surrender!

                         SOLDIER ANT
               What are you doing out here!  All
               workers are to remain inside the
               colony, by orders of General Formica!

     Z can't believe his luck -- and his curiosity is piqued.

                         Z
                      (heading inside)
               Well...if you insist...

     INT. MEGATUNNEL - DAY

     The Queen, with Formica striding at her side, is carried by
     a personal escort of fifty or so struggling workers to the
     bottom end of the Mega Tunnel, where a red ribbon waits to be
     cut.

                         QUEEN
               Very impressive, General.

     Behind her, hundreds of thousands of workers are crowded,
     looking confused and expectant.  Some of them clutch little
     flags and noisemakers...

                         MANDIBLE
               Wave that flag, you maggot!

     ...which we see are being handed out to them by Ant Team Six.

                         FORMICA
               Is there anything wrong, your majesty?

     The Queen is looking around unhappily.

                         QUEEN
               It's just...How I miss Bala.  I wish
               she were here for this special moment.

     Formica warmly places his hand on the Queen's shoulder.

                         FORMICA
                      (falsely supportive)
               She is, your majesty.  She is.

     The CAMERA heads up the long, long tunnel, where we see...

     INT. MID SKYLIGHT TUNNEL

     Bala, tied and gagged.  She's at the point in the Megatunnel
     where it begins to curve upwards towards the surface.  She
     struggles against her bonds, but can't get loose.

                                              CUT TO:

     INT. ANT MOUND - DAY

     Elsewhere in the colony, a column of soldiers marches by, and
     we hear the TROMP-TROMP-TROMP of their boots.  When they've
     gone, Z pokes his head out from behind a pile of dirt...he
     heads in the opposite direction of the soldiers...

     INT. OUTSIDE FORMICA'S CHAMBERS - DAY

     Z creeps around the outside of Formica's chambers.  This part
     of the colony seems to be deserted.

                         Z
               Geez, this place really empties out
               in August.  Where is everybody?

     Z walks up to the skull that houses Formica's chambers and
     peeks in the eye socket.

     INT. FORMICA'S CHAMBERS

     Inside, the Tracker Ant, who's been left behind, switches
     "on", eyes glowing.  Z enters the chamber cautiously.

                         TRACKER ANT
                      (sniffing)
               Z!  Z!  I smell Z!

     For a moment, Z's afraid.  Then he sees the small Tracker Ant
     doesn't seem hostile.

                         Z
               You "smell" me?  Well look, I -- I've
               been out in the wilderness for a
               while, and --

     The tracker ant keeps sniffing.  Z waves his hand in front of
     the blind ant's eyes.

                         Z
                      (getting it)
               Hey, wait, you're...you're one of
               those pheremone sniffers, aren't you?
               Maybe you can help me...I'm looking
               for a friend of mine, Princess Bala.

                         TRACKER ANT
                      (enthusiastic)
               Bala!  Yeahyeahyeahyeahyeah!  Find
               Bala!  Yeahyeahyeahyeah!

     Z picks up the tracker ant.

                         Z
               Just remember, I met her first.

     Z, carrying the little tracker ant, heads out, following its
     lead...

     Through this and that passage, as the Tracker Ant gets more
     and more insistent...And finally straight to a blank wall.

                         TRACKER ANT
               Yeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeah...

                         Z
               Bala's through there?

                         TRACKER ANT
               Bala...Yeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeah...

                         Z
               Great.  More digging.  This is why I
               left in the first place.

     Z can answer his own question.  He puts down the tracker ant,
     with a look on his face like a kid forced to eat broccoli,
     starts digging through the wall...

     INT. SKYLIGHT APEX - DAY

     Meanwhile, A member of Ant Team Six -- the stupidest member,
     in fact, waits at the very top of the tunnel, where it
     narrows almost to a point.  He's hanging from a winch, and
     has a little hammer and chisel in his hand.  He's WHISTLING,
     awaiting instructions.

     INT. MEGA-TUNNEL - DAY

     Z emerges from the tunnel he's dug, spits a load of dirt out
     of his mouth and wipes his hands off.  Nearby, Bala lies
     there, bound and gagged.

                         Z
               Bala!

     Z unties Bala and undoes her gag.

                         BALA
               Z!  You came back!

     They HUG.

                         Z
               Why do they have you tied up here?

                         BALA
               There's something going on, Z --

     From here, Z can see far down the tunnel to where the crowd
     is gathering.

                         BALA
               They're having a ceremony to open the
               Megatunnel...

     We can hear the sound of WATER SHIFTING somewhere above.  He
     looks up the tunnel...in the distance, we can make out the
     silhouete of the commando set to break open the wall...

                         Z
               Bala, that -- that lake we found --
               I think the tunnel's right underneath
               it!
                      (horrified)
               -- Formica's going to flood the
               colony!!!  That's what he meant when
               said there were too many ants!

                         BALA
               Oh no...

     Bala looks too shocked to move.  Z starts pushing her into
     the tunnel he made, and starts heading down towards the crowd.

                         BALA
               Z!  what are you doing?

                         Z
               I know it's crazy, but -- I can't
               just leave.  Don't argue with me.  If
               I've learned anything, it's that the
               problems of two people don't add up
               to a hill of ants in this world.  Or
               beans.  Something like that.  Anyway,
               I've got to warn the others.

     Z looks into Bala's eyes.

                         Z
               Head for the surface, Bala.  If I
               don't make it, well...we'll always
               have Insectopia.

     Z kisses Bala.  Then he starts running down the tunnel
     towards the crowd...

                         BALA
                      (following him)
               Z!!! Wait for me!

     INT. ANT MOUND - DAY

     All the SOLDIERS are filtering out of the assembly area,
     leaving the workers behind.  As his troops march by, Formica
     steps to the side and hands the Queen a pair of scissors to
     cut the ribbon strung across the Megatunnel.

                         FORMICA
               Your majesty, I'm afraid matters of
               state keep me from attending the
               ceremony.

                         QUEEN
               But General -- this tunnel is your
               baby!  You're sure you can't stay ?

                         FORMICA
               'Fraid not, your majesty.
                      (with regret)
               Goodbye, your majesty.

                         QUEEN
               Very well, General -- I know you --
               all work and no play!

                         FORMICA
               Alright, let's move out!

     Formica, surrounded by his bodyguards, hurries off as the
     Queen readies to cut the ribbon...

                         QUEEN
               In the name of the colony, I declare
               this tunnel open!

     INT. MEGA-TUNNEL - DAY

     Z and Bala sprint towards the bottom end of the tunnel...

                         Z
               Stoooooop!

     -- and then pull back to see Queen cut the ribbon -- she
     looks up and sees --

                         QUEEN
               Bala!

                         BALA
               Mom!

     Z calls out to the crowd.

                         Z
               Listen up!  We've all got to get out
               of here!  This place is going to
               flood!

     The workers are unconvinced.

                         WORKER #1
               Are you nuts?

                         Z
               You've got to believe me!

                         WORKER #2
               Oh yeah?  What makes you so special,
               Mr. Know-It-All?

                         Z
               I'm Z.

     The workers are even more sceptical.  A laugh goes up from
     the crowd.

                         WORKER #3
               You're Z?  Gimme a break!  Z's ten
               milimeters tall!

                         WORKER #4
               -- and he can kill termites with his
               bare hands!  You're just some scrawny
               worker with a mental problem!

                         Z
               I am Z!

                         WORKER #1
               No you're not!

                         WEAVER
               Yes he is.

     Weaver steps out of the crowd.

                         Z
               Weaver!

     Weaver runs up to Z and hugs him, starting to cry.

                         WORKERS
               Hey...it is Z...listen to what he
               says! [etc].

                         WEAVER
               Z...I'm so sorry!  I --

                         Z
               Don't worry about it, pal.

     Nearby, Bala and the Queen hug.  The Queen looks over at Z.

                         QUEEN
                      (distastefully)
               Oh...it's that social-climbing worker
               again -- what does he want?

                         Z
                      (in response)
               To save you all!  Now we've got to go!

                                              CUT TO:

     EXT. ANT MOUND - DAY

     Outside of the colony, where Formica, surrounded by the army,
     gives a signal to Mandible by drawing his finger across his
     throat...

                         MANDIBLE
                      (talking into his
                       antenna)
               Let 'er rip!

     INT. SKYLIGHT APEX - DAY

     AT THE TOP OF THE TUNNEL, the commando starts chiseling away
     furiously at the wall...and nothing but dust falls down.  The
     commando looks at the dust as it falls down, down the long
     tunnel...he looks up at the dry wall...Hmmm...

     Then...

     THE WALL BURSTS OPEN.

     And a TORRENT starts pouring out -- swallowing the terrified
     commando as if he were a crumb and heading down the tunnel
     like a freight train, ripping up the walls as it goes...

     INT. EARLY MEGA-TUNNEL - DAY

     Everyone turns to hear the rumbling sound coming down the
     tunnel --

                         AZTECA
               Listen!

                         WORKER #1
               He's right!!!

     From here, we can see deep into the tunnel, at the point
     where it levels out...and the torrent can be seen rushing
     down at them...

                         Z
               LET'S MOVE IT!

     All of a sudden there's panic as every ant tries to scramble
     away from the oncoming water...in the confusion, the Queen's
     bearers drop her and scramble over her.

                         QUEEN
               You there!  Stop!  I say!

     The Queen turns, and for a brief moment is silhouetted
     against the white-capped torrent of water...

     ...and then she picks her abdomen up like a skirt and high
     tails it away from the torrent, running so fast that she
     passes some of her bearers on the way...

     And then the torrent spits out of the mouth of the
     Megatunnel, quickly filling up the chamber and branching into
     all of its side tunnels, as we see:

     A group of workers RUNNING up a side tunnel and getting
     consumed by a wave, which crashes down on them like a hand
     slapping a table...

     Another group, the members of which are getting swallowed up
     one by one; one of the ants runs up on the ceiling of the
     tunnel and keeps on going, upside-down...it works for a while
     but eventually he, too is swallowed up...

     -- In the Nursery, nurses are evacuating stacks of crying ant
     babies...

     In one of the larger access-tunnels, down which thousands of
     workers are fleeing, a group of ants turns and decides to
     make a stand for it -- they link up in a mass and form a
     LIVING DAM.  It holds for a while but then BURSTS scattering
     and smashing ants along the sides of the tunnel before eating
     them up...

     And we...

                                              CUT TO:

     INT. TOWN CENTER - DAY

     The huge main chamber of the colony, where most of the
     workers -- as well as Z, Bala, Weaver, Azteca, and the
     Queen -- have run to.

     The chamber is rapidly flooding from all sides.  Water flows
     out of every escape tunnel the workers try...and the crowd is
     becoming more and more closely packed together as the waters
     rise around them.

                         AZTECA
               There's no way out!

                         QUEEN
               We're all going to drown!!!

                         BALA
               Z...what can we do?

     Z clenches his fist...he feels utterly powerless...then he
     shouts...

                         Z
               Dig!

     The workers turn to look at him questioningly.

                         Z
               We've got to dig a trench around us!

     -- But one of the workers raises his hands.

                         WORKER #1
               Uh...we don't dig any more.  We're
               individuals.

                         WORKER #2
               Yeah.  We're too important to dig.
               You taught us that, Z.  You hate
               digging!

                         Z
                      (at his wits end)
               Yeah, but I hate drowning more!  Now
               dig!

                         WEAVER
               You heard the ant -- DIG!!!

     The workers start to dig a circular moat around themselves,
     passing the dirt back into the middle of what remains of the
     dry ground.

     -- But they seems to be making little headway against the
     water as it continues to rush in...

     The ant labor we saw up to now were nothing compared to
     this.   As the moat gets deeper, the pile grows higher and
     higher...Weaver is digging up huge chunks of earth...nearby,
     Azteca is digging like crazy too...Z runs around, directing
     traffic and encouraging the workers...

                         Z
               That's it!  Pass the dirt back to the
               center!  Go on!

     Nearby the Queen stands there, looking squeamish.

                         Z
               Your highness...time to get your
               hands dirty!

     Gingerly, the Queen reaches out for a clod of dirt...and
     passes it along.  Next thing you know, she's practically
     crushed by a huge load thrown up by Weaver.

     The water keeps rushing in...but now we notice that...

     ...the pile of dirt in the middle of the "island" created by
     the digging of the moat is growing higher and higher,
     reaching up towards the ceiling of the chamber...

     ...And the water is getting swallowed up by the moat,
     swirling around angrily.

     Now Z looks up, and sees that with a little more effort they
     can reach the top --

                         Z
               We need to form a scaffolding around
               this mound -- let's DO IT!

     The workers start to cluster around the mound, covering it,
     forming a tight network of living bodies around the mound up
     towards the ceiling...

                         Z
               Now climb!

     The ants start to scale the scaffolding, up towards the top
     of the chamber...it's a swarming mass of ants, hauling each
     other up, giving each other legs up, climbing ever and ever
     higher towards the top...

     Where they start to dig through the very ceiling...

     ...as, at the bottom of the mound, Z starts to organize the
     hauling away of the Queen, as though she were a big cargo
     container...

                         Z
               Okay boys -- take her up!

     Z slaps the Queen on the butt, and she's winched away on a
     cable composed entirely of ants linked arm in arm like those
     plastic toy monkeys...

     EXT. ANT MOUND - DAY

     ...And Azteca's head pokes through the ground...she hauls
     herself up, and hundreds of ants pour up from the ground,
     widening the hole...

     INT. TOWN CENTER - DAY

     The water is rising...but almost all of the ants have
     escaped...Z clambers up the mound, as the scaffolding of ants
     rolls up from the bottom....

     And the rushing water finally wears down the earthen core of
     the structure.  As Z hauls himself through the hole in the
     ceiling.

     The entire structure collapses into the angry waters below,
     which seem furious to have missed their prey...

     EXT. ANT MOUND - DAY

                         WORKER
               He did it!  Z!  Z!  Z!  Z!  Z!

     The "Z" cheer goes up, with everyone joining in.  But the
     jubilation is short-lived, for, appearing on the ridge,
     surrounding the workers, is FORMICA'S ARMY, circling the mass
     of workers, backing them in towards the roiling water behind
     them.  Formica himself appears in the front lines, with
     Carpenter and Mandible at his side.

                         FORMICA
               Z.  I should have known.  All that
               work, all that preparation, come to
               nothing.  All because of one stinking
               ant.

     He steps forward to address the surrounded, trapped workers.

                         FORMICA
               ALRIGHT.  WHICH ONE OF YOU IS Z?

     The workers, trembling but silent, cower inside the unbroken
     circle of soldiers.

                         FORMICA
               WHAT ARE YOU, DEAF?  I ASKED YOU,
               WHERE'S Z?

     Formica laughs, shaking his head.

                         FORMICA
               Folks, you may have survived that
               flood, but there's no way you're
               gonna escape from me.  I'll make you
               a deal.  Hand over the rebel leader
               Z, and you survive.

     This sends a ripple of murmurs through the workers.

                         FORMICA
               But if you don't hand him over,
               you're all going to die, each and
               every single..."individual" one of
               you.

     The workers all look at each other.

                         FORMICA
               What shall it be, workers?

     The workers remain frightened but silent.  Z trembles,
     terrified.

                         FORMICA
               Have it your way.

     As Formica raises his swagger stick to order the attack, a
     lone figure steps out from the crowd.

                         Z
               Wait...

     Z stands there, shivering with fear.

                         Z
               ...I'm Z.

     For a moment, Z stands alone, under the glare of Formica's
     gaze.

     Then another figure steps out from the throng of workers.

                         WEAVER
               No, I'm Z.

     Z turns, astonished, to see Weaver, still and unwavering,
     bravely risking his life for his friend.  Then, AZTECA also
     steps forward.

                         AZTECA
               I'm Z!

     Next, Bala comes forward.

                         BALA
               No, I'm Z.

     More and more ants step forward.

                         WORKERS
               I'm Z!  I'm Z!  I'm Z and so is my
               brother!  I've been Z for weeks now!

                         QUEEN
                      (regally)
               We are Z.

     Now, the workers are all shouting the same declaration.

                         ALL
               I am Z!  I am Z!  I am Z!

     Z is plainly flabbergasted.  Formica is outraged.  He gives
     the signal.

                         FORMICA
               ATTACK!

     The army swells forward on all sides, pushing the workers
     towards the swirling water.  Some workers surround the Queen
     to protect her.  All seems lost, when THE FLY from Insectopia
     alights on the rim of the horizon.

                         FLY
               Hey, guys!

     THE WASP appears on the other side of the horizon.

                         WASP
               It's them!

     Suddenly, on all sides, A MASSIVE INSECT ARMY appears on the
     ridge, looking not unlike ambushing Indians in a John Ford
     film.  Formica's soldiers stop in their tracks, awed by the
     unfolding spectacle.  It looks like all of Insectopia has
     turned out: spiders, caterpillars, rhinoceros beetles, all
     manner of creatures crawling and flying have shown up, and
     now surround the army, dwarfing them.

                         WASP
               Are these hooligans giving you
               trouble, Z?

                         FLY
               Say the word, Z, and we kick their
               butts.

     The ant army remains frozen, unsure of what to do next.
     Formica is furious.  If ants had veins, Formica's would be
     bulging out of his face.

                         FORMICA
               What are you doing?!  ATTACK!!
                      (berating his army)
               Come on, you yellow-bellies!
                      (turning on Carpenter)
               Don't just stand there, Carpenter!
               Make an example of yourself!

                         CARPENTER
               Uh, actually, we are outnumbered
               sir...

     Formica turns towards the insects gathered against him.  With
     his chin raised pridefully, Formica steps forward, and
     CHARGES Z!

                         FORMICA
               AHHHHHHH!!

     Formica runs so quickly and with such force that his helmet
     blows off his head.  Z's eyes get big, he stumbles backwards,
     slipping, and Formica goes flying over him, toward the
     whirlpool behind.  He scrabbles at the edge of the water, and
     then tumbles over.

     For a moment, it looks as if he's gone.

                         FORMICA (O.S.)
               Help...help me...

     Z goes to the edge of the precipice and looks over.  Formica
     is struggling in the waters of the very flood he created,
     which are roiling not far below.  He looks up into Z's eyes,
     a new expression crossing his features: fear.

                         FORMICA
               Please...I...I can't swim...Help me...

     Formica goes under for a bit, then his head comes up again --
     but he's not going to be able to stay afloat for long...

     Suddenly he sees a line dropped down.  Above, Z looks down on
     him.

                         Z
               I thought you said that the life of
               one ant doesn't matter.

     Formica looks at the line...and in that moment seems to
     realize his error...

                         FORMICA
               I guess it does...to the ant.

     Formica reaches up and takes the line, and is pulled up by Z
     and a bunch of other ants (the line, we see, extends from a
     nearby spider, one of the cavalry from Insectopia).

     Formica is left, broken and alone, by the precipice, while
     HORDES OF ANTS surround Z to congratulate him.  Bala fights
     her way to his side and the two of them embrace.  Then the
     ants pick up Z and Bala, and, CHEERING, bear them away.

     Only Carpenter stays behind.  He walks up to Formica,
     carrying his dented and dusty helmet.  He cleans it the best
     he can with his jacket sleeve and hands it to his fallen
     general.

                         CARPENTER
               Sir, if it's any consolation, I still
               think you're completely worthless as
               an individual.

                                              FADE TO:

     CLOSE UP OF Z

     As he addresses the audience, stand-up style.

                         Z
               So, uh, that's pretty much it.  Just
               your basic "simple worker overthrows
               the government and winds up with the
               princess" kind of a story.
               You know: there was the big parade
               and everything...

                                              CUT TO:

     INT. TOWN CENTER - DAY

     A HUGE ASSEMBLY OF ANTS applauds as Z who is given a medal by
     the Queen.

                                              CUT TO:

     GENERAL FORMICA'S FACE, looking extremely dispeptic.

                         Z (V.O.)
               General Formica was almost
               unemployable.  He eventually got a
               gig as a honeydew keg.

     PULL BACK TO REVEAL Formica clinging to a wall, his belly
     hideously distended with honeydew.

                         Z (V.O.)
               The Queen asked me to take over his
               job, but I said "Sorry, but I'm
               really not the general type.  I'm
               more the specific type."  So they
               gave the job to Weaver instead.

                                              CUT TO:

     WEAVER, in Formica's old office, in a general's uniform, his
     feet up on Formica's desk, smoking a cigar.  Carpenter is on
     his hands and knees scrubbing the floor.

                         Z (V.O.)
               Weaver cut the defense budget in
               half.  Now we only have an army of
               five million.

     cut back to

     Z, ADDRESSING THE AUDIENCE.

                         Z
               And me, I guess you could say that I
               lived happily ever after.

     Bala enters the frame, embraces and kisses him.

                         Z
               I mean, I've got the whole package,
               right?  A great life, a beautiful
               wife, and a few kids.

                         BALA
               A few?

     WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL

     INT. Z'S HOUSE - DAY

     Z and Bala stand in the midst of their living room, up to
     their knees in THOUSANDS OF CHILD ANTS.  The children cover
     every horizontal surface.  They run around, cry, laugh, and
     tease each other.  Z looks around the room, looks back at us,
     and shrugs.

                         Z
               Well, so nothing's perfect.  But you
               know?  I wouldn't change a thing.

     The camera pulls up...and away from the ground...to reveal
     that this whole story has been taking place in a small area
     of CENTRAL PARK.  We pull back and back, and see all the
     familiar landmarks from the story: the bike path, the
     drinking fountain, etc.  We tilt up into the NEW YORK
     SKYLINE.  BIG MUSICAL FLOURISH.

     FADE OUT.

     THE END

                         Z (O.S.)
                      (over a dark screen)
               All my life, I've lived and worked in
               the big city...

     We see:

     EXT. AN ANT MOUND - DAY

     The camera swoops towards the entrance, then dives inside,
     past a couple of tough-looking soldier ants who stand at the
     gates of the ant colony like insect bouncers...into an access
     tunnel that snakes this way and that, past a row of ants
     plodding along...

     ...and into the MAIN CHAMBER of the colony, a huge, teeming
     vista that seems to stretch away forever, filled with ants
     rushing here and there on their business.  We see -- a
     "traffic cop" directing foot traffic, waving his arms like
     crazy so both sides move at once -- a column of soldier ants
     marching along in formation -- a chain of ants letting down
     a matchbox elevator filled with workers.

                         Z (V.O.)
               ...which is kind of a problem, since
               I've always felt uncomfortably in
               crowds.

     INT. MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR'S OFFICE - DAY

     We join Z, a worker ant with issues.  He's lying on a couch,
     recounting his woes.

                         Z
               I feel...isolated.  Different.  I've
               got abandonment issues.  My father
               flew away when I was just a larva.
               My mother didn't have much time for
               me...when you have five million
               siblings, it's difficult to get
               attention.
                      (pause)
               I feel physically inadequate -- I've
               never been able to lift more than ten
               times my own weight.  Sometimes I
               think I'm just not cut out to be a
               worker.  But I don't have any other
               options.  I was assigned to trade
               school when I was just a grub.  The
               whole system just...makes me
               feel...insignificant.

                         MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
                      (enthusiastic)
               Terrific!  You should feel
               insignificant!

     For the first time, we see the ant MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR.
     He's a mixture of Tony Robbins and Ron Popiel (the
     hyperactive late-night TV huckster, and founder of "Ronco").

                         Z
               ...I should?

                         MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
                      (hopping around
                       enthusiastically)
               YES!!!  You know, people ask me,
               "Doctor, why are you always happy?"
               And I tell them it's mind over
               matter.  I don't mind that I don't
               matter!  Do you get it?  Do you get
               it?

     Z gives a fake smile.

                         MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
                      (incredibly "up")
               Z, we're part of the fastest growing
               species in the whole world!

     The counsellor rolls down a chart from the wall.  An arrow
     shows ant population going up, up, up.

                         MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
               Ask me why we're so successful.

                         Z
               Why are we so successful?

                         MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
               I'm glad you asked me that question!

     The motivational counsellor opens some blinds...and we see a
     vista of the ant-filled chamber below.

                         MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
               What do you see out there?

                         Z
               ...Ants...

                         MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
               Right!  Ants!  Millions of creatures,
               each with his assigned task, all
               pulling together!

     Down below, we see a group of ants carrying a boulder up an
     incline.  One worker ants slips, and the boulder rolls down,
     crushing his leg.  The other ants rush over -- it looks like
     they're going to help their fallen comrade, but instead, they
     climb right over him, and pick up the boulder, continuing
     with their task.

                         MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
               You see?  Being an ant is being able
               to say, "Hey -- I'm meaningless,
               you're meaningless."

                         Z
               But -- but I've always felt life was
               about finding meaning...and then
               sharing it with someone special,
               someone you love.

     The motivational counsellor puts his arm on Z's shoulder...he
     seems to understand...

                         MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
               Z...you need help.
                      (looking at a clock)
               Whoops!  We're gonna have to stop
               there.  Your minute is up!

     The counsellor ushers Z out of his seat and towards the door.

                         MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
               Now back to work!  We've made real
               progress!  Remember -- let's be
               best superorganism we can be!

     INT. EARLY MEGA-TUNNEL - DAY

     A gigantic tunnel, with the size and scale of the "Chunnel".
     A banner strung overhead reads: "The Mega-Tunnel -- Tunneling
     Our Way to a Bright Future!"  Along the walls hang 50's work-
     incentive style posters with messages like, "You asked for
     it, you got it -- more work!" and "TWO MEALS A WEEK IS
     ENOUGH!!!"  Line after line of ants is working on the tunnel,
     digging, passing clumps of dirt from ant to ant, everyone
     synchronized.

     CLOSE on a clump of DIRT being passed from hand to hand.
     PULL OUT TO REVEAL

     AZTECA, a feisty, cynical, female worker ant, who stands
     there, waiting to pass the dirt on.  Z is daydreaming behind
     her, with clumps of dirt starting to pile up in front of him.

                         AZTECA
               Hello?!  Earth to Z!  You better snap
               out of it, or there's gonna be a lot
               of pissed off ants!

     Z looks back, and sees the ants behind staring at him angrily.

                         Z
                      (snapping out of it)
               Sorry Azteca.  Here you go, fellas!
               Fresh dirt!  Alley oop!
                      (looking at the dirt)
               Shouldn't we be wearing gloves?  I
               mean this dirt is very...dirty.
               Doesn't anyone think of hygiene?
                      (Z's stomach growls)
               Boy am I hungry.  I'm so hungry I'm
               seeing double.  It looks like there's
               two million ants in here.  When's
               lunch?  Tomorrow, or the day after?

                         AZTECA
                      (sweetly)
               Z, old pal...
                      (shouts)
               SHUT UP!!!  It's bad enough there's
               a food shortage without you
               complaining about it every day.

                         Z
               The squeaky wheel gets the oil.

                         AZTECA
               No, Z.  The squeaky wheel gets thrown
               away, alright?  You're a good ant, Z,
               even though you are a pain in my rear-
               segment.  I don't wanna see
               anything happen to you.  So quit
               mouthing off, before you get in
               trouble.

     A WHISTLE BLOWS.

                         Z
               Thank goodness.  Breaktime.

     All the ants put down their tools.  A beat.  Then the WHISTLE
     BLOWS AGAIN.  All the ants pick up their tools again.

                         AZTECA
                      (resigned)
               Break's over.

                         Z
                      (getting back to work)
               This colony needs another tunnel like
               a hole in the ground.  Why are we
               even digging this thing?

                         AZTECA
               Who cares, Z.  All I know is, we
               gotta dig.  We're not the ones in
               charge.

     INT. TOWN CENTER - DAY

     The huge, spacious main chamber of the colony.  Looming over
     the scene is the royal palace, which seems to be
     inaccessible, perched on top of a hill-like pedestal.

     Around the base of the pedestal, a crew of workers loiters,
     seemingly aimlessly...can these be the only unemployed ants
     in the place?

                         GENERAL FORMICA
               STAIRS!

     The workers look up and GROAN.  Then they start forming a
     stairway with their own bodies, linking arms, stepping on
     each other's shoulders.  It's extremely unpleasant work.  One
     ant is a little tardy, and just manages to get in place
     before...

     GENERAL FORMICA, the Pattonesque military leader of the
     colony, STEPS ON HIS HEAD, using it as the first step as he
     ascends to the palace, his aide-de-camp Carpenter in tow.  As
     Formica mounts the "stairs"  we can hear the workers going,
     "OUCH!  OOF!  YIKES!" etc.

                         GENERAL FORMICA
               Cut the chit-chat down there!
                      (turning to Carpenter)
               We've spoiled these workers,
               Carpenter.  They've never had it so
               good, and listen to them -- always
               grumbling and complaining...

     Formica steps on the foot of one of the "stairway" ants, who
     muffles a yelp.

                         CARPENTER
               ...Yes, sir.

                         GENERAL FORMICA
               What have they got to complain about?
               Three square meals a day...

                         CARPENTER
               Actually, sir, we've cut them down to
               three roughly rectangular meals a
               week.

                         FORMICA
               Don't give me statistics, Carpenter.
               I know what I'm talking about.  DOORS!

     Formica and Carpenter have reached the top of the staircase.
     There, the two guard ants on either side of the massive
     throne room doors pull them open -- and one door hinge
     SQUEAKS.

                         FORMICA
                      (to guard ant, while
                       passing)
               Oil that, soldier.

     INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY

     The QUEEN is on her throne, her huge abdomen sprawled behind
     her.

                         QUEEN
               Ah!  General Formica.

     Formica salutes and marches to her, Carpenter behind him.

     Note:  Throughout this scene, the Queen is giving birth
     repeatedly.  Each birth is accompanied by a herald playing a
     short "Happy Birthday" fanfare on his trumpet.  Mid-wife ants
     bring each baby to the Queen for inspection, who COOS a few
     words.  The midwives put the babies on a moving bassinet-
     line, powered by ants on a treadmill.

                         QUEEN
               General, the severe food shortage
               that faces the colony...pains me.
               The thought of any of my children
               going hungry...
                      (she shudders; then,
                       to baby)
               Who's the cutest widdle worker?  You
               are!  Yes, you!  Don't forget to
               brush your teeth!
                      (to mid-wife)
               Ship 'er out.
                      (back to Formica)
               What steps are you taking to remedy
               the situation?

                         FORMICA
               We are launching a major offensive to
               expand our foraging territory...

                         QUEEN
               Yes, what else?

                         FORMICA
               Please don't worry, your majesty.
               Leave the worrying to me.  As you
               know, I'm not an ant of half-
               measures.  I don't pussyfoot around.
               This crisis is my number one
               priority, and I promise you it's
               being dealt with swiftly, and
               decisively.

     The Queen's attention is interrupted by another baby being
     put in her arms.

                         QUEEN
                      (to baby)
               No snacking between meals!  Off you
               go!
                      (to Formica)
               Now -- what were we saying?

                         FORMICA
                      (Oliver North-style)
               I do not recollect, your majesty.
               Will that be all?

                         QUEEN
               Yes, General Formica.  Carry on, my
               good man!  I don't know what we would
               do without you.

     Formica clicks his heels and bows his head.  Carpenter bows
     low.  Formica smartly about faces --

                         BALA (O.S.)
               General Formica!

     PRINCESS BALA hurries through a second doorway, carrying a
     swatch book.  Something about her sets her apart from the
     HANDMAIDEN ANTS with her.  Her tiara, probably.

     Formica tilts his head quizzically to Carpenter behind him.

                         CARPENTER
                      (sotto)
               Princess Bala, sir.  Your fiancee.

                         FORMICA
               Princess!  You look -- outstanding.
               Is there anything I can do for you?

                         BALA
               Well -- I thought -- since we're
               getting married...it might be nice if
               we...got to know one another.

     Formica looks confused.

                         QUEEN
               Bala has always been a hopeless
               romantic, General.

                         BALA
               It's just that -- well, I'm honored
               that you selected me, and everything,
               I just thought the marriage might go
               a little more smoothly if -- we had
               a conversation?

                         FORMICA
                      (uncomfortable)
               Conversation...yes...well...
                      (to Carpenter)
               Wasn't she briefed?

                         QUEEN
                      (holding up a baby)
               Look, General!  A darling baby
               soldier!
                      (emotionally, to baby)
               Don't try to be a hero!  Just make
               sure you come back in one piece!
                      (handing it off)
               Next!

                         FORMICA
                      (using the
                       interruption)
               I'll take your suggestion under
               advisement, Princess.  In the
               meanwhile --

     Formica turns to go.

                         BALA
               General -- we have to talk sometime!

                         FORMICA
               Very well.  Carpenter, is there a
               convenient time to talk vis-a-vis:
               relationship?

                         CARPENTER
               Actually, sir, we're ahead of
               schedule.  We have thirty-six seconds
               available right now.

                         FORMICA
               Outstanding.  Princess...?

     Bala's a little fazed...but grabs her chance.

                         BALA
               So, um...how was your day?  What did
               you do?

                         FORMICA
                      (scouring his mind)
               Well...
                      (that's it!)
               I declared war!

                         BALA
                      (sadly)
               Oh...and I was afraid we had nothing
               in common...

                         CARPENTER
                      (under his breath)
               Fourteen-fifty hours, sir.

                         FORMICA
               Duty calls!

     He strides across the floor.  Bala watches him go, her
     antennae drooping unhappily.

                         FORMICA
               No squeak.  Outstanding!

     We see through the now-open doors into the throne-room as
     Formica and Carpenter double-time out of the frame.

     The Queen sees that Bala is unhappy.

                         QUEEN
                      (sympathetically)
               I felt the same way before I got
               married.  Confused.  Scared.

                         BALA
                      (hopefully)
               You did?

                         QUEEN
               Yes -- but I did my duty and sorted
               out all those messy feelings.  The
               wonderful thing about ant life is
               that everything is arranged.  Even
               marriage.  You're lucky -- General
               Formica is a paragon of anthood.

                         BALA
                      (unconvinced)
               Yes...he's wonderful...

     The doors swing shut on them -- revealing the two guard ants
     who were CRUSHED in the wake of Formica's exit.

     INT. BALA'S QUARTERS - DAY

     Bala enters, followed by her handmaidens, who are in a state
     of giggling infatuation over Formica.  Bala is scowling as
     she leafs through a wedding catalogue.

                         HANDMAIDEN #1
                      (swooning over
                       General Formica)
               The General's body segments are
               so...symmetrical.

                         HANDMAIDEN #2
                      (giggling)
               I'd let him order me into battle
               anyday.

     Bala hurls the swatch book against the wall.

                         HANDMAIDEN #1
               Princess?  What's wrong?

                         BALA
               Wrong?  How could anything be wrong?
               I'm going to marry General Formica
               and be a queen and have millions of
               babies, just like my mom.
                      (concerned)
               Do I look fat to you?

                         HANDMAIDEN #2
                      (knowingly, to
                       Handmaiden #2)
               Pre-wedding jitters.

                         HANDMAIDEN #1
               You just need to blow off some steam.
               Let's go to the bar at the Royal Club!

                         BALA
               The Club's so stuffy.  I want to try
               someplace different.

                         HANDMAIDEN #2
               There isn't anyplace else --
                      (making a joke)
               Except the worker bar.

                         BALA
               The worker bar!  Yes!  That's where
               I want to go!

     The handmaidens look shocked.

                         HANDMAIDEN #1
               But -- we can't -- there'll be
               workers there.

     INT. ANT BAR - NIGHT

     A long bar filled with ants.  The bar itself seems to stretch
     for miles, and there are hundreds of ants trying to get a
     drink...unfortunately, there's only one bartender.  Z is at
     the bar with WEAVER, a burly ant soldier.

                         Z
               We declared war again?
                      (off Weaver's nod)
               Are you scared?

                         WEAVER
                      (shrugs)
               I'll be back.

     The BARTENDER, a grizzled veteran, slaps down what looks like
     a couple of large green beer mugs.  Actually, they're aphids,
     little green critters he fills up from a number of kegs
     hanging from the ceiling.  The kegs are specialized ants with
     hugely distended stomachs, which spray liquid into the aphids.

                         APHIDS
                      (as they're slapped
                       on bar)
               Ouch!  Ouch!

                         BARTENDER
               Two aphid beers.

                         Z
                      (as Bartender leaves)
               Did you see that?  How he gave you
               the beers, not me?  I'm telling you,
               he's got something against workers.

                         WEAVER
               I don't know what you're talking
               about, Z.

                         Z
               Come on -- everybody dumps on us
               workers.  You soldiers get all the
               glory.  Plus you get to go out into
               the world, meet interesting insects,
               and kill them.

                         WEAVER
               Yeah, but you get to spend all day
               with those fabulous worker babes.

     We can see that Weaver is eyeing a nearby table of "Worker
     Babes", including Z's friend Azteca.

                         Z
               Weaver, they're career girls.
               They're obsessed with digging.
                      (sighs)
               No, I'll probably never meet the girl
               for me.

                         WEAVER
               Who said there was a girl for you?
               I was talking about a girl for me.
                      (quaffing his aphid
                       beer)
               Don't you want your aphid beer?

                         Z
               I can't help it.  I have a thing
               about drinking from the anus of
               another creature.  Call me crazy.

                         WEAVER
               Z, we've known each other a long
               time, right?

                         Z
               Of course.  You were born two seconds
               after me.

                         WEAVER
               And all the time I've known you,
               you've been grumping and groaning.
               You should quit making waves.  Go
               with the flow.

                         Z
               Weaver, I'm an insect, not a liquid.

     Down the bar, there's a commotion.  A grizzled old SCOUT ant
     has had too much to drink.

                         DRUNK SCOUT
               Have you been to Insectopia?  Have
               you?  No, ya goddam larvas!  But I
               have...
                      (becoming emotional)
               ...Mosquitos n' caterpillars n'
               beetles -- all livin' in peace,
               stuffin their guts with food...No
               rules, no regulations...you can be
               your own ant there...
                      (howling drunkenly)
               It's Insectopia!  Insectopia!

                         Z
               Hey, Weaver, listen!

                         DRUNK SCOUT
               I was cut off from my unit -- found
               it by mistake --
                      (slurring)
               It changed my life!
                      (spraying another
                       soldier with saliva)
               You see -- ya follow the great yellow
               egg, and you come to the land of red
               and white --

                         SOLDIERS
               You've had enough for one night!
               Come on, Gramps, before you get in
               trouble.

     The soldiers pull him from the bar, carrying him out.

                         Z
                      (excited)
               Hey, did you hear what he said?!

                         WEAVER
               Poor guy's had one too many scouting
               missions.

     MUSIC STARTS UP.

     INT. ANT BAR ENTRANCE - NIGHT

     Princess Bala is peering in at the entrance to the ant bar,
     accompanied by her worried-looking handmaidens.

                         HANDMAIDEN #2
               We shouldn't be doing this -- it
               isn't proper!

                         BALA
               I'm the Princess, aren't I?

                         HANDMAIDEN #2
               Of course --

                         BALA
               And do Princesses do improper things?

                         HANDMAIDEN #2
               Of course not --

                         BALA
               Then if I go to the worker bar, it
               isn't improper.  Anyway, don't worry.
               No one will recognize us in our
               disguises.

     She adjusts her "disguise", a hardhat, tied down Jackie O.-
     style with an ant's version of a Chanel scarf.

                         BALA
               I'm just a common worker, cooling off
               after a rough day!

     Music starts.  An ant BARKER takes the mic at one end of the
     dance floor.

                         BARKER
                      (on loudspeaker)
               Okay, folks.  It's six-fifteen, and
               that means it's time to dance.

     Every ant gets up to dance.  Weaver turns to Z.

                         WEAVER
                      (draining his beer)
               Time to cut a rug, Z!

                         Z
               I'm not in the mood.
                      (disgusted)
               Even when they're off work, they
               follow orders.

                         WEAVER
               Well, you just sit here and be a
               party-pooper.

     Weaver joins the rest of the ants who are lining up for the
     dance.  The Barker calls out the steps in a bored monotone --
     all the ants already know the steps.  Everyone dances in
     perfect synch.

                         BARKER
                      (southern twang)
               And a left-right-quarterstep-back
               step-halfstep -- a left-right-
               quarterstep-backstep-halfstep --
               a left-right-quarterstep-backstep
               halfstep --

     AT THE ENTRANCE, Bala smiles mischievously at her handmaidens.

                         BALA
               I'm going to ask one of these
               mindless, primitive worker-types to
               dance with me!

                         HANDMAIDEN #1
               But General Formica would be furious!

                         BALA
                      (enjoying the idea)
               I know.

     The handmaidens are appalled.  Bala whirls away from them,
     sets her sights and searches the crowd -- zeroing in on --

     Z, who's watching the other ants dance.

                         Z
               What a bunch of losers.  Mindless
               zombies capitulating to an oppressive
               system --

                         BALA
               Wanna dance?

     Bala's standing right there.  Z is instantly smitten.

                         Z
               Me?!  Yes!!!  I mean --
                      (regaining suavosity)
               Just let me finish my beer.

     Not breaking eye contact with Bala, Z smiles suavely.
     Reaches suavely for a beer.  Suavely grabs the candle in a
     glass jar off the bar.  Suavely singes his face.

     He plays it off with a rakish little laugh.  A bit
     apprehensive, Bala heads onto the floor.  Z follows her.

                         Z
               So uh -- how come I haven't seen you
               around here before?

                         BALA
                      (covering up)
               I work in the palace, I don't get out
               much.

                         Z
               The palace, hunh?  I bet those royals
               really live it up.  Of course they're
               all a little, you know, from
               inbreeding --

                         BALA
                      (shocked)
               What?

     Z and Bala step onto the dance floor with the rest of the
     ants, but Z can't do any of the steps.

                         Z
               Now, let's see, I -- it's been a
               while since I -- I think you --

     Bala watches Z, trying to follow along.  It's the blind
     leading the blind, as Z tries in vain to follow the barker's
     rapid instructions.

                         Z
               Here, I'll lead.

     Z starts doing his own, individual dance.  With a suave
     expression on his face, he leads Bala in a helter-skelter
     mixture-of Tango, Charleston, and hand-jive.

                         BALA
               Are you sure this is a real dance?

                         Z
               Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of
               making it up --

                         BALA
                      (surprised)
               Really?

                         Z
               Why should everyone dance the same
               way?  It's as exciting as watching
               fungus grow.

                         BALA
               You're right!

                         Z
                      (surprised)
               You -- you think I'm right?

                         BALA
               Why can't I just do whatever I want
               to do?  Why can't I just go wild?!
               Yahoo!

     Bala starts to get into it, making up her own steps in reply
     to Z's, loosening up, having fun.  For a moment, the two of
     them are actually sexy together.  Then they get a little too
     wild -- and the other ants, who are still doing their
     intricate dance, start to collide with Bala and Z.  Z almost
     knocks over a big soldier ant.  We can only see the ant's
     back at the moment.

                         SOLDIER
               Hey!  Watch your step, worker.

     Z has turned around to see the soldier ant, MAJOR MANDIBLE,
     glaring at him.  Mandible is about twice Z's size.  He's got
     one eye missing, and half of his left antenna his been chewed
     off.

                         BALA
               You watch yours, soldier, or my
               worker friend will beat you up!

                         Z
                      (terrified)
               Oh, that's okay, I'll let him off
               this time.
                      (whispering to Bala)
               Are you crazy?  This guy's built like
               a pebble!
                      (ineptly trying to
                       placate the soldier)
               You know they do great prosthetic
               antennas nowadays --

                         BALA
               Aren't you gonna stand up for
               yourself?

     Z's caught between a rock and a hard place.  He doesn't want
     to get beaten up, but on the other hand, he doesn't want to
     lose face in front of Bala.  More soldiers have gathered
     around, looking hostile.

                         SOLDIER
               How come you don't dance like the
               rest of us?

     Z glances over at Bala.  Then, shaking with nervousness, he
     says defiantly...

                         Z
               Because -- because I'm an individual!

                         SOLDIER #2
               An individual?  Never heard of it.

                         MANDIBLE
               You look like a worker to me.

                         WEAVER
               Hey, lay off my little buddy!

     Z, meanwhile, looks far away, ecstatic, as if he's just
     realized something very important.  Unfortunately, just at
     this moment, A soldier pushes Weaver...Weaver pushes him
     back...somebody makes a dive for Z -- and before you know it,
     there's a regular bar brawl going on, with Weaver in the
     middle of it, cracking heads together, punching ants in the
     face, having a great time.  Just then, the Princess'
     handmaidens hurries over.

                         HANDMAIDEN #1
               Princess Bala!  Princess Bala!

     Z, who's scrabbling around on the floor, overhears.

                         Z
               Princess?  You're a Princess?

                         HANDMAIDEN #2
               The police are coming!

                         BALA
               Uh oh.
                      (to Z)
               Goodbye!  Gotta run!

                         Z
               Wait!  When can I see you again?

                         BALA
               Let me think.  Hmmnn...
                      (thinks)
               Never.  Bye!

     Bala rushes off with her handmaiden, just before a squad of
     whistle-blowing POLICE wade into the crowd.

                         Z
               Wait!  Princess!  Wait!

     But she's already gone, leaving Z holding her scarf.

                                              CUT TO:

     INT. DORMITORY - THE NEXT DAY

     Z is talking to Weaver, who's getting ready to go off to war.
     Nearby, columns of ant soldiers march by.

                         WEAVER
               Get real, Z!  She just dropped the
               scarf by accident!

                         Z
               Are you kidding?  There were sparks
               between us!  This scarf is a sign!

                         WEAVER
               It's a sign that you're crazy!  Do
               you know what the penalty for
               impersonating a soldier is?

                         Z
               What's gonna go wrong?!  I take your
               place for the royal inspection.  Bala
               comes strolling down the line, she
               sees me -- bingo!  Love is rekindled,
               and she takes me up to the palace for
               a little...
                      (wags his eyebrows
                       suggestively)
               tea and crumpets... and you take your
               place again, and go march around to
               your heart's content!

     Weaver looks unconvinced.

                         Z
               You have to help me.  Please, Weaver.
               Think of all the things I've done for
               you!

                         WEAVER
                      (thinks)
               I can't think of any.

                         Z
                      (pause)
               Well I'm gonna start doing things for
               you...

                         WEAVER
               Will you introduce me to some worker
               girls?

                         Z
               You bet!  They'll really go for a
               sensitive guy like you!

                         WEAVER
               Maybe I'll get lucky.
                      (Weaver thinks about
                       it)
               You know, Z, I wouldn't do this
               for anyone but you...

     Weaver hands Z has helmet.

                         WEAVER
               Wear this.

                         Z
                      (overjoyed)
               You're a real buddy.

                         WEAVER
                      (sourly)
               Yeah, I know.

                         Z
               What do I do?

                         WEAVER
               Don't tell anyone you're a worker.
               Follow that column over there.  And
               come right back after the inspection!

     Weaver points to a bunch of soldiers hurrying by in formation.

                         Z
                      (overjoyed)
               Thanks!  I owe you!

     Z skips off and joins the column, marching in time with the
     soldiers but too excited to keep from jazzing it up a little.

     INT. TOWN CENTER - NIGHT

     The ant army has gathered in a huge HALL in front of a
     reviewing stand.  We can hear the murmuring of thousands of
     soldiers -- but all we can see is a HUGE POSTER of an ant
     General pointing right at the camera.  The poster reads,
     "GENERAL FORMICA WANTS YOU -- to obey".

     Z turns to some of the soldiers near him.

                         Z
               Any of you guys know when the
               Princess will show up?  She's kind of
               a personal friend.

     The soldiers look at Z like he's nuts.

                         LOUD VOICE
               ATTEN-SHUN!

     MARTIAL MUSIC sounds, and we hear thousands of ant feet as
     they snap to attention.  Z imitates the soldiers awkwardly.

     GENERAL FORMICA struts to the middle 6f the screen, slapping
     his thigh with a swagger stick (the antenna of some
     unfortunate insect)

                         FORMICA
               First of all, let me make one thing
               clear.  Nobody ever won a battle by
               thinking for himself.  All this
               "thinking" stuff is a load of crap.
               If the almighty had wanted you boys
               to think, he wouldn't have given you
               huge mandibles and a brain so small
               you'd misplace it if it wasn't
               trapped inside your head.

     In the audience, Z starts laughing -- he thinks Formica's
     just made a joke.

                         Z
                      (slapping his thigh)
               "Trapped inside your head" -- that's
               a good one --

     Z notices nobody else is laughing.  He stops.

                         Z
               Geez -- tough room.

     From the stage, Formica is squinting at the audience, trying
     to make out who was laughing, but there are just too many
     ants.  He continues.

                         FORMICA
                      (striding back and
                       forth)
               We ants survive as a species because
               we do what we're told.  We survive
               because we work together, as one, we
               get the job done, we do whatever it
               takes to persevere!
                      (dramatic pause)
               Hell, we're not an army of
               ants...we're one giant ant, with
               giant fists, and giant jaws!

     The soldiers CHEER!  Z CHEERS along with the rest of them.

                         Z
                      (to the soldier ant
                       next to him)
               Lays it on a little thick, doesn't
               he?  If you ask me, he's one giant
               bore.

                         FORMICA
               Now I've heard a lot of scuttlebutt
               about a food shortage.  Well you boys
               are gonna be taken care of.  But in
               the meantime we're gonna eat the
               enemy for breakfast, we are gonna
               eat the enemy for lunch, and we are
               gonna eat the enemy for dinner!

                         Z
               Geez, and I forgot my toothbrush.

                         FORMICA
                      (reflective moment)
               Dammit, I'm proud to be an ant.
                      (he looks out at his
                       army)
               And I know each and every one of you
               boys will do your duty.  Dismissed.

     Z applauds and whistles as the other ants look at him in
     confusion.

                         Z
                      (clapping)
               Bravo!  Bring on the Princess!

                         COLONEL
               Stow the gab there, soldier!  Let's
               move 'em out!

     The soldiers turn to the right and start to march out past
     the reviewing stand.

     A COLONEL marches at the head of Z's column as Z looks around
     for the Princess.

                         COLONEL
               Eyes...left!

     Finally, as Z's part of the army marches past the end of the
     reviewing stand, he sees her, looking bored, standing next
     to the Queen, who is giving the royal wave.

                         Z
                      (waving)
               Princess!  Princess Bala!  Hey!  It's
               me!  Z!  I've got your scarf!

     ON THE REVIEWING STAND, Bala sees Z -- that is to say, she
     sees one of the thousands upon thousands of ants marching
     by...

                         BALA
                      (peering out)
               Who is that idiot?

                         QUEEN
               Darling, you must encourage the
               troops -- wave!

     Bala waves unenthusiastically, little more than flopping her
     hand back and forth on her wrist.

     Down below, Z takes this as a sign that Bala has seen him.

                         Z
                      (excited)
               Excuse me, guys -- That's my date.
               Well, it's been fun.  Have a great
               war!

     Z tries to squeeze his way back towards the royals, but he's
     surrounded by a solid wall of soldiers -- and they're
     carrying him along with them.

                         Z
               Hey!  Wait!

     Z loses sight of the Princess as he's carried away.
     BARBATUS, a hard-as-nails "grunt" soldier ant, taps Z on the
     shoulder.

                         BARBATUS
               You new, kid?

                         Z
               I just joined up.  But I'm quitting!
               I got a trial membership!

                         BARBATUS
               Trial membership?  Kid, when you join
               this ant's army, you're in for the
               full hitch.

     At that moment, Z is swept out of the cramped corridor
     they've been marching along, as the army emerges into the
     OPEN AIR outside of the colony.

     EXT. ANT MOUND - NIGHT

     It's a starry, moonlit night.  The shadows crowd around the
     panicked Z, who looks up at the sky as we see the army on the
     march...

                         Z
               Wait a minute, there's been a
               mistake!  I've got to get back to the
               colony!

     Z starts to fall out of line, but Barbatus, looking
     concerned, stops him.

                         BARBATUS
               Are you crazy, kid?  They shoot
               deserters!

     Z swallows hard.

                         BARBATUS
               You just stick by old Barbatus.
               He'll watch out for you.
                      (off Z's look)
               Whatsamatter, kid?  Leave a girl
               behind?

                         Z
               Yeah.  Well -- no.  She's kind of
               playing hard to get.  As a matter of
               fact, she's playing completely
               unattainable.
                      (nervously)
               So, what's on the schedule?  A brisk
               walk?  a foraging expedition?

                         BARBATUS
               No -- we're going to attack the
               termites!

                         Z
                      (alarmed)
               Attack?  But -- I hate attacking!
               It's so hostile!

     Around Z and Barbatus, the ants start up a marching song,
     which we intersperse with dialogue between Barbatus and Z to
     form a montage/time-cut as the ant army marches on to the
     termite capital.

                         ANT SOLDIERS
                      (to the tune of "When
                       Johnny Comes
                       Marching Home")
               We ants go marching one by
               one, hurrah, hurrah!  We slaughter
               termites just for fun, Hurrah!
               Hurrah!

                         Z
               So -- these termites, they're little,
               shy, retiring insects?

                         BARBATUS
                      (grim smile)
               No such luck.  Those dirty terms are
               five times bigger than us, and they
               shoot acid from their foreheads!

                         SOLDIER ANTS
               We ants go marching two by two,
               hurrah!  Hurrah!  We'll all be dead
               before we're through, hurrah!  Hurrah!

     Montage shots of an ant column marching diagonally across the
     screen, fading into another column marching diagonally
     downwards across the screen...

                         Z
               Well, what exactly does our platoon
               do?  Serve beverages?  Process
               paperwork?

                         BARBATUS
               Our platoon has the best assignment
               of all.  We're the first into battle!

                         ANT SOLDIERS
               We ants are marching three by three,
               hurrah!  Hurrah!  Dead ants is what
               we soon will be, hurrah!  Hurrah!

     ...montage shot of Z's column crossing a bridge composed of
     living ants -- all of whom look extremely uncomfortable as
     they're getting stepped on...

                         Z
               So we're going back for more armor,
               right?  I mean, these guys are from
               outer space, how are we supposed to
               beat them?!

                         BARBATUS
               Superior numbers, kid!

     EXT. TERRAIN NEAR TERMITE STUMP - NIGHT

     Z looks up to see...looming high above them...the TERMITE
     CITY, which is built in the stump of a dead tree.  From here
     it looks like a demonic Mount Fuji.  The COLONEL ANT shouts
     an order.

                         COLONEL
               ATTAAAAAAAAACK!!!

     The front line of ants starts rushing towards the termite
     colony...Z is swept along...

                         BARBATUS
               Over the TOOOOOOOOOOOOO-OP!!!

     Z is swept along and up the side of the stump as thousands of
     ants invade the colony through every possible entrance.
     Up...over the lip of the stump...and down inside, to the very
     middle of the termite colony...

     Into a disquietingly peaceful scene.   They're in the middle
     of the hollowed-out trunk, and ants keep pouring in -- but
     there's not a termite to be seen.  Barbatus looks around
     suspiciously.

                         BARBATUS
               It's too damn quiet.

     Then we hear a strange tapping noise.  Barbatus looks over,
     and sees that Z's teeth are chattering with fear.

                         BARBATUS
               Don't be scared, kid.  Barbatus's
               got yer back.

                         Z
                      (petrified)
               Maybe they went out for the evening.
               Let's leave them a message and head
               home.

                         COLONEL
                      (ignoring him)
               Light it up!

     A nearby soldier ant take a firefly out of his knapsack and
     pinches him.  The firefly, yelling "Yipe!  Yipe!  Yipe!",
     shoots into the air like a flare, lighting up the interior of
     the stump with eery, shifting luminescence.

     Then we notice, hollowed into the inside of the stump like
     innumerable pockmarks, termite holes staring out upon the
     stump...and, with an unearthly ROAR, we see the first of
     hundreds of termites emerging to pour into the center of the
     tree, right onto the ant army.

                         COLONEL
               They're here!!!

                         BARBATUS
                      (to Z)
               Keep your head down!

     Within moments, Z finds himself in the middle of a
     BLOODBATH.  The ants have broken into the colony, but are
     taking heavy losses from the gigantic, blind, acid-spewing
     termites.  The battle scene is as sprawling and chaotic as
     something out of Braveheart. In a few QUICK SHOTS from Z's
     perspective, we see:

     -- A squad of ants rushes towards a termite soldier, but are
     literally melted into smoking heaps of flesh by a jet of acid
     from its forehead...

     -- A termite warrior is overwhelmed by a crowd of ants and is
     pulled to pieces with hideous ripping sounds...

     -- Another termite warrior takes on an ant soldier one on one
     and slowly crushes his head in his huge jaws...

                         Z
                      (looking around)
               Guys!  Guys!  It isn't too late for
               all of us to just talk this over!

     Just then, a termite burst up from the ground and turns to
     face Z.  Z is dwarfed by this hulking, roaring, drooling
     monstrosity.

                         Z
               Wait!  Please!  Acid makes me come
               out in spots!  -- Could I just say I
               have always had the greatest respect
               for your species?  I mean, eating
               wood -- why didn't I think of that?
               I --

     The termite rears, getting ready to melt Z, when OOF! he's
     knocked backwards by...

                         Z
               BARBATUS!  You -- you saved my life!

                         BARBATUS
               Don't get all sappy about it!

     As Barbatus and some other soldiers kill the termite, the
     Colonel strides up to Z, puffing on a cigar.

                         COLONEL
               I love the smell of formic acid in
               the morning.

                         Z
               Look out!

     A stream of termite acid engulfs the colonel, instantly
     burning him to a cinder clutching a still-burning cigar; Z's
     paratroop buddies turn in terror to see a herd of termites
     rumbling towards them.  Z, terrified, dives into the hole
     that the huge termite made...

     INT. TERMITE TUNNEL - NIGHT

     ...and tumbles headlong into a corridor of the termite mound.
     The corridors here are primitive, caveman-like, pocked with
     jagged access holes.

     No sooner has Z landed in the tunnel than a termite comes
     burrowing out from one of the side walls, snapping at Z's
     head.  Z just avoids getting decapitated, and digs straight
     through the wall in order to escape...

     INT. TERMITE QUEEN'S CHAMBER - NIGHT

     ...straight into the hub of the entire termite complex -- the
     Queen's chamber.  This is nothing like the civilized court of
     the ant colony -- it's a huge, stinking, fetid dungeon whose
     walls are held up by one massive (to Z) column of piled
     stones.

     The termite queen, a repulsive, slimy, squirming, foot-long
     monster, is attended by a crew of diminutive, blind termite
     nurses.  The queen turns to look Z right in the eye.

                         Z
               Excuse me.  I seem to be lost, and I
               was wondering if you could give me --

     Before Z can say, "directions", the queen gives out a
     piercing, blood-curdling shriek.  The nurses start shrieking
     too.

                         Z
                      (backing away)
               I'll let myself out.

     But the queen's shriek has summoned a soldier termite -- the
     biggest one we've seen yet -- who is charging headlong at Z,
     jaws snapping open and shut like huge scissors.

                         Z
                      (backing away)
               Shoo! -- Torro!  Torro!

     At the last moment, Z jumps out of the way -- and the termite
     runs headfirst into the supporting column of the chamber.  As
     if on a spring release, the termite's jaws clamp shut -- and
     shatter the base of the column.  The walls of the room begin
     to rumble...

     The termite turns to eat Z...but is crushed by a stone
     falling from the ceiling, which gives a final shudder and
     collapses, raining earth and stones down on the queen.

     As the walls of the chamber crumble, melees of ants and
     termites pour into the room from the corridors around and
     above...they keep struggling until...

                         ANT OFFICER
                      (points at Z)
               He's killed their Queen!

                         Z
               Hey, I'm sorry, it was a mistake --

                         ANT OFFICER
               VICTORY!!!

     We can see that the termite warriors, deprived of their
     leader, are suddenly confused and directionless, easy prey
     for the ants.

                         Z
                      (facetious)
               This is terrific!   Let's exact
               crippling war reparations!  Let's set
               up a puppet government!

                         ANT OFFICER
               Let's slaughter them all!

     The ants set about killing the disoriented termites when...we
     hear another rumble coming from the outside...the ants look
     up confusedly...

     ...And a (from the ant's point of view) five-hundred foot
     long tongue bursts through the top of the chamber with a
     CRASH.  The ten or so ants standing directly below are
     smashed by the tongue, which squirts out a spray of saliva
     around the crater.  As quick as it appeared, the tongue
     retracts, with a hideous SLUUURPING sound.  We can now see
     the end of the snout of an ant-eater poking through a hole in
     the ceiling high above...

                         ANT OFFICER
               INCOMING!

     The tongue comes down again, smashing some more ants, whose
     bodies are slurped up by the tongue...the ants scatter, but
     to no avail, as the tongue comes smashing down again and
     again...

     Z heads into a side corridor as the tongue smashes down
     again, barely missing him!

     Z retreats along the corridor as the tongue searches for him,
     across the tunnel from intersecting access-tunnels, getting
     closer and closer to Z, dragging more and more screaming ants
     and struggling termites...

     ....Then the tongue disappears.  Silence.  Z wipes his brow...

     And we hear a thunderous SNIFFING noise as the anteater
     searches for more prey... and the tongue starts rumbling down
     the corridor right towards Z, the tip squirming as it
     ricochets along the walls!

     Z gets up and runs, the tongue lapping towards him,
     reminiscent of the stone sphere that nearly crushed Indiana
     Jones in Raiders of the Lost Ark!  The walls disintegrate
     under the pressure of the tongue, which gets closer to
     Z...closer...

     ...and just misses him as Z tumbles out of the stump and down
     to the ground...Z sits there, dazed, as we see the huge form
     of the anteater withdraw its tongue and, with a final
     contented burp, shuffle off into the distance.

     EXT. TERMITE STUMP - MORNING

     Z makes his way across the corpse-strewn battlefield, an
     expression of horror on his face.

                         BARBATUS (O.S.)
               Z!  Over here!

                         Z
                      (hopeful)
               Barbatus?

     Z looks down at his feet, where Barbatus's still-living,
     decapitated head is looking up at him.

                         Z
                      (shocked)
               Barbatus!

                         BARBATUS
               Be honest, kid -- am I hurt bad?

                         Z
               No, no, you're...lookin' good.
               You've got good color in your cheeks.

                         BARBATUS
               No -- I can see it in your eyes.  I'm
               a goner.  It's alright, Z.  In this
               ant's army, a soldier's life ain't
               worth a sack of fungus.
                      (he winces)
               I can't feel my legs...

                         Z
               Hang in there, buddy!  You can make
               it!  Just -- take deep breaths, I'll
               try and find your body -- it's gotta
               be around here somewhere!

                         BARBATUS
                      (gasping)
               I wonder...what...was it all...for...

                         Z
               Barbatus, hang on -- Barbatus!!

                         BARBATUS
               Don't make my mistake, kid...
               don't...be a grunt...your whole
               life...

     Barbatus dies, leaving Z heartbroken.

     INT. EARLY MEGA-TUNNEL - DAY

     Weaver is "passing" as a worker, working alongside much
     smaller worker ants.  He actually loves the work.  He's
     throwing up dirt like a bulldozer.  He's so enthusiastic, he
     scoops up a WHOLE ANT in his shovel and tosses him aside.
     Azteca, who's standing next to him in line, is shocked by,
     and a little attracted to, this turbo-worker.

                         AZTECA
               Hey, slow it down, big boy.  You're
               making the rest of us look bad...How
               come I haven't seen you around here
               before?

                         WEAVER
                      (covering)
               I'm new...I was born yesterday.

                         AZTECA
               Tell me about it.

                         WEAVER
               Nobody told me digging was so much
               fun!  You pick up the dirt, you move
               it, you pick it up again, you move it
               again -- lots of repetitions, you
               exercise the forceps, and the
               pincers --

                         AZTECA
                      (ogling him)
               Mmm, yes, I see what you mean...

     While Azteca is checking out the hunky new worker, work has
     effectively stopped...clods are piling up behind Weaver.  A
     Foreman comes striding down the line, furious.

                         FOREMAN
               What's the holdup here?!

     Weaver whips his shovel up to his shoulder and salutes, as if
     he's dealing with a superior officer.

                         WEAVER
               Sorry, sir -- I was just having a
               little chat with my friend --

                         FOREMAN
                      (yelling at Weaver)
               Who said you could have a chat?
               You're not a chatter, you're a
               digger!  So shut up and dig!

                         AZTECA
               Leave him alone!  He's new.

                         FOREMAN
               You  too?  Well just for that, you
               lose your day's rations!  Now get
               back to work!

     The Foreman heads down the line, shoving and berating the
     other workers as he goes along.

                         AZTECA
                      (surprised at herself)
               I don't know what came over me,
               talking back like that.  I must be
               going crazy...

                         WEAVER
               Sorry I got you in trouble.  But
               listen, you can share my rations.

                         AZTECA
                      (flirting)
               Are you asking me out to dinner?

                         WEAVER
                      (blushing)
               No -- I mean yes -- I mean -- if you
               don't have other plans.

                         AZTECA
               I'll make myself available...Listen,
               better watch out with the
               backtalk.  I don't know want you to
               end up like the guy who used to work
               next to me.  I'm afraid he got...
               downsized.

     EXT. ANT MOUND - DAY

     Some guard ants are looking out across the sandy main
     entrance to the hive.

                         GUARD ANT
               Look!  They're back!  The army's
               back!  Alert the colony!

     The other ant starts ringing a bell, rushing down into the
     colony.

     INT. TOWN CENTER - DAY

     A huge crowd is forming, eager to welcome the army back.  A
     band is striking up a triumphant victory song, confetti and
     streamers are being thrown, as General Formica strides in,
     followed by Carpenter.

                         EXCITED ANTS
               The army's returned!  Our brave boys
               are back! (etc.)

     Everyone waves little flags as the tuba player Oompah-oompah-
     oompahs...

     ...and Z walks into the hall, looking bedraggled and
     exhausted, his helmet hanging over his ears.

     The band slows to a halt.

     At the edge of the crowd, Azteca, sitting on Weaver's
     shoulders, can just about see over the crowd.

                         AZTECA
               It looks like only one soldier made
               it back!

     Weaver looks distraught.

                         WEAVER
                      (to himself)
               Poor Z -- I should never have let you
               go!

     Far down the hall, Z is describing the battle.

                         Z
               It was horrible...a massacre, a
               massacre upon a massacre.  First we
               massacred them, then they massacred
               us, then it was halftime.  I've never
               seen such violence, such
               bloodthirstiness, such bad
               manners...I'm the only one that made
               it!

     The atmosphere is somber.  This is a tough one to try and put
     a spin on...but that doesn't stop Formica from trying.

                         FORMICA
               ONE TO NOTHING!  WE WIN!

     The band strikes up again, and everyone cheers.

                         Z
               No -- you -- you don't understand!

                         FORMICA
               Damn, I'm proud of you, boy.  I wish
               I had a hundred ants of your caliber.
               The world would tremble.  Now, time
               for some R and R.  You're invited to
               the royal victory party!

                         Z
               Royal victory party?  Will...will
               Princess Bala be there?

                         FORMICA
               Of course.  The entire royal family
               will be there to honor you.

                         Z
                      (thinks)
               ONE TO NOTHING!

     Renewed CHEERS, as Z is lifted onto the shoulder of some of
     the soldiers who stayed behind.

                         AZTECA
               Wait a minute, that's no soldier --
               that's Z!

                         WEAVER
               Z?  Our Z?  The little guy made it!

     Z is following Formica away from the cheering crowd.

     EXT. ABOVE TOWN CENTER - DAY

     Z and Formica are going up the royal "stairway" together.

                         FORMICA
               Son, you're an ant after my own
               heart.  A warrior.  An ant that looks
               death right in the face and laughs.

                         Z
               Well, I generally just make
               belittling comments and snicker
               behind death's back.  So, tell me,
               fellow war-monger...do you think
               Princess Bala likes men in uniform?

                         FORMICA
               Well she better -- she's engaged to
               one.  Me!

                         Z
               Engaged?  As in you're getting
               married?

                         FORMICA
               Affirmative.

                         Z
               So...you two are in love?

                         FORMICA
               In love?
                      (shakes his head)
               I'm just a plain old soldier at
               heart.  I'll tell you what I love --
               the field -- blood -- death --
               orders...and the company of other
               warriors.

     Formica gives Z a manly slap on the back.  Z looks a little
     uncomfortable as we...

                                              CUT TO:

     INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY

     Z follows Formica and Carpenter into the throne room.  At the
     end of the hall, a society band is playing.  The room is full
     of courtier ants and officers.

     Waiters are gliding around holding trays of hors d'ouevres.

                         Z
               Wow, what a spread -- you know,
               there's a food shortage in the rest
               of the colony.

                         FORMICA
               Yes, and do you know why there's a
               food shortage?

                         Z
               ...Not enough food?

                         FORMICA
               Negatory.  Too many ants.  And while
               we soldiers go out there, and fight,
               and bleed, and die for the colony,
               the namby-pamby workers live it up
               back home.

     Feeling a little hot, Z wipes his brow.

                         Z
               Well I, I don't think "living it up"
               is the right term -- how about
               "working themselves to death"?

                         FORMICA
               I tell you son, sometimes, at night,
               I see myself in battle, fighting a
               horrible, faceless enemy, with the
               future of our whole species at stake.
               And always, the dream ends with each
               of us plunging his sword into the
               other's heart...

                         Z
                      (spooked)
               Oh, hey, that's great, I think I see
               an old war buddy over there, it's
               been fun chatting.  Good luck with
               the hallucinations.

     Z escapes from Formica, who gazes after him suspiciously.

     Z mingles in with the crowd, then he sees Princess Bala
     standing with a group of officers who are eating hors
     d'oeuvres.

                         OFFICER
                      (telling a joke)
               What do you call it when 10,000
               workers are killed in a tunnel cave-
               in?
                      (a beat)
               Who cares?  They're workers!

     The officers laugh, but Bala looks bored in this stuffy
     social scene.

                         Z
               But...don't you think the worker
               class is the very foundation of the
               colony --
                      (realizes he's
                       getting odd looks)
               I mean, uh, without them, who would
               we stand on?

     More laughter.

                         BALA
               You're the hero of the recent termite
               campaign, aren't you?

                         Z
               Well, if single-handedly vanquishing
               the enemy and slaughtering a whole
               nestful of termites makes someone a
               hero, yes I am.

     Z reaches for a tray of canapes that a waiter is carrying by,
     and KNOCKS the whole thing CLATTERING to the ground.

                         Z
                      (feigning nonchalance)
               And you are...?

                         BALA
               I'm Princess Bala.

                         Z
               Ah, yes.
                      (affected)
               Well, charmed, I'm sure.  So,
               Princess, have you ever danced with
               a hero?

                         BALA
               Yes.

                         Z
                      (deflated)
               Oh...oh well then, one more won't
               matter.

     She moves towards the dance floor.  Z spit-combs his
     antennae, struts after her -- until he trips on his sword.
     He tumbles, falls, but hops to his feet just as Bala turns
     toward him, turning it into a ballet plies.

                         Z
               Just warming up...

     She frowns...there's something familiar about this guy.  But
     then they start dancing.

     ACROSS THE ROOM: The Queen and General Formica watch the
     party.

                         QUEEN
               All these parties are so marvellously
               alike.

                         FORMICA
               They should be...
                      (suspicious)
               But there's something funny about
               that soldier.

     Formica strides over to where Z and Bala are dancing.

                         FORMICA
                      (glowering)
               May I cut in?

                         Z
                      (intimidated)
               Oh, of course --

                         BALA
                      (pulling Z back)
               No, General.  I'm dancing with the
               war hero.

                         Z
                      (trying to placate
                       Formica)
               Uh, sorry, General, I...I've always
               had this animal magnetism, it --

     Bala YANKS Z back onto the dance floor, dancing away from
     Formica.

                         BALA
               You dance...

                         Z
               Divinely?

                         BALA
               No weirdly...You remind me of
               someone...

     Formica catches Bala's eye.  She frowns at him, and decides
     to get a little shocking.

                         BALA
               He was swarthy...primitive...
               earthy...sensual.

     As she says these things, Z tries to act accordingly.

                         BALA
               He was a worker.  I danced with him
               at a worker's bar just the other day.
               I'm not shocking you, am I?

                         Z
                      (proudly)
               No...as a matter of fact...

                         BALA
                      (shocked)
               OH MY GOD, IT'S YOU!  YOU'RE A
               WORKER!!!  A filthy, stupid,
               disgusting WORKER!

     Everybody gasps.  The dancing stops cold.

                         Z
               Gee, uh, could you say it a little
               louder, I think there are some ants
               in the next colony who didn't hear
               you.

                         BALA
               I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!

                         Z
                      (offended)
               That's not what you said the other
               night --

                         BALA
                      (now she's panicked)
               Quiet -- sshhh!!

                         Z
                      (digging it in)
               -- At the worker bar!  You were
               pretty hot to trot then!

                         BALA
               SSHH!!!  SSHH!!!

     A livid Formica is stalking over towards them.

                         FORMICA
                      (furious)
               What's this?  A worker has been
               masquerading as a war hero?!

                         Z
               Well it wasn't a masquerade, really,
               it was more what I'd call a clever
               ruse --

                         FORMICA
               ARREST HIM!

                         Z
               Can't we all settle this like
               adults -- we're not larvae anymore --

     Angry officers begin to surround Z, who hides behind Bala in
     fear, using her as a shield.

                         QUEEN
               Oh my god!  He's taking her hostage!

                         Z
               No I'm not -- I mean -- nobody move!
               Or the Princess gets it!

     People shout and scream, as Z backs up with the
     Princess...into the kitchen.

     INT. KITCHEN - DAY

     Z backs up into the kitchen, still pulling Bala along with
     him.  Here, ant chefs are preparing food for the party,
     vomiting little florets onto a platter.  Formica and the
     soldiers follow them in.

                         Z
                      (to Formica)
               Stay back, you lunatic!  Do you think
               I don't know how to use this?

     Z realizes that he's pointing his finger at them.

                         Z
               Uh-oh.

     The officers rush for...and Z, with Bala in tow, falls
     backwards into an opening marked, "GARBAGE".

     EXT. ANT MOUND - DAY

     HOLD ON: the GARBAGE CHUTE EXIT.  Nothing happens for a
     moment.  Then --

     From a distance, we hear the faint sound of SCREAMING,
     dopplering closer --

     -- and then Z and Bala come flying out of the exit, right
     into the mud, cutting off the scream abruptly.

     Bala sits up, coated in mud.  Z is nowhere to be seen.
     Because she's on top of him.

                         PRINCESS
               This is thoroughly unacceptable!

                         Z
               You're telling me...

     She gets up and runs back towards the colony entrance, where
     soldiers are already issuing to get her...

                         BALA
               I'm coming!  I'm coming!

     But...just as Bala'a about to be rescued...what looks like a
     gigantic LASER BEAM sweeps along the rim of the colony,
     sizzling the ground as it moves along...and IGNITES the lead
     soldier into FLAMES!  Bala looks stunned.

     Z watches in horror as another soldier ant is FRIED, and we
     look up to see a GIGANTIC MAGNIFYING GLASS casting the
     beam...we can just about make out the huge, grotesque figure
     (a seven year old kid) holding it.

     Bala, who has no idea what's really going on, turns from the
     colony and runs the other way.

                         BALA
               I'm going!  I'm going'

     ...unfortunately, this draws the fire of the laser, which
     follows after her in what looks like a strafing run, SIZZLING
     in her footsteps.

     Z, who's running towards the princess, suddenly realizes that
     he's running towards certain doom...and joins Bala in legging
     it away from the colony; under a brown leaf, which bursts
     into flames...between the redwood-like stalks of some
     flowers...and finally into the relative safety of some
     grass...where they throw themselves on the ground, exhausted.

                                              CUT TO:

     EXT. WEED CLUMP - DAY

     Z and Bala dust themselves off.

                         BALA
               What was that thing?

                         Z
               How should I know?

                         BALA
               I order you to find out where we are!

                         Z
               Alright, alright, I'll try to get
               directions from one of the locals.

     Z tries to flag down some passing bees.

                         Z
               Excuse me, I --
                      (it passes him by;
                       he tries the next)
               Pardon me --
                      (same response)
               And they call them social insects.

                         BALA
               Climb up that tree and get a better
               view!

     Bala points to a thin blade of grass.  Gingerly, Z tests the
     grass and starts climbing up it...but his weight bends it, so
     that he's lowered back to the ground, face to upside-down
     face with Bala.

                         BALA
               I've been kidnapped by the village
               idiot.

                         Z
               Who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot
               who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who
               lets herself get kidnapped by the
               idiot?

                         BALA
               How dare you speak to me like that?
               I'm the Princess!

     Z squares up with her.

                         Z
               Theoretically, yes.  But is the
               monarchical hierarchy applicable
               without the underlying social
               structure to support it?

                         BALA
               Of course!  It defines society!  To
               deny the precept is to say that order
               is an arbitrary distinction applied
               by the society itself!

                         Z
               But can there be a society composed
               of just two ants?

                         BALA
               No!  There's no such thing as "just
               two ants."  You never see just two
               ants -- you see a million ants!

                         Z
               Look around, sweetheart.

     She looks around.  She doesn't like what she sees.  She
     glowers at Z.

                         BALA
               I -- hate -- you.

                         Z
               Well I guess that makes us even.

                         BALA
               Ha!  Don't make me laugh.  You're
               crazy about me!  That's why you lied
               and cheated to get near me!

                         Z
               Oh come on, you're the one who came
               after me -- the swarthy, earthy,
               sensual worker!

                         BALA
                      (repulsed)
               I was slumming it!  I danced with you
               because you were the most pathetic
               specimen in the place!

                         Z
               Is that the same standard you used to
               choose General Formica?

                         BALA
               I didn't choose him.  What kind  of
               idiot would...
                      (unconvincingly)
               ...choose who she wanted to marry?

     She shakes herself out of it.

                         BALA
               Now, worker, you shall take me back
               to the colony, and have your head cut
               off and stuck on a sharp pole!

                         Z
               Well, that's an appealing offer,
               but...considering the options...
                      (he decides)
               You go back.  Me, I'm going to
               Insectopia.

                         BALA
               Insectopia?  You stupid worker,
               that's just a fairy tale!

                         Z
               Yeah, well I have it on a reliable
               source...
                      (he knows that was
                       maybe stretching it)
               that it exists.  Now you follow
               the yellow egg...
                      (looking around)
               That direction.

                         BALA
               Worker!  Come back here now!

                         Z
               I've got a name.  It's Z.

                         BALA
               That's not a name!  That's just a
               letter!

     Z, meanwhile, hits the road.  Bala has no idea of where to
     go.  Just then, the scariness of the outside world comes
     through to her.

     We start hearing NOISES -- the equivalent of scary jungle
     sounds in a Tarzan movie -- the HISSING, CROAKING,
     CHIRRUPING... Bala sees eyes looking out at her from all
     directions...and spots a colossal monster (a sparrow) fixing
     her with his beady gaze.

                         BALA
                      (clears her throat)
               Worker?
                      (no response...louder
                       now)
               Oh WORKER?  Where are you?
                      (getting desperate)
               Z?  Z?  Wait for me!!!

     Bala heads off after Z.

     INT. MEGA-TUNNEL - DAY

     The mass of worker ants are swinging pick-axes in the tunnel.
     The foreman moves up the line, BERATING the workers, yelling
     at them to dig faster.

                         AZTECA
               I tell ya, I'm gettin' sick of bein'
               yelled at.

                         WORKER #1
               What do you want, we're just workers.

                         WEAVER
               You know, you're not just workers --
               you can be whatever you want to be!
               Look at Z!  He started as a worker --
               then he became a soldier!

                         AZTECA
               That's right!  He slaughtered
               hundreds of termites single-handedly!

                         WORKER #2
               I heard about this guy.
                      (turning to the other
                       workers)
               He crashed a party at the palace.
               Then he took a hike with one of the
               royal babes!  And when they tried to
               stop him, he just looked at a
               couple'a guards, and they burst into
               flames!

                         WORKER ANT #1
               You're nuts, how could a worker do
               all that?

                         WEAVER
               Well, because he's more than a
               worker...he's a...what did he call
               it, Azteca...

                         AZTECA
               Invisible!

                         WEAVER
               No -- an individual!

                         WORKER #2
               What's that?

                         WEAVER
               Well, it's...someone with his own
               point of view...someone who does what
               he wants, not whatever he's told to
               do!

                         AZTECA
                      (eyes lit up,
                       watching Weaver)
               Someone who follows his heart!

                         WEAVER
                      (taking Azteca's hand)
               Right...because every ant's important!

                         WORKER #2
                      (scoffs)
               But that would mean I'm important.

                         WORKER #1
               I'm outta here, this sounds like
               trouble to me.

     But more ants are gathering 'round.

                         WEAVER
               We can all be individuals!  Just like
               Z!

     Weaver and Azteca hold hands.  More ants are gathering
     around, dropping their tools...

     EXT. BIKE PATH - DAY

     LONG SHOT.  A glimmering desert landscape (think of "The
     Sun's Anvil" in Lawrence of Arabia).  Two small figures can
     be seen, tiny dots moving across the arid whiteness.

     They're Bala and Z, who are crossing a concrete path in the
     park, which they perceive to be a "desert".

                         BALA
               Water...water...

                         Z
               Water...water -- oh, you already said
               that.

                         BALA
                      (walking along)
               My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is
               cracking...I wish I'd never met you,
               you ruined my life.

                         Z
               I ruined your life?  Look, I was
               perfectly happy until I met you --
               alright, I was miserable, but I was
               happily miserable.

     Over Z's line, we can see a GIGANTIC WHEEL, getting larger
     and larger and heading right towards them, a GIGANTIC WHEEL
     (the front wheel of a bicycle which is heading right towards
     them).

                         BALA
               Look out!

     Bala pushes Z out of the way just as the wheel rolls past
     with a cacophonous CRUNCHING, GRINDING noise -- like a
     gigantic millwheel.

                         BALA
               We're going to die!

                         Z
               Come on -- it's gone!  What are the
               chances of that happening again?

     No sooner has he said it than the rear wheel of the bike
     thunders past.

                         Z
               Well I'll be.

     Bala notices that they're clutching one another in fear; she
     pushes him away.

                         BALA
               Why didn't I listen to my mother
               ...why'd I have to go looking for
               trouble? Any ant would have given
               their left legs to be in my
               position...what's wrong with me?

                         Z
               Want a list?

                         BALA
                      (urgent)
               Wait, I hear something!

     We can, in fact, hear a low, musical PLUNK.. there's a pause
     and then we can hear it again...

     Z and Bala walk over a rocky "dune" (the soft shoulder of the
     path).  Beyond, the grass starts up again.  They have come to
     the end of the "desert" (i.e. the other side of the path)
     Through the blades of grass, we can see...

                         Z
               It's...it's...


                         BALA
               WATER!!!

     EXT. LAKE - DAY

     A LAKE (a puddle) stretches before them.  It is, in fact, the
     overflow of a drinking-fountain whose drain is jammed...as Z
     and Bala run to the lake, water dribbles from the fountain
     and into one edge of the pool (to the ants, it's a waterfall).

     Bala and Z run to the edge of the water and start slurping.
     They smile at each other, until they remember that they don't
     like each other.

                         Z
               This lake is huge!  And so close to
               the colony!  Think of the vacation
               potential!

                         BALA
               Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take
               a nap.

                         Z
               Listen, "Princess", you can't order
               me around.  Out here, you're not the
               boss anymore -- out here, you're
               just --

     -- But before he can finish, a water droplet from the
     fountain falls on him.  It may not sound like much, but to Z
     it's as though a ten-foot diameter sphere of jello had
     engulfed him.

     Z's stuck inside because of the surface tension of the
     droplet, which doesn't burst, just quivers up and down.
     Inside, Z is slowly, frantically drowning and screaming for
     help.  But his screams are muffled in the water.

                         BALA
                      (annoyed)
               Out here I'm just what?

                         Z
                      (through the water)
               Hlllllllp!

                         BALA
                      (hands on hips)
               Stop fooling around in there.

     By now the droplet has started rolling, and Z is being turned
     upside-down.  He manages to get one foreleg out of the
     droplet, and, in a frantic attempt to pull himself out, pulls
     Bala in by the leg.

                         BALA
               Let me go!!!

     But it's too late -- they're now both stuck in the droplet,
     and, as Z continues to drown, he also has to deal with Bala
     yelling at him -- though we can't hear exactly what it. is
     she's yelling through the water.

     Then, having run out of air, she too starts thrashing,
     alternately trying to swim and trying to slap him as Z tries
     to defend himself.  Finally all this commotion is enough to
     make the droplet burst, spilling the two coughing,
     sputtering, drenched ants onto the ground.

     They both lie there, miserable, wet, and cold.

                         BALA
                      (chants to herself)
               I'm going to be rescued soon.  I'm
               going to be rescued soon.  I'm going
               to be rescued soon.

     Z watches her incredulously.

                         Z
               Princess, has it ever occurred to you
               that they're not going to rescue you?

                         BALA
               General Formica won't let me die out
               here.  I'm his fiancee.

                         Z
               Look.  How many other Princesses are
               there?

                         BALA
               Five thousand three hundred and
               ninety -- no.  About five thousand
               four hundred by now.

                         Z
               And only you can become a Queen?

                         BALA
               Well...no, but --

                         Z
               So what makes you so special?

                         BALA
                      (hesitates)
               Well...I am the oldest.

     Bala turns from Z.  She's thinking things over, realization
     dawning on her.

                         BALA
               By three seconds...

     She looks out into the grass forest.

                         BALA
                      (to herself)
               You're right.  There are as many
               Princesses...as there are blades of
               grass.

     Z, overhearing her, slowly puts his hand on her shoulder.

     INT. MEGA-TUNNEL - DAY

     Formica and Carpenter are walking into the entrance of the
     tunnel with a squad of soldiers.

                         FORMICA
               Dammit, this tunnel is priority A-1!
               We can't afford any delays on this
               project!

                         CARPENTER
               I've never seen anything like it,
               General, they're they're...well, look!

     Ahead of them, a group of a few hundred workers have stopped
     work and are sitting down, chanting...

                         WORKER ANTS
               Z!  Z!  Z!  Z!

     A worker moves forward to join the strikers, tossing down his
     tool.

                         FOREMAN
                      (yelling at him)
               Where do ya think you're going?  Get
               back to work!

                         WORKER #1
               Buzz off, I'm important!
                      (joining the others)
               Z!  Z!  Z!  Z!


     At the center of the group, Weaver and Azteca are holding
     hands, leading the chant.

                         FORMICA
               Notice the big one, holding hands
               with the female?

                         CARPENTER
               Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?

                         FORMICA
                      (calculating)
               No one should have to.  Have him
               brought to me.

     INT. FORMICA'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT

     A nervous Weaver is sitting across from Formica, flanked by
     a couple of stoic guards.  Carpenter stands smiling by the
     side door.  There is no obvious threat to Weaver, but the
     atmosphere is truly intimidating.

                         FORMICA
               So this Z...he fancies himself an
               individual?

                         WEAVER
               Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know,
               really, sir.

                         FORMICA
                      (patronizing)
               Well now you haven't fallen for this
               silly idea of individuality, have
               you?

                         WEAVER
               Oh, no, sir!

                         FORMICA
               Good.  You're a good soldier.

                         WEAVER
               Thank you, sir.

     Weaver begins to relax a bit.

                         FORMICA
               So tell me.  Where's Z?

                         WEAVER
               I...I have no idea, sir.

                         FORMICA
               Okay, son.

     He pats Weaver on the shoulder.

                         FORMICA
               We know what makes an ant colony
               strong, don't we?  We know that no
               ant can be an individual.  No single
               ant matters, right?

                         WEAVER
                      (enthusiastically)
               That's correct, sir!

                         FORMICA
                      (points at a guard)
               Not that one.
                      (another guard)
               Or that one.

                         WEAVER
               No, sir!

     Formica nods at Carpenter, who smiles and opens a door.  Two
     soldiers walk in, holding Azteca.  The color drains from
     Weaver's face.

                         FORMICA
                      (calmly, with
                       satisfaction)
               Or that one?  Her life doesn't
               matter, does it?

                         AZTECA
               Don't tell that tightass anything,
               Weaver!

     Weaver starts to get up, but the guards behind him hold him
     down.

                         WEAVER
               Wait!  Just let her go!  Z's long
               gone anyway, following some golden
               egg to Insectopia!  You'll never
               catch him!

     Formica's face lights up.

                         FORMICA
               Insectopia, hunh?...See why
               individuality is so dangerous?  It
               can always be used against you.
                      (to the guards)
               If this sissy here wants to dig,
               he'll dig.  Send them both back to
               the tunnel project.  Double their
               workload.

     The guards exit with Weaver and Azteca.

                         FORMICA
               What do we have on this "Insectopia"?

                         CARPENTER
               Scattered reports, sir.  Rumors.
               Nothing reliable.

                         FORMICA
               Desperate times call for desperate
               measures.  Get me Ant Team Six.

                         CARPENTER
                      (frightened)
               Ant Team Six...

     EXT.  GRASS JUNGLE - DAY

     Z and Bala are lost, wandering through the grass

                         BALA
                      (looking hopeless)
               I swear, we've passed this blade of
               grass three times.

     Z keeps marching on.

                         BALA
               Face it, Z, we're lost!  We must have
               walked halfway across the world by
               now!  How did I get into this mess...

                         Z
                      (too shy to look at
                       her)
               Come on...tell me there wasn't just
               a little...something between us that
               first night at the bar.  The night we
               danced.

                         BALA
                      (sadly)
               What difference does it make...we're
               both going to starve to death, or get
               squished, or set on fire...

     But Z is just gawking.  The shot expands to show that they
     have stumbled onto...

                         Z
               ...The land of red and white...

     EXT. FALSE INSECTOPIA - DAY

     A PICNICGROUNDS...A red and white picnic blanket, which to
     the ants looks like a vast, undulating pavilion, stretches
     before them.  They gaze up at two obelisks: a salt and pepper
     shaker.

     Behind that is a gigantic tupperware jar full of potato
     salad, and sandwiches stacked high.  It all looks perfect,
     with the clean lines and monumental proportions of fascist
     architecture.  In fact, it looks a little too perfect.

                         Z
               We've found it!  Insectopia!  Look at
               all this food'

                         BALA
                      (amazed)
               You were right...you were right!
                      (smiling happily)
               Z, it's beautiful!

                         Z
               Let's dig in!

     Z goes over to a gigantic sandwich, but -- BOOIIING! -- he's
     prevented from getting at it by the saran wrap covering it.

                         Z
               There's - there's some kind of force
               field!

     Bala joins him, laboring against the saran wrap.  Then both
     of them hear laughter from above.

                         MALE WASP (O.S.)
                      (lockjawed accent)
               Muffy, look, party-crashers.

                         FEMALE WASP (O.S.)
                      (laughing)
               They're simply too much, Chip!

     Bala and Z look up to see two large, yellow WASPS hovering in
     the air above them.  The husband and wife wasps have
     lockjawed, William F. Buckleyesque accents.

                         MALE WASP
                      (to Z and Bala)
               You down there, haven't you ever been
               to a picnic?

                         Z
               Hunh?

                         FEMALE WASP
               Habla Ingles?
                      (to Male Wasp)
               Well I really don't know who they are.

                         Z
               We're ants!

     The Male Wasp zooms in closer.

                         MALE WASP
               Poopsie, we know some ants, don't we?
                      (to Z)
               Are you related to the Fifth Avenue
               ants?

                         FEMALE WASP
               Darling, do you have to talk to any
               insect from off the street?

                         MALE WASP
               Just being friendly, Poopsie.

                         BALA
               Hello?  I'm not just "any insect".
               My mother is the Queen.
                      (momentously)
               I'm Princess Bala!

                         MALE WASP
                      (under his breath)
               They're Eurotrash, dear.

     We hear a loud RUMBLING noise -- the family is about to sit
     down for their picnic lunch.  Gigantic hands reach down and
     pull away the "force fields".

                         MALE WASP
               Lunch!
                      (to Z)
               A little piece of advice, sport --
               bob and weave!  Bob and weave!

                         BALA
               What do you mean?

                         MALE WASP
               Well -- like my father used to say --
               there's no such thing as a free meal!

     The wasps dive in to the picnic, darting in for a bite, and
     then dashing away again...

                         THE WASPS
               Excuse me -- I'll have some potato
               salad -- thank-you! -- don't mind if
               I do!  After you! (etc.)

     -- But all is not well.  We pull back to reveal that Z and
     Bala are standing in front of a giant sneaker logo, which is
     attached to a giant sneaker.  Which moves.

                         Z
               I sort of imagined Insectopia a
               little differently --

     Just at that moment, we hear a whistling in the air -- and
     the female wasp is crushed by a huge swatter that sweeps out
     of the sky, sending the picnic blanket billowing up in an
     aftershock that throws Bala and Z to the ground.

                         BALA
               Oh...my...God.

                         MALE WASP
                      (shaking her)
               Muffy!  Muffy!  Wake up!

     But she doesn't move.  The Male Wasp stares up at the sky.

                         MALE WASP
                      (heartbroken)
               WHYYYYYYYYYYYYY????

     But Z, also looking up, has no time to commiserate.

                         Z
               Bala, look out!!

     They are only saved by the fact that they are so small - .the
     holes of the swatter pass over them.

     The woman, realizing that the swatter won't work on ants,
     throws it to the side and tries stomping on them...

     Before Bala can get away, a sneaker falls on her with a
     thunderous BOOM that shakes the ground.

                         BALA
               MMMffllmmm...

     The shoe rises, as the person wearing it steps away...and we
     see that Bala is stuck in one of the ridges of the waffle-
     soled sneaker, adhering to a big piece of bubblegum!

                         BALA
               Z!  Help me!!!

     But Bala is carried off on the sneaker in a huge, looping,
     ferris-wheel-like motion.  BOOM.  The sneaker on which Bala
     is stuck falls again, as the woman tries to step on Z, too --

                         Z
               Bala!
                      (mournfully)
               I'll never see her again...

     -- But he does, instantly, as the shoe rises again, showing
     Bala stuck deeper in the bubblegum --

                         BALA
               Z!!!  Get me out of heeeeere!

     -- The woman has decided to walk away from the picnic to get
     the bubblegum off her shoe...Z heart sinks as the shoe Bala's
     stuck on lopes off into the distance...

                         Z
                      (thinks)
               These things always come in twos...

     He sees a SECOND SHOE starting to rise --

                         Z
               Take me to your leader!

     Z runs towards the shoe as it rises... and at the last moment
     catches on to the snaky, swinging shoe-lace.

                         Z
               Whoooooooaaaa!!!

     The sneaker lifts off into the air, with Z holding on for
     dear life to the lace, and getting further and further away
     from Bala as he's drawn to a vertiginous height...the
     landscape can be seen rolling and pitching crazily in the
     background...

                         Z
               Bala!  Come back here!

     For a moment, the sneaker seems to pause in the air...then it
     descends again, in a stomach-churning, roller-coaster free-
     fall as the sneaker on which Bala is stuck rises up again...

                         BALA
               Z!!!!!!!  I'm stuck!

     --  But Z is trying to keep his lunch down as he descends.
     The sneaker hits the ground, and Z can feel himself
     again...it's now or never.

                         Z
                      (Tarzan whoop)
               Aa-ee-ya-ee-yaaaaaaaah!!!!!!!

     As the sneaker rises again, he swings off the lace, hurtling
     through the air and catching one of the laces of Bala's
     sneaker...the momentum swings him up and under the sole...

                         BALA
               Z!  You're here!

     Z gets smashed into the bubblegum next to Bala.  Now he's
     stuck too.

                         Z
                      (ruefully)
               Yeah.  I'm here.

     The sneaker descends again.  Z and Bala hold hands and SCREAM
     as they see the ground rise too meet them...

     THUD!  They're squished deeper into the bubblegum.  The
     sneaker rises again...

                         BALA
                      (emotional)
               Z...if we don't make it...I just want
               you to know....

                         Z
                      (touched)
               Yes?

                         BALA
               This is all your fault!!!

     The sneaker rises, and seems ready to fall again...but
     instead it just hovers there.  (The person wearing it is
     balancing on one leg and about to scrape off the bubblegum
     with a penny).

                         Z
               We're safe...

     Just then, the hand holding the penny looms up...the penny
     is, by ant standards, about sixty feet high.  The huge image
     of Abraham Lincoln stares down at them.

                         Z
               Who the hell is that?!!!

     The penny starts scrapes the bubblegum off the sneaker,
     bringing Bala and Z along with it.  They're carried through
     the air as the penny gets thrown away...turning over and over
     in a lopsided orbit as Bala and Z SCREAM...

     ...and land with a CRASH in total darkness.

     EXT. LAKE - DAY

     The "lake" where Z and Bala were nearly drowned by the water
     droplet.

     The earth shakes as a HUGE, MONSTROUS creature approaches the
     lake - and begins to drink from it.  The creature seems to
     hear something, and, growling, turns its ugly head.  It's a
     Pomeranian, one of those yappy little lap-dogs -- but seen
     from ant perspective, it's something out of a horror movie.

                         TOUGH VOICE (O.S.)
               Ant Team Six -- take him out!

     The monster bears its huge fangs at the approaching
     intruders -- a bunch of flying ants who look as though
     they're attacking the Death Star!

     The monster rears and snaps at two of the ants, who are
     making a diversionary run...

     and then gets it from the rest of the ants, who land on his
     soft, wet nose and start stinging away like crazy.

     The monster rears back in pain -- and runs away, YIPPING!

     The members of ANT TEAM SIX, a crack team of hardcore flying-
     ant commandoes a la Seal Team Six, break off the attack and
     land.

                         MAJOR MANDIBLE
               And don't come back, you sissy!

     MAJOR MANDIBLE, Ant Team Six's lethal commander, steps into
     frame.  He's the one-eyed killer we met in the bar earlier.
     The rest of his team fan out to search the area.

                         MANDIBLE
               Talk to me.

                         COMMANDO ANT
               Z and the Princess were here, sir.
               Signs of a struggle.

                         MANDIBLE
               Let's get a read on that feremone
               track.

                         COMMANDO ANT #1
                      (to the others)
               Get the sniffer!

     Two other commandoes come running up with what looks like a
     piece of machinery on a tripod -- only it's an ant -- a
     highly specialized, blind ant with an incredibly acute sense
     of smell.

                         TRACKER ANT
               Bala...find Bala...

     The tracker, drool running out of its long proboscis, sniffs
     the air and starts signalling like a geiger counter...

                         TRACKER ANT
                      (as he's swivelled)
               Nnononononononoyeahyeahnononononono
               no...

     Finally the tracker stops swivelling, pointing in one
     direction and saying, "Yeahyeahyeahyeah..."

                         COMMANDO ANT #3
               Got 'em!  Ten clicks from here!

                         MANDIBLE
               Z -- you dirt-digging, fancy-dancing,
               wisecracking, royalty-grabbing, rebel
               SCUM!
                      (yelling into the
                       distance)
               I AM COMING FOR YOU!  YOU ARE ONE
               DEAD ANT, MISTER!

     Mandible's muscles bulge.  The veins in his head throb.  This
     is one ass-kicking ant.  Even Mandible's troops look scared
     of him.

                         MANDIBLE
               Let's MOVE!  GO, people!  GO!  GO!
               GO!  GO!  GO!

     Ant Team Six takes to the air, heading in the direction
     indicated by the tracker ant.

     INT. TRASH BAG - DAY

     Darkness.  Out of it we hear the voices of Z and Bala.

                         BALA
               Come on, Z.

                         Z
               Forget it.  You go ahead, I give up.
               I...I don't know what I was thinking.
               "Insectopia".

     In one corner of the screen, we can see an irregular little
     hole through which a shaft of light is falling.  Bala
     proceeds towards it, the hole appears to get bigger and
     bigger...

                         Z
                      (defeated)
               There's only one thing worse than an
               ant who goes around mindlessly
               following orders, and that's an ant
               who's too dumb to go around
               mindlessly following orders.

     Bala stops...she notices that they're being watched.  She's
     emerging from a tied off garbage bag -- the yellow ties loop
     away gracefully.  Bala and Z have been tossed into a garbage
     area.  And above them and below them, peering from garbage
     cans, recycling containers, bags, etc., a multi-cultural
     assortment of insects are regarding them.

     A laid-back FLY voices their thoughts.

                         FLY
               What's with the bummer attitude?

     A nearby BUTTERFLY joins in.

                         BUTTERFLY
               Yeah -- nobody stresses out in
               Insectopia!

                         BALA
               Did you say...

                         Z
                      (joining Bala)
               ...Insectopia?

     Z and Bala look around.  Just to get things straight, the
     garbage dump doesn't look disgusting -- that would be seeing
     it through human eyes.  Instead, we're looking at it through
     ant eyes -- and, reimagined this way, it's Paradise.  Not the
     ordered, sterile, paradise of the picnic, but an earthly land
     of plenty.

     The sides of the plastic garbage bags are sheer, reflective
     walls of smoothest obsidian...the garbage cans are gigantic,
     thick metal columns put there by the gods (think the
     pyramids); a coke bottle, refracting the sunlight into a
     gorgeous rainbow, trickles a fountain of sweet nectar into
     the pink, bittersweet flesh of a grapefruit half, which
     appears as a multi-chambered concave dome.  Everywhere,
     insects are disporting themselves -- a multi- species love-in
     that's like an insect version of Woodstock.

     Bala and Z are awe-struck.  Bala turns to Z.

                         BALA
                      (happily)
               Z, we made it!

                         FLY
                      (alighting on the
                       grapefruit)
               C'mon in!  The nectar's fine!

     Like a kid at an amusement park, Z slides down the smooth
     side of the garbage bag, whooshing this way and that until he
     slides into one end of a straw (a red and white striped
     tunnel), and is shot out...

                         Z
               Yippeeeeee!

     ...into a bottle-cap filled with lemonade, which he
     alternately drinks and swims through...

     Down at the bottlecap, Z is drying himself off.  Then he
     sees, emerging from behind a lemon peel, a gigantic TERMITE.

                         Z
                      (terrified)
               AAAAAGH!!!

     Surprisingly, the termite seems equally terrified...

                         FLY
                      (to Z)
               Hey, take it easy!  There's nothin'
               to be afraid of!

                         Z
               Yeah, well, I make it a practice not
               to trust anyone who shoots acid out
               of their forehead.

                         CRICKET
               Dude, here in Insectopia, we don't
               judge people by how many arms and
               legs we've got.

                         FLY
               Yeah, back home, they called me a
               fruitfly.  But here, I'm known
               as...
                      (with attitude)
               Superfly.

                         CRICKET
               Anyway, big Gus is mellow.

     The termite sticks his hand out.  A drop of acid drips from
     his head and splashes at Z's feet.

                         Z
                      (taking his hand,
                       disgusted)
               Charmed.

     Z reaches out and shakes the termite's hand, as Bala watches,
     smiling.

                                              CUT TO:

     EXT. INSECTOPIA - NIGHT

     The insects are having a cookout, their faces illuminated by
     the still-red ember of a match.  Platters heaped with food
     lie untouched as they pat their bellies...

     Z and Bala sit next to one another, smiling shyly as if they
     had just met for the first time.

                         Z
               So...you never did tell me...what
               made you come out to the worker bar
               that night?

                         BALA
               Just looking for fun, adventure,
               trouble, I guess.

                         Z
               Well, "trouble" is my middle name.
               Actually, my  middle name is .985,
               but I don't tell people.  Hey, Bala,
               I...I actually have something of
               yours...you left it at the bar that
               night.

     Z takes out Bala's scarf, which he's been keeping folded in
     a pocket.

                         Z
               Sorry, it's been through a war, not
               to mention everything else...

                         BALA
               You held onto this all that time?

                         Z
               Well, I...I know it's a little
               strange, but...I thought it might
               come in handy if I...needed a scarf
               someday.
                      (embarrassed)
               Well, to be honest, I just liked
               having it.

     He hands it back to her.  Bala looks at Z, frankly, openly.
     For a moment Z is shy.  Then he looks at her too.  They're
     two lovers, leaning closer, about to have their first kiss,
     when --

                         BEETLE
               Hey Z!

     The moment is wrecked.  Z looks up.  A chubby beetle stands
     there with Gus the termite.

                         BEETLE
               Wanna bring back dessert?  There's a
               thirty foot long blimp in the next
               can, made completely of chocolate!

                         Z
                      (annoyed)
               Sure.  I wasn't busy or anything.

     Z gets up to go with them.

                         Z
               Great timing, guys.  Ever wonder why
               they call you "pests"?

     EXT.  INSECTOPIA, TOP OF CAN - NIGHT

     As Ant Team Six lands and takes up position above the feast.
     The tracker ant is going nuts.

                         TRACKER ANT
               Yesyesyesyesyes --

     One of the commandoes puts his hand over the tracker's mouth
     to shut him up.  Mandible communicates with his troops by
     pulling down his one functional antenna and gruffly
     whispering into it, as though it were one of those commando
     headsets.  His troops do likewise.

                         MANDIBLE
               Talk to me.

                         COMMANDO #1
               I've got a read on the Princess --
               but target Z isn't accounted for.

                         MANDIBLE
               Let's move in.

     EXT. INSECTOPIA - NIGHT

     Back at the feast, a cricket strums on his legs like a
     guitar, opining about life and the universe to a bunch of
     other chilled-out, hippyesque insects...Bala taps her feet to
     the song.

                         CRICKET
               What if, like...we're just these tiny
               little things, and we're just like
               part of this whole other huge
               universe, that's like, so big we
               don't even know it exists?

                         LADYBUG
               Man...that's so deep...

     At that moment Ant Team Six rapels down from the top of the
     garbage bin, landing amongst the insects.

                         MANDIBLE
               EVERYBODY DOWN!

     The cricket gets up to confront Mandible, but Mandible cold
     cocks him with a right to the jaw.  The other insects, too
     surprised to fight, just do as they're told.

                         MANDIBLE
               Alright, you hippy scum!  Make one
               move and I'll exterminate you!

     A couple of commandoes grab Bala by the arms and heave her up.

                         BALA
               Stop!  You don't understand!

                         MANDIBLE
               I don't have to understand, Missy --
               I've got orders.  Now where's Z?

                                              CUT TO:

     INT. INSECTOPIA - NIGHT

     Z, the termite, the beetle and the fly are happily carrying
     a huge M&M back to the feast.

                         FLY
               Man, your girl is fly, know what I'm
               saying?

                         Z
                      (overdoing it)
               Oh, Bala?  I guess she's okay, you
               know, for a princess.  I mean, I
               usually date queens, or you know,
               empresses, because sometimes the
               lesser nobility are too much in awe
               of my smouldering sensuality.  Please
               stop me if I'm making you feel
               inadequate.

     They throw down the M&M, which lands with a THUD.  Z notices
     that the rest of the insects look spooked.

                         Z
               What's the matter?  This place is as
               cheery as a Roach Motel at check-out
               time.

     Z looks around.

                         LADYBUG
               Bala's been kidnapped!  Some flying
               ants took her back to the colony!

                         Z
               She's been kidnapped?!  But I can't
               live without her!

     Z just stands there, heartbroken.

                         Z
                      (determined)
               I'm going back.  I've got to get her.
               Who'll come with me?

     Z looks around.  Nobody's volunteering.  Nothing but sheepish
     looks and shuffling from the insects of Insectopia.

     Z looks disheartened.  He's about to leave when --

                         MALE WASP (O.S.)
               I'll go.

     The male wasp is hovering nearby.

                         Z
                      (surprised)
               You?!

                         MALE WASP
               I know what it's like to lose
               someone...I keep hearing the sound of
               Muffy's flapping wings...so I'll take
               you.

     Z hops on the wasp's back.

                         Z
               Let's go, pal!

     The wasp takes off, leaving the other insects looking a
     little chastized.

                         FLY
               Geez.  I feel like a real stinkbug.

                                              CUT TO:

     EXT. SKY ABOVE COLONY - MORNING

     The wasp and Z fly high above the colony...

                         Z
               Wow...I never saw things this way...

     From here, we can see the whole layout of the land around the
     colony...the "desert" (an asphalt path) and across it, the
     "lake" (the overflowing water fountain)

                         Z
               Things look so close together from up
               here...there's the desert...and the
               lake...
                      (thinking about
                       something)
               it's not far from the colony at all...

     Suddenly, the wasp bounces up and down in the air.

                         MALE WASP
               Sorry.  Turbulence.

     INT. FORMICA'S CHAMBERS - DAY

     Formica sits at his desk, going over some plans.  Formica's
     chambers are located inside a snake skull, with the eye
     sockets serving as windows, and the mouth serving as a door.
     The walls are hung with trophies -- the heads of other
     insects.

     Ant Team Six burst in the doors of Formica's office, carrying
     the struggling and kicking Bala.  One of the commandoes sets
     the tracker ant one the floor...then Formica gets up from his
     desk as the commandoes bring the princess to him.

                         FORMICA
               Princess Bala.  Good.
                      (with urgency)
               Where's Z?

     Bala replies warily.

                         BALA
               He's...he's dead.
                      (covering for Z)
               You don't have to look for him
               anymore.  He was eaten by a praying
               mantis.

                         FORMICA
                      (regretfully)
               It's a shame he died prematurely...I
               was hoping to kill him myself.

                         BALA
               Well you'll never be able to hurt him
               where he is now.
                      (sadly)
               I miss him already.

                         FORMICA
                      (surprised)
               You miss him?  Why?

                         BALA
                      (angry)
               Because...because he's twice the ant
               that you are.  I could never go
               through with marrying you.  I'm --
               I'm an individual, and when I get
               married, it'll be to someone I choose.

     The soldiers look shocked.  For a moment, Formica looks
     furious.  Then he just shrugs.

                         FORMICA
                      (shaking his head)
               Princess Bala, I'm just a simple old
               soldier, and the ways of the feminine
               mind are a little too complex for me.
               But one thing I do know is, there are
               more Princesses where you came from.
               I just hope they're not all like you.
               In the meantime, maybe we can arrange
               for you to see Z again after all.

     He gestures to the commandoes, who drag her out the door.  We
     notice that the tracker ant has been left behind.

     EXT. ANT MOUND - DAY

     Z hops down from the wasp, who has landed near the entrance
     to the colony.

                         MALE WASP
               Good luck, Z.  For a wingless insect,
               you're alright by me.

                         Z
               Thanks, Chip.

     They shake hands and the wasp flies off.

                         Z
                      (to himself)
               How am I going to get in?  The place
               is crawling with soldiers!

     Z starts for the nearest entrance -- but he's spotted by a
     couple of SOLDIER ANTS.

                         SOLDIER ANT
               You there!  Worker!

     Z's caught -- it's over.  He turns around with his hands up.

                         Z
               Don't bite!  I surrender!

                         SOLDIER ANT
               What are you doing out here!  All
               workers are to remain inside the
               colony, by orders of General Formica!

     Z can't believe his luck -- and his curiosity is piqued.

                         Z
                      (heading inside)
               Well...if you insist...

     INT. MEGATUNNEL - DAY

     The Queen, with Formica striding at her side, is carried by
     a personal escort of fifty or so struggling workers to the
     bottom end of the Mega Tunnel, where a red ribbon waits to be
     cut.

                         QUEEN
               Very impressive, General.

     Behind her, hundreds of thousands of workers are crowded,
     looking confused and expectant.  Some of them clutch little
     flags and noisemakers...

                         MANDIBLE
               Wave that flag, you maggot!

     ...which we see are being handed out to them by Ant Team Six.

                         FORMICA
               Is there anything wrong, your majesty?

     The Queen is looking around unhappily.

                         QUEEN
               It's just...How I miss Bala.  I wish
               she were here for this special moment.

     Formica warmly places his hand on the Queen's shoulder.

                         FORMICA
                      (falsely supportive)
               She is, your majesty.  She is.

     The CAMERA heads up the long, long tunnel, where we see...

     INT. MID SKYLIGHT TUNNEL

     Bala, tied and gagged.  She's at the point in the Megatunnel
     where it begins to curve upwards towards the surface.  She
     struggles against her bonds, but can't get loose.

                                              CUT TO:

     INT. ANT MOUND - DAY

     Elsewhere in the colony, a column of soldiers marches by, and
     we hear the TROMP-TROMP-TROMP of their boots.  When they've
     gone, Z pokes his head out from behind a pile of dirt...he
     heads in the opposite direction of the soldiers...

     INT. OUTSIDE FORMICA'S CHAMBERS - DAY

     Z creeps around the outside of Formica's chambers.  This part
     of the colony seems to be deserted.

                         Z
               Geez, this place really empties out
               in August.  Where is everybody?

     Z walks up to the skull that houses Formica's chambers and
     peeks in the eye socket.

     INT. FORMICA'S CHAMBERS

     Inside, the Tracker Ant, who's been left behind, switches
     "on", eyes glowing.  Z enters the chamber cautiously.

                         TRACKER ANT
                      (sniffing)
               Z!  Z!  I smell Z!

     For a moment, Z's afraid.  Then he sees the small Tracker Ant
     doesn't seem hostile.

                         Z
               You "smell" me?  Well look, I -- I've
               been out in the wilderness for a
               while, and --

     The tracker ant keeps sniffing.  Z waves his hand in front of
     the blind ant's eyes.

                         Z
                      (getting it)
               Hey, wait, you're...you're one of
               those pheremone sniffers, aren't you?
               Maybe you can help me...I'm looking
               for a friend of mine, Princess Bala.

                         TRACKER ANT
                      (enthusiastic)
               Bala!  Yeahyeahyeahyeahyeah!  Find
               Bala!  Yeahyeahyeahyeah!

     Z picks up the tracker ant.

                         Z
               Just remember, I met her first.

     Z, carrying the little tracker ant, heads out, following its
     lead...

     Through this and that passage, as the Tracker Ant gets more
     and more insistent...And finally straight to a blank wall.

                         TRACKER ANT
               Yeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeah...

                         Z
               Bala's through there?

                         TRACKER ANT
               Bala...Yeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeah...

                         Z
               Great.  More digging.  This is why I
               left in the first place.

     Z can answer his own question.  He puts down the tracker ant,
     with a look on his face like a kid forced to eat broccoli,
     starts digging through the wall...

     INT. SKYLIGHT APEX - DAY

     Meanwhile, A member of Ant Team Six -- the stupidest member,
     in fact, waits at the very top of the tunnel, where it
     narrows almost to a point.  He's hanging from a winch, and
     has a little hammer and chisel in his hand.  He's WHISTLING,
     awaiting instructions.

     INT. MEGA-TUNNEL - DAY

     Z emerges from the tunnel he's dug, spits a load of dirt out
     of his mouth and wipes his hands off.  Nearby, Bala lies
     there, bound and gagged.

                         Z
               Bala!

     Z unties Bala and undoes her gag.

                         BALA
               Z!  You came back!

     They HUG.

                         Z
               Why do they have you tied up here?

                         BALA
               There's something going on, Z --

     From here, Z can see far down the tunnel to where the crowd
     is gathering.

                         BALA
               They're having a ceremony to open the
               Megatunnel...

     We can hear the sound of WATER SHIFTING somewhere above.  He
     looks up the tunnel...in the distance, we can make out the
     silhouete of the commando set to break open the wall...

                         Z
               Bala, that -- that lake we found --
               I think the tunnel's right underneath
               it!
                      (horrified)
               -- Formica's going to flood the
               colony!!!  That's what he meant when
               said there were too many ants!

                         BALA
               Oh no...

     Bala looks too shocked to move.  Z starts pushing her into
     the tunnel he made, and starts heading down towards the crowd.

                         BALA
               Z!  what are you doing?

                         Z
               I know it's crazy, but -- I can't
               just leave.  Don't argue with me.  If
               I've learned anything, it's that the
               problems of two people don't add up
               to a hill of ants in this world.  Or
               beans.  Something like that.  Anyway,
               I've got to warn the others.

     Z looks into Bala's eyes.

                         Z
               Head for the surface, Bala.  If I
               don't make it, well...we'll always
               have Insectopia.

     Z kisses Bala.  Then he starts running down the tunnel
     towards the crowd...

                         BALA
                      (following him)
               Z!!! Wait for me!

     INT. ANT MOUND - DAY

     All the SOLDIERS are filtering out of the assembly area,
     leaving the workers behind.  As his troops march by, Formica
     steps to the side and hands the Queen a pair of scissors to
     cut the ribbon strung across the Megatunnel.

                         FORMICA
               Your majesty, I'm afraid matters of
               state keep me from attending the
               ceremony.

                         QUEEN
               But General -- this tunnel is your
               baby!  You're sure you can't stay ?

                         FORMICA
               'Fraid not, your majesty.
                      (with regret)
               Goodbye, your majesty.

                         QUEEN
               Very well, General -- I know you --
               all work and no play!

                         FORMICA
               Alright, let's move out!

     Formica, surrounded by his bodyguards, hurries off as the
     Queen readies to cut the ribbon...

                         QUEEN
               In the name of the colony, I declare
               this tunnel open!

     INT. MEGA-TUNNEL - DAY

     Z and Bala sprint towards the bottom end of the tunnel...

                         Z
               Stoooooop!

     -- and then pull back to see Queen cut the ribbon -- she
     looks up and sees --

                         QUEEN
               Bala!

                         BALA
               Mom!

     Z calls out to the crowd.

                         Z
               Listen up!  We've all got to get out
               of here!  This place is going to
               flood!

     The workers are unconvinced.

                         WORKER #1
               Are you nuts?

                         Z
               You've got to believe me!

                         WORKER #2
               Oh yeah?  What makes you so special,
               Mr. Know-It-All?

                         Z
               I'm Z.

     The workers are even more sceptical.  A laugh goes up from
     the crowd.

                         WORKER #3
               You're Z?  Gimme a break!  Z's ten
               milimeters tall!

                         WORKER #4
               -- and he can kill termites with his
               bare hands!  You're just some scrawny
               worker with a mental problem!

                         Z
               I am Z!

                         WORKER #1
               No you're not!

                         WEAVER
               Yes he is.

     Weaver steps out of the crowd.

                         Z
               Weaver!

     Weaver runs up to Z and hugs him, starting to cry.

                         WORKERS
               Hey...it is Z...listen to what he
               says! [etc].

                         WEAVER
               Z...I'm so sorry!  I --

                         Z
               Don't worry about it, pal.

     Nearby, Bala and the Queen hug.  The Queen looks over at Z.

                         QUEEN
                      (distastefully)
               Oh...it's that social-climbing worker
               again -- what does he want?

                         Z
                      (in response)
               To save you all!  Now we've got to go!

                                              CUT TO:

     EXT. ANT MOUND - DAY

     Outside of the colony, where Formica, surrounded by the army,
     gives a signal to Mandible by drawing his finger across his
     throat...

                         MANDIBLE
                      (talking into his
                       antenna)
               Let 'er rip!

     INT. SKYLIGHT APEX - DAY

     AT THE TOP OF THE TUNNEL, the commando starts chiseling away
     furiously at the wall...and nothing but dust falls down.  The
     commando looks at the dust as it falls down, down the long
     tunnel...he looks up at the dry wall...Hmmm...

     Then...

     THE WALL BURSTS OPEN.

     And a TORRENT starts pouring out -- swallowing the terrified
     commando as if he were a crumb and heading down the tunnel
     like a freight train, ripping up the walls as it goes...

     INT. EARLY MEGA-TUNNEL - DAY

     Everyone turns to hear the rumbling sound coming down the
     tunnel --

                         AZTECA
               Listen!

                         WORKER #1
               He's right!!!

     From here, we can see deep into the tunnel, at the point
     where it levels out...and the torrent can be seen rushing
     down at them...

                         Z
               LET'S MOVE IT!

     All of a sudden there's panic as every ant tries to scramble
     away from the oncoming water...in the confusion, the Queen's
     bearers drop her and scramble over her.

                         QUEEN
               You there!  Stop!  I say!

     The Queen turns, and for a brief moment is silhouetted
     against the white-capped torrent of water...

     ...and then she picks her abdomen up like a skirt and high
     tails it away from the torrent, running so fast that she
     passes some of her bearers on the way...

     And then the torrent spits out of the mouth of the
     Megatunnel, quickly filling up the chamber and branching into
     all of its side tunnels, as we see:

     A group of workers RUNNING up a side tunnel and getting
     consumed by a wave, which crashes down on them like a hand
     slapping a table...

     Another group, the members of which are getting swallowed up
     one by one; one of the ants runs up on the ceiling of the
     tunnel and keeps on going, upside-down...it works for a while
     but eventually he, too is swallowed up...

     -- In the Nursery, nurses are evacuating stacks of crying ant
     babies...

     In one of the larger access-tunnels, down which thousands of
     workers are fleeing, a group of ants turns and decides to
     make a stand for it -- they link up in a mass and form a
     LIVING DAM.  It holds for a while but then BURSTS scattering
     and smashing ants along the sides of the tunnel before eating
     them up...

     And we...

                                              CUT TO:

     INT. TOWN CENTER - DAY

     The huge main chamber of the colony, where most of the
     workers -- as well as Z, Bala, Weaver, Azteca, and the
     Queen -- have run to.

     The chamber is rapidly flooding from all sides.  Water flows
     out of every escape tunnel the workers try...and the crowd is
     becoming more and more closely packed together as the waters
     rise around them.

                         AZTECA
               There's no way out!

                         QUEEN
               We're all going to drown!!!

                         BALA
               Z...what can we do?

     Z clenches his fist...he feels utterly powerless...then he
     shouts...

                         Z
               Dig!

     The workers turn to look at him questioningly.

                         Z
               We've got to dig a trench around us!

     -- But one of the workers raises his hands.

                         WORKER #1
               Uh...we don't dig any more.  We're
               individuals.

                         WORKER #2
               Yeah.  We're too important to dig.
               You taught us that, Z.  You hate
               digging!

                         Z
                      (at his wits end)
               Yeah, but I hate drowning more!  Now
               dig!

                         WEAVER
               You heard the ant -- DIG!!!

     The workers start to dig a circular moat around themselves,
     passing the dirt back into the middle of what remains of the
     dry ground.

     -- But they seems to be making little headway against the
     water as it continues to rush in...

     The ant labor we saw up to now were nothing compared to
     this.   As the moat gets deeper, the pile grows higher and
     higher...Weaver is digging up huge chunks of earth...nearby,
     Azteca is digging like crazy too...Z runs around, directing
     traffic and encouraging the workers...

                         Z
               That's it!  Pass the dirt back to the
               center!  Go on!

     Nearby the Queen stands there, looking squeamish.

                         Z
               Your highness...time to get your
               hands dirty!

     Gingerly, the Queen reaches out for a clod of dirt...and
     passes it along.  Next thing you know, she's practically
     crushed by a huge load thrown up by Weaver.

     The water keeps rushing in...but now we notice that...

     ...the pile of dirt in the middle of the "island" created by
     the digging of the moat is growing higher and higher,
     reaching up towards the ceiling of the chamber...

     ...And the water is getting swallowed up by the moat,
     swirling around angrily.

     Now Z looks up, and sees that with a little more effort they
     can reach the top --

                         Z
               We need to form a scaffolding around
               this mound -- let's DO IT!

     The workers start to cluster around the mound, covering it,
     forming a tight network of living bodies around the mound up
     towards the ceiling...

                         Z
               Now climb!

     The ants start to scale the scaffolding, up towards the top
     of the chamber...it's a swarming mass of ants, hauling each
     other up, giving each other legs up, climbing ever and ever
     higher towards the top...

     Where they start to dig through the very ceiling...

     ...as, at the bottom of the mound, Z starts to organize the
     hauling away of the Queen, as though she were a big cargo
     container...

                         Z
               Okay boys -- take her up!

     Z slaps the Queen on the butt, and she's winched away on a
     cable composed entirely of ants linked arm in arm like those
     plastic toy monkeys...

     EXT. ANT MOUND - DAY

     ...And Azteca's head pokes through the ground...she hauls
     herself up, and hundreds of ants pour up from the ground,
     widening the hole...

     INT. TOWN CENTER - DAY

     The water is rising...but almost all of the ants have
     escaped...Z clambers up the mound, as the scaffolding of ants
     rolls up from the bottom....

     And the rushing water finally wears down the earthen core of
     the structure.  As Z hauls himself through the hole in the
     ceiling.

     The entire structure collapses into the angry waters below,
     which seem furious to have missed their prey...

     EXT. ANT MOUND - DAY

                         WORKER
               He did it!  Z!  Z!  Z!  Z!  Z!

     The "Z" cheer goes up, with everyone joining in.  But the
     jubilation is short-lived, for, appearing on the ridge,
     surrounding the workers, is FORMICA'S ARMY, circling the mass
     of workers, backing them in towards the roiling water behind
     them.  Formica himself appears in the front lines, with
     Carpenter and Mandible at his side.

                         FORMICA
               Z.  I should have known.  All that
               work, all that preparation, come to
               nothing.  All because of one stinking
               ant.

     He steps forward to address the surrounded, trapped workers.

                         FORMICA
               ALRIGHT.  WHICH ONE OF YOU IS Z?

     The workers, trembling but silent, cower inside the unbroken
     circle of soldiers.

                         FORMICA
               WHAT ARE YOU, DEAF?  I ASKED YOU,
               WHERE'S Z?

     Formica laughs, shaking his head.

                         FORMICA
               Folks, you may have survived that
               flood, but there's no way you're
               gonna escape from me.  I'll make you
               a deal.  Hand over the rebel leader
               Z, and you survive.

     This sends a ripple of murmurs through the workers.

                         FORMICA
               But if you don't hand him over,
               you're all going to die, each and
               every single..."individual" one of
               you.

     The workers all look at each other.

                         FORMICA
               What shall it be, workers?

     The workers remain frightened but silent.  Z trembles,
     terrified.

                         FORMICA
               Have it your way.

     As Formica raises his swagger stick to order the attack, a
     lone figure steps out from the crowd.

                         Z
               Wait...

     Z stands there, shivering with fear.

                         Z
               ...I'm Z.

     For a moment, Z stands alone, under the glare of Formica's
     gaze.

     Then another figure steps out from the throng of workers.

                         WEAVER
               No, I'm Z.

     Z turns, astonished, to see Weaver, still and unwavering,
     bravely risking his life for his friend.  Then, AZTECA also
     steps forward.

                         AZTECA
               I'm Z!

     Next, Bala comes forward.

                         BALA
               No, I'm Z.

     More and more ants step forward.

                         WORKERS
               I'm Z!  I'm Z!  I'm Z and so is my
               brother!  I've been Z for weeks now!

                         QUEEN
                      (regally)
               We are Z.

     Now, the workers are all shouting the same declaration.

                         ALL
               I am Z!  I am Z!  I am Z!

     Z is plainly flabbergasted.  Formica is outraged.  He gives
     the signal.

                         FORMICA
               ATTACK!

     The army swells forward on all sides, pushing the workers
     towards the swirling water.  Some workers surround the Queen
     to protect her.  All seems lost, when THE FLY from Insectopia
     alights on the rim of the horizon.

                         FLY
               Hey, guys!

     THE WASP appears on the other side of the horizon.

                         WASP
               It's them!

     Suddenly, on all sides, A MASSIVE INSECT ARMY appears on the
     ridge, looking not unlike ambushing Indians in a John Ford
     film.  Formica's soldiers stop in their tracks, awed by the
     unfolding spectacle.  It looks like all of Insectopia has
     turned out: spiders, caterpillars, rhinoceros beetles, all
     manner of creatures crawling and flying have shown up, and
     now surround the army, dwarfing them.

                         WASP
               Are these hooligans giving you
               trouble, Z?

                         FLY
               Say the word, Z, and we kick their
               butts.

     The ant army remains frozen, unsure of what to do next.
     Formica is furious.  If ants had veins, Formica's would be
     bulging out of his face.

                         FORMICA
               What are you doing?!  ATTACK!!
                      (berating his army)
               Come on, you yellow-bellies!
                      (turning on Carpenter)
               Don't just stand there, Carpenter!
               Make an example of yourself!

                         CARPENTER
               Uh, actually, we are outnumbered
               sir...

     Formica turns towards the insects gathered against him.  With
     his chin raised pridefully, Formica steps forward, and
     CHARGES Z!

                         FORMICA
               AHHHHHHH!!

     Formica runs so quickly and with such force that his helmet
     blows off his head.  Z's eyes get big, he stumbles backwards,
     slipping, and Formica goes flying over him, toward the
     whirlpool behind.  He scrabbles at the edge of the water, and
     then tumbles over.

     For a moment, it looks as if he's gone.

                         FORMICA (O.S.)
               Help...help me...

     Z goes to the edge of the precipice and looks over.  Formica
     is struggling in the waters of the very flood he created,
     which are roiling not far below.  He looks up into Z's eyes,
     a new expression crossing his features: fear.

                         FORMICA
               Please...I...I can't swim...Help me...

     Formica goes under for a bit, then his head comes up again --
     but he's not going to be able to stay afloat for long...

     Suddenly he sees a line dropped down.  Above, Z looks down on
     him.

                         Z
               I thought you said that the life of
               one ant doesn't matter.

     Formica looks at the line...and in that moment seems to
     realize his error...

                         FORMICA
               I guess it does...to the ant.

     Formica reaches up and takes the line, and is pulled up by Z
     and a bunch of other ants (the line, we see, extends from a
     nearby spider, one of the cavalry from Insectopia).

     Formica is left, broken and alone, by the precipice, while
     HORDES OF ANTS surround Z to congratulate him.  Bala fights
     her way to his side and the two of them embrace.  Then the
     ants pick up Z and Bala, and, CHEERING, bear them away.

     Only Carpenter stays behind.  He walks up to Formica,
     carrying his dented and dusty helmet.  He cleans it the best
     he can with his jacket sleeve and hands it to his fallen
     general.

                         CARPENTER
               Sir, if it's any consolation, I still
               think you're completely worthless as
               an individual.

                                              FADE TO:

     CLOSE UP OF Z

     As he addresses the audience, stand-up style.

                         Z
               So, uh, that's pretty much it.  Just
               your basic "simple worker overthrows
               the government and winds up with the
               princess" kind of a story.
               You know: there was the big parade
               and everything...

                                              CUT TO:

     INT. TOWN CENTER - DAY

     A HUGE ASSEMBLY OF ANTS applauds as Z who is given a medal by
     the Queen.

                                              CUT TO:

     GENERAL FORMICA'S FACE, looking extremely dispeptic.

                         Z (V.O.)
               General Formica was almost
               unemployable.  He eventually got a
               gig as a honeydew keg.

     PULL BACK TO REVEAL Formica clinging to a wall, his belly
     hideously distended with honeydew.

                         Z (V.O.)
               The Queen asked me to take over his
               job, but I said "Sorry, but I'm
               really not the general type.  I'm
               more the specific type."  So they
               gave the job to Weaver instead.

                                              CUT TO:

     WEAVER, in Formica's old office, in a general's uniform, his
     feet up on Formica's desk, smoking a cigar.  Carpenter is on
     his hands and knees scrubbing the floor.

                         Z (V.O.)
               Weaver cut the defense budget in
               half.  Now we only have an army of
               five million.

     cut back to

     Z, ADDRESSING THE AUDIENCE.

                         Z
               And me, I guess you could say that I
               lived happily ever after.

     Bala enters the frame, embraces and kisses him.

                         Z
               I mean, I've got the whole package,
               right?  A great life, a beautiful
               wife, and a few kids.

                         BALA
               A few?

     WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL

     INT. Z'S HOUSE - DAY

     Z and Bala stand in the midst of their living room, up to
     their knees in THOUSANDS OF CHILD ANTS.  The children cover
     every horizontal surface.  They run around, cry, laugh, and
     tease each other.  Z looks around the room, looks back at us,
     and shrugs.

                         Z
               Well, so nothing's perfect.  But you
               know?  I wouldn't change a thing.

     The camera pulls up...and away from the ground...to reveal
     that this whole story has been taking place in a small area
     of CENTRAL PARK.  We pull back and back, and see all the
     familiar landmarks from the story: the bike path, the
     drinking fountain, etc.  We tilt up into the NEW YORK
     SKYLINE.  BIG MUSICAL FLOURISH.

     FADE OUT.

     THE END

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1	  GRAINY BLACK AND WHITE - CLOSE-UP - A MAN'S DESPERATE FACE	 1
	   This is Ash, mid twenties, square jaw firmly set and a pair of
	   haunted eyes which dart about quickly in fear. Ash speaks to
	   the CAMERA with urgency:
					   ASH
			   Why would you say that I am
			   insane?  I wouldn't say that I've
			   lost my mind simply because I've
			   heard the voices and seen the
			   godless things moving in the
			   woods. If anything, I think more
			   clearly now than ever before. I
			   know now that there is such a
			   thing as a living Evil. A dark
			   and shapeless thing that lives
			   not in the spaces we know, but
			   between them. In the Dark. In the
			   night. And it wants the exact same
			   thing as you and I: a chance at
			   warm life on this Earth. It
			   doesn't care that is already had
			   that chance ...once. Now listen
			   closely because there isn't much
			   time. Listen and believe, because
			   it's all true.
									   DISSOLVE TO:
2	  EXT. A LOG CABIN - NIGHT								2
	   nestled in a dark forest. Through the window, we see the tiny
	   figure of Ash picking up a book from a desk.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   I first saw the damn thing at that
			   blasted cabin. The Necronomicon.
			   An ancient Sumarrian text, bound
			   in human flesh and inked in human
			   blood. It contained bizarre burial
			   rites, prophesies...and
			   instruction for demon
			   resurrection. It was never meant
			   for the world of the living.

									   DISSOLVE TO:
3	  INT. CABIN - NIGHT									 3
	   Ash flips through the pages from the BOOK OF THE DEAD.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   The book awoke something dark in
			   the woods.
									   SUPERIMPOSE:
4	  BOOK OF THE DEAD - CAMERA PANNING STRANGE SCRIPT			 4
	   inscribed on the pages.  Illustrations of demonic faces with
	   white eyes.
5	  EXT. WOODS - NIGHT									 5
	   We take the point of view of a wind-like demon, swooping low
	   through the woods toward the cabin.  CAMERA rips through the
	   cabin door and comes upon a SCREAMING Ash.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   It got into my hand and it went
			   bad.
6	  CLOSE ON ASH'S POSSESSED HAND							6
	   twisting into a claw, before the flashing thunder clouds.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   So I lopped it off at the wrist.
7	  INT. CABIN - NIGHT									 7
	   ASH severs his hand from his wrist with the chainsaw.
8	  BLOOD RED CLOUDS									   8
	   sweep past the moon.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   In order to rid myself of the foul
			   thing, I read from a passage in
			   the book that was supposed to open
			   a hole.  A hole in Time that would
			   send the Evil back. And it worked.
9	  A BANDAGED, ONE HANDED ASH							   9
	   recites the incantation from the Necronomicon.
10	 EXT. CABIN - NIGHT									 10
	   The Time vortex is created.  Trees and a 1973 Delta 88
	   Oldsmobile are sucked up into the funnel cloud.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   ...I just didn't plan on coming
			   along.
11	 EXT. CABIN - NIGHT									 11
	   Ash, now armed with shotgun and chainsaw, is swallowed by the
	   funnel-cloud of the Time vortex.
12	 INT. TIME VORTEX									   12
	   Ash is rocketing through a funnel of swirling clouds.  He is
	   swept away from us, hand over foot, through the dark void of
	   Time.
13	 ANIMATION - A TENDRIL OF SMOKE						    13
	   swirls through blackness as a chorus of women's voices build
	   to eerie crescendo, from a musical note to a SCREAM.  The smoke
	   swirls, pulls in upon itself, like a thing alive, and forms the
	   words:
					   "BRUCE CAMPBELL"
					   "Vs"
	   The smoke is wisked away, then reforms as...
					   "THE ARMY OF DARKNESS"
	   The title billows past CAMERA REVEALING...
14	 INT. TIME VORTEX									   14
	   A GRANDFATHER CLOCK
	   its hands winding backwards at an insane rate, spins angrily
	   past, revealing other debris that has been swept up into this
	   funnel cloud. Tumbling weightless through this void we find...
15	 ASH												 15
	   He SCREAMS but there is no sound. No scream. Only the steady
	   BEATING of his heart.
16	 ANGLE ON ASH FRONT SCREEN PROJECTION					   16
	   He shields his eyes from a sudden bright light.  The funnel
	   cloud electrifies.
17	 ASH'S BODY										    17
	   RIPS at the fabric of Time.
18	 EXT. CLOUDY SKY - DAY								   18
	   All is quiet.  Then, an electrical disturbance in the shape of
	   a human body flashes briefly and is gone.  A moment latter, Ash
	   appears and tumbles from the sky, falling past CAMERA.
19	 EXT. BARREN WASTELAND - DAY							  19
	   ASH falls to the dust.  His double barrelled shotgun lands
	   beside him.  The '73 Oldsmobile comes CRASHING to the ground
	   a moment later.
20	 ASH												 20
	   looks up from the dust to behold...
21	 TWENTY-FIVE MOUNTED HORSEMEN							 21
	   in 12th century armor ride up over a hill.  They halt before
	   Ash.
22	 WARRIOR #1										    22
	   thrusts his longsword into the air, shouting:
					   WARRIOR #1
			   Hail to him who has come from the
			   sky to deliver us from the terror
			   of the Deadites!  Hail!
23	 ASH												 23
	   stares in confusion at the strange medieval figures.
24	 TWENTY-FIVE WARRIOR									24
	   join in the chant and hail Ash, but suddenly stop as...
25	 ARTHUR											   25
	   the muscular commander of the group, gallops his horse into
	   frame, followed by FOUR HORSEMEN who are his lieutenants. Arthur
	   lifts his iron visor and evaluates Ash.
26	 ARTHUR'S P.O.V.									    26
	   The Delta 88 Oldsmobile. The chainsaw, strapped to Ash's back.
	   The handless stump of Ash's right arm.  The Shotgun.
27	 A FRIGHTENED ASH									   27
	   waves a shaky hand.
					   ASH
			   Take is easy now chief. I don't
			   know how I got here and I'm not
			   lookin' for any trouble.
28	 WISEMAN JOHN										  28
	   An elderly man, in a long black cloak, steps forward.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   My Lord Arthur, I believe he is
			   the promised one, written of in
			   the Necronomicon.
29	 ARTHUR											   29
	   Brings his sword down across Ash's chest. Ash cries out in pain
	   as...
30	 ASH'S CHEST										   30
	   is cut. A thin red gash.
					   ARTHUR
			   He bleeds.  As a man bleeds.  The
			   one written of in the Book would
			   not bleed.
31	 ARTHUR GESTURES									    31
	   and CAMERA PANS to four prisoners bound in iron shackles.
					   ARTHUR
			   Likely, he is one of Henry's men.
			   I say to the pit with him!  If he
			   is truly the promised one... he
			   will emerge.
					   WARRIOR #2 AND #3
			   Aye!  The pit's a fair test!
					   GOLD TOOTHED WARRIOR
			   To the pit with the blackard!
32	 GOLD TOOTH										    32
	   charges his horse at Ash. But he is met with the wooden stock
	   of Ash's shotgun as it swings into frame, cracking against his
	   jaw.
33	 WIDE SHOT - GOLD TOOTH - STUNTMAN						 33
	   He tumbles from the horse.
34	 ASH												 34
	   leaps atop Gold Tooth's horse and jerks the reigns.
35	 LONG SHOT - ASH'S HORSE								 35
	   rears up, kicking it's hooves into the air.
36	 ASH												 36
	   gallops off as Warrior #2 runs at him. Ash kicks him in the face
	   as he gallops past.  The Warrior is sent reeling.
37	 TRUCKING SHOT - ASH									37
	   galloping over a hill.  He is almost thrown by the horse, but
	   manages to hang on for dear life.
					   ASH
			   Where the hell they put the
			   stirrups on this thing!!??
38	 CLOSE SHOT - ASH'S FEET								 38
	   grasping at the side of the horse, hoping to find some purchase.
39	 LONG SHOT - ASH - STUNTMAN							   39
	   he rides past CAMERA, almost falling from the horse.
40	 ANGLE ON ARTHUR									    40
					   ARTHUR
			   LIEUTENANTS!  Fetch me the blackard.
41	 TWO OF ARTHUR'S ARMORED HORSEMEN						  41
	   unsheathe their broadswords and gallop after Ash. The remaining
	   Warriors watch for sport.
42	 HIGH SHOT - TWO HORSEMEN								42
	   They are gaining an Ash.
43	 ASH												 43
	   glances behind him.
44	 ASH'S P.O.V. - TRUCKING SHOT - TWO HORSEMEN IN PURSUIT		44
	   They diverge to either side of CAMERA.
45	 ASH												 45
	   whips his horse.
					   ASH
			   GIDDYPU!
46	 THE FIRST HORSEMAN									 46
	   rides up alongside Ash and swings his Broadsword.
	   WHOOSH!!!
47	 ASH												 47
	   ducks the blade.
48	 THE SECOND HORSEMAN									48
	   rides up alongside Ash's other flank.  He swings and lands the
	   flat part of his blade along Ash's back.
	   THUNK!
49	 ASH												 49
	   ducks as the first horseman swings his blade again.
	   WHOOSH!
	   ASH looks left...
50	 THE SECOND HORSEMAN									50
	   winds up for another blow.
51	 ASH												 51
	   yanks back upon his horse's reigns.
52	 THE THREE HORSES									   52
	   running side by side. Ash's horse drops back suddenly.
53	 THE SECOND HORSEMAN									53
	   swings.
54	 HIS BROADSWORD										54
	   slams the First Horseman across the face.
55	 THE FIRST HORSEMAN									 55
	   is knocked from his steed.
56	 TRUCKING SHOT - THE FIRST HORSEMAN						56
	   is moving fast when he hits the ground. His armored form tumbles
	   end over end in the dust, clanging to a halt against a rock.
57	 THE SECOND HORSEMAN									57
	   turns around and gallops back toward Ash.
58	 WIDE SHOT - ASH AND THE SECOND HORSEMAN					58
	   ride at one another.
59	 TRUCKING SHOT - THE SECOND SWORDMAN AS HE RIDES			  59
	   swinging his Broadsword.
60	 TRUCKING SHOT - ASH AS HE RIDES						   60
	   He inserts the stump of his right arm into the female end of
	   his chainsaw arm bracket.
	   FOOMP!  He twists his stump and the chainsaw bracket locks into
	   place.  CLINK!
	   He thrusts his chainsaw arm outward, pulling on the starter
	   cord; PUTT-PUTT-PUTT... The engine won't turn over.  He curses
	   and yanks again.
61	 THE SECOND HORSEMAN									61
	   draws close. He leans from his horse and swings his Broadsword
	   mightily.  The flat portion of the blade connects. THUNK!
62	 ASH												 62
	   is knocked from his steed.  He tumbles to the dust, narrowly
	   escaping his own horse's hooves.
63	 ASH												 63
	   rolls to his feet and spins to the sound of approaching hooves!
64	 THE SECOND HORSEMAN									64
	   charges and swings his broadsword.
65	 ASH												 65
	   raises his chainsaw.  CLINK!  He deflects the blow. Ash swings

	   the chainsaw in a roundhouse motion, clipping the Second
	   Horseman as he rides past.
66	 TRUCKING SHOT - THE SECOND HORSEMAN					    66
	   is knocked from his horse.
67	 LOW TRUCKING SHOT - THE SECOND HORSEMAN					67
	   bounces along the rocky ground, kicking up dust.
68	 A SWORD HANDLE										68
	   slams against the back of Ash's skull.
69	 ASH												 69
	   crumples.  He looks up in pain to...
70	 ARTHUR											   70
	   above him. The sun over his shoulder.
71	 EIGHT MOUNTED WARRIORS								  71
	   gallop up, dismount and surround Ash with swords drawn.
					   ARTHUR
			   Bring the prisoner!
	   The warriors surge upon Ash. His sawed-off shotgun and chainsaw
	   are taken from him.
					   ASH
			   No!
72	 GOLD TOOTH AND OTHER WARRIORS							72
	   secure Ash to a set of iron shackles that painfully extend his
	   arms. A collar forces his neck upward.
					   ARTHUR
			   To the castle!
73	 WARRIOR #2 ON HORSEBACK								 73
	   prods Ash along with a rod attached to his spiked iron collar.
	   The Warriors gallop off, forcing Ash and the other prisoners
	   to run alongside them.
74	 WISEMAN JOHN										  74
	   Picks up the chainsaw and sawed off shotgun from the dust.  He
	   is troubled by the strange objects. Sunlight glints off the
	   blade of the chainsaw, blinding the CAMERA.
									   DISSOLVE TO:
75	 THE HOT ORB OF THE SUN								  75
	   blazing in the sky above the wasteland.
									   DISSOLVE TO:
76	 EXT. PARCHED LAND - DAY - A WEARY ASH					  76
	   bound in his iron shackles, whipped by Gold Tooth, who rides
	   alongside him.
					   GOLD TOOTH
			   Move along now!
									   DISSOLVE TO:
77	 LONGSHOT - A WIND SWEPT LANDSCAPE OF CRAGGY ROCK			 77
	   CAMERA PANS along the line of Arthur and his horsemen, to find
	   a 12TH CENTURY BATTLE CASTLE built on the edge of a great cliff.
	   A drawbridge is lowered.  Arthur's warriors ride over it.

78	 CAMERA TRACKING WITH ASH								78
	   shackled alongside other prisoners, is prodded inside the castle
	   walls.
79	 INT. CASTLE COURTYARD								   79
	   SHEILA
	   a striking, blonde haired maiden, rushes into frame. She
	   searches the faces of Arthur's warriors and grows concerned.
	   She pushes through a crowd of villagers and calls up to Arthur
	   atop his horse.
					   SHEILA
			   M'Lord Arthur!  Where is my brother?
			   Did he not ride with you?
					   ARTHUR
			   Eye.  And fought valiantly.  But
			   last night fell in battle to Duke
			   Henry's men.
	   SHEILA
	   Her face does not immediately register the grief.  She attempts
	   to step forward but stumbles.  She steadies herself against the
	   stone wall. Her eyes harden as she sees the first of the
	   shackled prisoners: a semi-conscious Ash.
	   She flushes with anger and races up to him. She spits and kicks
	   at him as he's dragged along.
					   SHEILA
			   Foul thing!  A pox on your throat!
			   Thou art a Murderer!  A black
			   Murderer!
80	 VILLAGE WOMEN										 80
	   restrain her.
	   SHEILA
	   cries as the Village Women attempt to soothe her.
					   VILLAGE WOMAN #1
			   May you be consoled by their
			   suffering in the pit.
81	 THE PROCESSION, ASH AND THE FOUR OTHER PRISONERS			 81
	   halt. Iron keys rattle. The shackles are unlocked. Ash and the
	   prisoners rub their reddened wrists. They are pushed at
	   swordpoint towards a circular iron grate that sits atop the
	   ground. This is THE PIT.
82	 ASH												 82
	   looks to the jeering villagers that surround the pit, wondering
	   what they have in store for him.
83	 SHEILA											   83
	   stares at him in hatred.
84	 THE PRISONER NEXT TO ASH								84
	   eyes Ash curiously.  This is Duke Henry the Red.
					   DUKE HENRY
			   You sir, are not one of my
			   vassals.  Who are you?
					   ASH
			   Who wants to know?
					   DUKE HENRY
			   I am Henry the Red. Duke of Shale.
			   Lord of the Northlands and leader
			   of its people.
					   ASH
			   You ain't leadin' but two things
			   now, pal. Jack and shit.  And Jack
			   left town.
85	 A STERN FACED ARTHUR AND HIS FOUR LIEUTENANTS			    85
	   address the doomed men:
					   ARTHUR
			   There is an Evil that has awakened
			   in this land.  And whilst my
			   people fight for their very souls
			   against it, you, Duke Henry the
			   Red, wage war on us. Your people
			   are no better than the foul
			   corruption that lies in the bowels
			   of that pit!  May God have mercy
			   on your souls.
86	 TWO OF ARTHUR'S MEN									86
	   crank a massive wench.  Chains tighten and the heavy iron lid
	   slides back, revealing a dark hole.  The Pit.
87	 FROM THE BOWELS OF THE IRON GRATED PIT					 87
	   a echoed wailing rises up.
88	 ASH, HENRY AND THE OTHER PRISONERS						88
	   stiffen in fear.
89	 AN OLD WOMAN AMONGST THE JEERING CROWD					 89
					   OLD WOMAN
			   Aye. Into the pit with the
			   bloodthirsty sons of whores!
	   She jams a meat pie into her mouth and cheers excitedly as
	   CAMERA PANS TO...
90	 HENRY'S WARRIOR #1									 90
	   as he's thrown down into the pit.  He disappears into the
	   blackness.
91	 CAMERA PANS AND HALTS CLOSE ON ASH						91
	   watching with disbelief.  We hear the warrior's echoed cry of
	   terror, then a SPLASH as he hits bottom.
92	 CLOSE ON THE EDGE OF THE PIT							 92
	   looking down into the blackness we hear:
					   HENRY'S WARRIOR #1 (O.S.)
			   I beg of you... by all that's
			   holy!  Lower a rope!  Lower... Oh,
			   for the love of god!  no!  NO!!!
			   AIIIIIiiieee!
	   The sound of ripping and scratching.  The SHRIEK of terror is
	   cut short as...
	   A GEYSER OF BLOOD
	   erupts upward from the pit. Then silence.
93	 ASH												 93
	   is frozen in fear.
					   TOWER GUARD (O.S.)
			   There!  He's escaping!
	   ASH'S TERRIFIED GAZE
	   jerks from the pit to...
94	 TRACKING SHOT - HENRY'S WARRIOR #2						94
	   making a break for it!  He's past the guards, heading for the open
	   drawbridge.
95	 THE TOWER ARCHERS									  95
	   spot him and fire arrows.
96	 ANGLE ON											 96
	   PING!  PING!
	   They bounce off the Warrior's armor.  He's makes it to the open
	   drawbridge when...
97	 ARTHUR											   97
	   pulls back a iron arrow in his crossbow.  ZING!  He lets it fly.
	   CAMERA SWISH PANS with arrow...
98	 PAN HALTS ON HENRY'S WARRIOR #2						   98
	   The iron arrow punctures the Warrior's armor, pegging him to
	   a wooden post.  He dies standing.
99	 THE CROWD											99
	   Cheers.  They turn their attention to the remaining prisoners:
	   CAMERA PANS from their bloodthirsty faces to the next prisoner
	   in line...
100	ASH												 100
	   turns to Arthur and in a desperate, cowardly plea:
					   ASH
			   Hey, I never even saw these
			   assholes before..
	   He spins to Duke Henry the Red.
			   You gotta tell 'em you don't know
			   me. We never met. Tell him.
					   HENRY
			   I do not believe that he shall
			   listen.
101	THE WARRIORS										  101
	   grab Ash and shove him into the pit.
102	ASH												 102
	   tumbles down into the pit.  He lands in a STEAMING pool of foul
	   water at the pit's bottom.  He stands and coughs out a mouthful

	   of the rancid water. He looks about.
103	INT. PIT - ASH'S P.O.V.								 103
	   UNDERGROUND CAVERNS disappear into the blackness.
104	ASH												 104
	   spins to a small sound.
105	INT. PIT - ASH'S P.O.V.								 105
	   Nothing.  Just the mist rising from the water.
106	ASH												 106
	   shifts his glance again.
107	A SHADOW											 107
	   rounds a corner and disappears from sight.
108	ASH												 108
	   doesn't notice the misty water behind him beginning to stir.
	   Bubbles. A hand emerges. Silently, a pair of bone white eyes
	   break the surface.
109	ASH												 109
	   spins... but there's nothing there.  As he turns back around,
	   he is confronted by...
	   A FEMALE EVIL DEAD
	   It's rotted corpse rockets up from the water inches from Ash's
	   face!
110	CLOSER											   110
	   Putrid water drains from it's empty eye sockets and mouth. It
	   jerks like a marionette as it advances.
111	ASH SCREAM										    111
	   and backs against the steep rock wall of the pit.  He tries to
	   scale the steep face. He gets one foot up.
112	THE DEADITE'S HAND									 112
	   clutches Ash's ankle and yanks him back down.
113	DOWN ANGLE ON ASH									  113
	   He falls away from the wall, his arms flailing.
114	ABOVE THE PIT - GOLD TOOTH AND OTHER VILLAGERS			   114
	   hoot and cheer for Ash to be devoured.
115	THE PIT - THE DEADITE								   115
	   grabs Ash, and begins hammering him with her rotted fists.
116	ABOVE THE PIT - SHEILA								  116
	   shouts for Ash's death.
117	THE PIT - ASH'S FACE								    117
	   The Deadite's fist enters frame, slugging Ash.
118	LONG SHOT - ASH									    118
	   is knocked back into a shallow pool of steaming water.
119	THE DEADITE										   119
	   races toward Ash, leaps into the air and comes down with a
	   kneedrop onto Ash's stomach.
120	ASH												 120
	   cries out in pain.
121	ASH'S LEGS										    121
	   cross to form a scissor lock around the Deadite's throat.  He
	   flips the beast.
122	ABOVE THE PIT - WISEMAN JOHN							 122
	   rides into the castle, dismounts and pushes through the crowd
	   with a bundle wrapped in cloth.
123	THE DEADITE										   123
	   grabs Ash by the throat.
124	THE PIT - A BLOODIED ASH								124
	   is thrown against the rock wall of the pit.
125	THE DEADITE										   125
	   advances.
126	ABOVE THE PIT - WISEMAN JOHN							 126
	   shouts down at Ash.
127	THE PIT - ASH										 127
	   trying to hear what the Wiseman is saying. His head jolts
	   backward, barely avoiding the beast's wild swing. Ash squints
	   to discern Wiseman John throwing something down to him: an
	   object falling at him through the glare above.
128	THE CHAINSAW - SLOW MOTION							   128
	   tumbling downward.  Blinding beams of sunlight bouncing off its
	   blade of steel.  Ash's Excalibur!
129	ASH - SLOW MOTION									  129
	   summons his strength and leaps upward.
130	LOW ANGLE - LOOKING UP - THE CHAINSAW - SLOW MOTION		   130
	   Tumbling downward...
131	HIGH ANGLE- ASH									    131
	   ascending, his teeth gritted, every muscle straining, he soars
	   past CAMERA.
132	LONG SHOT - SLOW MOTION								 132
	   Ash rising up through frame to meet the falling saw.
133	ASH'S STUMP										   133
	   snags the chainsaw, locking in onto his wrist bracket.CLICK!
134	ASH WITH HIS CHAINSAW								   134
	   He lands on his feet, in the path of the approaching beast.
					   ASH
			   Come on, you blasted piece of--
	   He thrusts out his chainsaw arm, yanking the starter cord and...
	   VERRROOOOOOM!!
135	ABOVE THE PIT - THE WARRIOR AND VILLAGERS				   135
	   gasp at the ROAR of the chainsaw.  Blue exhaust billows up from
	   the pit.
136	THE PIT - LOW ANGLE - THE DEADITE						 136
	   lunges at Ash.
137	DEADITE HAND MEETS SAW								  137
	   Buzzzzz!!
138	ASH												 138
	   is splattered with black bile.
139	THE DEADITE'S SEVERED HAND							   139
	   flies upward, past the face of the bewildered beast.
140	CAMERA MOUNTED TO THE HAND							   140
	   as it ascends, Ash and the Deadite grow smaller below.
141	ABOVE THE PIT - THE DEADITE'S SEVERED HAND				  141
	   flies up into frame and latches onto the face of a drunken
	   spectator. It's fingers dig into the eyes and nose. He shrieks
	   and flails about, into the screaming crowd. A Warrior tears the
	   hand free from his face, tossing it back down into the pit.
142	THE PIT - ASH										 142
	   raises the chainsaw blade and neatly bisects the falling deadite
	   hand.  He spins and with a roundhouse blow...
143	CAMERA MOUNTED ON ASH								   143
	   Ash decapitates the beast.
144	ABOVE THE PIT - THE WARRIORS AND VILLAGERS				  144
	   stop cheering from the Deadite. They're starting to like this
	   guy's guts and style.
145	THE LAST REMNANTS									  145
	   of the beast sink beneath the murky waters of the pit.
146	ASH												 146
	   climbs the steep wall of the pit when a SECOND DEADITE emerges
	   from the earthen wall before him.
147	ASH												 147
	   slams the butt end of the chainsaw into the beast, knocking it
	   back into the water.
148	ABOVE THE PIT - THE VILLAGERS							148
	   gasp as...
	   THUMP!
149	ASH'S CHAINSAW ARM									 149
	   comes up, over the edge of the pit.  Followed by... THUMP!  Ash's
	   bloody hand.  Then his bruised face.  Covered in the black blood
	   of the Deadites. He crawls to his feet.
	   Ash tuns to the crowd, his list clenched.
					   ASH
			   All right now. Who wants to be
			   next?  Who wants some.
150	GOLD TOOTH										    150
	   look at Ash stupidly. Ash shoves him.
					   ASH
			   You want some more?  Huh?!
	   Gold Tooth and the others give him a wide berth. Ash calls out
	   to Henry.
					   ASH
			   Now climb on those horses and get
			   out of here.
151	HENRY AND HIS TWO WARRIORS							   151
	   quickly mount horses.
					   ARTHUR
			   Nay. Henry is my prisoners. He--
152	ASH												 152
	   slaps Henry's horse.
					   ASH
			   GIDDYUP NOW!!  HYAAAH!
153	THE STUNNED CROWD									  153
	   parts allowing...
154	HENRY AND HIS WARRIORS								  154
	   to gallop off toward the open drawbridge and freedom.
155	ARTHUR											   155
	   stares at Ash with hatred.
					   ARTHUR
			   For that, I shall see you dead.
156	ASH												 156
	   removes his sawed off shotgun from Wiseman John's horse and
	   turns to Arthur, then the crowd.
					   ASH
			   This is my boomstick. It's a
			   twelve gauge, double barreled
			   Remington pump. Next one of you
			   primitives touch me...
157	ASH SPINS,										    157
	   pointing the barrel just past Arthur. He, but no one else, has
	   spotted the surviving Second Deadite crawling up from the pit
	   on the forgotten chain.
	   The crowds gasp is cut short by....BLAMMITY-BLAM!
	   The shotgun belches flame. The blast cuts the chain, leaving
	   the Deadite teetering at the pit's edge.
158	ANGLE ON											 158
	   BLAMMITY-BLAM!
	   The second shot blows the beast into a backflip, sending it
	   summersaulting down into the pit.
159	THE SOUND OF THE GUNBLAST							    159
	   echoes off the mountains like distant thunder.
160	SHEILA, THE WISEMAN, ARTHUR AND THE CROWD				   160
	   look to Ash in reverence.

161	ASH												 161
	   twirls the shotgun about western style: WHOOSH, WHOOSH,
	   WHOOSH...  and holsters it.
					   ASH
			   Bring me your hoo do man.
162	EXT. BLACKBIRDS									    162
	   fly from a barren tree.
163	SOMETHING MOVES IN THE DARKNESS						   163
	   It prowls, skimming the surface of the ground, moving swiftly
	   past rocks and over the crest of a hill revealing...
164	EXT. TEMPLE RUINS - LONG SHOT - NIGHT					  164
	   A massive grouping of freestanding rectangular stones, each
	   twenty feet tall.  The remains of an ancient temple.  In the
	   center of the ruins there burns a roaring bonfire.  As old Woman
	   stirs a cauldron atop the flames.  Nearby, Arthur converses with
	   his four Lieutenants.
165	EXT. WITHIN THE RUINS - NIGHT							165
	   CLOSE UP - ASH
	   opens his mouth to allow a spoonful of food to enter.  No sooner
	   has he swallowed then a piece of fruit is offered.  He waves
	   it away with a satisfied burp and turns to drink from a goblet
	   on wine, brought to his lips by a female hand.
166	ASH AND SHEILA										166
	   sits across the flames from Arthur and his men.  She bandages
	   Ash's wounds.
167	SHEILA											   167
	   is dresses in a revealing tunic. She looks good.
					   SHEILA
			   I pray thee to forgive me.  I
			   believed thee one of Henry's men.
	   She touches Ash's hand. Ash turns away
					   ASH
			   First you wanta kill me, now ya
			   wanna kiss me.
	   He spits out a mouthful of grape seeds.
					   ASH
			   Lady, just leave me alone.
					   SHEILA
			   I'm sorry m'lord. Please
			   understand... T'is a cruel time
			   for us. The Wisemen say you are
			   the promised one. Our only hope
			   against the darkness that has
			   descended on this land.
					   ASH
			   They're mistaken.
	   She stares deeply into his eyes.
					   SHEILA
			   I think not.  I feel that there
			   is reason for your being here.
			   It is no accident.
166	WISEMAN JOHN AND TWO OTHER CLOAKED WISEMEN				  167
	   approach.  They sit in tall stone chairs across the fire from
	   Ash.
					   ASH
			   Well what is it?  Can you send me
			   back or not?
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   Only the Necronomicon has the
			   power.  A power which we both
			   require. It contains passages that
			   can dispel the Evil from this
			   place and return you to your time.
					   ASH
			   The Necronomicon. Yeah, that's
			   the thing that got me here.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   It is in a place far from here.
			   It can only be retrieved by the
			   Promised one. Other Warriors have
			   tried.  Their widows grieve still.
			   We have waited long years for you.
			   Out only hope is the Necronomicon.
			   Thou must undertake to quest for
			   it.  Alone must thou travel to
			   a distant cemetery. There thou
			   shalt find it.
					   ASH
			   Me?  Now way, no day. Only place I'm
			   goin' is home.
	   A sudden gust of wind whips up the flames of the fire.
169	DOGS												169
	   around the fire begin to snarl and fight.
170	ASH AND SHEILA										170
	   turn to see...
171	THE OLD WOMAN										 171
	   now standing too close to the fire.  Her robes ignites.  She does
	   not respond as flames sweep up her body. She continues to stir
	   the caldron.
172	ASH												 172
	   His haw drops.  He slowly stands as...
173	THE BURNING WOMAN									  173
	   spins sharply to him.  Her voice changes as she SHRIEKS;
					   POSSESSED WOMAN
			   YOU SHALL DIE!
	   Her eyes are bone white.  She is POSSESSED by the dark spirit.
	   Her burning body is violently jerked about in the air by
	   invisible hands. Her blackened lips pull back in a wild animal
	   snarl. With two voice at once;
					   POSSESSED WOMAN
			   YOU SHALL NEVER WIN THE
			   NECRONOMICON.  WE SHALL FEAST UPON
			   YOUR SOUL, AND THEN THE SOUL OF
			   MAN!
174	THE POSSESSED WOMAN									174
	   collapses. Her face turned away from the Wisemen as it lays in
	   the dust.
175	CLOSE ON POSSESSED WOMAN'S FACE - GROUND LEVEL CAMERA		 175
	   Unseen by all, her bone white eyes flare open!  A nasty grin forms
	   on her face as she lies in the dust. Behind her, the Wisemen
	   approach.
176	WISEMAN JOHN										  176
	   kneels and reaches for her.
177	ASH'S HAND										    177
	   clutches Wiseman John, not allowing him to touch her.
					   ASH
			   It's a trick.  Get an axe.

178	THE POSSESSED WOMAN									178
	   awakens from her false slumber with a terrible BARK.  In a
	   frenzy she hurls WISEMAN JOHN into the bonfire. He SCREAMS and
	   rolls in the dust, extinguishing the flames.
179	PAPER MACHE STONE ARCHWAY							    179
	   With her great strength, the Possessed Woman pushes upon one
	   of the giant stone archways. It topples over, crushing two
	   warriors beneath it.
180	A GIGANTIC STONE									   180
	   topples the next stone.
	   BOOM!
	   Which topples the next, which sets off a chain reaction.
	   BOOM!  BOOM!
	   Like giant dominoes, they fall.
181	ASH												 181
	   watches the spectacle in horror as he sees...
182	ANGLE ON											 182
	   The gigantic falling stones coming right at SHEILA!
183	THE FALLING STONE'S P.O.V. - SHEILA					    183
	   She SCREAMS!
184	SHEILA'S P.O.V. - THE FALLING STONES					   184
	   coming toward CAMERA.
	   BOOM!  BOOM!  BOOM!
185	ASH												 185
	   does a flying leap and tackles SHEILA, knocking her out of the
	   stone's deadly path.
186	ASH AND SHEILA										186
	   rolls across the dusty stone courtyard.
187	CLOSE SHOT - ASH									   187
	   rolls into frame and glances up to see...
188	THE POSSESSED AND BURNING WOMAN						   188
	   rushing through the air at him with a SHRIEK!
189	WIDE SHOT - THE POSSESSED AND BURNING WOMAN				 189
	   latches onto Ash like an iron trap, knocking them both to the
	   ground.
190	ASH												 190
	   rolls the Possessed Woman over, and into the path of...
191	ANGLE ON											 191
	   The falling, gigantic domino-like stones.
	   BOOM!  BOOM!  BOOM!
192	EXT. WITHIN THE TEMPLE RUINS - PAPER MACHE STONE			 192
	   THE POSSESSES WOMAN
	   SHRIEKS in agony as... SMASH!  The multi-ton stone crushes her
	   legs to paste.  Her legs are pinned but still she battles on,
	   clutching Ash about his throat!
193	ASH												 193
	   gasps for breath as he reaches behind him, into the flames of
	   the fire, his fingers groping for a weapon.
194	POSSESSED WOMAN - STOP MOTION ANIMATION					194
	   Her blackened lips pull back and her mouth opens to an
	   impossibly large size, like a snake about to eat an egg.
195	ASH												 195
	   grasps a flaming log with his bare hands and rams it down the
	   monster's oversized throat.  She chokes.
196	GOLD TOOTH AND THREE OTHER WARRIORS					    196
	   grab the beast and pull it off of Ash.  Arthur comes to meet
	   them.  He carries a double-bladed battle axe.
197	THE POSSESSED WOMAN									197
	   vomits out the flaming log, taking off a man's head.
					   POSSESSED WOMAN
			   The Evil lives.  Slay me and ten
			   will rise to take my place.  All
			   will die.  ALL WILL -
	   CHOP!
198	IN SILHOUETTE, THE AXE								  198
	   is brought down upon her throat.  The possessed body flails and
	   spasm beneath the Warrior's grip.
199	THE HEAD											 199
	   rolls, and comes to a halt at Ash's feet.  It's eyes pop open!
					   POSSESSED WOMAN'S HEAD
			   ---DIE!
200	ARTHUR											   200
	   grabs the laughing head and tosses it into the darkness.  The
	   head sails away as the laughter receded.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   Now.  Will thou quest for the
			   Necronomicon?
201	CLOSE ON ASH										  201
	   He considers.
202	INT. CASTLE - BLACKSMITH'S WORKSHOP - DAY				   202
	   Ash and the blacksmith step into the shop.
203	ASH												 203
	   points to the hand piece on a hanging suit of battle armor.
204	THE BLACKSMITH										204
	   pounds upon the hand armor, modifying it.
205	SHEILA											   205
	   knits a grey woolen garment as she watches Ash.
206	BLACKSMITH'S WORKSHOP - DAY							  206
	   THE BLACKSMITH
	   attaches the shock absorber spring to the iron hand.
207	ASH												 207
	   tightens the tension on the shock absorber springs with a
	   ratchet like device.
208	ASH												 208
	   extends his arm triggering the tightly wound spring.
	   WHOOSH!  CLANG!
209	SHEILA											   209
	   gasps.
210	ASH'S SPRING-DRIVEN IRON HAND							210
	   SNAPS open with great force.
211	ANGLE ON											 211
	   WHOOSH CLANG!
	   ASH'S SPRING DRIVEN HAND
	   clenches closed with such great power, that it bends a iron
	   goblet.
212	CLOSE ON ASH										  212
	   He studies his new hand. It will do nicely.

									   DISSOLVE TO:
213	EXT. CASTLE TURRET - NIGHT							   213
	   ASH
	   stares over the castle wall to the foreboding wasteland with
	   apprehension.  The wind blows upon his hair. Sheila appears
	   behind him. She drapes a grey garment over Ash. A magnificent
	   cape. Ash draws her body close to his. He wraps the cape around
	   her.  Together they stare off into the night, then turn to one
	   another and kiss.
									   DISSOLVE TO:
214	EXT. LANDSCAPE OF CRACKED GROUND 1500MM LENS - DAY		    214
	   Arthur's castle in the distance.  In the foreground, five men

	   long wool capes billowing up behind them in the wind.
215	CLOSER ON RIDERS - TRUCKING SHOT						  215
	   Arthur and Wiseman John ride, flanked by two of Arthur's
	   Warriors.  CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL...
	   ASH
	   He wears an iron breastplate with the insignia of Arthur's army
	   that compliments his new spring-powered iron hand.  His chainsaw
	   juts from it's saddle holster on the horse's back.  Ash's cape
	   billows as he rides.
									   DISSOLVE TO:
216	EXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY									216

	   ARTHUR
	   points to...
217	THE TRAIL THAT LIES BEFORE THEM						   217
	   It disappears abruptly into a swirling wall of mist that emits
	   an eerie whistling.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   This is the edge of the land ruled
			   by the Dark Spirit. This path will
			   lead you to an unholy place. A

			   awaits.
218	ASH												 218
	   anxiously eyes the wall of swirling mist.
219	THE TWO WARRIORS									   219
	   finish placing saddlebags of water and food onto...

			   A moment.
220	WISEMAN JOHN										  220
	   moves close to Ash.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   As thou removest the Book from

					   ASH
			   Clatto Verata Nicto.  Okay.

					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   Repeat them.
					   ASH

			   After that I'm history.
	   Ash rears up on his horse and gallops into the mist
221	ARTHUR AND WISEMAN JOHN								 221
	   watch as Ash disappears.
222	IN A SEA OF MIST									   222
	   The sound of THUNDEROUS HOOFS.  A form materializes out of the

223	CLOSER ON ASH										 223
	   He whips the horse.
					   ASH

224	ANGLE ON ASH										  224
	   He gallops past.  CAMERA PANS as he disappears into the thick

225	EXT. TRAIL'S ENTRANCE TO WOODS						    225

227	CLOSER ON ASH										 227
	   He hears a sound and look to...
228	A SECTION OF WOODS									 228
	   A branch SCRAPING against the bark of a tree.
229	ASH												 229
	   hears a woman's soft laughter.  He glance to...
230	A BUBBLING BROOK									   230
	   and nothing more.
231	THE EVIL FORCE P.O.V.								   231
	   powers through the woods toward Ash.

	   kick his steed and bolts.
233	THE EVIL FORCE										233
	   sweeps over the forest floor, gaining velocity.
234	ASH												 234
	   frantically weaves his horse around storm felled trees which
	   jut from the ground.
235	THE EVIL FORCE										235
	   rips through the trees, splintering them to toothpicks.  It
	   burrows underground, and resurfaces, always closing upon Ash.
236	ASH												 236
	   jerks upon the reins and his steed leaps a fallen tree.  He
	   gracefully leaps a second tree.  But as he leaps over the third,
	   he is ripped off the horse by a low branch.  He falls hard to
	   the mud as the horse gallops off.
	   He groggily stands and stumbles onward.
237	THE EVIL FORCE										237
	   follows Ash down a wooded trail.

242	THE EVIL FORCE										242
	   emerges from over the ridge.
243	ASH												 243
	   unscrews his iron hand and holsters it.  He slings the chainsaw
	   from his shoulder and snaps it onto his stump bracket.  Click.
	   He threads the chainsaw starter cord through the V-SHAPED SLOT
	   that extends from his breastplate. CLICK.  He thrusts out his
	   arm and the chainsaw ROARS to life!
244	INT. SHED - CLOSE ON INTERIOR DOOR						244

			   Blasted piece of junk!
248	THE EVIL FORCE										248

250	INT. SHED											250
	   ANGLE ON DOOR
	   The partially cut log gives way.  Ash tumbles into the storage
	   shed. He slams the door shut and slides the remainder of the

251	THE EVIL FORCE										251
	   Hammers at the door of the Shed.
	   BANG!
252	INT. SHED											252
	   A terrified Ash braces his back against the door.
	   BANG!
	   Earth shaking in its intensity. The planks of the door shudder
	   behind Ash.
253	CLOSE ON LOG BOLT									  253
	   It cracks.
254	ASH												 254
	   presses himself against the door for all he's worth, praying

	   BANG!  Splinters fly.
255	CLOSE ON LOG BOLT									  255
	   BOOM!  The crack widens.
256	THE DOOR FRAME										256
	   behind Ash begins to buckle beneath the hammering blows.
257	ASH												 257
	   begins to SCREAM.  And the BANGING halts.
258	LONG SHOT - INT. SHED								   258
	   All is quiet.  Ash hugs the door. Shaking in the silence.  And
	   that's when it hits.  LIKE A LOCOMOTIVE!
	   Ash and the door he braces are blasted away from the wall of
	   the Shed as the Evil Force brings it's tremendous power to bare.
259	INT. SHED - SAM-O-CAM - INTERVOLOMETER					 259
	   TRACKING WITH ASH AND THE DOOR
	   as they are swept up at super speed in the grip of the Evil
	   Force.  Ash is seen rocketing through the long hallway of the
	   Shed, spinning head over heels.  Ash rips through other doors,
	   taking them with him. Ash is now sandwiched between two doors
	   as he flies through the air.
260	EXT. SHED - SIDE SHOT								   260
	   The roof of the shed ripples, sending tiles and wood beams
	   flying as the EVIL FORCE surges through the shed like a tidal
	   wave.
261	EXT. REAR DOOR OF SHED								  261
	   It blows out from the place in a flying stack along with the
	   other doors.  The flying doors slam against a tree and fall to
	   the ground in a stack.
262	THE EVIL FORCE										262
	   with Ash out of sight, glides forward, into the woods.
263	EXT. SHED- DUSK									    263
	   LOOKING DOWN UPON - THE STACKS OF DOORS.
	   All is quiet.  We hear the sound of a bolt moving. The doorknob
	   turns slightly.  The door swings upward and opens... revealing
	   a somewhat flattened Ash who picks his groggy and bruised self
	   up.

	   He beholds...
264	EXT. ABANDONED MILL									264
	   An empty place of stone and wood.  Driven by the wind, the
	   Mill's giant grinding wheel slowly turns with a squeak.
265	INT. MILL											265
	   ASH
	   enters the Mill.
					   ASH
			   Anybody here?!
	   The place is quiet. Ash slumps down against a wall to catch his
	   breath.
					   ASH
			   This place'll do for the night.
			   Get the book in the morning.
266	INT. MILL - THREE SHOTS - INTERVOLOMETER				    266
	   Shadows lengthen on the floor and stretch across the walls.
267	ASH												 267
	   peers through the window.
268	EXT. MILL - LONG SHOT THE SUN - DAY					    268
	   a gigantic ball of fire as it sets behind the Mill.  The wind
	   kicks up.
269	INT. MILL											269
	   ASH
	   listens as the cabin CREAKS like an old ship beneath the force
	   of the gale.
270	THE WOODEN SHUTTERS									270
	   on the window quietly KNOCK.  Ash shivers and rubs his arms for
	   warmth.
					   ASH
			   Damn this cold.
271	ASH												 271
	   looks about the Mill and spots an iron stove.
272	GASOLINE											 272
	   pours out of Ash's chainsaw over some logs in the stove's belly.
273	ASH												 273
	   lights the fire with his Zippo lighter and huddles near the
	   flame for warmth.
					   ASH
			   'least I won't freeze to death.
	   He turns to a tiny sound.
274	WIDE SHOT - ASH									    274
	   behind him, through the window, a large gnarled hand sweeps
	   past.

275	ASH												 275
	   spins, raises his shotgun and fires.
	   BLAMITY-BLAM!
	   The window is ripped away in a shower of glass.
276	ASH'S P.O.V. - THROUGH THE BROKEN WINDOW				    276
	   Only the night woods.  The "gnarled hand" comes back, sweeping
	   down in front of the broken window, but it's revealed to be just
	   a tree branch swaying in the wind.
277	ASH												 277
	   reloads. He moves to the front door and peers out through a
	   crack.
278	ASH'S EYEBALL										 278
	   through the crack in the door.
279	ASH'S P.O.V. - THE WOODS BEYOND						   279
	   CAMERA pushes through the crack to the woods beyond.  There is
	   movement.
280	LONG SHOT - EXT. MILL								   280
	   The tiny figure of Ash steps from the Mill.
281	CLOSE UP - ASH										281
	   He sweeps the barrel of the shotgun toward the sound of sticks
	   breaking.
282	ASH'S TERRIFIED HORSE								   282
	   It rears up on it's hind legs. It's front hoofs come down toward
	   Ash.
283	A STARTLED ASH										283
	   leaps aside just in time.
284	ASH												 284
	   snags the horse's reigns.
					   ASH
			   Easy, boy.
	   The horse calms.  Ash ties it to a tree, patting it's head. A
	   shadow passes behind him. He turns toward the Mill.
285	ASH'S P.O.V.  THROUGH THE MILL'S OPEN DOOR				  285
	   He sees am image of himself inside the Mill. Peering out.
286	EXT. MILL											286
	   ASH
	   stares in disbelief, then the wind slams the front door of the
	   Mill, halting Ash's view. Ash races for the Mill.
287	INT. MILL											287
	   ASH
	   races through the door and toward CAMERA when...SMASH...Ash's
	   reflection shatters. He's run into a mirror. Shivering, he picks
	   himself up from the pile of broken glass. He moves to the
	   fireplace and hunches before the flames, CAMERA PANS TO....
288	THE SHATTERED MIRROR PIECES							  288
	   Each piece of mirror reflects an image of Ash.  From the eight
	   pieces of mirror spring...
289	EIGHT TINY ASHES									   289
	   Two inch high versions of himself.  They leap from the mirror
	   fragments and land on the floor.
290	ASH												 290
	   is unaware of them as he kneels close to the fire.
291	TINY ASH #1, #2, AND #3								 291
	   grab a discarded dinner fork.  Like men on a battering ram, they
	   race forward to jam it into Ash's buttocks.
292	ASH												 292
	   SCREAMS in agony and jerks forward, banging his head into the
	   stove pipe.
293	TINY ASH #4, #5, AND #6								 293
	   lift the barrel of the shotgun in Ash's direction.  Another
	   leaps upon the shotgun's trigger. BOOM!
294	ASH												 294
	   barely dives away from the blast the would have taken his head
	   off.
295	THE TINY ASHES										295
	   SHRIEK with uncontrollable laughter.  They jump away from the
	   shotgun and scurry off across the floor.
296	ASH												 296
	   pulls the fork from his buttocks and heaves it.
297	TINY ASH #1										   297
	   is running for his life, as fast as his tiny legs will carry
	   him.
298	TRACKING SHOT - THE FORK								298
	   a giant projectile as it ROARS AT CAMERA. PAN with it as it
	   WHOOSHES past.
	   FA-THONG!
299	THE FORK											 299
	   skewers tiny Ash #1 to the wooden wall of the mill.
300	ASH												 300
	   stumbles over a broom handle that has been thrust out in front
	   of him by other tiny ASHES.  His head slams into a stove pipe.
	   He crumples.  He lands with his cheek pressed against the hot
	   stove.  SSSSSSssss.  He pries his face loose with a spatula.
301	A BUCKET OF GREASE									 301
	   is pushed off a high shelf.
	   CLANG!
302	IT LANDS ON ASH'S HEAD								  302
	   and spills slippery grease about the floor.
303	ASH												 303
	   with an upside-down bucket on his head, slips and falls, back
	   and forth on the grease.  He stands and tries to dislodge the
	   bucket.  He trips over the broom handle, again thrust in his
	   path.  He falls backward, onto a crochet basket with knitting
	   needles jutting from it.
304	BUCKET-HEADED ASH									  304
	   SCREAMS and jerks upward, slamming his bucket head into the
	   stove pipe.  CLANG!  Ash rips the bucket from his head then yanks
	   the needles from his buttocks.  He looks about for the little
	   imps.
305	TINY ASH #2										   305
	   crouching behind a log attempting to hide.  BUT...
306	ASH												 306
	   has seen him.  He "accidentally" elbows the log and Tiny Ash
	   #2 into the stove's fire.
					   ASH
			   Ooops.
307	TINY ASH #2										   307
	   is burned alive.
308	ASH												 308
	   glances downward at the pitter patter sound of tiny feet.
309	TINY ASH #3										   309
	   is dashing across the open expanse of floor.  Ash's gigantic
	   foot comes down to crush the little man.  Tiny Ash #3 raises
	   a rusty nail into the path of the descending foot.
	   RIP!!
310	THE NAIL RIPS										 310
	   through Ash's shoe.
311	ASH												 311
	   jerks his leg upward in pain.  Ash dances about the place
	   hopping on one foot, HOWLING. He strays into the greasy area
	   of the floor and stumbles over the broomstick again thrust in
	   his path, swung there by Tiny ASHES #6, #7 and #8. He almost
	   regains his balance when he strays into the oil patch, falls,
	   and hits his head on the stone floor. BLACKNESS.
312	ASH												 312
	   awakens on the floor of the Mill, like Gulliver he is bound with
	   tiny ropes.  Directly above him, on the edge of a table...
313	TINY ASHES #4 AND #5								    313
	   suspend Tiny Ash #6 by his legs.
314	TINY ASH #7 AND #8									 314
	   stand atop Ash's face.  They push from either side of his
	   nostrils, plugging his nose.  Ash's mouth opens as he gasps for
	   air.  As he inhales...
315	SUSPENDED TINY ASH #6								   315
	   is released.
316	TINY ASH #6 - SLOW MOTION - WIND FAN					   316
	   He free falls for a moment, then the tiny body arcing to form
	   a perfect swam dive, plunges down into Ash's opened throat.
317	ASH												 317
	   inhales the living beast whole.  He chokes violently.  He breaks
	   his bonds an he hacks for breath.  He puts his finger down his
	   throat, trying to make himself vomit up the little man, to no
	   avail.
	   He looks about to crush some of the little ASHES but they are
	   gone.  He places his hand on his stomach and dizzily stumbles
	   to a chair.  He goes pale.
					   ASH
			   Nasty little thing's inside me.
	   He stands indignant but double over in sudden pain.
			   Well let's see how you like a
			   little hot water!
	   He grabs the hot kettle from the stove and pours the scalding
	   contents painfully down his throat.  He sets down the kettle
	   and waits for a moment.  A tiny SCREAM emits from Ash's stomach
	   ASH
	   emits a bark of LAUGHTER. He clutches as his chest.  Then his
	   arm.  He rips back his shirt sleeve.
318	CLOSE ON ASH'S ARM - STOP MOTION ANIMATION				  318
	   We can see the outline of Tiny Ash #6's body squirming down
	   Ash's arm, just beneath the skin.
319	ASH												 319
	   watches in horror as...
320	THE TINY FIGURE									    320
	   squirms down his wrist and disappears into his iron hand.  The
	   Iron hand snaps open and closes uncontrollably. The possessed
	   iron hand swings at him.
321	THE IRON HAND										 321
	   connects with an uppercut that knocks Ash out of frame.
322	ASH												 322
	   lands next to an iron vice. He reaches for the EVIL HAND.  But
	   the hand has grabbed a mallet that BONK-BONKS him on the head.
	   Ash is groggy as he is grabbed by the hair and yanked down into
	   the opened vice.
323	THE EVIL IRON HAND									 323
	   cranks the vice's handle.
324	THE VICE											 324
	   tightens around Ash's head.  Trapped, he looks to...
325	THE EVIL HAND										 325
	   rummaging through a wooden toolbox.  It comes upon a crude wooden
	   punch.
326	ANGLE - THE EVIL HAND - UNDERCRANKED					   326
	   stabs rapidly at Ash's good hand.  But Ash expertly dodges each
	   stab with an opening of the fingers or a closing of the thumb
	   is super fast motion.
327	ASH												 327
	   with is head still wedged in the vice.
					   ASH
			   Why you dirty little...AHHHHHH!!
328	A PAIR OF IRON PLIERS								   328
	   has entered frame and clamps down upon Ash's nose.  He emits
	   a nasal SCREAM and shakes the pliers loose.
					   ASH
			   Soon as I get out of this thing
			   I... YIEEEE!!
	   THE PAIR OF IRON PLIERS
	   dip into Ash's mouth and clamps down upon a back molar.
					   ASH
			   No!  Not the teeth!
	   YANK!
329	THE EVIL HAND										 329
	   jerks his rear MOLAR from his head and holds up the tooth for
	   his inspection.  It sets the tooth down nearly in front of him.
	   The Evil hand forms a fist and crushes the tooth to dust.  It
	   scurries from view.
330	ASH'S HEAD										    330
	   struggling in the grip of the vice.
					   ASH
			   Where the hell are ya!?
331	THE EVIL HAND										 331
	   grabs a red hot fireplace poker from the fire.
					   ASH
			   I can't see ya!!
	   HIS EVIL HAND
	   raises a red hot fireplace poker and presses it against the
	   right half of his body.
					   ASH
			   No, no--not the poke--
	   SSSSsssssssss!
332	ASH												 332
	   jerks his head free from the vice with a SCREAM.  He holds up
	   his iron hand.  It's back to normal.  Again under his control.
					   ASH
			   Okay then.
	   But he halts abruptly as he feels a strange sensation: His
	   shoulder itches.  He scratches it.  The Itch grows.  It itches
	   madly.  He rips back his shirt.  Upon his shoulder... THERE
	   BLINKS A THIRD EYEBALL!!!
333	THE CAMERA RACES INTO THIS HIDEOUS SIGHT				    333
	   It is the eyeball of EVIL ASH.  Beneath it, a mouth and nose
	   begin to take shape on the surface of Ash's back.
334	ASH												 334
	   SHRIEKS and SHRIEKS and races out of the mill.  The CAMERA
	   follows him in docu-horror style as he flees into the dark
	   woods.
335	EXT. WOODS - 12MM LENSE - NIGHT						   335
	   ASH
	   staggers about in a frenzy, stumbling over logs and through the

	   brambles.  He races up to the CAMERA and cries out as this
	   protrusion upon his shoulder becomes more pronounced.
					   ASH
			   Dear God, it's growing bigger!
336	THE PROTRUSION SWELLS AND GROWS LARGER.					336
	   It's taking the shape of a twin human head as it emerges from
	   his shoulder. A head that looks similar to his own, but is Evil
	   incarnate.
	   He is now a man with two heads!
337	TWO HEADED ASH										337
	   Staggers through the woods like a drunkard, the two identical
	   heads trading insults, and sharply butting against one another.
338	THE BAD ASH HEAD									   338
	   opens it's mouth and bites the nose of the Good Ash head.
339	THE GOOD ASH HEAD									  339
	   retaliates by gouging the eyes of the Bad Ash head.
340	TWO HEADED ASH										340
	   collapses against a tree.  Under the light of the full moon we
	   see a terrifying sight:
341	TWO ADDITIONAL ARMS									341
	   sprout from Ash's body!
342	A LEG											    342
	   rips out of his stomach.  Another foot POPS out from his back.
343	TWO HEADED ASH										343
	   Like a human spider he scurries about the forest floor,
	   propelled by his four arms and four legs.  Suddenly he stands
	   and SHRIEKS as the EVIL ASH begins to pull away from the first.
	   He literally splits into two.
344	SPLIT SCREEN - WIDE SHOT								344
	   When it's over, there are two ASHES.
	   GOOD ASH and...
345	BAD ASH.											 345
	   They square off beneath the moonlight.
346	HIGH SHOT AS THE TWO ASHES							   346
	   circle one another like wolves.
					   GOOD ASH
			   What... are you?  Are you me?
					   BAD ASH
			   WHAT... ARE GOO?  ARE GOO ME?!!  You
			   sound like a jerk!
					   GOOD ASH
			   Why are you doing this?!
					   BAD ASH
			   Wanna know?  'cause the answers
			   easy. It's cause I'm the bad Ash,
			   and yer...
347	EVIL ASH											 347
	   Dances a funny jig around Ash.  He SMACKS Ash across the face
	   as he sings:
					   EVIL ASH
			   ...Little goody two-
	   SMACK!
			   ...shoes, little goody two-
	   SMACK!
			   ...shoes, little good--
348	EVIL ASH											 348
	   the shotgun barrel is suddenly shoved into his frame, pointing
	   at his nose.
	   BLAMMITY-BLAM!
	   The blast blows Evil Ash off his feet.
349	WIDE SHOT - EVIL ASH - STUNTMAN						   349
	   blown backwards into a double backflip.
350	EVIL ASH'S BODY									    350
	   slams against a tree, upside-down. Then slides to the ground,
	   quite dead.
351	GOOD ASH											 351
	   clutching the smoldering shotgun.
					   GOOD ASH
			   Good...Bad...I'm the Ash with the
			   gun.
352	LONG SHOT - ASH									    352
	   staring down at the body of his evil self.
					   ASH
			   I know better than to bury you
			   whole.
353	EXT. MILL WHEEL - LONG SHOT - NIGHT					    353
	   The giant blades of the Mill are illuminated with bright flashes
	   of lightning.  The wind kicks up leaves as Ash throws the body
	   of his Evil Twin onto a workbench at the base of the windmill.
	   The giant blades of the mill arc down into frame with a WHOOSH-
	   WHOOSSH-WHOOSH!
354	MONTAGE SEQUENCE:									  354
	   Ash's hand light a torch.
355	FRIGHTENED BATS FLY									355
	   from the base of the windmill.
356	CHAINS ARE PULLED TIGHT								 356
	   across the body of Evil Ash to secure it.
	   CLICK. SNAP. CLINK.
357	THE CHAINSAW										  357
	   is switched on.  It spews a plume of blue exhaust.
358	ASH												 358
	   falters for a moment as he stares down at the form of his Evil
	   twin.  He grits his teeth... and lowers the saw to the grisly
	   task.
359	EXT. NIGHT SKY - BLOOD RED CLOUDS						 359
	   float past the moon.  We hear the distant WHINE of the chainsaw.
360	EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT								  360
	   ASH
	   with shovel in hand, drags a bloody burlap bag from the Mill.
	   Grunting, he pulls the remains of his Evil twin to the base of
	   an old Oak Tree in the graveyard.
	   Ash mumbles nervously to the bloodies burlap bag at his feet
	   as he digs a grave.
					   ASH
			   Now you see what's what.  Man's
			   body is his own personal property.
			   Don't anybody try to take that
			   away from him.
361	ASH												 361
	   finishes digging and lifts the bloody burlap sack.  As he heaves
	   the bag into the grave, the Evil Ash head spills out.
362	INT. GRAVE - THE EVIL ASH HEAD						    362
	   It's eyes pop open!  It peers up at Ash from the grave.  It
	   croaks;
					   EVIL ASH HEAD
			   You'll never get that Book. I will
			   come back for you.
					   ASH
			   Hey, what's that you got on your
			   face?
					   EVIL ASH HEAD
			   Huh?
363	CLOSE SHOT - THE EVIL DEAD							   363
	   It's eyes dart, looking for something on it's face when a
	   shovelful of dirt is heaped atop it.
364	EVIL ASH HEAD - P.O.V. - EYEMO						    364
	   as a shovelful of dirt is heaped atop the CAMERA.
365	ASH												 365
	   buries it deep.  He raises a crude burial marker high above his
	   head;
					   ASH
				   (muttering under his
				    breath)
			   Rest in pieces.
366	ASH												 366
	   backlit by the moon, brings the burial maker swiftly into the
	   grave. A flash of lightning reveals...
367	THE GRAVEYARD										 367
	   in the distance. A burial place of evil. The old mill wheel
	   GROANS in the gale.
					   ASH
			   This must be it. The cemetery.
368	ASH												 368
	   moves toward the cemetery.
369	ASH'S P.O.V. - THE CEMETERY							  369
	   In the center, lies a massive slab of black stone.
370	ASH												 370
	   draws closer, his teeth chattering as the wind blasts at him.
	   He glances down to...
371	ASH'S P.O.V. - TRACKING SHOT - SKULL					   371
	   sitting atop the ground, leering up at CAMERA with empty eye
	   sockets. The wind whistles through the empty skull.  The jaw
	   bone drops open with a squeak.
372	CLOSE ON ASH										  372
	   His hair is whipped up by the wind. He looks to...
373	THE MASSIVE BLACK STONE IN THE CEMETERY'S CENTER			 373
	   backlit by the rising moon, creates eerie beams of light and
	   shadow.
374	ASH												 374
	   arrives at the foot of the massive stone.
375	UNDERCRANKED - THE STONE								375
	   Atop it sits... THE BOOK OF THE DEAD.
376	CAMERA PANS REVEALING...								376
	   A SECOND BOOK OF THE DEAD!
377	CAMERA PANS AGAIN REVEALING...						    377
	   A THIRD!
378	CAMERA RACES BACK AT SUPER SPEED TO REVEAL:				 378
	   THREE BOOK OF THE DEAD!!!
379	A BAFFLED ASH										 379
	   steps close.
					   ASH
			   Wait.  Three books?  Nobody said
			   anything about that. Ha!  That
			   Wiseman was so busy fillin' me
			   fulla his secret words and phrases
			   and, and, his... bullshit, he
			   forgot to mention anything about
			   that.  Like do I take all of 'em
			   of one or 'em, or what?  Well...
	   He reaches for the first book and opens it.
380	ANGLE ON											 380
	   WHOOOOOOSH!!!
	   To reveal a black hole.  SCREAMS ERUPT from the dark abyss of
	   the Book. It begins to suck things into it.
381	CLOSE ON BOOK OF THE DEAD - BACKWARDS MOTION				381
	   dead leaves and mist are sucked into the book.
382	ASH - MAKE-UP APPLIANCE								 382
	   Wind hits Ash's face as he feels the suction of the book growing
	   stronger.
383	ASH'S HAND - PUPPET									383
	   is stretched as it's pulled down into the book.
384	LONG SHOT - ASH PUPPET								  384
	   Ash's arms stretch down into the book's black page.
385	ASH'S PUPPET HEAD									  385
	   stretched and screaming, is also pulled on by the book.
386	ASH PUPPET										    386
	   A taffy stretched version of Ash struggles against the pull of
	   the black hole. He pulls free and snaps the book shut.
387	INTERVOLOMETER SHOT - ASH							    387
	   His face vibrates like jello until it finally snaps back to
	   normal.
					  ASH
			   Woah.  Wrong book.
	   He turns to study...
388	THE TWO REMAINING BOOKS								 388
	   ASH
	   tries to decide between them.  At first he's sure which one it
	   is.  Then, chiding himself for being so easily duped, chooses
	   the other.
389	THE BOOK											 389
	   moves ever so slightly as he reaches for it.
					   ASH
			   Huh.
	   Ash reaches for it again and the book bites him!
390	THE BOOK OF THE DEAD - PUPPET							390
	   Rodent teeth have appeared on the surface of the Book.  The Book
	   flaps it's pages and becomes airborne, flying right at CAMERA
	   like a bat!
391	BATBOOK P.O.V. - CAMERA RIG - UNDERCRANKED				  391
	   Swooping erratically around Ash's head.
392	THE BATBOOK										   392
	   shrieking, chases Ash around, pecking at his neck.
					   ASH
			   Dear God, help me... ahhh!!!
	   The Batbook is pecking at his eyes!
393	ASH												 393
	   pulls it from his face and throws it. It lands back on it's
	   pedestal.
394	ASH												 394
	   faces the remaining book.  He slowly reaches for it as the wind
	   kicks up. Ash gently lifts it and turns it over.
395	CLOSE ON BOOK										 395
	   It's cover is bound in the dried skin of a man's face!  Two empty
	   eye sockets stare out from it.  This is the Book of the Dead...
396	ASH												 396
	   bristles in fear.
					   ASH
			   Okay.   The words.  Say the words.
			   KLATOO!... VERATA...  uh...  Uh...
			   Necta... uh... Nectar...
			   Necktie... uh...
	   He hesitates, then calls out boldly.
					   ASH
			   KLATOO... VERATA...
			   NECTtphhhhhhhhhh...
	   He deliberately muffles the last word that he can't remember.
	   The wind stops.  It seems to have worked.  He looks about with
	   growing confidence.
					   ASH
			   Okay then.
	   But he loses his smile as... a LOW RUMBLE is heard on the
	   soundtrack.
397	LONG SHOT - CEMETARY								    397
	   ASH
	   A tiny figure among the gravestones which tremble and one by
	   one are thrust from the earth.
					   ASH
			   Hey, wait a minute. Everything's
			   cool!  I said the words!  I did!
398	EXT. CASTLE - NIGHT									398
	   A violent storm in the distance.  Lightning flashes.
399	INT. CASTLE COURTYARD - NIGHT							399
	   A DOOR
	   blows open revealing Wiseman John.  He looks at the gathering
	   storm with foreboding.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   Something is amiss.
400	HORSES IN THE CASTLE GROUNDS							 400
	   WHINNIE in hear. Sheila steps into frame and stare fearfully
	   out at the storm.
401	EXT. CEMETARY - NIGHT								   401
	   ASH runs for his horse, clutching the Necronomicon.
402	A BONEY HAND										  402
	   rips up from a grave and grabs his leg!
403	ASH												 403
	   falls.
404	THE BOOK OF THE DEAD								    404
	   is knocked from Ash's hand.
405	ASH												 405
	   reaches for it when a SECOND skeleton hand rips from the ground
	   and clutches his face.
406	THE FIRST SKELETON HAND								 406
	   digs into Ash's mouth.  It jerks his face sideways to show
	   him...
407	A GROUP OF SIX ROTTED ARMS							   407
	   that rip from the ground!
408	THE SKELETAL HANDS									 408
	   toss Ash to...
409	THE ROTTED ARMS									    409
	   grab Ash's head and bang it on a rock.  Two of the six arms try
	   to shake and slap some sense into him. A rotted fist is waved
	   at him.  Another rotted arm backhands him. The arms thrust his
	   face toward the skeleton hands.
410	THE SKELETON HANDS									 410
	   curl boney fingers, clenching them into fists.
					   ASH
			   No.. no more...
	   The skeletal fists pepper Ash's face with punches.
					   ASH
			   Leave me alone!  Leave me aHUUU!
411	THE SKELETAL FINGERS								    411
	   last out and snag Ash's tongue between their boney pincers,
	   shutting Ash up.  With his tongue held, he tries to speak again,
	   but the other skeletal hand slaps him, shutting him up.  Both
	   hands work double-time at slapping him.
412	UNDERCRANKED - ASH									  412
	   His face has become a punching bag for the skeletal hands.  They
	   pull his ears and gouge his eyes.
413	ASH												 413
	   open his mouth wide with in a SCREAM!
414	SIDE SHOT - COLLAPSIBLE SKELETON ARM					   414
	   The boney fist is thrust into Ash's screaming mouth up to the
	   skeleton's boney elbow.
415	EXTREME CLOSE SHOT - ASH'S EYES						   415
	   They bulge as he swallow the arm.
416	STOP MOTION ANIMATION								   416
	   A ROTTED ARM
	   rips through the ground, punching Ash in the stomach.
417	SIDE SHOT - COLLAPSIBLE SKELETAL ARM					   417
	   ASH
	   jerks backward, vomiting out the skeletal arm.  He tumbles to
	   the ground.
418	THE ARMS											 418
	   reach for him, but he is too fast.  He stamps on one of the
	   skeletal arms, pinning it to the ground.
					   ASH
				   (in a snarl)
			   Keep you damn filthy bones outta
			   my mouth.
	   SNAP!  He breaks the boney arm in two and runs away from the sea
	   of limbs. A bone arm rips from the grave and reaches for the
	   Book of the Dead but Ash scoops it up first.  He leaps over
	   another set of groping arms that rip from the ground!
419	ASH CLIMBS										    419
	   atop the horse. He glances back in fear to see...
420	EXT. CEMETARY - OLD OAK TREE							 420
	   The burial site of Evil Ash. A bolt of lightning strikes the
	   grave marker.
421	EVIL ASH'S BURIAL MARKER								421
	   is thrust from the ground. A hand breaks the surface of the
	   earth.
422	EVIL ASH'S BODY PARTS								   422
	   fly up from the grave and assemble themselves into a lopsided,
	   decayed version of EVIL ASH!
423	EXT. MILL - NIGHT									  423
	   ASH
	   stares in horror at his evil self. All around, skeletons rip
	   from the earth and shriek as they come back to life!
424	A FEARFUL ASH										 424
	   kicks the horse and rides off.
425	EXT. MILL - LONG SHOT - NIGHT							425
	   ASH ON HORSEBACK
	   galloping back the way he came. In the distance we see the
	   cemetery. More bodies arise from the ground.
426	EXT. WOODS - ASH - NIGHT								426
	   Now far from the danger but still he rides hard.
					   ASH
			   I'm through bein' their garbage
			   boy.  I did my part of the
			   bargain.
	   He pats the saddlebag, where the book is and grins.
			   Now they owe me.  Like in the
			   deal.  I want back.
	   He whips his horse...
			   HA!  GIIDDUP NOW!!
	   ...and rides off into the darkness.

431	INT. CASTLE COURTYARD - NIGHT							431
	   TWO WARRIORS

					   VILLAGERS
			   The stranger has returned!  He's

432	INT. CASTLE COURTYARD - NIGHT							432
	   ASH
	   is led to the THREE WISEMEN.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   The Necronomicon.  Quickly.
433	ASH												 433
	   pours a bucket of water over his head and begins drinking.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   Did you bring the Necronomicon!
434	ASH												 434
	   slurps down more of the water, averting his eyes from the
	   Wiseman.
					   ASH
			   Yes. It's just that...
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   Just what?!
					   ASH
			   Nothing. Here
	   Ash produces the Necronomicon.
			   Now send be back. Like in the
			   deal.
435	WISEMAN JOHN										  435
	   takes the book and suddenly goes pale.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   No...I sensed something had gone
			   awry. The book's power. It's gone.
436	THE CROWD											436
	   murmurs at this bad news.
437	ASH												 437
	   suddenly looks very guilty. Wiseman John turns to him.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   When you removed the Necronomicon
			   from it's cradle, did you speak
			   the words?
					   ASH
			   Yeah.  basically.

					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   Did you speak the exact words?!
					   ASH
			   Well, maybe not every single
			   syllable, no.  But basically I
			   said them.  Yes.
438	WISEMAN JOHN										  439
	   bows his head, stung by this information.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   Dung eating fool!  Thou hast doomed
			   us. When thou misspoke the words
			   the Army of the Dead was awoke.
					   ASH
			   Hey. We had a deal. You told me,
			   you could clean this thing up,
			   once I got you the book. You said
			   there was a passage in there that
			   could get rid of this thing and
			   send me back.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   The passage is useless to us as
			   long as these evil dead walk. They
			   have a terrible desire for this
			   book. And they shall come here
			   to get it. Once in their
			   possession, the Evil shall rule
			   the Earth for one thousand
			   years...Because of you...we are
			   doomed.
					   ASH
			   You wanted the damn book. You got
			   yer book. I did my part of the
			   deal.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   We did strike a bargain. I will
			   return you to your own time as
			   promised.
					   ASH
			   Yeah. Well good. That was the
			   deal.  So uh...when do you think
			   we can...

					   ASH
			   I mean...when can you send me...
441	ASH												 441
	   sees Sheila, but looks away, consumed with the guilt that he's
	   doomed her.
					   ARTHUR
			   The Wisemen were fools to believe
			   that you were the Promised one.
			   That one such as you could have
			   saved us!.
442	ASH												 442
	   is solemn.
443	ARTHUR											   443
	   and the others turn away in contempt.
444	SHEILA											   444
	   moves closer.
					   SHEILA
			   I still believe that thou wilt
			   help us.
					   ASH
			   No.. They're right.  I screwed
			   up. I didn't come through for you,
			   and...  I'm sorry for it.
					   SHEILA
			   I still have faith in thee. In
			   my heart I know thou wilt still
			   succeed.
					   ASH
			   Sheila... It's over for me. I
			   don't belong here and I'm going
			   home. I didn't have what it took.
			   It's over.
	   He bows his head and moves off.
	   A high pitched SHRIEK is heard!
445	ALL HEADS											445

446	TWO WINGED DEADITES									446

	   Like a delta winged F-15, it banks towards Sheila.

	   severs the tip of the Beast's rotted wing.
455	THE FLYING DEADITE									 455
	   shrieks in pain as it soars over Ash. No longer aerodynamically
	   sound, it crashes to the ground.
456	A GROUP OF WARRIORS									456
	   fire their arrows into the beast, pegging it to a tree.  The

	   The beast flies off with the fair maiden, soaring over the

459	ASH												 459
	   shakes his fist at the receding beast.
					   ASH
			   Damn you!
460	THREE MOUNTED SCOUTS								    460
	   come riding in through the castle doors.
					   SCOUT
			   An army of the dead!  They have

					   ARTHUR
			   How far from here?
					   SCOUT
			   But two days ride.
					   ARTHUR
			   Then these winged ones are only
			   the first of them.
					   WISEMAN
			   Perhaps we should go from this
			   place while we can.
					   GOLD TOOTH
			   We could be safe in the mountains.
					   WARRIORS
			   Yes!  To the mountains!  We must flee!

			   I stay we stay and fight.
463	ARTHUR											   463
	   takes a challenging step forward.
					   ARTHUR
			   How will we stop an army of the

			   you fight that?!  With more words?
			   Most of out people have already
			   fled.  We are but forty men.
					   ASH
			   We'll get Henry the Red and his
			   men to fight with us.
					   ARTHUR
			   We shall not stand in battle,
			   alongside the likes of him. Our
			   honor will not allow it.
					   ASH
			   Then you'll die.  Honor and all.
			   Now who's with me?
464	THE CROWD											464
	   is silent as they consider Ash's words. Then from the rear, the
	   Village Blacksmith steps forward.
					   BLACKSMITH
			   I'll stand by you.
465	A WARRIOR											465
	   steps forward. Then another.
					   WARRIOR #7
			   You may count on my steel.

472	EVIL ASH											 472
	   looks down at her with lust.
					   EVIL ASH
			   Why ain't you a sweet little
			   thing?
	   His boney digit caresses her lips.
					   SHEILA
			   Don't touch me!  You foul thing!
					   EVIL ASH
			   Your gonna learn to live me missy.
					   SHEILA
			   The Promised one will come for

					   HENRY
			   What of them?
					   ASH
			   They're headed towards Arthur's
			   castle. We need your help. Fight
			   with us.
					   HENRY
			   So you are a vassal of Arthur now?
			   You have taken up sides with him
			   against me.
					   ASH
			   The only side I'm takin' is the

	   Henry laughs.
					   HENRY
			   Why should I endanger my people
			   to save my enemy?

			   Because after they finish with
			   Arthur they'll come after you.
			   Together, we've got a chance.

	   They are clad in rusting suits of armor, wielding swords and
	   spears.  Nasty grins on their faces. One hobbles past on his
	   wooden leg.
506	EVIL ASH AND SHEILA									506
	   ride their steeds to a halt atop a hill.
507	A SKELETON AND DEADITE CAPTAIN						    507
	   ride alongside Evil Ash and salute him sharply.
					   SKELETON CAPTAIN
			   M'Lord!  We are positioned on both
			   fronts!
					   EVIL ASH
			   Where are they keeping my book?
					   SKELETON CAPTAIN #1
			   Most likely...there, in the
			   castle's keep. It would be the
			   safest place.  It is behind two
			   walls that must be taken first.
					   EVIL ASH
			   Excellent. Proceed.
508	SKELETON CAPTAIN #1									508
	   With a sweep of his arm, he waves the Army of rot.
					   SKELETON CAPTAIN #1
			   Forward!
509	THE MACABRE MARCHING BAND							    509
	   now pound the attack beat on their drums.
510	A LINE OF DEADITES									 510
	   advance toward the castle. Some crouch behind wooden barricades
	   which they roll before them.
511	EXT. CASTLE - ATOP THE WALL							  511
	   ASH, ARTHUR AND THE WARRIORS
					   ASH
			   Arrows!
					   ARTHUR
			   Load!
512	TWELVE ARCHERS										512
	   pull back arrows on their bow strings.  Each arrow has a small
	   charge of black powder attached to it.
			   Torch boy!
513	A TORCH BOY										   513
	   runs behind the archers, lighting the fuses on each of the
	   powder charges. As the last arrow is lit....
514	ARTHUR											   514
	   looks to the approaching army.
515	THE LINE OF DEADITES								    515
	   rolls their wooden barricades closer.
516	ARTHUR											   516
	   turns to Ash for the signal.
517	ASH												 517
	   holds up a finger.  He waits.
518	TWELVE ARCHERS										518
	   strain, their bows taut with the explosive arrows.  The sound
	   of the FUSE BURNING is loud.
519	THE BURNING FUSES									  519
	   about to disappear into the powder charges.
520	ASH												 520
	   waits one more beat.  The turns to Arthur.
					   ASH
			   Fire!
					   ARTHUR
			   Fire!
521	TWELVE ARCHERS										521
	   fire a volley of smoking arrows.
522	SMOKING AND SPUTTERING ARROWS							522
	   rain down from the castle wall.
523	TWO WOODEN BARRICADES								   523
	   are hit with the explosive arrows. They explode.
524	THREE DEADITES										524
	   are pierced by the explosive arrows.  BOOM!  BOOM!  BOOM!  They burst
	   apart in flames.
525	FLAMING DEADITES									   525
	   roll on the ground unable to extinguish themselves.
526	A BURNING SKELETON									 526
	   continues to advance only to collapse into a smoldering heap.
527	THE WARRIORS										  527
	   CHEER Ash in sensurround.
528	A SCOUT											  528
	   races up to Ash.
					   SCOUT
			   M'Lord!  A second division
			   approaching from the South.
529	ASH												 529
	   turns to the South.
530	A SECOND WAVE A DEADITES								530
	   approach.
					   ASH
			   CATAPULTS...SOUTH!
531	INT. COURTYARD										531
	   THREE WOODEN CATAPULTS
	   are wheeled into position.
					   ARTHUR

532	GOLD TOOTH AND OTHER WARRIORS							532
	   hoist large sacks of black powder onto spoons of the catapults.
	   Their fuses are lit.
533	ASH												 533
	   gestures. Swords slice through lines which send giant sacks of
	   black powder catapulting.
534	LONG SHOT - CASTLE									 534
	   Three flaming projectiles whine as they hurl over the castle
	   walls.
535	THREE FALLING SATCHELS P.O.V.'S						   535
	   CAMERA CRANING DOWN toward the skeletons as they look upward
	   in horror.
	   BOOM!  The first blast takes out a skeleton horse and rider. Bones
	   fly.
	   BOOM!  FOUR DEADITES are obliterated.
536	EVIL ASH											 536
	   turns to the Skeleton Captain #1 who rides alongside him.
					   SKELETON CAPTAIN #1
			   Permission to regroup, m'Lord.
					   EVIL ASH
			   You needn't bother.
537	EVIL ASH											 537
	   slices off the head of Skeleton Captain #1. He turns to the
	   MOUNTED DEADITE next to him.
					   EVIL ASH
			   You are now my captain. I will
			   now allow anything to stop me from
			   possessing the Necronomicon. Get
			   me into that castle.
538	THE NEW DEADITE CAPTAIN								 538
	   gulps and races forward into the ranks shouting:
					   NEW DEADITE CAPTAIN
			   RAM THE GATES!
539	TWO GROUPS OF FOUR SKELETONS							 539
	   use trees as battering rams and batter the large wooden doors
	   of the castle.
	   BOOM!-BOOM!
540	INT. CASTLE - THE CASTLE DOORS						    540
	   begin to buckle beneath the hammering blows.
541	TWO VILLAGE WOMEN									  541
	   scream!
542	TEN WARRIORS										  542
	   wedge logs to buttress the buckling castle doors.
543	EXT. CASTLE										   543
					   EVIL ASH
			   Arrows!
544	A ROW OF SIX SKELETAL ARCHERS							544
	   fire a volley of arrows. As they reload. Behind them...
545	A SECOND LINE OF SIX SKELETAL ARCHERS					  545
	   fire their arrows.
546	A VOLLEY OF DEADITES' ARROWS							 546
	   pierce five Warriors atop the castle wall. They fall.
547	INT. CASTLE										   547
	   TWO DEAD WARRIORS
	   fall to the courtyard. Villagers lift them away on stretchers.
548	ARTHUR											   548
	   shouts to Ash:
					   ARTHUR
			   Where is Henry?!
					   ASH
			   He'll be here.
					   ARTHUR
			   I think he will not. But know
			   this.  No matter how this battle
			   fares, I was wrong to think you
			   a coward.
549	EXT. CASTLE										   549
	   The battering rams rips through the doors and the army of
	   darkness pours into the courtyard.
550	A LEGLESS SKELETON									 550
	   crawls in with a knife in its teeth.
					   ARTHUR
			   They're coming in. What now?!
551	ASH												 551
	   looks terrified. He turns and runs from the castle entrance,
	   dropping his sword, and hides in the blacksmith's shop, pulling
	   the door closed behind him.
552	ARTHUR											   552
	   shocked at Ash's cowardly desertion, turns to his men and
	   shouts:
					   ARTHUR
			   Fall back!  Man the Parapet!  Protect
			   the book or God save us all!
553	THE WARRIORS										  553
	   retreat across the courtyard to rope ladders that scale the
	   parapet.
554	ARTHUR'S MEN CLIMB ATOP THE PARAPET					    554
	   The rope ladders are hastily pulled up, leaving no access.
555	INT. COURTYARD - SIX OF ARTHUR'S WARRIORS				   555
	   are stranded in the courtyard. They fight for their lives but
	   are quickly overcome.
556	EVIL SHEILA										   556
	   takes out the last of the stranded warriors with her sword.
557	EVIL ASH											 557
	   smiles at Sheila. He turns his attention to the guarded tower
	   just beyond the parapet.
					   EVIL ASH
			   The book shall be mine!
	   He raises his rusty sword.
			   LADDERS!
558	TWELVE EVIL DEAD									   558
	   storm the parapet with three crudely built wooden ladders as
	   large rocks rain down upon them from above.
559	TWO WARRIORS										  559
	   push away ladder #1.
560	FOUR SKELETONS ON LADDER #1							  560
	   swing away from the wall and crash to the ground.
561	TWO SKELETONS ON LADDER #2							   561
	   leap onto the parapet and battle the men with swords.
562	WARRIOR #2										    562
	   knocks the deadite off the ledge and shouts back toward Arthur.
					   WARRIOR #2
			   We can't hold this wall much
			   longer!
563	A DEADITE ARROW									    563
	   pierces his armor and he falls to his death.
564	INT. COURTYARD										564
	   A VIKING DEADITE
	   looks up as he hears...
	   CHUG!  CHUG!  CHUG!
565	DEADITE'S P.O.V.									   565
	   THE DOORS OF THE BLACKSMITH'S SHOP BURST OPEN
	   Through the dust and smoke something appears...An iron
	   beast...belching steam...It's angry iron blades whirling.
	   Behold...
566	THE DEATHCOASTER									   566
	   The stripped chaise of the Delta  88 Oldsmobile. A steam engine
	   is mounted to it's center to power the craft. At the front and
	   rear are spinning, helicopter like rotor blades.
567	GOLD TOOTH										    567
	   shovels coal into the Deathcoaster's furnace.
568	ASH												 568
	   is at the helm. He pulls a cord.
569	THE DEATHCOASTER'S STEAM WHISTLE						  569
	   SCREAMS to announce its birth.
570	THE VIKING DEADITE									 570
	   is cut to ribbons by swirling blades.
571	THE VILLAGERS ATOP THE PARAPET						    571
	   cheer!
572	EVIL DEAD											572
	   at the base of the ladders look up in horror to see...
573	THE STEAM DRIVEN ROTOR BLADES							573
	   slicing through two Deadites at once. The cow-catcher in front
	   pushes aside the halved Evil Dead.
574	ASH												 574
	   operates a crude instrument panel with only two levers to steer
	   the craft. It's a bumpy ride.
575	WIDE SHOT - THE DEATHCOASTER							 575
	   Thwop!  Thwop!  Two more skeletons bite the dust.
	   leathery hands pluck a SCREAMING Gold Tooth from the craft.
576	GOLD TOOTH										    576
	   disappears beneath the squirming corpses. A moment later he re-
	   emerges as a skeleton himself, except for the single gold tooth
	   that shines against the white of the bone. He stands and joins
	   the Deadites.
577	EVIL SHEILA										   577
	   leaps onto the moving Deathcoaster to face Ash.
					   EVIL SHEILA
			   Thou didst find me beautiful once.
					   ASH
			   Honey...You got real ugly.
578	EVIL SHEILA										   578
	   attacks with a SHRIEK!
579	ASH												 579
	   spins out his double barreled shot gun and...
	   BLAMMITY-BLAM!
	   ...blows her off the craft. She does a back flip into the other
	   Deadites.
580	ASH												 580
	   pulls hard on the steering stick and it tears loose from the
	   craft.
581	THE DEATHCOASTER									   581
	   careens out of control.
582	ASH												 582
	   tumbles from the helm and hits the ground.
583	THE DEATHCOASTER									   583
	   flips, crushes a group of Deadites against a wall, and explodes.
584	ASH												 584
	   picks himself up from the dust. He looks upward to...
585	LADDER #2 - ARTHUR									 585
	   attempts to push the ladder away. A sword comes up into frame,
	   stabbing Arthur. He is yanked to his death with a shriek!  Evil
	   Ash, with his bloody sword, leaps up from the ladder and onto
	   the parapet. He's headed for the Book of the Dead.
586	BELOW IN THE COURTYARD - ASH							 586
	   races to a set of ropes and pulley that ascend the parapet. Two
	   deadites come at him. He grabs the rope with his steel hand and
	   slices one end of it with his sword.
587	ABOVE HIM - A NET OF BOULDERS							587
	   plummet down atop the two deadites, crushing them.
	   Simultaneously, Ash is tanked upward by the rope, to the
	   parapet.
588	ASH												 588
	   looks to...
589	EVIL ASH											 589
	   approaching the Necronomicon.
590	ASH												 590
	   kicks aside a hay bale and removes a mini-crossbow with four
	   flame tipped arrows, loaded and ready. He fires.
591	A FLAME ARROW										 591
	   imbeds in Evil Ash's leg and ignites his body. Another flaming
	   dart hits his shoulder blade. The flames consume his body. He
	   burns and SHRIEKS!
592	ASH												 592
	   watches in horror as...
593	THE FLAMES RECEED									  593
	   revealing a bone white skeleton with mismatched eyes. SKELETAL
	   EVIL ASH!  It races at Ash with a SHRIEK.
594	ASH AND EVIL ASH									   594
	   bring their swords together with such great force that sparks
	   fly.  Ash is forced back against the stone pedestal that holds
	   the Necronomicon.
	   CLANG!
	   With a deft stroke, Ash's sword is flung from his hand.
595	ASH'S SWORD										   595
	   imbeds in a wooden beam.
596	EVIL ASH											 596
	   grabs the Necronomicon, then swings his sword at Ash.
597	ASH												 597
	   grabs a burning iron torch from its mount.
598	ANGLE ON											 598
	   WHOOSH!  KLANG!  WHOOSH!  KLANG!
	   Man and Skeleton battle with flaming torch and sword.
599	ANGLE ON											 599
	   KLANG!
	   The torch is knocked from Ash's hand. It falls over the edge
	   of the wall and lands in the courtyard below. It ignites a fuse.
	   The burning fuse leads to a sack of black powder. The sack sits
	   upon the spoon of a catapult.
600	ABOVE...											 600
	   SKELETON ASH
	   swings his sword. Ash leaps over the blade. The Skeleton swings
	   downward, and Ash side steps it.
601	ASH												 601
	   rabbit punches CAMERA.
602	CLOSE ON SKELETON HEAD								  602
	   Ash's fist bursts out all it's rotted teeth.
603	ASH												 603
	   delivers a right hook, spinning the skeleton's head around in
	   a circle.
604	THE SKELETON										  604
	   gives Ash a backwards roundhouse kick to the face. Ash tumbles
	   over the edge.
605	ASH												 605
	   falls to the courtyard below, alongside the catapult. He glances
	   at the burning fuse.
606	EVIL ASH											 606
	   leaps from the parapet and lands atop the catapult. The Skeleton
	   looks down at Ash with a nasty grin of bone.
607	SKELETON ASH										  607
	   Behold...
	   He gestures to the Evil Dead that overrun the parapet and now
	   battle the last twenty of Arthur's warriors for control of the
	   Keep.
608	ANGLE ON SKELETON ASH								   608
					   SKELETON ASH
			   You're finished.
	   He extends the Necronomicon to taunt Ash.
					   SKELETON ASH
			   I possess the Necronomicon. I've
			   crushed your pathetic army. Now
			   I'll have my vengeance!
	   He raises his sword for the death blow...
609	THE SHRILL CALL OF BATTLE TRUMPETS						609
					   GUARD (O.S.)
			   Duke Henry's men!  They've come!
610	ASH AND THE SKELETON								    610
	   turn...
	   A jubilant CHEER rises from the castle as...
611	DUKE HENRY THE RED AND FIFTY OF HIS MEN					611
	   thunder down the hill, across the drawbridge and into the castle
	   courtyard to attack the Deadites!
612	THE SKELETON - ATOP THE CATAPULT						  612
	   turns back to Ash and raises his sword for the kill.
613	ASH												 613
	   has grabbed a sword from a fallen warrior. With a single motion
	   he slices the hand that holds the Necronomicon from Skeleton
	   Ash.
614	ASH												 614
	   snags the book with one hand and on the backswing, slices
	   through the rope, springing the catapult.
615	THE SKELETON AND BURNING SATCHEL						  615
	   are flung over the castle wall.
616	HIGH SHOT - LOOKING DOWN AT CASTLE						616
	   THE SKELETON PROJECTILE
	   rockets up past camera, waving its boney arms. The burning
	   satchel follows.
	   BOOM!  The skeleton is blown to bits in mid air.
	   A CHEER goes up within the castle courtyard as Henry's Warriors
	   crush the last of the Deadites.
									   DISSOLVE TO:
617	GLORIOUS BEAMS OF MORNING SUNLIGHT						617

618	LONG SHOT - THE BATTLEFIELD - MORNING					  618
	   Smoking skeletons lay scattered. Henry and Arthur's Warriors
	   work together. They toss the deadite bones and armor into a

622	THE ARROWS										    622
	   strike a wooden ship that holds the body of Arthur.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   We said goodbye to Arthur.  Sure

			   Peace was made between the two

			   to stay among them and teach them.
			   A chance to lead them.  To be

			   Besides, I had places to go.
	   FLAMES OF THE FIRE - CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL...
625	THE WISEMEN										   625
	   mix a vat of liquid over a fire as they recite a passage from

	   the Necronomicon.  A flask is dipped into the liquid.
	   WISEMAN JOHN
	   hands the flask of liquid to Ash.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   The Book tells us that each drop
			   allows a man to sleep a century.
			   Swallow six drops, and thou shalt
			   awaken in thine own time.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   Yeah.  Right...
	   Ash takes the flask and studies it.
			   ...but what other choice did I

									   DISSOLVE TO:

627	EXT. CAVE - DAY									    627
	   ASH
	   with the aid of his horse, drags the Deathcoaster inside the

	   He sets the horse free.
					   ASH
			   YAHH!!
	   It gallops off.
628	INT. CAVE - DAY									    628
	   ASH
	   Places a black powder charge at the mouth of the cave.  He
	   ignites the fuse and climbs into the car.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   I locked the door.
629	INT. MOUTH OF THE CAVE								  629
	   BOOM!
	   The powder charge blows.  The cave's entrance is sealed shut

	   The car headlights come on, piercing the blackness.
631	INT. DEATHCOASTER									  631
	   ASH
	   uncorks the flask filled with the Wiseman's brew.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   I closed my eyes.
	   He lets six drops fall into his mouth.  One for each century
	   he must sleep.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   I took a drink.
	   Ash is unaware that an extra drop has fallen into his mouth!  A
	   7th drop!  Ash swallows the liquid.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   I didn't know if it was day or

			   drowsy... And I slept...
632	ASH												 632
	   falls into a deep slumber.
									   DISSOLVE TO:

					   ASH
			   ...And dreamed.
635	THE HANDS ON ASH'S WRISTWATCH							635
	   wind faster and faster, then halt and rust in time lapse
	   photography. The leather band rots away and the watch falls from
	   Ash's wrist.
636	THE SUN											  636
	   rises then sets.
637	THE MOON											 637
	   follows.
638	A CRACK											  638

			   Dreams last lasted centuries.

639	A BARREN TREE										 639
	   sprouts buds, they swell forming leaves which change to the

640	A FROST											  640
	   covers Ash.
641	ICICLES											  641
	   on the ceiling of the cave melt.  The water drops down onto
	   Ash's face.  He stirs.
642	ASH												 642
	   awakens in a heap of rusted scrap, which was once the
	   Deathcoaster. His clothes and armor having deteriorated, he is
	   buck ass naked as he staggers to the mouth of the cave. He digs
	   at the rocks that block the cave's entrance.  Sunlight streams
	   into the hole he has created.
643	EXT. HILLSIDE										 643
	   ASH

645	A FUTURISTIC CITY -									645
	   after the next Nuclear war: a dead land.
646	ASH'S P.O.V.										  646
	   A FRACTURED CLOCK TOWER

647	A SHATTERED BRIDGE									 647
	   abruptly ends, a third of the way across a river it once
	   spanned.  Upon it, rest heaps of futuristic, yet rusted taxicabs
	   piled eight deep in some places.
	   CAMERA PULLS BACK from a stunned Ash, amidst the atomized pieces
	   of iron and bone.
					   ASH
			   ....I found that I had slept too
			   long.
648	ASH												 648
	   is so small a dot now, and so far away, that we almost can't

          THE SOUND OF DRUMS, from a great distance, growing louder.
          
          FADE IN:
          
          WE ARE FLYING through mist, a dimly glimpsed forest below.
          
                               VOICE (V.O.)
                     When I was lying there in the VA
                     hospital, with a big hole blown through
                     the middle of my life, I started having
                     these dreams of flying.
          
          We are very low over the forest now, gliding fast, the drums
          BUILDING to a PEAK --
          
                               VOICE (V.O.)
                     Sooner or later though, you always have
                     to wake up...
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          EXT. CITY - NIGHT
          
          A SCREECH OF BRAKES as a vehicle WIPES FRAME, revealing --
          
          JAKE SULLY, a scarred and scruffy combat vet, sitting in a
          beat up carbon-fiber wheelchair. At 22, his eyes are
          hardened by the wisdom and wariness of one who has endured
          pain beyond his years.
          
          Jake stares upward at the levels of the city. MAGLEV TRAINS
          WHOOSH overhead on elevated tracks, against a sky of garish
          advertizing.
          
                               JAKE (V.O.)
                     They can fix a spinal, if you've got the
                     money. But not on vet benefits, not in
                     this economy.
          
          The traffic light changes and Jake pushes forward with the
          crowd, pumping the wheels of his chair. Most of the people
          wear FILTER MASKS to protect them from the toxic air. In a
          LONG LENS STACK it is a marching torrent of anonymous,
          isolated souls.
          
          INT. JAKE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
          
          The room is a tiny CUBICLE, prison cell meets 747 bathroom.
          Narrow cot, wall-screen droning away in the B.G. --
          
                               PERKY NEWSCASTER
                     The Bengal tiger, extinct for over a
                     century, is making a comeback. These
                     cloned tiger cubs at the Beijing Zoo
                     are...
          
                                                                       2.
          
          
          
          Jake laboriously pulls his pants off -- rocking to one side,
          pushing the fabric down past his hip, then rocking to the
          other, and so on.
          
          His legs are white and atrophied. Utterly useless. But his
          arms are tattooed and powerfully muscled. A "Born Loser"
          tattoo prominent on his shoulder.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    I became a Marine for the hardship. To
                    be hammered on the anvil of life. I told
                    myself I could pass any test a man can
                    pass.
          
          Jake struggles with his pants a long time.
                                                                   CUT TO:
          
          INT. ROWDY BAR -- NIGHT
          
          Not the kind of place you'd bring your mom.
          
          We find Jake near the pool table, BALANCING his chair, front
          wheels off the ground, while holding a tequila shot on his
          forehead. ONLOOKERS, including some other disabled vets,
          CLAP and WHOOP.
          
          Jake grabs the glass, SLAMS down the shot as they cheer.
          
          A WALL-SIZED SCREEN filled with the World Cup game -- men
          RUNNING on antelope legs.
          
          CU JAKE, watching what he can't have.    Expression stony.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    Let's get it straight up front. I don't
                    want your pity. I know the world's a
                    cold-ass bitch.
          
          Jake's eyes shift   -- HIS POV, seeing the bar through gaps in
          the crowd. A MAN    on a barstool SLAPS the WOMAN he's with.
          Hard. She cowers    but he's got her arm, shouting, raising his
          fist. An eternal    tableau. People look away.
          
          CU JAKE -- not looking away.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    You want a fair deal, you're on the wrong
                    planet. The strong prey on the weak.
          
          TIGHT ON JAKE'S HAND as he starts pushing the wheel of his
          chair.
          
          TRACKING WITH HIM as he rolls forward.
          
                                                                        3.
          
          
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    It's just the way things are.   And nobody
                    does a damn thing.
          
          Jake stops, unnoticed, next to the bullying man. He leans
          down and grabs one leg of the man's barstool -- and YANKS.
          
          The chair flips.   The guy goes down HARD and --
          
          JAKE hurls himself from the wheelchair, toppling on the guy,
          getting a grip on him like a pit bull and PUNCHING the crap
          out of him, right there on the floor.
          
          THE BOUNCER jumps in, trying to drag him off and it goes into
          SLOW MOTION, everybody yelling and pulling...
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    All I ever wanted in my sorry-ass life
                    was a single thing worth fighting for.
                                                                   CUT TO:
          
          EXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR -- NIGHT
          
          THE BOUNCER hurls Jake out the door, sending him SPRAWLING on
          the pavement. A moment later, his chair CRASHES down on him,
          banging across the alley, landing in the trash.
          
          Jake struggles to rise on one elbow. He's bleeding and
          bruised, but still crazed and ready to fight.
          
                              JAKE
                    I hope you realize you've just lost a
                    customer!
          
          He collapses onto his back, panting.
          
                              JAKE
                        (to himself)
                    Candy ass bitch.
          
          He stares upwards at the levels of the city. MAGTRAINS ROAR
          overhead. It starts to RAIN. He just lies there, blinking --
          then shouts jauntily to no one in particular --
          
                              JAKE
                    If it ain't rainin' we ain't trainin'!
          
          CAMERA PULLS BACK high and wide, as Jake lies spread-eagled
          amongst the trash, getting drenched.
          
          TWO LONG SHADOWS enter FRAME, coming to rest across him.
          
                                                                       4.
          
          
          
          Jake sees two pairs of SHINY SHOES stop next to him.   He
          squints up at --
          
          TWO MEN. Matching suits. Their features unremarkable and
          blandly threatening in the way of FBI agents and auditors.
          
                              AGENT 1
                    Are you Jake Sully?
          
                                JAKE
                    Step off.    You're ruinin' my good mood.
          
                              AGENT 2
                    It's about your brother.
                                                                   CUT TO:
          
          INT. MUNICIPAL CREMATORIUM - NIGHT
          
          DOWN-ANGLE on a large rectangular cardboard box. HANDS ENTER
          FRAME, pulling open the top to reveal a DEAD MAN'S FACE. He
          looks EXACTLY like a clean-shaven version of Jake. His
          IDENTICAL TWIN -- TOMMY.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    The strong prey on the weak. A guy with
                    a knife took all Tommy would ever be, for
                    the paper in his wallet.
          
          WIDER, showing Jake and the two agents in a high tech
          CREMATORIUM -- a row of stainless steel furnaces. Jake
          stares down at his own face.
          
                              JAKE
                    Jesus, Tommy.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    The Suits' concern was touching.
          
                              AGENT 1
                    Your brother represented a significant
                    investment. We'd like to talk to you
                    about taking over his contract.
          
          The ATTENDANT closes the box and seals it with a tape
          dispenser, like it's a package for shipping. The cardboard
          coffin is rolled into the furnace.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    The egghead and the jarhead.   Tommy was
                    the scientist, not me. He was the one
                    who wanted to get shot light years out
                    into space to find the answers.
          
                                                                       5.
          
          
          
          PUSHING IN ON JAKE as he watches, bathed in orange light.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    Me -- I was just another dumb grunt
                    gettin' sent someplace I was gonna
                    regret.
          
          INSIDE THE FURNACE the burners quickly eat away the
          cardboard; TOMMY'S FACE is, for a moment, wreathed in flame
          but not touched by it, as we --
                                                             DISSOLVE TO:
          
          JAKE'S FACE, in icy darkness. CLOSE ON his eyes -- they OPEN
          suddenly, and he takes a sharp breath.
          
          JAKE'S POV -- the inside of a metal coffin. A SERVO WHINE
          and we are moving, emerging into a large chamber --
          
          INT. CRYO VAULT
          
          JAKE'S POV -- A TECH in medical scrubs FLOATS WEIGHTLESSLY
          toward us. Wherever we are, we're not on Earth.
          
          Jake squints as the lights flicker on, revealing --
          
          WIDE SHOT -- the multi-tiered CRYO VAULT. Hundreds of CRYO-
          CAPSULES are opening like morgue drawers, as med techs pull
          themselves about in ZERO-G, tending to their patients.
          
                              JAKE
                        (a hoarse whisper)
                    Are we there?
          
                              MED TECH
                    We're there, Sunshine.
          
          TIME CUT -- SCORES OF PEOPLE emerge from their cryo-capsules
          in ZERO-G. Pale spirits of the dead rising from rows of open
          coffins.
          
          The MED TECH floats among them, using his announcement voice.
          
                              MED TECH
                    People, you have been in cryo for five
                    years, nine months and twenty two days.
                    You will be hungry, you will be weak. If
                    you feel nausea, please use the sacks
                    provided for your convenience. The staff
                    thanks you in advance.
          
                                                                        6.
          
          
          
          FOLLOWING JAKE as he pushes away from his capsule, gliding to
          the LOCKERS across the aisle, his paralyzed legs not an
          impediment in weightlessness.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          EXT. SPACE
          
          Against the cold infinity   of stars glides an INTERSTELLAR
          SPACECRAFT -- ISV VENTURE   STAR. As it moves past like an
          endless train, we realize   this thing is ENORMOUS -- over half
          a mile long. PAN WITH IT    180 to REVEAL --
          
          A GAS-GIANT PLANET called POLYPHEMUS, ringed with dozens of
          moons which cast beauty-mark shadows on its vast face.
          
          The ISV diminishes away from us toward the largest MOON-- a
          blue and surprisingly Earth-like world called PANDORA. The
          ship dwindles to a speck against the BLUE MOON.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          EXT. PANDORA ORBIT
          
          ISV Venture Star drifts above a spectacular vista -- the
          sapphire seas and unfamiliar continents of Pandora.
          
          CLOSE ON ISV -- two massive "VALKYRIE" SHUTTLES are mated to
          a DOCKING NODE. One of them separates from the starship and
          moves away, its thrusters FIRING in short bursts.
          
          As the shuttle moves away, descending toward Pandora, we hear
          the sound of DRUMS, building, louder and louder until we--
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST - TWILIGHT
          
          FLYING OVER A LANDSCAPE of massive cliffs and towering mesas
          carpeted in rainforest. Great scarves of cloud swirl around
          the mesa tops. A primeval landscape, vast and forbidding.
          
          The trees are alien, the color too cyan. There are
          waterfalls, rivers, and distant flocks of WINGED CREATURES.
          
          Suddenly the carpet of virgin rainforest gives way to --
          
          AN OPEN-PIT MINE. A lifeless crater -- as if a giant cookie-
          cutter took a chunk out of the world. Down among the
          terraces are EXCAVATORS and TRUCKS the size of three story
          buildings.
          
          And beyond the mine is the HUMAN COLONY --
          
                                                                       7.
          
          
          
          EXT. HELL'S GATE - TWILIGHT
          
          HELL'S GATE is a cluster of squat concrete and steel
          structures surrounded by chain-link FENCE 10 meters high,
          topped with razor wire.
          
          At the corners are towers with automated SENTRY GUNS
          swiveling on servo mounts.
          
          Visible beyond the gun towers, the VALKYRIE SHUTTLE roars in
          across the treetops. VECTORING NOZZLES change angle,
          bringing the ship to a SLOW HOVER.
          
          EXT. RAIN FOREST - TWILIGHT
          
          Through a screen of jungle canopy, we see the VALKYRIE
          thunder overhead. Camera TILTS with it until leaves block
          the view.
          
          A BLUE INHUMAN HAND reaches INTO SHOT, parting the foliage to
          reveal the shuttle hover-taxiing across the compound.
          
          REVERSE -- ECU of two intense, cat-like golden EYES watching.
          
          INT./EXT. SHUTTLE
          
          The CREW CHIEF stomps down the aisle yelling --
          
                              CREW CHIEF
                    Exopacks on!
          
          Passengers don their EXO-PACK breathing gear with practiced
          moves. Everybody except JAKE, who's turning his this way and
          that trying to figure out the straps.
          
                              CREW CHIEF
                    Remember people, you lose your mask
                    you're unconscious in 20 seconds and
                    you're dead in four minutes. Let's nobody
                    be dead today, it looks bad on my report.
          
          The crew chief stops by Jake long enough to bark --
          
                              CREW CHIEF
                    Exopack on, let's go!
          
          BENEATH THE SHUTTLE air blasts outward for a hundred meter
          radius as it settles onto its landing gear.
          
          INSIDE everybody is queued up in the aisles, with duffles
          ready. Rows of tense, expectant faces in breathing masks --
          and we DIP DOWN to find Jake, wheelchair putting him at the
          level of everyone else's WAISTS.
          
                                                                        8.
          
          
          
          THE CARGO RAMP OPENS with a hydraulic whine.
          
                              CREW CHIEF
                    Go directly into the base! Do not stop!
                    Go straight inside!
          
          HAND-HELD, running with the arriving colonists who double
          time down the ramp. They jog across the exposed apron toward
          a walkway covered in CHAINLINK which leads to the complex.
          
          Inside the chain-link tunnel are a couple of SEC-OPS
          TROOPERS, CORPORAL LYLE WAINFLEET and PRIVATE FIKE. Sec-Ops
          is the colony's private security force. These guys are laid
          back, hardened, and haggard.
          
                              WAINFLEET
                    Look at all that new meat.
          
          THEIR POV -- Jake rolls down the ramp.
          
                              FIKE
                    Check it out, man.    Meals on wheels.
          
                              WAINFLEET
                    That is just wrong.
          
          Jake, pumping his chair, looks around as --
          
          A huge TRACTOR, taller than a house, ROARS past on muddy
          wheels. He notices something sticking in the tires --
          ARROWS. The neolithic weapons are jarring amid all the
          advanced technology.
          
          Beyond the tractor, two VTOL vehicles take off. Armored and
          heavily armed, they are AT-99 "SCORPION" GUNSHIPS.
          
          MITSUBISHI MK-6 AMPSUITS -- human operated walking machines 4
          meters tall -- patrol the perimeter. They are heavily
          armored, and armed with a huge rotary cannon called a GAU-90.
          
          Beyond the outer fence stands a black wall of forest hundreds
          of feet high.   A SENTRY GUN OPENS FIRE from a tower. TRACERS
          light up the twilight. A shadowy SHAPE SHRIEKS and drops off
          the fence. It is an armed camp in a state of siege.
          
          WAINFLEET and Fike give Jake and his chair the hairy eyeball
          as he approaches.
          
                              JAKE
                    What're you two limpdicks starin' at?
          
          As Jake rolls past, SOMETHING SWOOPS down behind him and --
          
                                                                          9.
          
          
          
          K-KRASH! SMASHES against the chain-link right next to his
          head.
          
          A vicious AERIAL PREDATOR a meter across gnashes glass fangs
          against the steel. It STABS at him through the chain link
          with a tail ending in a glistening stiletto. A STINGBAT.
          
          WAINFLEET casually BLASTS IT with his PISTOL.   It drops off
          the fence, tail still lashing.
          
                              WAINFLEET
                    Seen a lotta guys leave this place in a
                    wheelchair. Never seen anybody show up
                    in one.
          
          Jake stares at the gnashing fangs of the dying alien.
          
          ON A WALKWAY of the OPS CENTER, seen from above, a UNIFORMED
          FIGURE grips the railing, watching Jake pump his chair
          through the tunnel below.
          
          The hair is clipped short. The scalp is etched by long
          parallel SCARS where some Pandoran denizen's claws raked
          across it. The bare arms, below tightly rolled sleeves, seem
          hewn out of some hard tropical wood. Criss-crossed by scars.
          
          The MAN raises his masked face to look at the sky.    He eyes
          are an icy steel gray.
          
          HIS POV -- the mighty POLYPHEMUS seems to fill the sky,
          beyond the clouds.
          
                              MAN (V.O.)
                    You are not in Kansas any more...
                                                                    CUT TO:
          
          INT. COMMISSARY - TWILIGHT
          
          THE MAN from the balcony -- COLONEL MILES QUARITCH -- is the
          HEAD OF SECURITY for the Hell's Gate colony. A hundred new
          arrivals watch raptly as he paces like a panther across the
          front of the large cafeteria. He stops, stance wide.
          
          Without his mask, we see that Quaritch's features are rugged
          and handsome, except for the SCAR, which runs from scalp to
          jaw down one side of his face. On one hip he carries a very
          large PISTOL.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    ... You are on Pandora, ladies and
                    gentlemen. Respect that fact every second
                    of every day.
          
                                                                       10.
          
          
          
          JAKE ROLLS IN, watching from the back.
          
          COLONEL QUARITCH raises his hand and points out the window,
          toward the dark treeline.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Out beyond that fence every living thing
                    that crawls, flies or squats in the mud
                    wants to kill you and eat your eyes for
                    jujubees.
          
          The room gets very quiet.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    We have an indigenous population of
                    humanoids here called the Na'vi. They're
                    fond of arrows dipped in a neurotoxin
                    which can stop your heart in one minute.
                    We operate -- we live -- at a constant
                    threat condition yellow.
          
          PAN ACROSS the solid faces of miners, Cat-machine drivers,
          engineers, geologists, as they take that in.
          
                               QUARITCH
                    As head of security, it's my job to keep
                    you alive.    I will not succeed --
                        (pausing for effect)
                    -- not with all of you. If you wish to
                    survive, you need a strong mental
                    attitude, you need to follow procedure...
          
          PUSH IN ON JAKE, watching as the briefing continues.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    Nothing like an old-school safety brief
                    to put your mind at ease.
                                                                   CUT TO:
          
          INT. CORRIDOR
          
          People are roaming in both directions, looking for rooms,
          lugging duffels and cases.
          
          An eager young XENOANTHROPOLOGIST, staggering under an
          overpacked duffel, runs to catch up to Jake.
          
                              NORM
                    Hey, you're Jake right? Tom's brother?
                    You look just like him.
                        (off Jake's wary look)
                    Sorry, I'm Norm Spellman, I went through
                    avatar training with him.
          
                                                                         11.
          
          
          
          Norm offers his hand and Jake shakes it.
          
                              NORM
                    He was a great guy -- funny.     It was a
                    big shock to all of us.
          
                               JAKE
                    Yeah.
          
          Jake pumps the wheels of his chair, rolling on.       Norm walks
          with him.
          
                              NORM
                    And duh! -- obviously you look like him.
                    I mean, if you weren't genetically
                    identical, you wouldn't be taking over
                    his avatar.
          
                              JAKE
                    That's why I'm here.
          
                              NORM
                    So -- you want to go check it out?
                                                                      CUT TO:
          
          INT. BIO-LAB - DAY
          
          JAKE AND NORM enter the BIO-LAB -- a large lab complex with
          many adjoining rooms.
          
                              MAX
                    Me and Norm were out here to drive these
                    remotely controlled bodies called
                    avatars. They're grown from human DNA
                    mixed with DNA from the natives here.
          
          A scientist, DOCTOR MAX CULLIMORE, is supervising the
          uncrating of two SHIPPING CONTAINERS. The nearer has the
          sides removed, revealing -- a ceiling-height acrylic TANK.
          
          Norm stops to stare, and Jake rolls past him as if drawn by
          some unseen force, toward --
          
          THE AMNIO TANK. There is a FIGURE floating lanquidly inside,
          which looks like a man. A very large, very blue, man.
          
          Blood circulates through a synthetic UMBILICAL in the
          abdomen. As the figure turns in the amniotic fluid, we see
          that it has a lemur-like TAIL. The skin is cyan-blue. Long
          black hair drifts, graceful as seaweed.
          
                               JAKE
                    Damn.   They got big.
          
                                                                       12.
          
          
          
                              NORM
                    Yeah, they mature on the trip out.
                        (to Max)
                    So the proprioceptive sims worked pretty
                    well.
          
                              MAX
                    Yeah, they've got great muscle tone. Give
                    us a few hours, you guys can take them
                    for a spin.
          
          THE FIGURE'S sleeping face turns toward us, and the features
          are -- despite feline ears and a long feral snout --
          definitely JAKE'S.
          
                              JAKE
                    It looks like him.
          
                              NORM
                    No, it looks like you.   This is your
                    avatar now, Jake.
          
          ON JAKE, mesmerized as he stares into the tank.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    The idea is -- every driver is matched to
                    his own avatar --
          
          STEREOCAM VIDEO SHOT OF JAKE -- facing the camera, talking
          directly to the lens. JAKE'S VOICE-OVER up until now has
          been part of this VIDEOLOG.
          
                               JAKE
                    -- so their nervous systems are in tune.
                    Or something. Which is why they offered
                    me this gig, because I can link with
                    Tommy's avatar, which was insanely
                    expensive.
                        (looking off camera)
                    Is this right? I just say whatever in
                    these videologs?
          
          WIDER, showing Norm working nearby with Max.
          
                              NORM
                    Yeah. You just need to get in the habit
                    of documenting everything -- what you
                    see, what you feel -- it's all part of
                    the science. Good science starts with
                    good observation.
          
                                                                     13.
          
          
          
                              JAKE
                    Right.
                        (to camera)
                    So, whatever. Here I am. Doing science.
                        (looks around)
                    Never been in a lab before.
          
                              MAX
                    Log off. It's time to meet your boss for
                    the next five years.
          
          He leads Jake and Norm through the short corridor to the --
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          INT. LINK ROOM - DUSK
          
          The LINK ROOM contains a dozen PSIONIC LINK UNITS, which look
          like coffins crossed with MRI scanners.

                    Grace Augustine is a legend. She's the
                    head of the Avatar Program, and she wrote
                    the book -- I mean literally wrote the
                    book -- on Pandoran botany.

                        (low, over his shoulder)
                    That's because she likes plants better
                    than people.
          
          DR. GRACE AUGUSTINE sits up in her link, stretching and
          cracking her neck after a long session. She's fifty, with a
          strong face and fiercely intelligent eyes.
          
                              GRACE
                        (YELLING)
                    Who's got my goddamn cigarette?!
          
          A TECH scurries to bring it to her, already lit.   Around here
          they jump when Grace barks.
          
          Grace stands, scowling, as Jake, Norm and Max approach.
          
                              MAX
                    And here she is, Cinderella back from the

                    Spellman and Ja --

                    Norm. I hear good things about you.

                    meeting.
          
          Grace nods approvingly, taking a drag on her cigarette.
          
                              GRACE
                        (SUBTITLED)

          Jake waits while they ignore him, chattering in fluent Na'vi.

                    Uh, Grace, this is Jake S----

                        (turning to Jake)
                    Yeah, yeah, I know who you are, and I
                    don't need you. I need your brother.
                        (to Max)
                    You know -- the PhD who trained three
                    years for this mission.
          
                              JAKE
                    He's dead. I know it's a big
                    inconvenience to everyone.
          
                              GRACE
                    How much lab training have you had?   Ever
                    run a gas chromatograph?
          
                                 JAKE
                    No.
          
                              GRACE
                    Any actual lab work at all?

                    High school chemistry.   But I ditched.
          
          Grace wheels on Max.
          
                              GRACE
                    You see? You see? They're pissing on us
                    without even the courtesy of calling it
                    rain.
                        (turning away)
                    I'm going to Selfridge.
          
                                                                     15.
          
          
          
          She shoves past Jake.
          
                              MAX
                    Grace, that's not a good idea.
          
          But she's already out the door and clomping down the
          corridor. Max turns to Jake with a pained look.
          
                              MAX
                    Here, tomorrow, oh eight hundred.   Try to
                    use big words.

          INT. OPS CENTER - DUSK
          
          It looks like an air-traffic control tower, with lots of
          screens and bay windows showing the whole complex.
          
          ADMINISTRATOR PARKER SELFRIDGE takes a ball from a newly
          opened case of TITLEISTS and sets it on the floor. Selfridge
          is young, charismatic, focused. Some would say ruthless.
          
          He assumes the stance and lines up his putt, toward a
          practice cup across the control room floor. He glances up as
          Grace strides toward him.
          
                              GRACE
                    Parker, I used to think it was benign
                    neglect, but now I see you're
                    intentionally screwing us.
          
                               SELFRIDGE
                    Grace.   You know I enjoy our little
                    talks.
          
                              GRACE
                    I need a research assistant, not some
                    jarhead dropout.
          
          Selfridge looks down and hits the ball.
          
          Grace kicks the practice cup aside, and the ball rolls past.
          Selfridge looks at her with a sigh.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    Actually, we got lucky with him.
          
                               GRACE
                    Lucky?   How is this in any way lucky?
          
          As Selfridge saunters over to retrieve the ball --
          
                                                                    16.
          
          
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    Well -- lucky your guy had a twin
                    brother, and lucky the brother wasn't an
                    oral hygienist or something. A Marine we
                    can use. I'm assigning him to your team
                    as security escort.
          
                              GRACE
                    The last thing I need is another trigger
                    happy asshole out there!
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    Look, you're supposed to be winning the
                    hearts and minds of the natives. Isn't
                    that the whole point of your little
                    puppet show? If you look like them, if
                    you talk like them, they'll trust you?
          
          Selfridge crosses to his office, behind a glass wall nearby.
          Grace follows.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    But after -- how many years? -- relations
                    with the indigenous are only getting
                    worse.
          
                              GRACE
                    That tends to happen when you use machine
                    guns on them.
          
          On Selfridge's desk is a magnetic base, and hovering in mid-
          air, in the invisible field, is a lump of METALLIC ROCK.
          Pure UNOBTANIUM. He grabs it and holds it up between thumb
          and forefinger, in front of Grace's eyes.
          
                               SELFRIDGE
                    This is why we're here. Unobtanium.
                    Because this little gray rock sells for
                    twenty million a kilo. No other reason.
                    This is what pays for the party. And
                    it's what pays for your science.
                    Comprendo?
          
          He places it back in the magnetic field.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    Those savages are threatening our whole
                    operation. We're on the brink of war and
                    you're supposed to be finding a
                    diplomatic solution. So use what you've
                    got and get me some results.
                                                                 CUT TO:

          INT. LINK ROOM - DAY
          
          NEXT MORNING, GRACE, NORM and JAKE approach their link units.
          
          Jake glances through a PRESSURE WINDOW. In an adjoining
          chamber (the AMBIENT ROOM) JAKE'S AVATAR lies on a gurney,
          breathing slowly in PANDORAN AIR. NORM'S AVATAR is on a
          second gurney. Both are attended by med techs in exo-masks.
          
          Norm slips into his LINK CHAIR, expertly donning biometric
          sensors.
          
                              GRACE
                    How much link time have you logged?
          
                              NORM
                    Five hundred and twenty hours.
          
          Grace looks pointedly at Jake.
          
                              JAKE
                    Like -- an hour.
          
                              GRACE
                    Tell me you're joking.
          
          Grace opens the hood of Jake's link unit. Jake starts
          hauling himself across from his wheelchair. She reaches to
          help him but --
          
                               JAKE
                    Don't!   I got this.
          
          Grace steps back, hands raised.    He drags himself into the
          unit.
          
                               GRACE
                    So you just figured you'd come out here
                    to the most hostile environment known to
                    man, with no training of any kind, and
                    see how it went? What was going through
                    your head?
          
          He meets her eyes with a defiant glare.
          
                              JAKE
                    Maybe I was just tired of doctors telling
                    me what I couldn't do.
          
          Grace watches him laboriously pull his inert legs into the
          link chair by hand.
          
                                                                       18.
          
          
          
          Jake settles into the warm fluid gel packs lining the unit.
          It seems to enfold him. Grace adjusts his biometric sensors,
          then lowers the UPPER CLAMSHELL --
          
                              GRACE
                    Relax and let your mind go blank.    That
                    shouldn't be hard for you.
          
                              JAKE

          of children next to his 9' tall frame.
          
          He sees something like a blue tentacle curl across his arm
          and he JERKS AROUND in alarm. HIS TAIL.
          
          As he turns to see it, the tail sweeps instruments off a
          table with a crash. Jake laughs and grins at Max.
          
                              MED TECH
                    Easy, Jake, I need you to sit down --
          
          But Jake takes a step, then another. The wires to the bio-
          monitors pull taut, and he yanks them off his chest.
          
                              MAX
                    Jake! Wait, we have to run some tests --
          
          But Jake pushes past the protesting med techs, toward the
          door and --
          
          EXT. AVATAR COMPOUND - DAY
          
          Jake emerges, blinking in the morning sun. He finds himself
          in the AVATAR COMPOUND -- a living and training area.
          
          Nearby, a couple of AVATARS are playing one-on-one in front
          of a (non-regulation height) basketball net. Others go about
          their daily activities around the compound.
          
                                                                       20.
          
          
          
          Jake flexes his legs -- JUMPS -- and lands a little
          unsteadily, but his expression is joyful.
          
          He takes a few steps and breaks into a RUN. People are
          calling to him, somehwere, but he doesn't hear them -- he's
          running. RUNNING!
          
          He finds himself in the COMPOUND GARDEN, and stops amid
          neatly tended rows of ALIEN PLANTS. He looks down, wiggling
          his toes in the warm soil. Then inhales deeply -- revelling
          in the alien smells -- earth, plants, the nearby forest. He
          looks at his bare footprint in the soil of an alien world.
          
                              GRACE (O.S.)
                    Hey Marine!
          
          Jake turns at the familiar voice to see --
          
          A statuesque FEMALE AVATAR walking toward him. AVATAR GRACE
          is magnificent, with panther thighs, flat muscular stomach
          and firm athlete's breasts. She wears shorts and a T-shirt.
          In human years she would be about 35.
          
                                JAKE
                    Grace?
          
                              GRACE
                    Well who'd you expect, numbnuts?   Think
                    fast!
          
          She throws him a piece of Pandoran fruit, which he catches.
          
                              GRACE
                    Motor control is looking good.
          
          Jake bites into the fruit, the juice running down his chin.
          
                              NORM (O.S.)
                    Hey, check it out.
          
          Jake turns to see NORM'S AVATAR posing like a bodybuilder --
          chest shot, back shot, bi's.
          
                              NORM
                    I am a living god.
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          EXT. MINE PIT - DAY
          
          A WIDE SHOT of the terraced crater of the UNOBTANIUM MINE.    A
          quiet beat, then --
          
                                                                     21.
          
          
          
          K-WHOOOOM! The entire face of one terrace is blown skyward
          in a chain of EXPLOSIONS. The "shot" blasts hundreds of tons
          of rock loose.
          
          LONG LENS ANGLES of enormous WHEEL-LOADERS shovelling up ore-
          rich rock and dropping it into DUMP TRUCKS.
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST - DAY
          
          A wall of steel FILLS FRAME. The DOZER BLADE crushes
          everything in its path, reducing trees to kindling.
          
          WIDER, showing the CLEAR-CUTTING operation near the mine, as
          a road is cut through the jungle. Remotely operated DOZERS
          three stories tall rip into the tree-line.
          
          One of the dozers has rotating SLASH-CUTTER, a vicious
          spinning head, mounted on a hydraulic arm, that hogs through
          the enormous tree trunks in a spray of wood-shrapnel.
          
          The heavy machines are escorted by AMPSUITS. COLONEL
          QUARITCH, on foot, leads a squad of troopers wearing
          breathing masks and carrying almighty big AUTOMATIC WEAPONS.
          
          A BANSHEE -- a fearsome aerial predator -- HURTLES from
          above, diving toward them on wings 3 meters across. We get a
          glimpse of glassy fangs before --
          
          P-P-POOM! Quaritch cranks off three rapid SHOTS with his
          massive sidearm, and the creature drops with a SHRIEK.
          
          It crashes near them and Quaritch FIRES two more well placed
          rounds. The newbies stare at the thing's barracuda teeth.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    For you pogues, this is a banshee. A
                    small one. See, they like it when I
                    bring fresh meat out here. And this
                    clearcutting really stirs up the hornet's
                    nest. So keep your head on a swivel. If
                    it moves, shoot it. If you're not sure
                    it's moving -- shoot it! If it looks like
                    a bunch of flowers you want to take home
                    to Sally Rottencrotch -- SHOOT IT!
                    What're you gonna do?
          
                              TROOPERS
                    Shoot it, sir!
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Outstanding. Let's roll.
          
                                                                      22.
          
          
          
          Quaritch leads his squad into the gloom of the forest, his
          eyes scanning. Flanking the squad, LYLE WAINFLEET drives an
          AMPSUIT, his massive feet CRASHING through the underbrush.
          
          As his gaze comes down, he sees something ahead of him on the
          trail -- an intricate TOTEM of woven sticks, bones and
          feathers hanging across the trail like an orb-weaver's web.
          
          He tears it down with the barrel of his rifle, and stomps it
          into the mud as he moves on.
          
          INT. AVATAR LONGHOUSE - DUSK
          
          Jake sits on a wooden bed in a long hut of tropical-style
          construction -- beamed ceiling, open sides covered by screen.
          
          Around him the other avatars are bedding down for the night,
          pulling insect netting around their cots. In one hand, Jake
          holds the end of his long braided QUEUE of hair.
          
          CLOSE ON the queue -- the ends of the hair writhe slowly with
          their own life, like tendrils of a sea creature.
          
                              JAKE
                    That's kinda freaky.
          
          GRACE switches off the overheads.
          
                              GRACE
                    Lights out amigos.     See ya' at dinner.
          
          Jake sits in the twilight, listening to the SCREECHES and
          HOOTS from the forest. Finally he lies down, CLOSING HIS
          EYES and --
          
          INT. LINK ROOM - NIGHT
          
          ECU HUMAN JAKE -- his eyes OPEN.
          
          Jake blinks, disoriented, as Max opens the upper clamshell of
          his link unit.
          
          In the next chair Grace sits up, yawning and cracking her
          neck as the scared tech runs to her with a lit cigarette.
          
                              GRACE
                        (looking down)
                    Damn. Same old sack a' bones.
          
          JAKE struggles with the dead weight of his legs as he hauls
          himself out of the unit.
                                                                   CUT TO
          
                                                                    23.
          
          
          
          INT. COMMISSARY - EARLY MORNING
          
          JAKE sits with GRACE, NORM and the other avatar "drivers",
          while around them miners, troopers and other base personnel
          wolf their breakfasts. Grace is engaged in a heated
          conversation with another SCIENTIST.
          
          Jake, isolated from the conversations around him, notices --
          
          PILOT TRUDY CHACON approaching, dressed in her flight suit.
          She's a rock-hard former Marine with thousands of flight
          hours out in the badlands.
          
                               TRUDY
                    Sully -- Colonel wants to see you in the
                    Armor Bay.
          
          Jake gives Norm a puzzled glance and pivots from the table.
          He wheels away, led by Trudy.
          
          TIGHT ON GRACE, scowling as she watches him go.
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          INT. ARMOR BAY - MORNING
          
          JAKE AND TRUDY enter the ARMOR BAY, passing TILT-ROTORS under
          repair. There are the heavily armed SCORPIONS as well as
          several SA-2 SAMSON work-horses outfitted with door guns and
          rocket pods.
          
                              JAKE
                    You guys're packing some heavy ordinance.
          
                               TRUDY
                    Yeah, `cause we're not the only thing
                    flyin' around out there. Or the biggest.
                    I'm gonna need you on a door gun, I'm a
                    man short.
          
                              JAKE
                    Yeah, no problem.
          
          She extends her fist and he taps it with his.
          
                              TRUDY
                    See ya on the flight-line, zero nine.
                        (she points)
                    He's down there.
          
          Jake rolls his chair along the central gallery of the Armor
          Bay, passing rows of AMPSUITS standing in service racks.
          Techs clamber over the `suits, loading ordinance with cranes
          and lifts.
          
                                                                      24.
          
          
          
          At the end of the row is a makeshift GYM area.   QUARITCH is
          bench-pressing massive plates.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    This low gravity makes you soft.
                        (pushing the last rep)
                    You get soft, Pandora will shit you out
                    dead with zero warning.
          
          Quaritch racks the bar and sits up, sweating but not winded.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    I pulled your record, Corporal. Venezuela
                    -- that was some mean bush. Nothing like
                    this here, though. You got heart kid,
                    coming out here.
          
                              JAKE
                    I figured -- just another hellhole.
          
          Quaritch chuckles appreciatively, claps him on the shoulder.
          The CHIEF MECHANIC yells from the nearest AMPSUIT --
          
                              MECHANIC
                    That servo's in, Colonel, if you want to
                    try it.
          
          Quaritch crosses to the `suit, with Jake following.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    I was in First Recon a few years ahead of
                    you. More than a few. Two tours in
                    Nigeria, not a scratch. I come out here
                    and --
          
          He points to his scarred face.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    They could fix this if I rotated back.
                    But you know what? I kinda like it.
                    Reminds me every day what's out there.
                    Besides, I can't leave --
          
          He looks out, as if he can see through the wall to the tree-
          line.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    This is my war, here.
          
          Quaritch climbs the `suit and reaches into the cockpit,
          throwing some switches. The `suit's gas-turbine spools up
          with a rising WHINE.
          
                                                                       25.
          
          
          
                              QUARITCH
                    The avatar program is a joke -- buncha
                    limpdick scientists. But we have a
                    unique opportunity here, you and I. A
                    recon Marine in an avatar body could get
                    me the intel I need, on the ground, right
                    in the hostiles' camp.
          
          The WHINE is now a roaring WHOOSH as the `suit trembles with
          power. The air boils above the exhaust vents.
          
          Quaritch reaches in and operates the controls, flexing one
          huge hand. He nods to the waiting mechanic --
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Looks good.
                        (to Jake)
                    I need you to learn about these savages,
                    gain their trust. Find out how I can
                    force their cooperation, or hit `em hard
                    if they don't. Maybe you can keep some
                    of my boys from going home like you. Or
                    bagged-and-tagged.
          
                              JAKE
                        (NODDING)
                    That sounds real good, Colonel.   So -- am
                    I still with Augustine?
          
                              QUARITCH
                    On paper. You walk like one of her
                    science pukes, you quack like one, but
                    you report to me. Can you do that for
                    me?
          
          Jake nods. Quaritch brings the `suit to life. He steps
          forward and pivots smoothly.
          
          He balances the two ton machine on one foot while sweeping
          the arms in strong, graceful arcs. Jake realizes he is doing
          a WU-SHOO KATA. A flawless display of strength and control.
          He's impressive, and Jake is impressed. Quaritch is the kind
          of man he respects -- focused, hard. Determined.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Look, son -- I take care of my own. Get
                    me what I need, I'll see you get your
                    legs back when you rotate home. Your real
                    legs.
          
          He raises the `suit's hand, and slams the canopy shut like
          the visor of a helmet. Jake watches Quaritch walk past, huge
          feet CLANGING -- KUNG! KUNG! KUNG!
          
                                                                      26.
          
          
          
          INT. BIO LAB - DAY
          
          GRACE is on the move, gulping coffee, in a hurry to get their
          FIRST SORTIE started. She hands a clipboard to MAX.
          
                              GRACE
                    Start calibrating. We're on the flight
                    line in ten minutes.
          
          Max nods and jogs ahead toward the LINK ROOM. JAKE and NORM
          fall in with Grace as they enter the CONNECTING CORRIDOR.
          
                              GRACE
                    What did Atilla want?
          
                              JAKE
                    Just Marines comparin' tattoos.
          
                              GRACE
                        (not buying it)
                    Yeah. Well, listen to me, Marine --
          
          She stops, turning to drill him with a look.
          
                              GRACE
                    -- you're driving an avatar, now.     That
                    means you're in my world, got it?
          
                               JAKE
                    Got it.
          
          She turns and enters the LINK ROOM.
          
          INT. LINK ROOM
          
          Grace crosses to the controls of Jake's LINK UNIT. As the
          others catch up --
          
                              GRACE
                    That son of a bitch has screwed up this
                    program enough. All this --
                        (indicating link room)
                    -- exists so we can go out there and
                    build a bridge of trust to these people,
                    who could teach us so much. But thanks
                    to Quaritch and his thugs the Na'vi won't
                    even talk to us anymore.
          
                              JAKE
                    Then how's this supposed to work?
          
                                                                     27.
          
          
          
                              GRACE
                    We have a new face.
                        (turning to Norm)
                    You're fluent, you've studied the
                    culture. You're non-threatening. The
                    ones we know best -- the Omaticaya clan --
                    may give you a chance. Maybe you can get
                    them back to the table before things go
                    tits-up for good.
          
                              NORM
                    This is failing as a pep talk.
          
          Jake hauls himself across from wheelchair to link.
          
                              JAKE
                    How do we contact them?
          
                              GRACE
                    We don't. They contact us. If they see
                    us taking our samples, treating the
                    forest with respect --
                        (pointedly to Jake)
                    Not trampling everything in sight --
                    they may reach out to us.
          
                              JAKE
                    Or they may skin us and make a drum.
          
          Jake lies back, lowering the sensor array over his body.
          
                              GRACE
                    Just keep your mouth shut and let Norm do
                    the talking.
          
          She closes his clamshell, HARD, and we --
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          EXT. RAIN FOREST / AERIAL - DAY
          
          FLYING over a carpet of rainforest, past sheer cliffs and
          cloud-wreathed mesas. TRUDY'S SAMSON TILT-ROTOR chases its
          shadow across the treetops. Though big as a Blackhawk, it is
          tiny in the vast primeval landscape.
          
          ANGLE THROUGH the open side doors of the Samson. Trooper
          WAINFLEET, in exo-mask and body armor, leans on his door gun,
          scanning for aerial predators.
          
          In avatar form JAKE, GRACE and NORM watch the forest
          unrolling beneath them, the wind blasting their clothes.
          Jake mans the other door gun, his feet propped on the skids.
          
                                                                       28.
          
          
          
          TRUDY flies from a pressurized cockpit. She banks to follow a
          shallow river.
          
                              TRUDY (INTERCOM)
                    Sturmbeest herd, one o'clock.
          
          Norm grins and points, excitedly. Jake looks in time to see--
          A herd of STURMBEEST -- massive six-legged creatures
          reminiscent of buffalo -- thundering across the river.
          
                               GRACE
                    Looks like a bull, six cows and some
                    juveniles.
          
                              NORM
                    The bull has the red on the dorsal armor?
          
          Grace nods approvingly.
          
          TIME CUT -- Hundreds of purple winged creatures take flight
          from a lake, startled by the Samson. They skim the water
          above their own reflections. TETRAPTERONS.
          
          TIME CUT -- the ground drops away as the Samson flies over a
          WATERFALL hundreds of feet high. Trudy banks hard, rolling
          in on the gorge below like it's a gun-run.
          
          Wainfleet WHOOPS while Norm looks like he's about to puke.
          
                                 WAINFLEET
                    Yo Chacon!     Get some!
          
          Jake grins into the airstream.
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          EXT. CLEARING - DAY
          
          A small meadow among towering trees. The fern-like "grass"
          is beaten down in waves by the rotor-wash as the Samson
          settles to the ground.
          
          Jake pulls the massive door gun off its pintle mount and
          hefts it like an assault rifle.
          
          He and Wainfleet leap out to secure the LZ, scanning the tree-
          line warily, weapons aimed.
          
          Grace jogs forward to the cockpit, motioning Trudy to shut
          down. Trudy kills the Samson's TURBINES.
          
          Grace, towering over Wainfleet, motions him to hang back.
          
                                                                    29.
          
          
          
                              GRACE
                    Stay with the ship.
                        (for Jake)
                    One idiot with a gun's enough.
          
                              WAINFLEET
                    Whatever you say, Doc.
          
          Jake takes point as they enter the jungle.
          
                              WAINFLEET
                        (LAUGHING)
                    Ya'll have fun out there.
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST - DAY
          
          The forest engulfs JAKE, GRACE and NORM in cyan gloom. The
          shadows are alive with the CHITTERING sounds of unseen alien
          wildlife.
          
          TRACKING WITH JAKE as he moves through the foliage, hyper-
          alert -- looking around like a tourist in Hell.A monkey-like
          PROLEMURIS leaping from limb to limb overhead, flashing
          through the sunlight streaming down in shafts.
          
          A PLANT with swaying tendrils which reach toward Jake as he
          passes.
          
          This forest is more alive than any on Earth, with plants that
          react and move like animals. Jake white-knuckles his rifle
          as if every shadow conceals razor-fanged death.
          
                              GRACE
                    Relax, Marine. You're making me nervous.
          
          She pushes ahead of him on the trail, forcing him to lower
          his muzzle as he follows her. Grace moves nimbly on the
          path, seemingly unconcerned.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          EXT. FOREST/ GLEN
          
          WIDE SHOT as the party moves between the huge trees, tiny as
          ants. The trail has gotten steeper, the going tougher.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          EXT. SCHOOL RUINS - DAY
          
          They enter a clearing with an OVERGROWN BUILDING made of
          timbers cut from the local trees, with a thatch roof. It is
          covered with vines as the jungle reclaims it.
          
                                                                     30.
          
          
          
                              NORM
                    How will they know we're here?
          
                              GRACE
                    I'm sure they're watching us right now.
          
          Norm gulps. Jake looks behind him as they approach the
          school, feeling unseen eyes.
                                                                   CUT TO:
          
          INT. SCHOOL RUINS
          
          TRACKING WITH JAKE'S BOOTS as he steps among dried leaves and
          a few moldering CHILDREN'S BOOKS. Floorboards CREAK.
          
                              GRACE (O.S.)
                    The kids were so bright, so eager to
                    learn... they picked up English faster
                    than I could teach it to them.
          
          WIDER as Jake explores the room. Grace and Norm are selecting
          INSTRUMENTS from storage cases on a wooden table.
          
                              GRACE
                    Bring the soil probe -- right there,
                    yellow case.
          
          Jake looks up at a RUSTLING among the dark rafters. Roosting
          STINGBATS eye him warily, fluttering their wings.
          
          Grace picks up a moldering copy of "The Lorax" by Dr. Seuss
          from the floor and puts it back on a shelf.
          
                               GRACE
                        (WISTFULLY)
                    The stingbats knock them off. I guess I
                    always hope somebody will come back and
                    read them.
          
                              NORM
                    Why don't they come back?
          
                              GRACE
                        (GRIMLY)
                    The Na'vi learned as much about us as
                    they needed to know.
          
          Jake sees something, and approaches the blackboard -- reaches
          out to touch a pattern of holes blasted into the slate.
          Unmistakably BULLET HOLES.
          
                                                                       31.
          
          
          
                              JAKE
                        (turning to her)
                    What happened here?
          
                              GRACE
                        (SHARPLY)
                    Are you going to help with this gear?
                    We've got a lot to do.
          
          She turns away.   Jake watches her as he jams equipment into
          his pack.
                                                                     CUT TO:
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST - DAY
          
          CLOSE ON Grace's blue hand gently brushing away soil,
          exposing a tangle of ROOT TENDRILS.
          
                              GRACE
                    See, right here where the roots of the
                    two trees interact.
          
          WIDER -- GRACE and NORM crouch among enormous octopoidal
          roots. She takes a tiny sample using a needle-like probe.
          Norm uses a digital DEVICE to scan the roots.
          
          JAKE, bored, scouts ahead a few meters.
          
          He comes to a GLADE filled with shoulder-high SPIRAL PLANTS
          called HELICORADIANS.
          
          He BRUSHES one and SHTOONK! -- it SUCKS DOWN into a tube in
          the ground so quickly it seems to simply vanish.
          
          Curious, Jake touches another -- SHTOONK! And another --
          like popping balloons after a party. SHTOONK! SHTOONK!
          SHTOONK!
          
          A chain reaction begins and the whole colony pulls down into
          the ground, REVEALING --
          
          A HAMMERHEAD TITANOTHERE. Like a six-legged rhinoceros, but
          twice that size. Its massive, low-slung head has projections
          of bone giving it the look of a hammerhead shark.
          
          Its baleful eyes lock onto him.   Jake raises his rifle.
          
          Grace, alerted by the creature's SNORTS, runs to where she
          can see the tableau. She presses her THROAT MIKE.
          
                              GRACE
                    Don't shoot. You'll piss it off.
          
                                                                       32.
          
          
          
          The bull HAMMERHEAD bellows and lowers its 3 meter wide
          sledgehammer of a skull.
          
                              JAKE
                    It's already pissed off!
          
                              GRACE
                    Jake, that armor's too thick. Trust me.
          
          Jake starts to back away.   The hammerhead bellows again,
          pawing the earth.
          
                              GRACE
                    It's a territorial threat display. Do not
                    run, or he'll charge.
          
                              JAKE
                    What do I do?
          
                              GRACE
                    Hold your ground!
          
          The hammerhead SLASHES its head sideways, splintering
          saplings. It bellows again, lowers its head and CHARGES --
          
          Jake SCREAMS at the top of his lungs, spreads his arms wide
          and runs straight at the thing.
          
          It STOPS abruptly, with an oversized BLEAT.
          
          ON JAKE -- amazed the gambit worked.
          
                               JAKE
                    Oh yeah!   Who's bad?! That's right.
          
          SOMETHING rises up behind him out of focus --
          
          A THANATOR. The most awesome land predator the universe has
          ever conceived This thing could eat a T-rex and have the
          Alien for desert.
          
          It is a black six-limbed panther from Hell, with an armored
          head and massive distensible jaws.
          
          JAKE, unaware of the advancing thanator, is still bracing the
          hammerhead --
          
                              JAKE
                    That's what I'm talkin' about, bitch!
          
          The bull wheels around, TRUMPETING in fear, and CRASHES away
          through splintering undergrowth.
          
                                                                       33.
          
          
          
                              JAKE
                    That's right motherf--
          
          A guttural SNARL behind him. Jake spins in time to see --
          
          THREE TONS of rippling thanator LAUNCH over him, landing
          between him and the hammerhead. The ground shakes.
          
          The thanator emits an earsplitting ROAR, enraged that the
          hammerhead got away. It twists on itself, turning to face
          Jake, and bares its fangs with a lethal HISS.
          
                              JAKE
                    What about this one?       Run, don't run?
                    What?
          
                                 GRACE
                    Run.     Definitely RUN!
          
          Jake BOLTS as --
          
          The thanator LEAPS after him and --
          
          Jake launches himself between two large trunks, forcing the
          beast to claw its way around to the side while --
          
          Jake scrambles up -- around -- over a tangle of roots and --
          
          SK-RASH!! CLAWS SLASH the air behind him, EXPLODING bark off
          a trunk as --
          
          JAKE wills himself forward in a frenzy. With rippling muscle
          the beast is airborne again, blacking out the sun but --
          
          JAKE dives under a massive root system, and --
          
          CRASH! Kindling rains around him as the beast tears into the
          root-trunks above him. Claws SLASH down next to him as he
          rolls and crawls --
          
          Glistening jaws SMASH and SNAP against the barrier trunks,
          sending chunks of wood flying. It's spittle sprays across
          Jake, jaws inches away as --
          
          He rolls onto his back, and FIRES his AR point blank but the
          rifle is SNATCHED out of his hands. The beast SCREECHES an
          ungodly WAIL of pain and rage and -- RIPS the ENTIRE TRUNK
          away. Jake scrambles to escape but --
          
          GLISTENING JAWS lunge downward, SNAP SHUT and --
          
          The creature rips Jake out of the tree, shaking him like a
          junkyard dog with a rabbit, only --
          
                                                                       34.
          
          
          
          It has him by the BACKPACK, so Jake unlatches it and --
          
          He FLIES FREE as the thanator crushes the pack with its
          teeth. Giving Jake a moment to sprint away, but --
          
          With a hideous BELLOW the thanator crashes after him,
          splintering trees.
          
          JAKE RUNS in a blur, dodging between trunks as a glistening
          black tornado shreds the forest behind him and --
          
          He sees WATER ahead and DIVES OUTWARD with all his might --
          
          The thanator's jaws SNAP SHUT inches behind him as he flies
          out into open space and --
          
          JAKE SPLASHES down into a swiftly moving river.
          
          The thanator LEAPS DOWN AFTER HIM, pursuing from rock to
          rock, its claws swiping like a grizzly fishing for salmon.
          
          Jake ducks under as -- FWHOOSH! -- black claws SLASH past
          his face amid turbulent bubbles.
          
          A WATERFALL ahead. Jake is swept over the falls, with the
          thanator SWIPING at him from a rock, just MISSING and --
          
          Jake disappears down the throat of the thundering cataract.
          
          EXT. RIVER BELOW FALLS - DAY
          
          The water boils below the cataract. Jake's head bursts
          through the surface, and he gasps for breath.
          
          He is carried along by the current, but manages to grab a
          limb on a fallen tree. He weakly pulls himself up, and just
          lies there gasping on the trunk.
          
          Above him, on the cliff, the THANATOR BELLOWS, a roar which
          echoes across the jungle.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST - DAY
          
          JAKE, wet and bruised, crouches under a screen of giant
          leaves.   He hacks manically at the end of a cut sapling with
          his knife, forming a crude but sharp tip.
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST - DAY
          
          TRACKING with Jake as he walks through the forest like it's a
          minefield, carrying his SPEAR white-knuckled. He is freaked
          and hyper-alert.
          
                                                                        35.
          
          
          
          The trees here are a hundred meters high, blocking out the
          sky. A few pencil beams of sunlight filter down into the
          cyan gloom.
          
          POV FROM ABOVE -- looking down through leaves we watch Jake
          move warily through the forest.
          
          ECU -- TWO GOLDEN EYES, bright in the shadows.
          
          DOWNANGLE as Jake passes under a tree limb. Invisible to
          him, draped on the limb like a leopard, is a striking NA'VI
          GIRL. She watches, only her eyes moving.
          
          She is lithe as a cat, with a long neck, muscular shoulders,
          and nubile breasts. And she is devastatingly beautiful --
          for a girl with a tail. In human age she would be 18. Her
          name is NEYTIRI(nay-Tee-ree).
          
          Jake passes less than 2 meters beneath her, oblivious.
          
          NEYTIRI rises soundlessly. In one fluid, sinuous movement
          she NOCKS an arrow to her BOW and DRAWS, aiming RIGHT AT
          JAKE. Utterly silent.
          
          Below her Jake is totally unaware of the arrow aimed at his
          THROAT.
          
          ON NEYTIRI as she follows him with the bow, muscles tensing
          for the shot --
          
          -- and SOMETHING drifts down in front of her, F.G.    She
          hesitates.
          
          RACK FOCUS to the tip of the arrow -- where a single
          WOODSPRITE floats down to land on the arrow-head.Like a
          dandelion seed, but larger, the WOODSPRITE waves its silky
          CILIA, feather light, as it balances on the deadly point. It
          glows faintly in the dark shadows.
          
          NEYTIRI frowns, puzzled, and LOWERS her bow slowly.   The
          woodsprite WHIRLS away into the gloom.
                                                                      CUT TO:
          
          INT./EXT. SAMSON - SUNSET
          
          GRACE and NORM peer down into the shadowed forest as TRUDY
          banks in a search pattern.
          
                              TRUDY (INTERCOM)
                    I'm going to have to call it, guys. We're
                    not allowed to run night ops. Colonel's
                    orders.
          
                                                                        36.
          
          
          
          Grace looks to the west.    The sun setting behind alien trees.
          
                              GRACE
                    Shit.
          
                              TRUDY
                    Sorry, Doc. He's just gonna have to hang
                    on `till morning.
          
                              GRACE
                    He's not going to make it till morning.
          
          Grace stares into the dark forest as the Samson banks hard,
          thundering away toward the setting sun.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST - NIGHT
          
          LONG LENS-- POLYPHEMUS. The giant planet rises behind the
          black trees.
          
          Jake's got a new problem. He sees shapes moving with liquid
          grace in the NIGHT shadows behind him. He is being stalked by
          a pack of VIPERWOLVES.
          
          Jake catches only glimpses -- a glint of eyes, a slinking
          black movement -- then nothing. Darkness.
          
          TIME CUT -- TIGHT ON Jake's hands as he knots his T-shirt
          around the butt end of the spear.
          
          ANGLE ON THICK SAP trickling down a tree-trunk. Jake jams
          the makeshift torch into the sap, soaking the shirt with it.
          
          A WATERPROOF MATCH from his survival kit lights the torch.
          
          The torch creates a pool of light surrounded by pulsing,
          leaping shadows. Jake turns warily as he moves along the
          trail.
          
          Behind him are several pairs of reflective green EYES.
          Another pair flanking him beside the trail. Black-on-black
          SHAPES which seem to flow like liquid.
          
          He looks up -- sees one cross a limb overhead.   Another on
          his opposite flank.
          
          Then a hideous sound, like a hyena's psychotic LAUGH.
          
          The VIPERWOLVES can run like a dog and climb like a monkey.
          They are hunting Jake from the ground and the trees.
          
                                                                       37.
          
          
          
          JAKE RUNS by torch-light, on the edge of panic. He reaches a
          steep banked stream and -- without thinking -- runs across it
          on a horizontal trunk --
          
          -- and STOPS DEAD on the other side. The torch illuminates
          GREEN EYES cutting ahead of him across the trail. The
          viperwolves have him encircled.
          
          The psychotic BARKS become more intense as they signal each
          other, getting excited. ONE MAKES A RUN at him, angling on
          his legs from behind but --
          
          JAKE WHIRLS, jamming the torch in its face.   It yips and goes
          past, but ANOTHER moves in --
          
          He jabs it with the business end of the spear and it SNARLS,
          retreating, baring its fangs.
          
          Now half a dozen are circling him in the open, and he sees
          what he's up against.   The VIPERWOLVES are six-limbed with
          shiny chitinous skin, their paws leathery BLACK HANDS.
          Intelligent eyes. Glistening black teeth in dead white gums.
          
          Jake realizes that he is making his final stand.   He whirls
          the torch in an arc, keeping them at bay --
          
          And feels a rush of adrenaline. It goes through him like a
          lightning bolt and the fear is gone.
          
                              JAKE
                        (SCREAMING)
                    I don't have all goddamn night! Come on!
                    Come on!
          
          With snarls and a blur of motion THEY ATTACK.
          
          Jake CRACKS the spear down on one, then SPINS as --
          
          ANOTHER LEAPS at him and he plants the spear in it, striking
          true, but --
          
          Its momentum wrenches it from his hands, and the torch goes
          flying. Left in semi-darkness, Jake draws his KNIFE as--
          
          A WOLF LUNGES, sinking its teeth into his arm. He YELLS in
          pain and fury, SLASHING with the knife which --
          
          CUTS deep into the beast's shoulder and it lets go.
          
          JAKE SPRINTS, trying to escape, but a snarling viperwolf
          leaps, GRABBING him by the ankle with its fore-hand. Jake
          tears away, sprawling, SCRAMBLING to get up as --
          
                                                                       38.
          
          
          
          THREE WOLVES charge at once.     The nearest LEAPS at his throat
          just as --
          
          THUNK!! -- an ARROW appears in its chest.
          
          The wolf lands on him, already a dead weight.    He pushes it
          off in time to see --
          
          A BLUE AMAZON emerge from the trees, nock another arrow, draw
          and FIRE in one fluid motion. AN UNEARTHLY YOWL as another
          wolf falls.
          
          NEYTIRI LEAPS right over Jake, and CRACKS her bow down on the
          skull of a circling wolf.
          
          ANOTHER SPRINGS at her and she drops under its weight, but
          rolls, coming up on top of it with a knife in her hand.
          
          Her knife FLASHES down, buried to the hilt in its chest.
          
          SNARLING, a wounded wolf attacks Jake, and he KICKS it away,
          but --
          
          It SPINS and leaps back onto him, and Jake barely catches its
          throat in time to keep the SNAPPING JAWS away from his face.
          
          MEANWHILE Neytiri swings her bow in a big arc, CRACKING IT
          across the heads and shoulders of two remaining wolves.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    Rrreeyaaah! Hyaaaah!!
          
          The wolves slink and circle, yelping as the bow whistles past
          them. Finally they break and run, with Neytiri chasing and--
          
          They bound away through the foliage as she SHOUTS after them--
          
                                 NEYTIRI
                    Raaaarrrr!
          
          Jake has his adversary pinned and is choking it with all his
          weight. Finally it stops thrashing. Panting, he releases it
          and looks up at --
          
          NEYTIRI. Her tail LASHES as she scans the forest, listening
          to the fading YELPS of the wolves. Satisfied the attack is
          over, she turns.
          
          She regards him coldly for a second, then walks past him.
          Neytiri picks up the torch and extinguishes it in a stream.
          
                              JAKE
                    Wait, don't --
          
                                                                       39.
          
          
          
          Jake blinks around at the darkness -- realizing he can still
          see. In fact, with the blinding torchlight gone, the forest
          is transformed.
          
          The jungle has come alive with BIOLUMINESCENCE -- spots and
          patterns, ghosts and galaxies of blue-green light.
          
          Jake scrambles to recover his spear.   Neytiri kneels beside --
          
          A DYING WOLF. It's CRIES are pitiful. It paws the air,
          trying to raise its head. She pulls her KNIFE from its
          chest.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                        (in Na'vi)
                    Forgive me, my brother.
          
          She cuts its throat, ending the pitiful cries. She touches
          its head gently, regarding it with sadness.
          
          Neytiri wipes the knife and returns it to the sheath at her
          waist. She crosses to another slain wolf and kneels, pulling
          the arrow from its heart.
          
                              JAKE
                    Look, um, I know you probably don't
                    understand this. But -- thanks. Thank
                    you. I owe you.
          
          Neytiri ignores him, assuming a prayer posture over the dead
          animal.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                        (in Na'vi)
                    Forgive me. May your spirit run with the
                    Great Mother.
          
                              JAKE
                    I would have been screwed if you hadn't
                    come along --
          
          She rises and walks away without looking at Jake.
          
                              JAKE
                    Hey, wait. Wait!   Where you goin'?
          
          He crashes through some plants, catching up to her.
          
                              JAKE
                    Slow down a second will you. I just want
                    to thank you for killing those --
          
          He makes the mistake of grasping her shoulder and --
          
                                                                     40.
          
          
          
          WHACK! She WALLOPS him upside the head with her bow in a
          fierce backhand swing, laying him out flat.
          
          He looks up to see a FURY standing over him. A Fury who
          speaks English -- accented, halting, angry English.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    Don't thank! You don't thank for this!
                    This is sad. Very sad, only.
          
                              JAKE
                    Okay, I'm sorry.    Whatever I did -- I'm
                    sorry.
          
          She gestures at the bodies of the viperwolves.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    All this is your fault! They did not need
                    to die.
          
                              JAKE
                    They attacked me.   How'm I the bad guy
                    HERE--
          
          She silences him with the tip of her bow at his throat.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    Your fault! You are like a baby, making
                    noise, don't know what to do. You should
                    not come here, all of you! You only come
                    and make problems. Only.
          
          Jake gets up, slowly, facing her.
          
                              JAKE
                    Okay, fine, you love your little forest
                    friends. So why not just let them kill
                    my ass? What's the thinking?
          
          CU Neytiri -- looking away. Finally, reluctantly, her eyes
          MEET HIS for the first time -- a riveting gaze with those big
          gold orbs.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    Why save you?
          
                              JAKE
                    Yes, why save me?
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    You have a strong heart.   No fear.
          
          She leans closer --
          
                                                                       41.
          
          
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    But stupid! Ignorant like a child!
          
          She turns away, stalking off, but Jake goes after her.
          
          TRACKING WITH Neytiri as she climbs nimbly along a huge ROOT.
          
          WIDER as she trots with perfect balance along the root, which
          forms an elevated walkway.
          
          Jake runs to catch up, realizing suddenly that he is far
          above the forest floor. Throughout the following they move
          through a GLOWING PHANTASMAGORICAL FOREST.
          
                              JAKE
                    If I'm so ignorant, maybe you should
                    teach me.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    Sky people can not learn.   You do not
                    See.
          
          She leaps to another elevated root.   Jake follows, surprised
          that he made it.
          
                               JAKE
                    Whooaa.
          
          He runs to catch up with her easy jogging pace.
          
                              JAKE
                    Then teach me to "see."
          
          She stops and he almost runs into her.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    No one can teach you to See.
          
          Then she turns and trots on.
          
          EXT. GORGE - NIGHT
          
          They run across the elevated root of an enormous tree -- a
          horizontal trunk big as an oak.
          
          WIDE SHOT as they cross a DEEP GORGE. A waterfall shimmers
          silver in the Polyphemus-light. Vines hang down a hundred
          feet into the gorge, and among them swoop stingbats and other
          night flyers.
          
                              JAKE
                    Hey, slow down. Look, I think we just
                    got off on the wrong foot and --
          
                                                                       42.
          
          
          
          Jake looks down, suddenly aware of the height.
          
                              JAKE
                    --you just have to get to know me. I'm
                    Jake. Jake Sull--
          
          A vine catches his spear and spins him off balance.   He drops
          the spear and almost falls off the root.
          
                              JAKE
                    Whooaaa -- shit!
          
          Neytiri catches him with one hand, gripping his bicep. He
          watches the spear cartwheel down to splash in the river.
          
          She pulls him upright. Shouts at him in English and Na'vi.
          
                              JAKE
                    I need your help.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    You should not be here.
          
                              JAKE
                    So take me with you.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    No. You go back.
          
          DOWN ANGLE FROM FAR ABOVE -- several WOODSPRITES float down
          through the trees. FOLLOW THEM as they descend silently
          toward Jake and Neytiri.
          
          NEYTIRI, sensing a presence, looks up to see --
          
          The WOODSPRITES, PULSING with purpose, float right towards
          Jake. They dance gently around his shoulders and head.
          
                              JAKE
                        (off her amazed look)
                    What?
          
          More woodsprites gather around him.   Several ALIGHT on him.
          
          Jake holds still, knowing he should be afraid -- but somehow
          he's not. He spreads his arms. More sprites come, landing
          all over his arms, hands, body.
          
                              JAKE
                    What are they?
          
          CU NEYTIRI -- reacting with a mixture of wonder and dread.
          
                                                                       43.
          
          
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    Atokirina'. Seeds of the Great Tree --
                    very pure spirits.
          
          Jake -- now a pulsing, glowing, fluttering MASS OF LIGHT --
          moves one hand slowly, not wanting to break the spell. He
          studies one of the sprites dancing on his palm until --
          
          -- WHOOSSHH! the woodsprites whirl up and away, scattering
          into the darkness.
          
                              JAKE
                    What was that all about?
          
          Neytiri seems shaken.   She seizes his hand and pulls him
          after her.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    Come!
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST - NIGHT
          
          TRACKING WITH JAKE as he gazes about him in growing wonder.
          He touches leaves as he passes, watching the bioluminescence
          shiver through them.
          
          Jake looks down as -- they cross a bed of purple MOSS which
          reacts to the pressure of their footsteps. Rings of green
          light, like ripples on a pond, expand outward from each
          footfall. Exploding rings of light where his feet touch
          down. Dream-like, surreal beauty.
          
          WIDE ON THEM as they run over a large root, across a mirror-
          like POOL at the base of a WATERFALL.
          
          Jake follows Neytiri, running along a raised root-trunk.
          
                              JAKE
                    What's your name?
          
          JAKE hears WHOOSH-WHOOSH and snaps a look as a BOLO flies at
          him, spinning end for end and --
          
          SHWHAP!! -- tangles around his legs.   He topples off the root
          and crashes into the foliage below.
          
          JAKE untangles himself, getting up to run just as --
          
          SEVERAL NA'VI RIDERS thunder toward him. They are riding
          DIREHORSES -- six-legged, armor-skinned alien Clydesdales.
          
                                                                       44.
          
          
          We see that the riders' QUEUES are connected to the horses'
          long moth-like antennae -- a neural-link with which they can
          command the horse, leaving hands free for weapons.
          
          The riders aim bows and spears at Jake as they approach. Jake
          turns to bolt, but --
          
          NA'VI HUNTERS melt out of the shadows, weapons aimed --
          blocking his retreat.
          
          Neytiri drops to the ground next to Jake and confronts the
          LEAD RIDER. She shouts sharply in Na'vi --
          
                              NEYTIRI
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    Tsu'tey, what are you doing?! He is my
                    captive!
          
          TSU'TEY(tsu-Tay)is young and powerfully built, with sculpted
          features and a proud jawline, piercing eyes. Tsu'tey swings
          off his mount with fluid grace.
          
                              TSU'TEY
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    These demons are forbidden here. I will
                    kill this one as a lesson to the others!
          
          Tsu'tey draws his bow but Neytiri leaps between him and Jake,
          confronting him warrior to warrior.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    Stop! There has been a sign. This is a
                    matter for the Tsahik.
          
          Tsu'tey clenches his jaw with frustration -- frustration with
          her as much as the situation. He turns and angrily remounts
          his direhorse, barking a command to the HUNTERS.
          
                               TSU'TEY
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    Bring him.
          
          They grab Jake and haul him to his feet. Encircled by spears
          and bows, he is shoved forward along the trail, as Tsu'tey
          and the others ride ahead.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          EXT. HOMETREE - NIGHT
          
          JAKE is hauled roughly toward Neytiri's village, which is
          sheltered inside one of the GREAT TREES. HOMETREE is 250
          meters tall, with a trunk four times the diameter of the
          largest Sequoia, and a base of massive mangrove-pillars.
          
                                                                      45.
          
          
          
          TSU'TEY rides inside the columns at the base of Hometree,
          shouting an ululating WARNING.
          
          Jake is force-marched through the pillars into --
          
          INT. COMMONS/HOMETREE - NIGHT
          
          An open CENTRAL AREA. The villagers gather to see the
          arriving hunt party. We see the people of the tribe --
          mothers with babies, old women, young hunters.
          
          They gawk at the alien, expressions ranging from curiosity to
          outright hostility. The huge eyes of the children follow
          him.
          
          Jake is amazed at the size of HOMETREE inside. By the light
          of the COOK-FIRES he can see up into a vast cylindrical
          gallery -- a living cathedral.
          
          Clear membranes -- sturmbeest bladders -- filled with
          fluttering bio-luminescent insects, act as area lighting.
          
          The central space is dominated by the SKULL of some enormous
          creature, mounted with much embellishment on a TOTEM.
          Standing in front of this, awaiting their approach, is --
          
          EYTUKAN (AY-too-kahn), the Clan Leader. Eytukan has deeply
          chiselled features and a long chest mantle of THANATOR CLAWS.
          His normally stern features are clouded further by anger.
          
                              EYTUKAN
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    Why do you bring this creature here?
          
          Neytiri addresses Eytukan in Na'vi.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    I was going to kill him, but there was a
                    sign from Eywa.
          
          He glowers at her as he responds, pointing at Jake.
          
                              EYTUKAN
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    I have said no dreamwalker will come
                    here, to offend our home! His alien
                    smell fills my nose
          
          Neytiri stands her ground, answering in a respectful but not
          submissive tone.
          
                                                                       46.
          
          
          
                              NEYTIRI
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    Father, many atokirina came to this
                    alien.
          
                              JAKE
                    What's going on?
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    My father is deciding whether to kill
                    you.
          
                              JAKE
                    Your father!?
                        (to Eytukan)
                    Uh, good to meet you, sir.
          
          Jake steps forward, offering his hand, and the hunters JUMP
          to restrain him, shouting. But they all FREEZE as --
          
          A commanding FEMALE VOICE echoes through the chamber.
          
                               MO'AT
                        (NA'VI)
                    Step back!
          
          Everybody looks up.
          
          MO'AT (MOH-aht) stands on the second level, looking down.
          She is a severe woman in her 50's. Her bearing is haughty,
          her expression friendly as a hanging-judge. Her outfit is
          elaborate, denoting her rank as CLAN MATRIARCH.
          
                              MO'AT
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    I will look at this alien.
          
          There is an expectant hush as Mo'at descends the helical core
          of Hometree, a kind of natural spiral staircase.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    That is Mother. She is Tsahik -- the one
                    who interprets the will of Eywa.
          
                              JAKE
                    Who's Eywa?
          
          Neytiri kneels before her like an acolyte as Mo'at passes.
          
          The villagers stare silently as the Matriarch circles slowly
          around Jake, examining his tail and the end of his queue.
          
                                                                     47.
          
          
          
                              MO'AT
                        (thick accent)
                    What are you called?
          
                              JAKE
                    Jake Sully.
          
          She produces a long THORN between her fingertips. With a
          flourish she strikes his chest.
          
          Jake flinches. RED BLOOD wells up and Mo'at rubs some
          between her fingertips. She tastes it.
          
                              MO'AT
                    Why did you come to us?
          
                              JAKE
                    I came to learn.
          
                              MO'AT
                    We have tried to teach other Sky People.
                    It is hard to fill a cup which is already
                    full.
          
                              JAKE
                    My cup is empty, trust me. Just ask
                    Doctor Augustine. I'm no scientist.
          
                              MO'AT
                    What are you?
          
                              JAKE
                    I don't know. I was a Marine -- uh, a
                    warrior. Of the Jarhead clan.
          
                              TSU'TEY
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    A warrior! I could kill him easily!
          
                              EYTUKAN
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    No! This is the first warrior
                    dreamwalker we have seen. We need to
                    learn more about him.
          
                              JAKE
                    What's going on?   What are they saying?
          
                              MO'AT
                        (to Neytiri, subtitled)
                    Daughter. You will teach him our way, to
                    speak and walk as we do.
          
                                                                     48.
          
          
          
          NEYTIRI looks shocked, then angry.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    Why me? That's not fair!     I only--
          
                              MO'AT
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    It is decided!
          
          Neytiri subsides, turning to glare at Jake.
          
                              MO'AT
                        (to Jake)
                    My daughter will teach you our ways.
                    Learn well, Jakesully. We will see if
                    your insanity can be cured.
          
          She turns to Neytiri, her expression stern --
          
                              MO'AT
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    He is your responsibility.
          
          Neytiri nods, accepting, but she's not a happy camper.   She
          grabs Jake's arm and pulls him roughly away.
          
                              JAKE
                    So it's all good, right?   You and me --
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    Do not speak.
                                                                   CUT TO:
          
          INT. SECOND LEVEL/HOMETREE
          
          LATER, Neytiri leads Jake up the spiral to the SECOND LEVEL.
          He now wears only a ratty LOINCLOTH. His wounds are bound
          with plant-fiber bandages.
          
          THE ENTIRE CLAN is squatting at dinner in a huge circle. They
          stop talking and turn to gaze at Jake as he enters the
          circle.
          
                              JAKE
                    Don't get up.
          
          Neytiri crosses the circle to the cook pit and returns with
          several large leaves heaped with food. She kneels next to
          Jake, placing the food in front of him almost DEFIANTLY.
          
                              JAKE
                    You never told me your name.
          
                                                                       49.
          
          
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    Neytiri te Ckaha Mo'at'ite.
          
                              JAKE
                    Okay, again, a whole lot slower.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                        (exaggerated slowness)
                    Neytiri. Nay-TEE-ree.
          
          Jake knows she's baiting him.   He smiles in response.
          
                              JAKE
                    Nay-TEE-ree. That's nice. Nay-TEE-ree.
          
          ACROSS THE CIRCLE, Tsu'tey, Mo'at and Eytukan sit together,
          glancing up occasionally from their food to the stranger.
          
                              TSU'TEY
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    These aliens try to look like people, but
                    they can't.
          
                              MO'AT
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    He seems dim to me.   And his eyes are too
                    small.
          
          NEYTIRI motions for Jake to take portions from the serving
          leaves onto his own leaf.
          
                              JAKE
                    Your mom likes me.    I can tell.
          
          MO'AT, watching Jake and Neytiri, leans over to Eytukan.
          
                              MO'AT
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    Neytiri will test this "warrior." Hey may
                    learn nothing -- but we will learn much.
          
                              EYTUKAN
                    You speak truth. We must understand
                    these Sky People if we are to drive them
                    out.
          
          Jake munches on a white shrimp-like thing.
          
                              JAKE
                    These rock. What are they?
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    Teylu. You call beetle larvae.
          
                                                                       50.
          
          
          
          Jake blanches. She heaps some more onto his leaf -- a
          CHALLENGE -- and Jake meets her eyes, takes a handful, and
          starts munching enthusiastically.
          
                              JAKE
                    That's some damn fine teylu. That's like
                    grandma's teylu.
          
          CU TSU'TEY, warily eyeing Jake --
          
                              TSU'TEY
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    I say she will kill him.
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          INT. THIRD LEVEL - NIGHT
          
          The sleeping level -- families nesting in groups on woven
          hammocks the size of trampolines. The hunters sleep along
          SPOKES joining the inner trunk to the tree's outer shell.
          
          Jake lies awake in a hammock, people rustling in the darkness
          around him. Neytiri is nearby, curled up like a little girl.
          She stares at him for a moment, then closes her eyes.
          
          Jake watches the glowing bugs fluttering inside a night-
          light, a pulse of life energy. A strange peace spreads
          through him. He closes his eyes and --
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          INT. LINK ROOM - NIGHT
          
          GRACE is over JAKE in the Link, SLAPPING him, as Max and NORM
          hover.
          
                              GRACE
                    Come on back, kid, that's it.
          
                              JAKE
                    Wha --? Oh.
          
          He looks around, blinking.   Reality crashing in.
          
                              GRACE
                    Damn, you were dug in like a tick.
                        (she helps him sit up)
                    Is the avatar safe?
          
                              JAKE
                        (huge grin)
                    Yeah, Doc -- and you are not going to
                    believe where I am.
                                                                 CUT TO:

          INT. COMMISSARY - MORNING
          
          BREAKFAST the next day. The other drivers lean forward,
          hanging on Grace's re-telling of the tale.
          
                              GRACE
                    -- so the kid's out there one night and
                    he's got the Queen Bitch herself offering
                    him the spare room and the car keys.
                    Unbelievable.
          
                              JAKE
                    It's not something you can teach.
          
          Some of the other scientists clap Jake on the shoulders in
          congratulation.

                    That's awesome, Jake.
          
          NORM chomps his bacon, fuming.

                         (to Jake, getting serious)
                    For reasons I cannot fathom, the
                    Omaticaya have chosen you. God help us
                    all.

          INT. OPS CENTER - MORNING
          
          JAKE has reported to SELFRIDGE and QUARITCH. Quaritch turns
          from gazing out at the wall of forest, displaying a feral
          grin.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Jarhead clan?
                        (he laughs)
                    And that worked?
          
                              JAKE
                        (GRINNING)
                    Yeah. They want to study me.   See if I
                    can learn to be one of them.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    That's how you seize the initiative. I
                    wish I had ten more like you.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    Look, Sully -- find out what these blue
                    monkeys want.

                    We try to give them medicine and
                    education. Roads! But no -- they like
                    mud. I wouldn't care except --
          
          Selfridge turns to a large 3D GRAPHIC DISPLAY, pointing. A
          road runs from Hell's Gate to a proposed new mine miles away.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    Their damn village is sitting right over
                    the richest unobtanium deposit for a
                    hundred klicks in any direction. Which
                    sucks -- for them -- because they need to
                    relocate.
          
                              JAKE
                        (taking that in)
                    Does Augustine know about this?
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    Yeah, she does, and she's on the next
                    ship back if she tries to cock-block me
                    on it.
          
                              JAKE
                    So -- who talks them into moving?
          
                              QUARITCH
                        (TURNING)
                    Guess.
          
                              JAKE
                    What if they won't go?
          
                              QUARITCH
                        (ICY)
                    I'm betting they will.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    Killing the indigenous looks bad, but
                    there's one thing shareholders hate more
                    than bad press -- and that's a bad
                    quarterly statement. Find me a carrot to
                    get them to move, or it's going to have
                    to be all stick.
          
          Jake is shaken by the enormity of this new responsibility.

          INT. BIO LAB - MORNING
          
          JAKE pumps his chair across the lab, flanked by GRACE and
          NORM. Grace holds STEREO STILL PICTURES in front of him, one
          at a time -- images of clan members she has shot over the
          years -- a kind of flash card drill.

                    -- but she's the spiritual leader.   Like

          The dialogue is continuous as they enter.

                    Got it. So who's this Eywa?
          
                              NORM
                    Who's Eywa? Oh, only their deity. The
                    Great Mother. The goddess made up of all
                    living things. You'd know that if you
                    had any training whatsoever.
          
          He hauls himself from wheelchair to Link.

                    Who's got a date with the chief's

                    Knock it off. Jesus, it's like
                    kindergarten around here.
          
          As Jake settles into the soft embrace of the link, Grace
          inputs commands at the control station.
          
                              GRACE
                    Neytiri was my best student. She and her

                              JAKE
                    I didn't meet the sister.

                    Okay, let's go -- village life starts

          CU JAKE'S AVATAR, blinking awake, staring up at --
          
          HOMETREE, like a gothic cathedral overhead.   Sunlight streams
          down through gaps in the towering vault.
                                                                   CUT TO:
          
          INT. COMMONS - DAY
          
          JAKE walks among the villagers, who go about their daily
          tasks.
          
          -- young girls sit together, weaving and SINGING.    They look
          up as he passes, then go back to work.
          
          --two men clean the fish they've caught.
          
          -- a young mother pounds seeds into meal, while nursing an
          infant.
          
          --children chase each other and climb like monkeys. One bold
          LITTLE GIRL runs up to Jake, stops -- staring -- then shrieks
          with laughter as she runs back to her playmates.
          
          GRINNING, Jake turns to see NEYTIRI cantering toward him on a
          DIREHORSE. She leads a second horse, an old sway-backed
          MARE. His grin drops.
          
          EXT. RIVER NEAR HOMETREE - DAY
          
          JAKE nervously grips the surcingle of the mare. Neytiri holds
          its nose-ring while Jake clumsily mounts.
          
          Jake bends one of its ANTENNAE down to the tip of his queue.
          He hesitantly touches them together and --
          
                                                                       55.
          
          
          
          TIGHT SHOT -- the tendrils INTERWEAVE.
          
          Jake's PUPILS DILATE and his mouth drops open. The horse's
          eyes also go wide and it HONKS nervously. Neytiri touches her
          fingertips to the neural interface.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    This is shahaylu -- the bond. Feel her
                    heartbeat, her breath. Feel her strong
                    legs.
          
          Jake closes his eyes, nodding.   One with the horse.
          
          TSU'TEY and another young hunter come out of the forest
          leading TWO DIREHORSES. The magnificent animals drink from
          the edge of the pool. Tsu'tey watches Jake's riding lesson
          with disdain.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    You may tell her what to do --
                        (she touches her head)
                    -- inside. For now, say where to go.
          
                               JAKE
                    Forward.
          
          The horse LAUNCHES into a GALLOP. Jake flops around, with no
          idea how to sit the animal, and is promptly THROWN OFF. He
          lands painfully in the mud.
          
          He gets up, brushing mud off knees and ass, as Neytiri leads
          the horse back to him.
          
                               NEYTIRI
                    Again.
          
          SERIES OF JUMP CUTS -- Jake falls off the horse in various
          ways, seemingly landing harder each time.
          
          ON JAKE, face down in the mud of the riverbank. He painfully
          rises to hands and knees. Which is when he sees --
          
          TSU'TEY and another HUNTER thundering across the shallow
          river on their direhorses. Spray blasts up from their
          hooves.
          
          Jake stands, covered in mud, as Tsu'tey stops his horse next
          to him, looking down with disdain.
          
                              TSU'TEY
                    You should go away.
          
                                                                       56.
          
          
          
                              JAKE
                        (to Neytiri)
                    I knew this guy could speak English.
          
          Tsu'tey turns to Neytiri, who is leading the old mare back.
          
                               TSU'TEY
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    This alien will learn nothing.   A rock
                    Sees more.
          
          She sighs in agreement. Tsu'tey and the other hunter wheel
          their horses around and THUNDER OFF into the woods.
          
          NEYTIRI gestures to Jake's horse.
          
                               NEYTIRI
                    Again.

          Grouped around a table are JAKE, COLONEL QUARITCH, SELFRIDGE
          and few ENGINEERS and OFFICERS. Jake is talking them through
          plans he's made of Hometree's inner structure.
          
                              JAKE
                    You've got outer columns, then a
                    secondary ring here, and an inner ring.
                    Then a core structure, it's like a
                    spiral, that's how they move up and down.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    I'm going to need accurate scans of all
                    these columns.
          
                              JAKE
                    Roger that.
          
          ANGLE ON MAX, at the stairwell. He's been watching Jake
          talking rapidly to Quaritch, but can't hear him. Frowning,
          he backs away, down the stairs.
                                                                 CUT TO:

                    The Hallelujah Mountains?
          
                              GRACE
                    That's right.
          
                              NORM
                    Yesssss!
                        (off Jake's look)
                    The legendary Floating Mountains of
                    Pandora? Heard of them?
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST - AERIAL - DAY
          
          A SAMSON THUNDERS over the rainforest, climbing into the mist-
          shrouded mountains.
          
          In the SEALED COCKPIT, Norm is up front, sitting left seat so
          Trudy can talk him through the flight controls. Jake and
          Grace are behind them, in the jump-seats.
          
          Grace and Norm's UNCONSCIOUS AVATARS ride in the open back
          compartment.
          
                              TRUDY
                    It only takes tiny inputs.   Here, put
                    your hand on the cyclic --
          
          She points to the stick between her knees. Norm hesitantly
          reaches over and rests his hand on hers.
          
                              TRUDY
                    Feel how small the moves are? You barely
                    have to think it, and the aircraft
                    reacts.
          
          ON NORM -- reacting to tiny inputs from the hot lady-pilot.
          
          THE SAMSON is dwarfed by enormous ARCHES OF ROCK.
          
                              GRACE
                    See these magnetic formations.   We're
                    getting close.
          
                              TRUDY
                    Yeah we are. Look at my instruments.
          
          On the dash, many of the displays are fritzing out.
          
                                                                       58.
          
          
          
                              GRACE
                    Yup. We're in the flux vortex.
          
          AHEAD, a cloud bank parts, revealing --
          
          THE HALLELUJAH MOUNTAINS.   Right in front of them.
          
                              NORM
                    Oh. My. God.
          
          Jake leans forward between the seatbacks for a good look out
          the front canopy.
          
          JAKE'S POV -- enormous islands of rock are hovering a half
          mile above the ground. They are overgrown with rainforest,
          and straggly beards of vines hang down beneath them.
          Waterfalls stream down the sides and dissolve into spray at
          the bottom.
          
          ON JAKE, staring in amazement.   It is both awe-inspiring and
          disturbing.
          
          Trudy turns, grinning at Jake.
          
                              TRUDY
                    You should see your face.
          
          WIDE AERIAL -- the Samson is tiny as it approaches the
          floating islands of rock. An archipelago among the clouds,
          they cast great shadows over the forested slopes below.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    Yeah, so what does hold them up? Grace
                    explained it to me -- some kind of maglev
                    effect because unobtanium is a
                    superconductor, or something. At least
                    somebody understands it. Just not me.
                                                                  CUT TO:

          A remote RESEARCH STATION -- TWO SHACKS and a few clusters of
          instruments perched on a promontory near the Hallelujah
          Mountains. The shacks are AIRLIFT MODULES the size of buses.
          
          THE SAMSON LANDS, beating the grass with its rotor-wash. The
          humans hop out, wearing MASKS.
          
          They move toward the Shack, taking in the spectacular
          panorama.
                                                                  CUT TO:

          INT. SHACK - DAY
          
          NORM and TRUDY assist JAKE with his chair as they cycle in
          through the AIRLOCK. GRACE is already inside, starting the
          GENNY. She turns on the lights and equipment.
          
          There are 4 bunks, a clutter of science gear, and -- through
          a short connecting corridor -- THREE LINK UNITS in the second
          module.
          
          As Grace powers up the Link equipment, Jake stops to look at
          STEREO STILL PICTURES which are taped and tacked up around
          her workstation.
          
          CLOSE ON PICTURES -- Grace posing at the school with various
          grinning children. There is one of her with two lanky girls,
          a younger Neytiri and an older girl who looks much like her.
          
                              GRACE
                    Jake, take number two, it's the least
                    glitchy. Norm, I need you to operate
                    Jake's link.
          
          Norm glares at Jake as he passes.
          
                              JAKE
                    Hey. You got a problem?
          
          Norm turns to Grace, his frustration boiling over.
          
                              NORM
                    I trained three years for this mission.
                    I speak the language fluently.
                        (he points at Jake)
                    He falls off the frickin' turnip truck
                    and all of a sudden he's cultural
                    ambassador!?
          
                              GRACE
                    It's not our choice, Norm.
          
          He glowers at Jake.
          
                              NORM
                    Yeah, well I didn't come out here to wash
                    the dishes while you're on some
                    interspecies booty call.
          
          He stalks off.
          
                              GRACE
                    He can't go far.

          She points to Jake's link.
          
                              GRACE
                    Let's get you in.
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          INT./EXT. HOMETREE - BANSHEE EYRIE
          
          LOOKING DOWN the central shaft of Hometree, 80 meters to the
          ground. Villagers are ant-like.
          
          Jake tries to keep up with Neytiri as she leaps up the core
          trunk like a lemur. He climbs the last section, arriving out
          of breath beside her. She leads him OUTSIDE, onto --
          
          A large branch. Through gaps in the foliage Jake can see
          other Great Trees scattered across the landscape, like
          enormous umbrellas above the rainforest.
          
          NEYTIRI strides out across the branch toward some kind of
          STRUCTURE -- a WEB made of thick woven fiber. DARK SHAPES
          clinging to it stir with a leathery RUSTLING SOUND.
          
          Neytiri makes a series of TRILLS and CLICKS. One of the
          shapes MOVES toward them, emerging into a shaft of sunlight.
          
          A huge MOUNTAIN BANSHEE. Much larger than the forest
          banshees, this thing is taller than a Na'vi with a 10 meter
          wingspan. A leathery FWHOOP, like the crack of sails, as it
          alights on the branch right in front of her.
          
                                 JAKE
                    Holy shit.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    Do not look in her eye.
          
          Neytiri feeds it a large scrap of meat, which it SNATCHES and
          gulps down. She murmurs to it and strokes its NECK.
          
          It lets out a signature SHRIEK, and some of the others in the
          shadows nearby answer.
          
          Neytiri flip-catches her queue and gently connects it to the
          Banshee's ANTENNA. It shivers and stretches its wings as the
          neural connection is made.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    Ikran is not horse. Once shahaylu is
                    made, ikran will fly with only one Hunter
                    in the whole life.
          
          She climbs smoothly onto the animal's back.
          
                                                                       61.
          
          
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    To become taronyu -- Hunter -- you must
                    choose your own ikran. And he must choose
                    you.
          
                                 JAKE
                    When?
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    When you are ready.
          
          The BANSHEE shivers with anticipation.
          
                                 NEYTIRI
                    Heeyaaahh!
          
          Jake ducks as the great wings EXPLODE OPEN and the banshee
          DROPS off the branch. It swoops down across the forest
          canopy, banks hard, lets out a CRY and beats its wings in a
          power climb.
          
          Completing the bank, Neytiri directs the banshee into a close
          SWOOPING FLYBY, and Jake instinctively ducks.
          
          ON NEYTIRI -- flying in perfect fusion with her winged mount,
          the rainforest rolling beneath her.
                                                                  CUT TO:

          STEREO VIDEO-LOG IMAGE -- Jake has just switched on the
          camera. He looks tired.
          
                              JAKE
                    Do I have to do this?   I need some rack.
          
          GRACE, behind him, looks up from her MICROSCOPE, scowling.
          
                              GRACE
                    No -- now, when it's fresh.
          
                              JAKE
                    Yeah, yeah.
                        (to camera)
                    The days are starting to blur together.
                    The language is a bitch, but I figure
                    it's like field-stripping a weapon.
                    Repetition.
          
          THIS THROWS US INTO A TEACHING MONTAGE:
          
          JAKE AND NEYTIRI kneel together inside Hometree. Neytiri
          touches her lips with her fingertips.
          
                                                                       62.
          
          
          
                                 JAKE
                    Seyri.
          
          She touches her nose, her ears, her eyes in quick sequence.
          
                              JAKE
                    Ontu, mikyun, nari.
          
          NEYTIRI stands next to him, correcting his position as he
          draws a longbow.
          
          BARKING commands, she SMACKS him on the shoulder, then the
          elbow, repositioning him roughly.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    Neytiri thinks I'm some kind of retard.
          
          HUMAN JAKE emerges from the LINK to see --
          
          TRUDY and NORM caught IN THE ACT on Norm's bunk. Norm blushes
          and Trudy waves, pulling the blanket over their heads.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    Norm's attitude has improved lately.
          
          NORM works with JAKE at the small table in the SHACK kitchen.
          
                                 NORM
                    Thank you?
          
                                 JAKE
                    Ireiyo.
          
          Norm comically exaggerates the pronunciation.
          
                              NORM
                    Irrrreiyo. Irrrreiyo.   You've gotta roll
                    the R, r-r-r-oll it.
          
          Norm makes Jake repeat the word, getting more frustrated.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    It's good he's back on board, but he
                    thinks I'm a retard too.
          
          TRACKING WITH JAKE'S FEET as he runs over rocks, leaping onto
          a thick root, running on across the rough bark.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    My feet are getting tougher.   I can run
                    farther every day.
          
                                                                       63.
          
          
          
          Neytiri leads him along a massive root, and soon they are
          running 30 meters above the ground.
          
          He sprints with her through the trees, trying to keep up.
          She CLIMBS and LEAPS with the ease of a spider monkey.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    I have to trust my body to know what to
                    do. With Neytiri it's learn fast or die.
          
          Neytiri LEAPS off into space, falling, falling until --
          
          She catches an enormous palm leaf and, gripping it, allows
          its DROOP to slow her fall. She lets go, plummeting, and
          catches another.
          
          JAKE FOLLOWS in a leap of faith. THE CAMERA PLUNGES with
          him, from leaf to leaf, down and down in a dizzying kinetic
          rush.
          
          He drops down from the last leaf, landing next to her on a
          game trail. He is exhilarated to still be alive.
          
          Neytiri is surprised -- that he followed.   That he lived.
          
          TIGHT ON HUMAN JAKE, in the shack. Thinking as he looks at
          the pictures of Grace with the laughing kids at the school.
          
          IN THE COMMONS -- AVATAR NORM formally greets MO'AT. The
          Matriarch looks on as GRACE kneels to hug children she knows.
          Grace's eyes sparkle as she chats with them in Na'vi.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    I sweet-talked Mo'at into giving Norm and
                    Grace a hall pass. Now Grace even makes
                    me coffee before link every morning.
          
          Grace looks up to see Neytiri approaching. It is an awkward
          moment between them. Grace makes the formal gesture of
          greeting.
          
                              GRACE
                        (Na'vi, subtitled)
                    I See you, Neytiri Mo'at'ite.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    I See you, Doctor Grace Augustine.
          
          ANOTHER DAY -- NEYTIRI kneels on a game trail, pointing out
          the tracks in the mud to Jake. She touches the edges of the
          plants around her, and sniffs the air.
          
                                                                      64.
          
          
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    I'm learning to read the trails, the
                    tracks at the water-hole, the tiniest
                    scents and sounds.
          
          JAKE AND NEYTIRI watch through a screen of leaves as --
          
          A HERD of huge, armored STURMBEEST walks through the shallows
          of a lake. In the middle of the herd, the babies are
          sheltered from predators among their parents' legs.
          
          One of the BULLS trumpets, and a flock of TETRAPTERONS takes
          flight, an explosion of purple wings.
          
          Jake stares at the strange and wild alien tableau.
          
          ANOTHER PLACE -- NEYTIRI STANDS utterly still, except for her
          ears, which move with a life of their own. Her eyes are
          closed. She speaks very softly to Jake --
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    When you hear nothing, you will hear
                    everything. When you see nothing, you
                    will See everything.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    Sometimes I have no idea what she's
                    talking about.
          
          Jake and Neytiri creep quietly, stalking a large male
          HEXAPEDE -- a six legged deer-like creature.
          
          Jake expertly nocks an arrow and draws his bow as Neytiri
          watches. He takes a bead on the hexapede -- tracks it for a
          beat with the drawn bow, then RELAXES his arm. Zen archery.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    It's been a month and I'm still not
                    allowed to make a kill. She says the
                    forest hasn't given permission.
          
          OMIITED
          
          NEYTIRI and JAKE crawl through the undergrowth.   She points
          and he parts some leaves to see --
          
          A MOTHER VIPERWOLF bringing meat to her cubs, which frisk
          around her legs. She licks their faces.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    There's a lot of crap like that. She's
                    always going on about the flow of energy--
                    the spirits of the animals and what not --
          
                                                                        65.
          
          
          
          VIDEO-LOG IMAGE -- HUMAN JAKE talks into the lens.    He's
          changing -- un-shaven, cheeks hollow. Pale.
          
                               JAKE
                        (SMIRKING)
                    I just hope this treehugger shit isn't on
                    the final.
          
          Visible behind him, Grace is hunched over her samples.
          
                              GRACE
                        (without looking up)
                    This isn't just about eye-hand
                    coordination out there. You need to
                    listen to what she says. Try to see the
                    forest through their eyes.
          
                              JAKE
                    Excuse me -- this is my video-log here,
                    okay?
          
          NEYTIRI AND JAKE move through the NIGHT FOREST, surrounded by
          galaxies of shimmering bioluminescence. They move
          gracefully, soundlessly -- two forest spirits.
          
          CU JAKE -- the pupils of his cat eyes dilated. The night
          forest floods his brain with its million bio-sources.
          
          NIGHT SHOT, from overhead -- Jake and Neytiri bow-fishing
          from a dugout canoe over huge glowing ANEMONES at the bottom
          of a pool.
          
          A large fish swims silhouetted against the pastel glow.      ZAP!
          Jake drills it. He holds up the fish, triumphantly.
          
          ANOTHER DAY -- Neytiri stands close behind Jake, adjusting
          his position as he draws his bow. Only now her hands are
          GENTLE as they move on his arms, his shoulders.
          
          Aware of her touch, Jake's focus is broken.   Their eyes meet,
          and she pulls away quickly.
          
          NIGHT -- they enter a CLEARING filled with chest-high ferns.
          Neytiri signals him to move slowly. They approach a creature
          on one of the ferns. An ugly, stick-like LIZARD-THING
          perched on a frond. As he approaches --
          
          SNAP! A long spine whips in a circle, unfurling a
          bioluminescent membrane -- a disk a meter across, opening
          like a Chinese fan. It FLIES OFF, a living Frisbee.
          
          THE FAN LIZARD FLOATS across the clearing.
          
                                                                        66.
          
          
          
          Neytiri plunges among the ferns with a SHARP CRY. An
          EXPLOSION OF COLOR as dozens of FAN LIZARDS take flight.
          
          Grinning widely, she hops around like a little girl, until
          they are all flying. And for the first time, she is
          unguarded and joyful, totally herself with him.
          
          INSIDE THE LINK -- Jake's eyes open in the darkness. He
          doesn't know where he is. He weakly pushes open the lid,
          blinking at the light.
          
                               JAKE (V.O.)
                    Everything is backwards now. Like out
                    there is the true world, and in here is
                    the dream.
          
          TIGHT ON AVATAR JAKE silently drawing his bow, his eyes
          focused in intense concentration. A beat -- the arrow flies.
          
          JAKE PULLS the arrow from the twitching body of a hexapede.
          He dispatches it with his knife.
          
          He speaks haltingly, but with feeling, in Na'vi.
          
                              JAKE
                        (NA'VI)
                    I See you Brother, and thank you. Your
                    spirit goes with Eywa, your body stays
                    behind to become part of the People.
          
          NEYTIRI watches with approval.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    A clean kill. You are ready.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          INT. SHACK - NIGHT
          
          Lying in the link, Jake looks exhausted, pale, thin.   Norm
          helps Grace get him to his chair.
          
                              GRACE
                    You're still losing weight.   Here --
          
          She hands him a microwaved burrito. He looks at the now alien
          food. Bites into it without enthusiasm.
          
                              JAKE
                    I made a kill today. We ate it.   I know
                    where that meal came from.
          
                                                                     67.
          
          
          
                               GRACE
                    Other body. You need to take care of
                    this body.
          
                                 JAKE
                    Yeah yeah.
          
                              GRACE
                    Jake, I'm serious -- you look like crap.
                    You're burning too hard.
          
          Jake takes the cigarette out of her mouth and stubs it out.
          
                              JAKE
                    Get rid of this shit, then you can
                    lecture me.
          
                              GRACE
                    I'm telling you, as your boss and someone
                    who might even consider being a friend
                    someday, to take some down time.
          
                              JAKE
                    Not now. Tomorrow we leave for Iknimaya.
          
          GRACE walks past Jake, starts making herself coffee.
          
                              GRACE
                    Yeah -- you're gonna go ride a banshee.
                    Or die trying.
          
                              JAKE
                    That's right, Grace. This is what I've
                    been working for.
          
                              GRACE
                    And this is your check up from the neck
                    up, Marine. You're getting in way too
                    deep.
                        (she turns away)
                    Trust me, I learned the hard way.
          
          Jake scans the pictures tacked up around Grace's workstation.
          
                              JAKE
                    What did happen at the school?
          
          GRACE looks up from making coffee.   Her eyes track across the
          pictures of the laughing children.   Finally --
          
                                                                     68.
          
          
          
                              GRACE
                    Neytiri's sister -- Sylwanin -- stopped
                    coming to school. She was angry about
                    the clear-cutting.
          
          GRACE sips her coffee, grimaces at the taste.
          
                              GRACE
                    One day, she and a couple of other young
                    hunters came running in, all painted up --
                    they'd set a bulldozer on fire -- I guess
                    they thought I could protect them.
          
          GRACE'S voice stays oddly CALM as he tells this terrible
          story, while getting MILK out of the refrigerator.
          
                              GRACE
                    The troopers pursued them to the
                    schoolhouse.
          
          MACRO as she pours the milk -- her hand is SHAKING.
          
                              GRACE
                    They killed Sylwanin in the doorway.
                    Right in front of Neytiri. Then shot the
                    others.
                        (MILDLY)
                    I got most of the kids out, before they
                    shot me.
          
                              JAKE
                    Jesus.
          
                              GRACE
                    Yeah.
          
          Jake realizes that Grace is on the verge of tears and
          desperately trying to hide it.
          
                              GRACE
                    A scientist stays objective -- we can not
                    be ruled by emotion. But I poured ten
                    years of my life into that school. They
                    called me sa'atenuk. Mother.
                        (turning to him)
                    That kind of pain reaches back through
                    the link.
          
          GRACE sits down at the table, looks intently at Jake.
          
                              GRACE
                    It's a job. Learn what you can -- but
                    don't get attached.
          
                                                                       69.
          
          
          
          GRACE looks at him with real PAIN in her eyes.
          
                              GRACE
                    It's not our world, Jake.   And we can't
                    stop what's coming.
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          EXT. MOUNTAIN TRAIL - DAY
          
          TSU'TEY leads three direhorse riders up the trail -- two
          TEENAGE HUNTERS and JAKE, who's riding well enough to keep
          up. The horses' hooves CLOP right next to a sheer drop into a
          misty canyon.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    Iknimaya translates roughly as stairway
                    to heaven. It's the test every young
                    hunter has to pass.
          
          TSU'TEY signals a stop.
          
          UP-SLOPE AHEAD is an astounding formation. Thick vine-like
          trees have trapped large FLOATING BOULDERS of UNOBTANIUM in
          their gnarled grip.
          
          A hundred meters above them more boulders are WOVEN into the
          twisted vine-trunks. This is some sort of freak natural
          occurrence -- like the mythical beanstalk, going up into the
          clouds.
          
          There is a THUNDERING ROAR, like an artillery barrage, and
          the ground SHAKES. Jake looks around at --
          
          One of the FLOATING MOUNTAINS grinding against the flank of a
          nearby mesa. A huge rockfall is set loose. The mountain is
          drifting toward them, filling half the sky.
          
          The Hunters dismount.
          
          JAKE looks up at the beanstalk going into the clouds. He
          turns to Tsu'tey, who is checking the young hunters' gear.
          
                              JAKE
                    We doin' this?
          
          Jake leaps to catch up as Tsu'tey and the hunters swarm up
          the base of the beanstalk.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
                                                                       70.
          
          
          
          EXT. BEANSTALK - DAY
          
          200 METERS up the BEANSTALK, the hunters nimbly climb along
          the vine-trunks. They clamber over one of the unobtanium
          BOULDERS which is lifting this incredible tree.
          
          JAKE looks down -- the massive trunk dwindles to the size of
          a licorice stick. A chunk breaks off a boulder as he climbs
          over it -- it floats upward.
          
          They reach the upper branches of the beanstalk. Above them,
          the craggy underbelly of MONS Veritatis looms. Spray from
          one of the waterfalls hits them.
          
          Some of the HANGING VINES are brushing over the upper
          branches of the beanstalk with a crackling hiss.
          
          One by one the hunters grab onto vines as they pass.
          
          Jake shrugs and leaps to a passing vine, his feet dangling
          over nothingness. They climb toward the floating islands
          above.
          
          EXT. MONS VERITATIS - DAY
          
          TINY FIGURES cross a causeway of vines connecting a small
          island of unobtanium to the main mass of Mons Veritatis.
          
          WIDE SHOT looking down a rock face bigger than Half Dome --
          the sheer side of Mons Veritatis.
          
          Banshees circle next to the cliffs, flashing in shafts of
          sunlight. Waterfalls dissolve into nothingness below.
          
          EXT. GROTTO/BANSHEE ROOKERY - DAY
          
          A waterfall THUNDERS down into the void like a faucet of the
          gods. Jake looks down the sheer cliff at the world far below
          -- a view from Olympus.
          
          A SHRIEK and the THWAP THWAP of leathery wings -- NEYTIRI'S
          BANSHEE swoops in to perch at the edge of the grotto. She
          dismounts and, like a falconer, covers its eyes with a woven
          HOOD. It waits, docile, as --
          
          She joins Jake and the hunter party. Tsu'tey leads them
          through the cave until they emerge onto a CLIFF FACE. And
          Jake sees --
          
          The BANSHEE ROOKERY. HUNDREDS of banshees huddle on rock out-
          croppings as far as the eye can see. They cling to the walls
          with the fore-claws on their wings, or perch on ledges.
          
                                                                       71.
          
          
          
                              TSU'TEY
                    Jakesully will go first.
          
          Tsu'tey smirks at Jake, a challenge in his eyes. The two
          teenage Hunters are scared but trying to act tough.
          
          Tsu'tey scowls when Neytiri leads Jake out onto the ledge.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                        (WHISPERING)
                    Now you choose your ikran. This you must
                    feel -- inside. If he also chooses you,
                    move quick, like I showed. You will have
                    one chance.
          
                              JAKE
                    How will I know if he chooses me?
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    He will try to kill you.
          
                              JAKE
                    Outstanding.
          
          Out of sight of Tsu'tey, Neytiri takes his hand and squeezes
          it. Jake feels a rush of emotion, but she breaks away like
          it didn't happen. He is on his own, on the ledge with --
          
          The BANSHEES. They eye him as he approaches. Several SHRIEK
          and take flight. Others flap their wings and yawn, showing
          rows of fangs, in a threat display.
          
          Jake unrolls a weighted leather strap, like a one-ended BOLO.
          
          A LARGE MALE spreads enormous wings, SHRIEKS, and glares
          straight at him.
          
          Jake looks directly into its eyes -- and strides toward it.
          
                              JAKE
                    Let's dance.
          
          The challenged banshee HISSES and leaps at him, jaws wide as--
          
          Jake times the lunge, swinging the bolo, feinting and then
          slipping aside as the banshee's jaws miss him, SNAPPING SHUT.
          
          Jake WHAPS the bolo across its snout. The weighted thong
          whips twice around its long jaws, tying them shut. A MUFFLED
          SCREAM and it SLASHES at his stomach with razor talons but --
          
                                                                      72.
          
          
          
          Jake is already leaping, over the talons and tackling the
          banshee around the neck. It topples on its side, and he
          SWARMS IT -- arms around its thrashing head.
          
          Jake grabs its whip-like antenna and brings it toward his
          queue but --
          
          The bony head SLAMS sideways, and BAM! -- clocks him right in
          the face, almost knocking him out and --
          
          IT WRITHES, flinging him to the ground. He slides on the
          rock and almost goes over the edge as --
          
          NEYTIRI gasps. Tsu'tey laughs and yells mockingly.
          
          The bolo is coming loose as the creature shakes its head, way
          pissed off now, but --
          
          Jake scrambles up and leaps straight at it. Claws rake his
          leg but he gets his arms around its head and CLAMPS DOWN
          HARD. They flop to the ground and he scrambles on top,
          pinning it and --
          
          Grabs its whipping antenna, locks it under his arm, and jams
          the end of his queue into it. They FUSE together and --
          
          The banshee stops struggling. It lies there panting.   They
          are locked together, literally eye to eye.
          
                              JAKE
                    That's right! You're mine.
          
          ECU BANSHEE -- the pupil like a deep black well.
          
          Jake relaxes his grip and slowly, warily, slides his leg over
          the creature's back.
          
          Neytiri runs to him.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    First flight seals the bond. You cannot
                    wait.
          
          Jake sits astride the creature, feeling its power.   He grips
          a hank of the beast's main, and --
          
                              JAKE
                    Heeeyyyaaaah!
          
          THWAP! THWAP! The banshee is off like a shot. Jake SCREAMS
          as they PLUMMET off the cliff -- the banshee WAILS and --
          
                                                                      73.
          
          
          
          They fall together, spiralling out of control, and he is
          almost tossed lose. The thing is SQUAWKING and SHRIEKING so
          much he can't think.
          
                               JAKE
                     Shut the hell up!!
          
          It does.
          
                                  JAKE
                     Level out!     Fly straight!
          
          It levels out. Jake cocks his head, only thinking "bank left"
          and the animal complies. He settles the banshee into an easy
          loping beat of its huge wings, while he catches his breath.
          
          NEYTIRI'S BANSHEE falls into formation with him.   She signals
          "follow me" and DIVES.
          
          Jake guides his banshee clumsily after her. Neytiri's
          banshee moves with precise movements of its wingtips, while
          Jake's wobbles and dips, almost falling out of the sky.
          
          THE CAMERA SWOOPS after them as Neytiri leads an arcing DIVE
          around the flank of Mons Veritatis. The scenery is stunning.
          They pass waterfalls and swoop between hanging vines.
          
          Neytiri leads Jake in a sharp bank, skimming close to the
          cliffs. They punch through streamers of cloud and emerge
          into sunlight.
          
          Jake is getting the hang of it. He jinks left, then right,
          then dives, tucking himself tight against the animal's back.
          He's reckless, fearless. Half in control and LOVING IT.
          
          Neytiri dives next to him as he lets out a long WHOOP of joy.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          INT./EXT. GROTTO/MONS VERITATIS - DAY
          
          FLIGHT MONTAGE:
          
          NEYTIRI squats with Jake, using her hands to explain flight
          principles like one fighter pilot to another.
          
          LOOKING DOWN a sheer cliff. SWOOOSH! Jake and Neytiri dive
          their mounts STRAIGHT DOWN PAST CAMERA, pulling out and
          soaring into a series of aerobatic turns.
          
                               JAKE (V.O.)
                     I may not be much of a horse guy.   But I
                     was born to do this.
          
                                                                      74.
          
          
          
          THEY FLY in close formation with TSU'TEY and the young
          HUNTERS, 5 banshees flashing through scarves of mist.
          
          ANOTHER DAY. Jake dives, playing hide and seek with Neytiri
          among the clouds. They are wild and free in a wild world.
          She grins and banks hard, diving -- catch me if you can. He
          DIVES after her.
          
          IN THE GROTTO, by firelight, JAKE'S BANSHEE snaps at a piece
          of meat which he playfully pulls back. He's teaching it to
          take the food more slowly. He strokes its long head.
          
          TSU'TEY is nearby with the young hunters.   He eyes Jake with
          frustrated hostility.
          
          ANOTHER DAY -- Jake and Neytiri fly abreast, soaring easily.
          She points and Jake sees --
          
          A BIZARRE GEOLOGICAL FORMATION. Arches of magnetic rock form
          rainbows of stone above a deep CALDERA. In the center of the
          caldera is a single, enormous WILLOW TREE, gnarled and
          ancient. This, we will be told, is THE WELL OF SOULS.
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          EXT. RIDGE
          
          JAKE flies with Neytiri along a forested ridge. She is
          teaching him to hunt from his banshee. They carry their bows
          at the ready, scanning below them for prey.
          
          A HUGE SHADOW covers him and Neytiri SHOUTS a warning.   Jake
          looks up to see --
          
          A LEONOPTERYX in a delta-dive, whistling straight at him.
          
          Like a banshee, only several times larger, it is the king
          predator of the air: the GREAT LEONOPTERYX.   Striped
          scarlet, yellow and black, with a midnight blue crested head
          -- it is both gorgeous and terrifying.
          
          The hunter has become the prey. JAKE snap-rolls and dives
          toward the forest canopy. He plummets into the gloom as --
          
          K-CRASH -- the leonopteryx tears through foliage, following
          him down, both diving like missiles and --
          
          JAKE yanks into a hair-pin bank, right through a gap between
          two huge branches --
          
          Forcing the leonopteryx to brake with a loud FWOOSH of wings.
          It banks away with a frustrated SHRIEK. Two flaps of its
          mighty wings and it is gone, back above the canopy.
          
                                                                    75.
          
          
          
          CLOSE ON THE LEONOPTERYX, as its fanged mouth opens in a
          bloodcurdling SCREECH which echoes among the mountains. The
          lord of its domain.
          
          ON JAKE, shaken. Neytiri flies up, her expression the Na'vi
          equivalent of Oh my God. A beat -- they both crack up.
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          INT. SHACK - NIGHT
          
          Jake ponders images Grace has called up at her workstation--
          science graphics of the Leonopteryx. Trudy and Norm are
          crowded around as well.
          
                              GRACE
                    The Great Leonopteryx is the apex aerial
                    predator. Not only rare, but the
                    sightings tend not to get reported.
          
          Trudy makes a clicking motion with her thumb.
          
                              TRUDY
                    There usually isn't time to key the mike.
          
                              JAKE
                    The People call it Toruk.
          
                              NORM
                        (TRANSLATING)
                    Last Shadow.
          
                              JAKE
                    Last one you ever see.
          
                              TRUDY
                    I saw one take out a gunship once --
                    WHAM! Total frickin' yard sale. Ate the
                    crew like peanuts.
          
          TIME CUT -- Grace is scanning through images and Jake stops
          her on one -- a 3D aerial shot of the strange arched
          formation.
          
                                 JAKE
                    That's it.
          
                              GRACE
                    Vitraya Ramunong -- The Well of Souls.
                    It's their most sacred place.
          
          She moves the virtual camera, and we seem to fly around the
          Well of Souls, catching only a glimpse of the interior.
          
                                                                      76.
          
          
          
                              GRACE
                    Something big is going on in there,
                    biologically. I'd die to get samples, but
                    outsiders are strictly forbidden.
          
          TIME CUT -- Jake looks through the pressure window at HUMAN
          GRACE and NORM outside. Wearing masks, they are taking
          readings from some time-series experiments Grace has set up.
          
          As TRUDY watches, JAKE works fast to download Grace's images
          of the Well of Souls onto a memory chip.
          
                              TRUDY
                    They're coming back.
          
          Jake pulls the chip, then hesitates. Torn by what he is
          doing.
          
                              TRUDY
                    If you don't give him something, he's
                    gonna shut us down.
          
          He hands her the chip and she slips it into a pocket of her
          flight-suit just as Grace and Norm enter from the airlock.
          
                                 JAKE
                    Hey, guys.
                                                                    CUT TO:
          
          INT. HOMETREE - NIGHT
          
          JAKE STARES up at the TOTEM SKULL, which we now recognize as
          that of a GREAT LEONOPTERYX. NEYTIRI watches as he reaches
          up to touch the tall indigo crest.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    My grandfather's grandfather was Toruk
                    Macto -- Rider of Last Shadow. Toruk
                    chose him. It has only happened five
                    times since the time of the First Songs.
          
                              JAKE
                    That's a long time.
          
          Neytiri takes his hand, because that's what the Na'vi do when
          they're telling you something important.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    Toruk Macto was mighty -- he brought the
                    clans together in a time of great sorrow.
                    All Na'vi people know this story.
          
                                                                       77.
          
          
          
          PUSH IN SLOWLY on the skull totem, then --
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          EXT. RIVER BED - DAY
          
          JAKE, NEYTIRI and other FLYING HUNTERS swoop low above a HERD
          OF STURMBEEST -- a rapids of thundering muscle. Dust rises
          from this living river like steam from a python's back.
          
          TRACKING WITH the herd. A HUNTER appears in FG, astride a
          direhorse at full gallop. The sight is breathtaking. He
          hurls a 3 meter spear and one of the sturmbeest CRASHES down,
          flipping twice from momentum.
          
          JAKE ROLLS IN like a fighter jet, his banshee screaming. He
          draws and fires his bow. The arrow strikes true, in the
          plexus between the armored shoulders and --
          
          THE BEAST crashes to the ground. Skids to a stop in a cloud
          of dust.
          
          NEYTIRI swoops in next to Jake, arms raised and grinning
          wolfishly.
          
          CU TSU'TEY, banking around Jake's kill.   Jake looks up, and
          Tsu'tey SALUTES in grudging admiration.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          INT. COMMONS/HOMETREE - NIGHT
          
          The central space is lit by a BONFIRE, around which the HUNT
          FESTIVAL is in full swing. Wild dancing. People gnawing on
          massive sturmbeest ribs. A bowl of some kava-like intoxicant
          is passed around.
          
          NEYTIRI dances in a flowing costume as the BANSHEE SPIRIT.
          NORM is dancing seductively with his own tail.
          
          JAKE, surrounded by young hunters, acts out the leonopteryx
          attack with his hands. The leaping fire-light plays across
          the eye sockets of the TORUK SKULL, bringing it to life. It
          seems to watch Jake.
          
          TSU'TEY squats next to Jake, the usual scowl on his face.
          
          Jake braces himself -- and Tsu'tey holds up the KAVA BOWL,
          offering it to him. A challenge or an olive branch?
          
          Jake takes a long, hearty drink as some of the young hunters
          hoot and clap hands in a fast rhythm.
          
                                                                       78.
          
          
          
                               GRACE
                    Watch that stuff.   It'll knock you into
                    next week.
          
          Jake offers the bowl back to Tsu'tey.   They lock eyes.
          Tsu'tey drinks.
          
          LATER -- AN EMPTY BOWL drops, landing on a pile of empty
          bowls near the fire.
          
          WIDER ON JAKE and TSU'TEY, sitting amid the rowdy hunters.
          Tsu'tey looks a little blearily at Jake. Finally, he GRINS.
          
                              TSU'TEY
                    I thought -- enough drink -- you would
                    not be so ugly.
          
                              JAKE
                    Sorry.
          
          Tsu'tey looks deep into the fire.
          
                              TSU'TEY
                    Your warriors -- hide inside machines --
                    fight from far away.
                        (he looks at Jake)
                    I did not think a sky person could be
                    brave.
          
          Before Jake can answer, NEYTIRI'S lithe shape runs through
          the circle of silhouetted dancers toward them. She takes
          Jake by the hand and pulls him up --
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    You must dance! It is the way.
          
          TSU'TEY watches as she leads him away, his face darkening --
          the moment of connection to Jake lost to anger.
          
          The hunters WHOOP and CHEER as Jake joins the circle of
          dancers.
          
          Jake takes Grace's hand and pulls her up, protesting.
          
          JAKE lets the DRUMS and CHANTING flow through him. He lets
          himself go, dancing from the inside, channeling the primal
          energy.
          
          GRACE is rocking out, grinning. We see the young girl, so
          repressed, who lives within her.
          
          Jake and Neytiri flow amongst the dancers, but they are
          looking only at each other.
          
                                                                     79.
          
          
          
          A couple of the young girls watching from outside the circle
          are giggling and talking about them. Mo'at and EYTUKAN
          follow their look, seeing the obvious connection.
          
                              MO'AT
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    We cannot let this seed grow. Her path is
                    with Tsu'tey.
          
          ON JAKE, dancing with abandon to the primal beat, eyes locked
          with Neytiri.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST - DAY
          
          WIDE VISTA -- mist blowing through the treetops as the
          morning sun burns it away. A spectacular panorama of a vast,
          primeval land.
          
          UP ANGLE TRACKING among the trees, the sunlight shafting down
          like light in a cathedral.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    It's hard to put in words the deep
                    connection the People have to the forest.
          
          HIGH IN THE BRANCHES of a tree, Jake watches as Neytiri
          gently bends a large pitcher-like flower toward her, sipping
          nectar which is sweet and thick as honey. An incredibly
          sensuous image.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    They see a network of energy that flows
                    through all living things. They know that
                    all energy is only borrowed--
          
          MACRO SHOT of a purple flower, beaded with raindrops.   A blue
          hand picks the flower.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    -- and one day you have to give it back.
          
          LOOKING DOWN into a hole dug among tree roots. The body of
          an old Omaticaya WOMAN lies curled there like an unborn baby
          in the womb of the earth. The purple flower is gently placed
          on her body, joining flowers, totems and beads.
          
          Mo'at recites a prayer as Neytiri, acting as acolyte, places
          a WOODSPRITE, a seed of the Great Tree, on the body.
          
          Earth is poured over the LENS and we CUT TO --
          
                                                                       80.
          
          
          
          JAKE WAKING UP in the Link. DARK as a coffin. He pushes the
          lid off, letting in light, and lies there. He looks pale and
          haggard, with a scraggly beard.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    Hard to believe it's only been three
                    months.
          
          JAKE SITS in front of the video log camera, late at night. It
          is many log entries later. He has lost a lot of weight. He
          looks like a junkie watching a test pattern.
          
                              JAKE
                        (to the lens)
                    I can barely remember my old life. I'm
                    not sure who I am anymore.
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          EXT. COMPOUND - DAY
          
          Under a sky of thunderheads, the forest is a dark wall beyond
          the fence. SELFRIDGE, wearing an exopack, TEES UP while GRACE
          and JAKE approach from the direction of the Ops Center.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    Good of you to stop by. How's it going
                    out there? Our blue friends all packed
                    up yet?
          
          Selfridge swings his DRIVER with good form.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    See, I keep hooking it.   It's the damn
                    pack.
          
          THE BALL drops into the mud just past a marker which reads
          220. A TROOPER walks over to retrieve it.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    The low gravity and the high air density
                    cancel out so --
          
                              JAKE
                    You called us back to report -- you want
                    to hear it or not?
          
                                SELFRIDGE
                    Go ahead.
          
                              GRACE
                    Jake is making incredible progress, years
                    worth in just a few months. But -- we
                    need more time.
          
                                                                    81.
          
          
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    Not what I was hoping to hear.
          
          It starts to rain. Selfridge calmly pulls an umbrella from
          his golf bag and snaps it open.
          
                              GRACE
                    Parker, it's their ancestral home.
                    They've lived there since before human
                    history began. You can spare them a few
                    more weeks.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    This thing is inevitable. What does it
                    matter when it happens? I'm sorry, Dr.
                    Augustine. You're out of time.
          
          He leaves them standing there to get drenched.
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          INT. ARMOR BAY
          
          A break table, under a harsh overhead light. Quaritch pulls
          up a chair, turns it around, and sits astride it facing Jake.
          He studies Jake's pale, sunken face. The scraggly beard.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    You're not gettin' lost in the woods, are
                    you son?
          
          Jake can't meet his eyes.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Your last report was two weeks ago. I'm
                    starting to doubt your resolve. From what
                    I see, it's time to terminate this
                    mission.
          
          Jake eyes flare with alarm.
          
                                JAKE
                    No.    I can do this.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Look, you've given me plenty of usable
                    intel. Like this "Well of Souls" place --
                    I've got them by the balls with that,
                    when it turns into a shit-fight. Which it
                    will.
          
          Jake feels hollow inside, knowing what he's done.
          
                                                                      82.
          
          
          
                              QUARITCH
                    So you'll get your legs back, like I
                    promised.
                        (puts his hand on Jake's
                         SHOULDER)
                    It's time to come in.
          
          Jake ponders this. Isn't this what he was doing all this for?
          
                              JAKE
                    I've gotta finish this thing. There's
                    one more test -- the Dream Hunt. It's the
                    final stage of becoming a man. Then I'm
                    one of them. They'll trust what I say...
          
          It's hard for him to even form these words --
          
                              JAKE
                    ... and I can negotiate the terms of
                    their relocation.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Then you need to get it done, Corporal.
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          EXT. HALLELUJAH MOUNTAINS - NIGHT
          
          Strange horizontal LIGHTNING branches through the floating
          mountains, twisted by the magnetic fields. The sky is black
          and heavy with clouds.
          
          INT. SHACK KITCHEN - NIGHT
          
          Jake is gulping black coffee like a tequila shot, looking
          pretty STRUNG OUT. GRACE is smoking furiously.
          
                              GRACE
                    Jake, I can't allow this.   You're just
                    not strong enough.
          
                              JAKE
                    It's the last door -- I'm going through
                    it. You can help me or get out of the
                    way.
          
          Jake pushes past her toward the corridor --
          
                              GRACE
                        (grabbing him)
                    Will you listen to me? Sometimes the
                    Na'vi themselves die in these vision
                    quests. The venom takes you to the edge
                    of death.
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                        83.
          
                              GRACE (cont'd)
                    And the psychoactive alkaloid in the worm-
                    - we have no idea what that'll do in an
                    avatar brain.
          
          Jake breaks free and wheels away, down the corridor.
          
          GRACE follows JAKE as he crosses to the Link. A sheet of
          LIGHTNING flashes across the sky outside.
          
          Norm is initializing the Link.
          
                              NORM
                    Calibrating. Thirty seconds.
          
          She puts her hands on his shoulders.
          
                              GRACE
                    No matter what you prove out there-- you
                    are still in here.
                        (shaking him)
                    Right here.
          
                              JAKE
                    I have to go all the way -- become one of
                    THEM--
          
                              GRACE
                        (FURIOUSLY)
                    Goddammit, Jake, you can never be one of
                    them!
          
          Norm looks up, startled at the VEHEMENCE in GRACE' voice.
          
                              GRACE
                    Our life out there takes millions of
                    dollars of machinery to sustain. You
                    visit -- and you leave.
          
          During this, Jake pulls himself from his wheelchair, levering
          himself into the Link, hauling his useless legs inside.
          
                              GRACE
                        (SOFTENING)
                    You can never truly be with her.
          
          Jake stops, pinioned by the truth.   He seems suddenly very
          lost.
          
                              JAKE
                    You know why I'm here? Because Quaritch
                    sent me.
          
                              NORM
                    What?
          
                                                                      84.
          
          
          
                              JAKE
                    That's right -- to embed with the
                    Omaticaya. To find out how to screw them
                    out of their home. By deceit or by
                    force, he didn't care. And if it turned
                    out to be force, then how best to do it.
          
          Norm is in shock.   But Grace is eerily calm.
          
                              GRACE
                    And what about now, Jake?
          
                              JAKE
                    I'm not that guy any more.
          
          Grace nods.   She's been on his journey every step of the way.
          
                               GRACE
                    I know.
          
                              JAKE
                    But if I tell Quaritch the truth, he
                    yanks me out -- I never see her again.
                    And if I tell her the truth, the clan
                    throws me out -- that's if they don't cut
                    my heart out and show it to me.
          
          Jake looks hopelessly at the two of them.   In his own perfect
          Hell.
          
                              NORM
                    They won't understand what you've done.
          
                              JAKE
                    They don't even have a word for "lie" --
                    they had to learn it from us.
          
          Grace sees he is on the verge of tears.   Lost and alone,
          between worlds.
          
                              GRACE
                    I know. I taught it to them.
          
                              JAKE
                        (PLEADING)
                    Grace. I've gotta go.   They're waiting.
          
                              NORM
                    Link is ready.
          
          Grace stops him as he tries to close the lid.
          
                                                                      85.
          
          
          
                             GRACE
                    Jake. You can't carry this burden much
                    longer.
          
                              JAKE
                        (smiling wanly)
                    It's okay. Mo'at says an alien mind
                    probably can't survive the Dream Hunt
                    anyway.
          
          Grace closes the lid. It feels like closing a coffin. She
          watches his psionic patterns aligning to his avatar,
          somewhere out in the night.
          
                              GRACE
                        (to Norm)
                    Prep my link. I'm going in.
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          INT. COMMONS/HOMETREE - NIGHT
          
          JAKE SITS, eyes closed, as Neytiri and another young hunter
          paint his face and body in preparation for uniltaron -- the
          Dream Hunt.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    When your Spirit Animal comes, you will
                    know.
          
          Their eyes meet with emotion neither can conceal any longer.
          
          TIME CUT. GRACE stands with the crowd at the ramp to
          HOMETREE'S LOWEST LEVEL. Jake barely sees her as he goes down
          the spiral. She tries to follow, but is barred by a hunter.
          
          BELOW, seemingly in the womb of the earth, Jake walks slowly
          into the center of a tight circle of seated elders and
          hunters. An ELDER is slowly rapping a large WATER DRUM.
          
          TIME CUT -- MO'AT purifies him with smoke from burning herbs,
          CHANTING in a low monotone. Jake, squatting, washes the
          smoke over himself with his palms.
          
          MACRO - MO'AT'S FINGERS unwrap a piece of wood riddled with
          holes. She catches the end of a glowing purple WORM, and
          draws it out of the wood.
          
                              MO'AT
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    Oh wise worm, eater of the Sacred Tree --
                    bless this worthy Hunter with a true
                    vision.
          
                                                                       86.
          
          
          
          MO'AT places the worm on Jake's out-stretched TONGUE. It
          twists on itself, lighting his mouth before he closes it. She
          indicates he should chew. He does.
          
          MACRO -- AN EARTHEN JAR is opened. EYTUKAN removes a
          writhing black ARACHNOID, the Pandoran equivalent of a
          scorpion.
          
          He places it against the back of Jake's neck and presses. The
          insect drives its stinger into Jake's skin and --
          
          Jake grimaces. Mo'at and Eytukan step back, leaving Jake
          alone in the circle.
          
          Neytiri watches intently, joining in the low chant.
          
          SLOW DOLLY IN on Jake. His eyes OPEN. He looks around at the
          faces -- they seem to TRANSFORM, becoming threatening.
          
          Jake looks down at the palms of his hands.
          
          JAKE'S POV -- his hands recede, his whole body, the ground
          and --
          
          INSTANTLY the circle of Na'vi recedes, as if to a distant
          horizon, leaving vast ground in between. SPACE is utterly
          distorted, and SOUND as well -- echoing, THUNDEROUS.
          
          ECU JAKE -- pupils DILATED black. He looks around and --
          
          The onlookers are gone, replaced by a ring of glowing trees,
          which seem miles high. The whole image is bathed in spectral
          radiance. Jake looks down --
          
          JAKE'S POV -- his body and hands transforming -- fingers
          stretching into tendrils, legs becoming roots which spread
          outward across the ground, a thousand glowing dendrites which
          connect to the roots of the trees and --
          
          CUT TO REALITY -- Jake is on his hands and knees, PUKING in
          the dirt. He contorts, crying out in agony as the venom
          contracts his muscles but --
          
          IN HIS VISION Jake stands serene on a FLOATING MOUNTAIN
          CLIFF. A GREAT BLACK SHADOW covers him, the unmistakable X
          silhouette of a diving LEONOPTERYX. The LAST SHADOW.
          
          CAMERA SCREAMS down on him as the shadow grows larger -- WE
          RUSH into his face, into the blackness of his pupil which
          FILLS THE UNIVERSE and --
          
                                                                       87.
          
          
          
          REAL JAKE writhes in the dirt, his back arched as his muscles
          seize. He foams and thrashes, his eyes rolled back in his
          head, while inside --
          
          TIME ITSELF HAS ACCELERATED -- clouds scream around the
          mountain tops, mist boils through the forest. He feels the
          wind of time blowing through him as --
          
          REAL JAKE claws the ground, moaning, staring blindly while --
          
          INSIDE, IN POV he FLIES over the landscape of Pandora --
          
          --but the forest is BLASTED. Fires flicker among trees that
          are BURNED black and lifeless in a smoky twilight.
          
          A great WINGED SHADOW is cast below, rippling over the
          devastated ground. AVATAR JAKE looks down at the shadow.
          Realizes HE is casting it, and we RUSH IN to his PUPIL and --
          
          PULL BACK from the eye of a GREAT LEONOPTERYX, flying lordly
          and terrible over the land. It lets out an almighty SHRIEK
          which seems to echo to eternity and --
          
          SLAM CUT to Jake, on his back, GASPING -- back in his body.
          He weakly rolls up to one elbow and looks around the room.
          
                              MO'AT
                    It is finished.
          
          Neytiri's face is flooded with relief.   The faces of the clan
          elders look at Jake expectantly.
          
                              EYTUKAN
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    Did your Spirit Animal come?
          
          Jake looks from Eytukan to Mo'at, Tsu'tey and the elders. How
          can he tell them what he has seen?
          
          Mo'at puts her splayed fingers against his face, seeming to
          peer into his troubled soul.
          
                              MO'AT
                        (to Jake)
                    Something has come.
                        (to the others, subtitled)
                    It will take time for the meaning to be
                    clear.
          
          She steps back, and Eytukan motions for Jake to stand. He
          gets up, weakly.
          
                                                                       88.
          
          
          
          OUTSIDE THE ENCLOSURE -- Eytukan emerges with Jake and the
          others. The entire clan is gathered, waiting to hear what
          has happened. Jake looks up at the Leonopteryx Skull Totem,
          which seems to stare down at him.
          
          GRACE watches, her eyes brimming. Proud. Relieved. Amazed.
          
          Eytukan places both hands on Jake's chest and holds them
          there.
          
                              EYTUKAN
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    You are now a son of the Omaticaya.   You
                    are part of the People.
          
          All the members of the clan press forward, crowding around
          and putting their hands on Jake's shoulders, back, chest --
          hands upon hands, until he is connected to everyone.
                                                             DISSOLVE TO:
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST - NIGHT
          
          JAKE and NEYTIRI run silhouetted in the night. Behind them
          waterfalls cascade down in the silvery light. POLYPHEMUS
          RISES behind the trees.
          
          NEYTIRI DIVES from a rock, slicing into a mirror of water.
          Jake follows her and --
          
          UNDERWATER, they swim over glowing ANEMONES.
          
          They seem to float in a cosmic dance above a luminous garden
          of waving shapes. Tiny purple fish swirl around them.
          
          Their hands come together, fingers twining, as they float
          weightlessly, as if between worlds.
                                                             DISSOLVE TO:
          
          EXT. WILLOW GLADE
          
          Laughing, they run together into a stand of WILLOWS. Their
          trunks are as gnarled as bonsai. Long faintly glowing
          tendrils hang straight down in pastel curtains.
          
          Underfoot, a bed of moss glows faintly. It REACTS to their
          footsteps with expanding rings of light.
          
          It is an exquisitely beautiful spot.
          
          The willows stir, responding to their presence. She holds up
          her hands, letting the TENDRILS caress her.
          
                                                                       89.
          
          
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    This is a place for prayers to be heard.
                    And sometimes answered.
          
          Jake puts out his hands and the tendrils play over his
          fingers, his palms, his forearms. His eyes go wide. We hear
          the WHISPERING of ancient Na'vi VOICES.
          
                              JAKE
                    It's like -- a sound you feel.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    We call this utraya mokri -- the Tree of
                    Voices. The voices of our ancestors, who
                    live within Eywa.
          
          A few WOODSPRITES circle around them, some alighting on their
          shoulders and arms.
          
          They stand, very close together now. Her eyes are intense,
          almost luminous. He feels drawn into them.
          
          But she pulls back a little.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    You are Omaticaya now. You may make your
                    own bow from the wood of Hometree.
                        (she looks away)
                    And you may choose a woman.
          
          The Amazon warrior trying so hard to sound casual.   Jake
          suppresses a smile.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    We have many fine women. Ninat is the
                    best singer --
          
                              JAKE
                    I don't want Ninat.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    There is Beyral -- she is a good hunter --
          
          Jake puts his fingers on her lips to stop her.
          
                              JAKE
                    I've already chosen. But this woman must
                    also choose me.
          
          She takes his hands and their fingers intertwine, moving
          gently over each other.
          
                                                                       90.
          
          
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    She already has.
          
          He puts his face close to hers. She rubs her cheek against
          his. He kisses her on the mouth. They explore each other.
          
          Then she pulls back, eyes sparkling.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    Kissing is very good. But we have
                    something better.
          
          She pulls him down until they are kneeling, facing each other
          on the faintly glowing moss.
          
          Neytiri takes the end of her queue and raises it. Jake does
          the same, with trembling anticipation. The tendrils at the
          ends move with a life of their own, straining to be joined.
          
          MACRO SHOT -- The tendrils INTERTWINE with gentle
          undulations.
          
          JAKE rocks with the direct contact between his nervous system
          and hers. The ultimate intimacy.
          
          They come together into a kiss and sink down on the bed of
          moss, and ripples of light spread out around them.
          
          THE WILLOWS sway, without wind, and the night is alive with
          pulsing energy as we DISSOLVE TO --
          
          LATER. She is collapsed across his chest.     Spent.   He
          strokes her face tenderly.
          
                              JAKE
                    Neytiri, you know my real body is far
                    away, sleeping.
          
          She raises up, placing her fingertips to his chest --
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    This body is real.
                        (she touches his forehead)
                    This spirit is real.
          
          Her eyes are luminous, honest, infinitely deep.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    When I was first your teacher, I hated
                    all Sky People. But you have also taught
                    me.
                        (WHISPERING)
                    Spirit is all that matters.
          
                                                                       91.
          
          
          
          She lays her head down, against his chest, listening to his
          heartbeat.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    I am with you now, Jake. We are mated for
                    life.
          
                                 JAKE
                    We are?
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    Yes. It is our way.
                        (INNOCENTLY)
                    Oh. I forgot to tell?
          
          He rouses up, making her look at him.
          
                              JAKE
                    Really, we are?
          
                                 NEYTIRI
                    We are.
          
          Jake considers this.
          
                              JAKE
                    It's cool. I'm there.
          
          He lays his head down, and her arms enfold him, sheltering
          him as he sleeps.
          
          INT. SHACK - NIGHT
          
          Jake's eyes open in the darkness. He just lies there,
          thinking. In his coffin. In another world.
                                                                  CUT TO:

          DAWN BREAKS in the sacred glade. Shafts of orange morning
          light. Jake and Neytiri asleep in each others' arms. Maxfield
          Parrish painting. But then --
          
          THE ROAR OF ENGINES. Neytiri awakens with a start. The
          SPLINTERING, CRACKLING of forest being crushed under enormous
          treads gets louder.
          
          SHE WATCHES in growing horror as the BLADE of a bulldozer
          becomes a dark wall behind the sheltering ring of willows.
          She shakes Jake, shouting at him in Na'vi to wake up.
          
                                                                       92.
          
          
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    Jake! Wake up! Where ever you are, come
                    back to me now. Jake!
          
          INT. SHACK - DAWN
          
          HUMAN JAKE is in a hurry to get back to the link. GRACE,
          still groggy, chases him with coffee and microwaved eggs.
          
                              GRACE
                    Here -- eat this. I'd hate to have to
                    force-feed a cripple.
          
          She slams the lid shut before he can enter and sticks the
          plate under his nose.
          
                              GRACE
                        (GRINNING)
                    She's not going anywhere.
          
          He sighs heavily and starts wolfing the eggs.
          
          EXT. WILLOW GLADE - DAWN
          
          Neytiri SCREAMS as --
          
          The willows begin to fall before the blade, to be ground
          under the treads. AVATAR JAKE is directly in the path. She
          tries to lift him, but he is too heavy. She is screaming at
          him, frantically trying to wake him, as --
          
          INT. SHACK - DAWN
          
          Jake adjusts himself in the link chair. He hands Grace the
          empty plate.
          
                              GRACE
                    And when was the last time you took a
                    shower? Jesus, Marine.
          
          Jake pushes her hands away and pulls the lid down.
          
          EXT. WILLOW GLADE
          
          AVATAR JAKE wakes up to see --
          
          NEYTIRI dragging him, screaming.   He leaps up as --
          
          THE DOZER pushes inexorably into the glade, splintering the
          trees, plowing the earth before it.
          
          JAKE RUNS into the path of the bulldozer, waving his arms.
          
                                                                       93.

                    Hey!    Heeeey! Stop! Stop!
          
          He positions himself where the camera-eyes of the robotic
          juggernaut will see him.
          
          INT. OPS CENTER - DAY
          
          CLOSE ON MONITOR -- Jake shouts but there's no sound feed.
          
          WIDER as the TRACTOR OPERATOR sees him and pulls back on the
          remote throttles. He yells to his SUPERVISOR.
          
                              OPERATOR
                    Hey, I got one of the natives blockin' my
                    blade here.
          
          This attracts the attention of Selfridge, who comes over to
          the workstation.
          
          ON THE SCREEN -- Jake, in his Omaticaya loincloth and
          ceremonial body paint, is unrecognizable.
          
                              SUPERVISOR
                        (to Selfridge)
                    What do we do?
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    Roll on. He'll move. These people have
                    to learn that we don't stop.
          
          TIGHT ON THROTTLES as the operator pushes them forward.
          
          ON THE SCREEN Jake stumbles back, tripping, disappears below
          the blade for a second -- reappears, running to the side.
          
          EXT. WILLOW GLADE
          
          JAKE grabs a rock and LEAPS onto the dozer.   He climbs
          quickly to the CAMERA MAST.
          
          SMASH! The rock crashes into the lens of the camera. Jake
          beats the rock furiously against it, pounding it to junk.

          THE JUGGERNAUT grinds to a stop. But the ROAR of engines
          continues because --
          
          MORE DOZERS and TRACTORS advance nearby, crushing the forest
          before them. Trees are slashed down by the PLASMA CUTTERS.
          Terrified animals flee before the onslaught.
          
          POWERSUITS and TROOPERS stride through the ravaged forest,
          blasting anything that moves. A trooper sees Jake on the
          dozer. He rips off a BURST and --
          
          Rounds CLANG into metal as Jake dives off the machine. He
          grabs Neytiri and they run into concealing foliage. From
          behind a screen of leaves, they watch as --
          
          THE DOZERS advance, obliterating the sacred site, leaving
          only mud and wood splinters in their path.

          JAKE and NEYTIRI cross the commons toward them. Jake feels
          all eyes turn toward him. He takes her arm, stopping her.

          fury.
          
                               TSU'TEY
                    You!
          
          Tsu'tey walks right up and SLAMS Jake in the chest with both
          hands. It is so unexpected, that Jake topples on his ass.
          
                              TSU'TEY
                    You mated with this woman?!
          
                               GRACE
                    Oh shit.
          
          Jake stands. He reaches out for Neytiri.   She goes to him,
          clutching his hand.
          
                              MO'AT
                    Is this true?
          
                              NEYTIRI
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    We are mated before Eywa. It is done.
          
          Tsu'tey turns to Mo'at and Eytukan, his face anguished.
          
                                                                       96.
          
          
          
                              TSU'TEY
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    Neytiri was promised to me! Everything is
                    changing. Everything is being destroyed!
          
          Tsu'tey points at Jake, his pain shifting to rage.
          
                              TSU'TEY
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    These aliens kill everything they touch,
                    like poison.
          
                              MO'AT
                    Neytiri! If you choose this path, you can
                    never be Tsahik. Your life will be
                    wasted.
          
          Neytiri looks at her mother -- sees the grief in her eyes.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    I have chosen.
          
          Tsu'tey draws his knife and --
          
                                 TSU'TEY
                    Yeeeeeaaa!
          
          LUNGES AT JAKE, who's ready this time -- he sidesteps,
          blocking the knife, and elbows Tsu'tey HARD in the face.
          
          Tsu'tey reels back, nose bleeding. He starts forward on a
          second attack but --
          
          Eytukan grabs his arm and spins him around.
          
                              EYTUKAN
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    Stop! This is not a proper challenge.
          
          Tsu'tey glares at Jake while sheathing his knife.
          
                              TSU'TEY
                    I challenge you.
          
                              GRACE
                    Jake, don't --
          
                                 JAKE
                    I accept.
                                                                 CUT TO:

          INT./EXT. SAMSON - DAY
          
          QUARITCH rides left seat as Trudy pilots through the
          mountains. She glances at him, then toggles the aircom.
          
                                 TRUDY
                       Loveshack this is Samson One Six inbound
                       hot to your pos. I have Colonel Quaritch
                       with me and --
          
          But Quaritch SLAMS the switch, cutting her off.
          
                                 QUARITCH
                       Did I tell you to announce us?
          
                                 TRUDY
                       Sorry sir, it's procedure.
          
          INT. SHACK
          
          Norm punches buttons on the comms console.
          
                                 NORM
                       Samson One Six?   Trudy?
                           (no answer)
                       Crap.
          
          He looks helplessly at Jake and Grace's link units -- no way
          to warn them.
          
          INT. HOMETREE - DAY
          
          TSU'TEY AND JAKE square off. Each holds a long, solid staff.
          The entire clan crowds around them in a circle.
          
                                 GRACE
                       What the hell are you doing?
          
                                 JAKE
                       It's the only way to get him to goddamn
                       listen.
          
          TSU'TEY LEAPS at Jake with a sharp cry and Jake parries with
          his staff. The staves CLACK off each other as the two
          combatants LEAP, DUCK and STRIKE furiously.
          
          Tsu'tey sweeps Jake off his feet with a roundhouse hit to the
          ankles, but --
          
          Jake ROLLS out of it and catches Tsu'tey in the belly with
          the blunt end.
          
                                                                            98.
          
          
          
          EXT. SITE 26 - DAY
          
          TRUDY'S SAMSON lands. QUARITCH and a posse of troopers jump
          down and rush the Shack.
          
          INT. COMMONS
          
          TSU'TEY wades in with a series of short, sharp blows. Jake
          swings with equal fury. Both fighting from the heart.
          
          The staves whistle through the air, and CLACK together like
          gunshots. Jake presses hard, and Tsu'tey staggers back,
          stumbling as --
          
          Jake lands a SOLID HIT, dropping him to his knees, just as --
          
          INT. SHACK
          
          THE INNER DOOR bangs open and QUARITCH stomps toward Grace's
          Link controls.
          
                                 NORM
                       Hey, hang on, you can't interrupt a link
                       in progress, it's dangerous -- wait!
          
          Quaritch shoves him aside and SMACKS his fist down on the
          POWER switch. Grace's unit goes dead and --
          
          INT. COMMONS
          
          AVATAR GRACE'S eyes roll back and she keels over.       NEYTIRI
          barely catches her before she hits the ground.
          
          JAKE parries as Tsu'tey swings but then --
          
          Jake's eyes go blank just as -- K-RACK! Tsu'tey puts one
          alongside his head. Jake sprawls, completely inert. Tsu'tey
          pokes him with his staff, then raises it and lets out a
          piercing VICTORY CRY.
          
          INT. SHACK - DAY
          
          JAKE SLAMS OPEN the Link, amped from the fight, furious --
          
                                 JAKE
                       Are you out of your goddamn mind?!
          
                                 QUARITCH
                       You crossed a line.
          
          Quaritch PUNCHES HIM HARD. Jake flops back, dazed. The
          troopers yank him out and ZIP-TIE his wrists.
          
                                                                       99.
          
          
          
          INT. COMMONS
          
          TSU'TEY draws his KNIFE, and bends down, grabbing Jake by the
          hair.
          
                              TSU'TEY
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    This is a demon in a false body. It
                    should not live.
          
          He puts his knife to Jake's throat but --
          
          NEYTIRI BLIND-SIDES him at full tilt. Tsu'tey sprawls, rolls,
          comes up to see --
          
          Neytiri crouched like a lioness over Jake, her KNIFE and
          teeth bared, her ears flattened. She SNARLS with primal
          fury.
          
          Tsu'tey stands panting. He pushes through the crowd and walks
          away, calling for his hunters.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          INT. OPS CENTER - DUSK
          
          TIGHT ON MONITOR -- showing JAKE'S AVATAR FACE on the dozer
          camera, as he pounds a rock into the lens. The shot FREEZES
          on Jake's ANIMAL SNARL.
          
          WIDER -- HUMAN JAKE sits, bruised and bleeding, watching
          himself on the monitor. GRACE and NORM stand nearby, rubbing
          their wrists where the zip-ties bit in. SELFRIDGE and
          QUARITCH watch with disdain.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    You let me down, son. You got a little
                    local pussy and completely forgot what
                    team you play for.
          
          Jake meets his gaze with a defiant glare.
          
                              GRACE
                    Parker, listen, there may still be time
                    to --
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Shut your fucking hole!
          
          Grace is momentarily stunned by Quaritch's fury. But she
          meets it with her own intensity, not backing down an inch.
          
                                                                   100.

                    Or what, Ranger Rick? You gonna shoot
                    me?
                        (to Selfridge)
                    You need to muzzle your dog!
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    Can we just take this down a couple
                    notches, please.
          
                              JAKE
                        (to Quaritch)
                    You say you want to keep your people
                    alive. Start by listening to her.
          
          Jake nods to Grace to continue.
          
                              GRACE
                        (to Selfridge)
                    This is bad, Parker. Those trees were
                    sacred to the Omaticaya in a way you
                    can't imagine.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    You know what? You throw a stick in the
                    air around here it falls on some sacred
                    fern.
          
                              GRACE
                    I'm not talking about pagan voodoo here --
                    I'm talking about something real and
                    measurable in the biology of the forest.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                        (FRUSTRATED)
                    Which is what exactly?
          
          Grace's nerve fails. A rush of conflicting emotions -- the
          need to act, to do something, colliding with her scientific
          rigor.
          
                              GRACE
                        (to Jake)
                    I can't do this. How am I supposed to
                    reduce years of work to a sound bite for
                    the illiterate?
          
                              JAKE
                    Just tell him what you know in your
                    heart.
          
          She turns to Parker, steeling herself.
          
                                                                   101.
          
          
          
                              GRACE
                    Alright, look -- I don't have the answers
                    yet, I'm just now starting to even frame
                    the questions. What we think we know --
                    is that there's some kind of
                    electrochemical communication between the
                    roots of the trees. Like the synapses
                    between neurons. Each tree has ten to the
                    fourth connections to the trees around
                    it, and there are ten to the twelfth
                    trees on Pandora --
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    That's a lot I'm guessing.
          
                               GRACE
                    That's more connections than the human
                    brain. You get it? It's a network -- a
                    global network. And the Na'vi can access
                    it -- they can upload and download data --
                    memories -- at sites like the one you
                    destroyed.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    What the hell have you people been
                    smoking out there? They're just.
                    Goddamn. Trees.
          
                              GRACE
                    You need to wake up, Parker. The wealth
                    of this world isn't in the ground -- it's
                    all around us. The Na'vi know that, and
                    they're fighting to defend it. If you
                    want to share this world with them, you
                    need to understand them.
          
                               QUARITCH
                    We understand them just fine.   Thanks to
                    Jake here.
          
          Jake shares a look of alarm with Grace as Quaritch selects a
          NEW CLIP on the main monitor --
          
          TIGHT ON MONITOR -- VIDEO-LOG IMAGE of Jake, looking haggard
          and borderline deranged, rambling in a late-night monologue.
          
                              JAKE (RECORDED)
                    They're not going to give up their home --
                    they're not gonna make a deal. For what?
                    Lite beer and shopping channel? There's
                    nothing we have that they want. We're a
                    horror to them. We're the monsters from
                    space.
          
                                                                   102.
          
          
          
          JAKE watches with a growing dread as his words condemn the
          people he has grown to love.
          
                              JAKE (RECORDED)
                    They're never going to leave Hometree.
          
          Quaritch FREEZES the recording.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Since a deal can't be made -- it gets
                    real simple.
                        (to Jake, icily)
                    So thanks. I'm getting all emotional.    I
                    might just give you a big wet kiss.
          
                              GRACE
                    Parker, we have to talk, like rational
                    people.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    Well, I'd cherish that, but unfortunately
                    you're out of here on the next shuttle.
                    All of you. I'm shutting down the Avatar
                    Program, effective now.
          
          ON JAKE, GRACE AND NORM, speechless.
                                                       SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
          
          A WALL OF FIRE. Silhouettes of direhorse riders cross in SLOW
          MOTION, spears and bows held high.
          
          INT. OPS CENTER - MORNING
          
          MONITOR SCREEN IMAGE -- WAINFLEET pans a camera across the
          smoldering hulks of BURNED DOZERS. The toppled remains of a
          charred ampsuit. Dead troopers bristling with arrows.
          
                              WAINFLEET
                    They hit with banshees first. Set the
                    ampsuit on fire. Driver's toast.
          
          Quaritch and Selfridge look on grimly.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    The rest of the squad?
          
                              WAINFLEET
                    Six bodies -- that's all of `em. And the
                    equipment is totalled.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    Christ.
          
                                                                     103.
          
          
          
          INT. SELFRIDGE'S OFFICE - DAY
          
          Selfridge is stares soberly as Quaritch outlines the plan.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    I can do it with minimal casualties to
                    the indigenous. We'll clear them out
                    with gas first. It'll be humane. More or
                    less.
          
          Selfridge sighs and rubs his face.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Hey, don't go limp on me now. This is
                    exactly the incident we needed.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    Alright, let's pull the trigger.
                                                                    CUT TO:
          
          INT. BIO LAB
          
          MAX and the lab staff are glumly packing files and equipment,
          under the watchful eye of armed SEC-OPS TROOPERS. JAKE,
          GRACE, NORM stare bleakly at each other.
          
                              GRACE
                    They bulldozed a sacred site on purpose,
                    to trigger a response. They're
                    fabricating this war to get what they
                    want.
          
                              NORM
                    I can't believe that.
          
                               JAKE
                    Yup. That's how it's done. When people
                    are sitting on shit you want, you make
                    them your enemy. Then you're justified in
                    taking it.
          
          TRUDY RUNS into the lab, breathless. She's wearing full
          flight gear and carrying her helmet.
          
                              TRUDY
                    Sec-ops is rolling the gunships.   They're
                    gonna hit Hometree!
          
                                JAKE
                    When?
          
                                TRUDY
                    Now.    We're spooling up now! I gotta go.
          
                                                                    104.
          
          
          
                              GRACE
                    My God.
          
          Jake pumps furiously toward the door, Grace following.
          
          INT. OPS CENTER - DAY
          
          SELFRIDGE surveys the airfield, where crews swarm over the
          gunships, loading ordnance. He turns as JAKE and GRACE
          charge toward him.
          
                              GRACE
                    Parker, wait. Stop! These are people
                    you're about to --
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    They're fly-bitten savages who live in a
                    tree! Look around -- I don't know about
                    you but I see a lot of trees. They can
                    move.
          
                              GRACE
                    For God's sake, there are children in
                    there. Babies!
          
                              JAKE
                    Look Selfridge, you don't want this kind
                    of blood on your hands. Let me try to
                    talk them out. They trust me.
          
          ON SELFRIDGE, considering this.
                                                                   CUT TO:
          
          INT. LINK ROOM
          
          SELFRIDGE and an escort of armed TROOPERS accompany Jake and
          Grace to the links. The two enter their units, as NORM and
          MAX prep the system.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    You've got one hour. Unless you want
                    your girlfriend in there when the axe
                    comes down, you get them to evacuate. One
                    hour.
          
          Jake lowers the upper clamshell. Norm starts the sequence.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          INT. COMMONS -DAY
          
          The entire clan is gathered, with Eytukan and Mo'at
          presiding. Jake looks around, feeling the gaze of the People
          upon him. He steels himself, and speaks in clear Na'vi --
          
                                                                  105.
          
          
          
                              JAKE
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    Eytukan, I have something to say, to
                    everyone.
          
                              EYTUKAN
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    Speak, Jakesully.
          
                              JAKE
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    A great evil is upon us. The Sky People
                    are coming to destroy Hometree. They
                    will be here soon.
          
          A murmur of fear and anger goes through the crowd.
          
                              JAKE
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    You have to leave, or you will die.
          
                              MO'AT
                    Are you certain of this?
          
                              JAKE
                    They sent me here to learn your ways. So
                    one day I could bring this message, and
                    you would believe it.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    What are you saying, Jake? You knew this
                    would happen?
          
          He is unable to meet her eyes.
          
                              JAKE
                    Yes.
                        (ANGUISHED)
                    At first it was just orders. Then
                    everything changed. I fell in love--
                    with the forest, with the Omaticaya
                    People --
                        (he looks at her)
                    -- with you. And by then, how could I
                    tell you?
          
          Neytiri can barely breathe. She is shaking with the enormity
          of it, her voice cracking with rage and pain --
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    I trusted you, Jake!
          
                                                                   106.
          
          
          
                              JAKE
                    Neytiri. Please, I only wanted to --
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    You will never be one of the People!
                    NEVER!
          
          TSU'TEY yells to his HUNTERS --
          
                               TSUTEY
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    Bind them.
          
          They grab Jake, who doesn't resist. Others seize Grace.
          Both are driven to their knees, and their arms bound.
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST - DAY
          
          SCORPION GUNSHIPS darken the sky as they come over the tops
          of the trees. At the head of the formation is one much
          larger ship, a monster 150 feet long -- the GENERAL DYNAMICS
          C-21 DRAGON GUNSHIP.
          
          Quaritch, next to the pilot of the Dragon, surveys the world
          below like Napoleon astride his horse.
          
          EXT. HOMETREE
          
          JAKE and GRACE are lashed to posts at the front entrance to
          Hometree. The People look up as --
          
          THE DRAGON and its escort of GUNSHIPS arrive over the trees.
          The DOWN-BLAST from their rotors creates a maelstrom of
          flying leaves and debris.
          
          IN THE DRAGON COCKPIT Quaritch watches a targeting screen --
          a telescopic image of Jake and Grace tied to posts.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Well, I'd say diplomacy has failed.
          
          TSU'TEY and another HUNTER hold knives to the throats of the
          two avatars, glaring defiantly at the gunships.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    I think they mean to cut their throats if
                    we don't back off. Make sure you get a
                    nice close-up of that. I can tack it onto
                    the after-action report.
          
          JAKE YELLS to Neytiri, Tsu'tey, the others gathered nearby --
          
                                                                      107.
          
          
          
                              JAKE
                    You have to get out of Hometree! Run to
                    the forest! Please, I'm begging you!
          
          EYTUKAN scowls at Jake, then GRABS TSU'TEY and yells --
          
                              EYTUKAN
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    Take the ikran! Attack from above!
          
          Tsu'tey grabs some hunters and runs up the roots of Hometree.
          
          IN THE COCKPIT Quaritch grows impatient.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Alright, let's get this done. Give me
                    forty millimeter gas rounds, right in the
                    front door.
          
                               GUNNER
                    Roger.   CS forties. Going hot.
          
                               QUARITCH
                    Fire.
          
          On the Dragon's stub-wings the 40mm ROCKET LAUNCHERS open up
          with a BARRAGE of leaping fire which FLASHES down and --
          
          K-WHOOM!K-WHOOM!K-WHOOM! -- the inside of Hometree ERUPTS
          with multiple EXPLOSIONS of TEARGAS.
          
          THE GAS rolls across the confused villagers. They begin to
          cough and gag.
          
          Eytukan and the remaining HUNTERS bravely fire at the
          gunships with their longbows.
          
          IN THE DRAGON'S COCKPIT, Quaritch laughs as arrows CLINK
          against the armored windows.
          
          AMID CLOUDS of teargas, the Omaticaya run, stumble, collapse.
          
                              EYTUKAN
                        (yelling/subtitled)
                    Everybody outside! Go to the Forest.
          
          The villagers pour out of Hometree. Everyone is yelling.
          Piercing SCREAMS in the boiling gas.
          
          JAKE, eyes streaming, struggles with his bindings.
          
          KA-WHOOM! An INCENDIARY ROUND explodes inside the Commons.
          FLAMES ROAR through the base of Hometree.
          
                                                                     108.
          
          
          
          INSIDE HOMETREE it is a burning smoky HELL. Flames roar up
          the inside like a chimney. STRAGGLERS scramble outside,
          coughing and dragging wounded with them.
          
          High up in the trunk, TSU'TEY and his hunters leap rapidly
          from spoke to spoke, climbing barely ahead of the fireball.
          
          OUTSIDE the fire is driven by the rotor-wash toward JAKE and
          GRACE who are still bound tightly to the posts.
          
          Out of the smoke, MO'AT appears in front of Jake.    She raises
          a KNIFE and --
          
          SLASHES DOWNWARD. Jake looks down, surprised, to see his
          bonds falling away. He meets her eyes, which are filled with
          horror, but also something else. Call it faith.
          
                              MO'AT
                    You are one of us.   Help us!
          
          Jake takes the knife and cuts Grace free.
          
                              JAKE
                    We've gotta move!    He's gonna blow the
                    columns.
          
          As Grace realizes what he means, he grabs her and they RUN.
          Around them the Omaticaya flee in horror and confusion.
          
          IN THE COCKPIT, Quaritch watches as the Omaticaya stream away
          from the Great Tree, running along roots and branches.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    That's how you scatter the roaches. Okay,
                    switch missiles. Give me H-E's at the
                    base of the west columns.
          
                              PILOTS (V.O.)
                    Copy, switching missiles.
          
          IN TRUDY'S SAMSON -- she hears the other pilots acknowledging
          Quaritch's order.
          
                                TRUDY
                    Screw it.
          
          She takes her finger OFF the fire-control and pulls her
          aircraft out of formation.
          
          PUSHING IN ON QUARITCH, the Hometree reflecting in his
          glasses.
          
                                                                      109.
          
          
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Bring it down.
          
          MISSILES stream down from the DRAGON and the other gunships
          and --
          
          The base of Hometree VANISHES in a chain of HIGH-EXPLOSIVE
          BLASTS. The massive PILLARS fragment into matchsticks, and --
          
          The Omaticaya watch in horror as --
          
          HOMETREE GROANS and starts to MOVE.
          
          In a cacophony of cracking, splintering roots, the mighty
          tree TOPPLES with agonizing slowness.
          
          AT THE BANSHEE EYRIE, TSU'TEY and the other hunters spur
          their mounts into flight. They swoop among the branches as
          the tree, the one fixed thing in their lives, MOVES.
          
          It CRASHES DOWN through the forest canopy, crushing the
          lesser trees in its path, FALLING PONDEROUSLY.
          
          HOMETREE hits the ground like the end of the world, raising a
          great cloud of dust and pulverized debris.
          
          IN THE DRAGON cockpit, Quaritch surveys the destruction.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Nice work people. Alright, let's light
                    it up.
          
          INCENDIARIES launch from the gunships, EXPLODING into gouts
          of FIRE in the debris of Hometree.
          
          THE GUNSHIPS fan the flames through the trees like a fire-
          storm. The Omaticaya retreat as a WALL OF FIRE advances.
          
          JAKE SEARCHES for Neytiri amid swirling smoke and sparks.
          
                               JAKE
                    Neytiri!   Neytiri!
          
          GRACE is gathering crying CHILDREN, and herding them away
          from the fire-storm.
          
          NEYTIRI stumbles through the burning wreckage at the edge of
          the INFERNO. She sees --
          
          EYTUKAN. A large shard of wood is driven through him like a
          spear. He recognizes her as she kneels over him.
          
                                                                      110.
          
          
          
                              EYTUKAN
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    Daughter -- take my bow. Protect the
                    People.
          
          In his last living moment he places his bow in her hands.
          
          She collapses over him, her face crumpling in grief.
          
          JAKE reels out of the smoke.    Kneels next to her.
          
                              JAKE
                    I'm sorry --
          
          She shoves him away and stands, screaming at him as tears
          stream down her face.
          
                               NEYTIRI
                    Get away from me, Jake. Go away! Never
                    come back!
          
          Jake stumbles back as she slumps down by her father's body.
          Sparks and smoke swirl around him. He watches as --
          
          NETYIRI kneels, grieving. Slumped over, clutching her
          stomach. Keening like an animal.
          
          SLOW MOTION -- Jake staggers lost and alone through the
          burning forest. Utterly shattered. Eyes vacant.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    I was a warrior who dreamed he could
                    bring peace. Sooner or later though, you
                    always have to wake up...
          
          INT. LINK ROOM
          
          SELFRIDGE watches a video feed of the destruction on one of
          the monitors. Max and NORM stare in shock.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    Pull the plug.
          
          A TROOPER crosses to the console and grabs the handle of the
          MASTER BREAKER --
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST
          
          The strings are cut. Jake flops to the ground, limp.
          
          Elsewhere in the smoky Hell, Grace slumps unconscious. The
          crying kids pull at her. Mo'at, leading a group of
          Omaticaya, comes upon the scene.
          
                                                                     111.
          
          
          
          She grabs the kids and pulls them away, leaving Grace's
          avatar helpless in the path of the flames. She hesitates,
          then --
          
                               MO'AT
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    Bring her.
          
          INT. LINK ROOM
          
          BLACKNESS. Then the top clamshell of Jake's unit is yanked
          upward, and troopers grab him, zip-tie his wrists as we --
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST - DUSK
          
          ON A HILLSIDE -- a grieving Neytiri stands with Mo'at and the
          Omaticaya refugees. Two hunters pull Grace's avatar on a
          travois.
          
          They watch as the flames burn like a funeral pyre below. A
          great pall of smoke darkens the landscape.
                                                             DISSOLVE TO:
          
          INT. LOCK-UP - NIGHT
          
          Jake, Grace, and Norm are in a common holding cell. They
          sit, staring in silence. Too wired to sleep, too emotionally
          drained to move.
          
                              GRACE
                    They never wanted us to succeed.
          
          AT THE DESK OUTSIDE, the lone TROOPER looks up as --
          
          TRUDY approaches along the corridor, pushing a stainless
          steel trolley.
          
                              TRUDY
                    Personally I think steak's too good for
                    these traitors.
          
                              GUARD
                    They get steak?    That's bullshit. Let me
                    see that --
          
          The guard bends to look into the hot cart and   --
          
          THE MUZZLE of Trudy's pistol presses behind his ear.
          
                                                                     112.
          
          
          
                              TRUDY
                    Oops.
                        (shoving him down)
                    All the way down, pendejo.
          
          She WHISTLES and MAX trots around the corner.
          
          Trudy binds the guard with one of his own zip-ties as Max
          grabs his KEY CARD and runs to the cell. Swipes the card.
          The door is rolling open when --
          
          ANOTHER TROOPER rounds the corner. Trudy takes him down with
          a sharp BLOW to the windpipe and a THAI KNEE to the ribs.
          
          Meanwhile the first TROOPER is getting up, but Max CLOCKS him
          heartily with a coffee urn. He goes down and stays down.
          
                              MAX
                    That was unexpectedly satisfying.
          
          Trudy plants a kiss on Norm as he runs out of the cell.
          
                              NORM
                    Baby, you rock.
          
          Jake wheels out, grabbing the sidearm from the fallen trooper
          as Trudy binds his wrists.
          
                              JAKE
                        (to Max and Trudy)
                    Thanks.
          
          Jake faces his motley group, chambering a round.
          
                              JAKE
                    So what do you say?    Time for a
                    revolution?
          
                                GRACE
                    I'm free.
          
          Trudy grins and taps his fist.
          
                                JAKE
                    Come on.
                                                                    CUT TO:
          
          INT. UTILIDOR
          
          In the utility corridor under the base, Jake pumps the chair
          furiously, as the others jog. They reach an AIRLOCK and start
          donning EXOPACKS.
          
                                                                        113.
          
          
          
                                JAKE
                          (to Trudy)
                      Get your ship fired up.
          
          Trudy nods. She grabs Norm and enters the airlock.     Jake
          turns to Max.
          
                                JAKE
                      Stay here. I need somebody on the inside
                      I can trust.
          
          Max nods.   Jake grips his hand tightly.
                                                                   CUT TO:
          
          EXT. AIRFIELD - NIGHT
          
          IN THE SAMSON, Norm is helping Trudy race through the
          preflight checks as the turbines spool up. A LIGHT hits
          them.
          
          An armored TROOPER approaches, aiming his AR at them.
          
                                TROOPER
                      I need you to shut down and step out of
                      the vehicle! Now!
          
          JAKE rolls up behind him, aiming his pistol.
          
                                JAKE
                      Take it nice and easy, troop.
          
          The trooper turns, sees the gun.
          
                                 JAKE
                      On the ground, face down. Hands behind
                      your head.
          
          The trooper hesitates.
          
                                GRACE
                      Do what he goddamn says!
          
          He does. Norm jumps down and grabs the trooper's rifle and
          side-arm, covering him, while Grace helps Jake from chair to
          the back bay of the chopper. She throws his chair in, and
          jumps in herself.
          
                                JAKE
                      Go! Go! Go!
          
                                                                     114.
          
          
          
          INT. OPS CENTER - NIGHT
          
          QUARITCH, watching a monitor, sees what's happening down at
          the airfield. He slams his palm down on an ALARM BUTTON.
          
          He draws his PISTOL.   Strides toward the EMERGENCY DOOR. He
          undogs it.
          
          EXT. OPS CENTER/AIRFIELD - NIGHT
          
          HOLDING HIS BREATH Quaritch yanks the hatch open and strides
          onto the outer landing. Inside people scramble for MASKS.
          
          THE SAMSON lifts off in a blast of rotor-wash just as --
          
          QUARITCH OPENS FIRE and --
          
          ROUNDS rake the ship. Trudy banks hard, using the bottom to
          shield them. Bullets WHACK into the ship as she climbs-out
          over the tree-line.
          
          Jake's fist pumps the air exultantly.
          
                              JAKE
                    Oh yeah, baby!
          
                              GRACE
                    Aaahh, crap. Not again.
          
          He looks over at Grace and freezes. She is looking down at a
          BLOODY HAND. She clutches her abdomen, covering the
          spreading stain. Looks at Jake, wide-eyed.
          
                              GRACE
                    This is gonna ruin my whole day.
          
                              JAKE
                    Hang on, Grace.
                                                                  CUT TO:

          NORM'S AVATAR, with an AR slung over his shoulder, stands on
          the roof of the LINK MODULE. He gives a thumbs up signal.
          The lift cable goes taut and --
          
          The shack LIFTS OFF THE GROUND.
          
          Trudy's Samson beats the grass of the mountain meadow,
          straining to lift the module on a long-line sling. The shack
          sways as Trudy banks across forested slopes and heads deeper
          into the HALLELUJAH MOUNTAINS.
          
                                                                    115.

          Outside the windows, clouds and cliffs pass by, lit by
          Polyphemus.
          
          Jake is yanking stuff out of the Samson's trauma bag, while
          Grace lies curled across two back seats, hugging her blood-
          soaked abdomen. She is pale and shocky.
          
          Trudy is flying on visual only, by the light of Polyphemus.
          Her instruments are showing gibberish.
          
                              TRUDY
                    Well, at least they won't be able to
                    track us up here. Not this deep in the
                    vortex.
          
                              JAKE
                    It's strongest at the Well of Souls,
                    right?
          
                               TRUDY
                    Yeah.
          
                              JAKE
                    Good, `cause that's where we're going.
          
                               TRUDY
                    Copy.
          
          He gives Grace an ampule of morphine for the pain.
          
                              JAKE
                    I'm gonna get you some help, Grace.
          
                              GRACE
                    Forget it, it doesn't matter.
          
          Jake grabs her shoulders.
          
                               JAKE
                    No!   The People can help you. I know it.
                                                                   CUT TO:

          Dawn light paints the massive ARCHES of magnetic rock above
          the Well of Souls.
          
          Tiny as an insect, the SAMSON passes.

                    The Well of Souls. The heart of the
                    forest. I knew the People would go
                    there.
          
          EXT. WELL OF SOULS - DAWN
          
          The WELL OF SOULS is a deep caldera 100 meters across. It is
          ringed with enormous WILLOWS whose roots seem to pour down
          the sheer rock walls like candle wax.
          
          AT THE BOTTOM, in a natural amphitheater, the Omaticaya
          refugees are clustered around a central rock outcropping
          which forms a kind of dais and altar.
          
          Shafts of dawn light reach to the bottom of the grotto,
          lighting a single willow -- the MOTHER TREE. Ancient and
          gnarled, it grows in the center of the rock.
          
          Its ROOTS spread down to the grotto floor, where they merge
          with the roots of the willows ringing the Well -- forming a
          braided mat resembling the surface of a brain.
          
          Mo'at stands on the dais, leading them in a CHANT.

          It bumps to the ground.

          Grace lies, comatose, in her open link. Trudy gives Jake a
          look that says "not much time." Jake feels Grace's cold
          forehead, then crosses to his own link.
          
          As Trudy helps him in, Norm rapidly preps the system.

                        (LOW)
                    Tsu'tey is Olo'eyctan now. He's not
                    going to let you get near that place.
          
                              JAKE
                    I've gotta try, Norm.

          Jake pulls the clamshell down and we --

          CU JAKE'S AVATAR -- HIS EYES OPEN. He sits up. The forest is
          silent, shrouded in smoke that the sun can't penetrate. The
          animals have fled. Ash blows on the wind.
          
                                  JAKE (V.O.)
                       Outcast. Betrayer. Alien. To ever face
                       them again, I was gonna have to change
                       the rules.
          
          DISSOLVE -- JAKE reaches the top of a rise. The forest
          beyond is utterly DEVASTATED. The trees burned and fallen.
          Small fires still flicker across a landscape in Hell.
          
          JAKE stares. It is his vision, made real. He stumbles
          through the dark wasteland, sparks and ash swirling around
          him.
          
          A SCREECH.    Jake looks up as --
          
          HIS BANSHEE -- bonded for life -- flaps down to a landing in
          front of him. He steps to it, and strokes its head. It
          nudges his chest like a horse.
          
                                 JAKE (V.O.)
                       Sometimes your whole life boils down to
                       one insane move.
          
                                 JAKE

          It scans for prey below, its magnificent indigo-crested head
          cocking left, then right.

                       The way I had it figured, Toruk is the
                       baddest cat in the sky. Nothing attacks
                       him. So why would he ever look up?
          
          FROM ABOVE -- THE SMALL SHADOW of Jake's banshee falls across
          the back of the mighty Toruk.

          tragic loss and yearning for deliverance.
          
          CLOSE ON NEYTIRI, singing. A SHADOW CROSSES HER FACE.   She
          looks up, and her eyes go wide as --
          
          A TERRIBLE CRY echoes, turning all eyes skyward.   AN ENORMOUS
          SHADOW covers the crowd as --
          
          TORUK comes out of the sun, beating its huge wings to slow
          its descent. Its crimson and black wings, backlit by the
          sun, seem to glow from within.
          
          The People CRY OUT in alarm and scatter as the dreaded beast
          alights in their midst. And that's when they see --
          
          JAKE, riding high on its shoulders, plugged-in to its
          antenna. It folds its wings and stands calmly amid the
          paralyzed Na'vi.
          
          Toruk lowers its body. They stare in awe as Jake dismounts
          and strokes the magnificent animal's flank.
          
          NEYTIRI, TSU'TEY and MO'AT watch in stunned amazement as the
          legendary Rider of Last Shadow walks toward them.

          ON THE FACES of the Omaticaya -- new hope dawning in their

          Jake walks through the crowd, straight to Neytiri at the foot
          of the dais. He looks into her enormous eyes, and the
          emotion between them is powerful and pure.
          
                                 NEYTIRI

                    I was afraid Jake -- for my people. I'm
                    not any more.
          
          Jake takes Neytiri's hand and climbs the steps of the dais.
          
          MO'AT steps back in awe as he approaches. He turns to
          Tsu'tey, who stares at him with fear and incomprehension.
          Jake plays to the rapt crowd as he says --

                        (SUBTITLED)
                    Tsu'tey of the Rongloa, son of Ateyo. I
                    stand before you, ready to serve the
                    People.
                        (then just for Tsu'tey)
                    You are Olo'eyctan, and you are the best
                    warrior. I can't do this without you.
          
          Tsu'tey struggles with his emotions. Finally --
          
                              TSU'TEY
                    I will fly with you.

                    Grace is dying.     I beg the help of the

                              MO'AT
                    Bring her, Jakesully.
          
          TIME CUT -- AVATAR JAKE carries Grace's HUMAN BODY, lightly
          in his arms like a child. Jake walks through the crowd to
          the dais, followed by NORM, who carries GRACE'S AVATAR.
          
                                                                   120.

                    Look where we are, Grace.
          
          Her eyes flutter open. She looks up wonderingly at the Mother
          Tree.
          
                              GRACE
                        (with a wan smile)
                    I need to take some samples.
          
          Mo'at directs them to lay both bodies among the roots on the
          altar-rock.
          
          Mo'at touches Jake's shoulder and he steps back.
          
                              MO'AT
                        (QUIETLY)
                    The Great Mother may choose to save all
                    that she is --
          
          Mo'at's hand indicates Grace's AVATAR --
          
                              MO'AT
                    -- in this body.
          
          CU JAKE, realizing the enormity of what she's saying.
          
                              JAKE
                    Is that possible?
          
                              MO'AT
                    Possible, yes. She must pass through the
                    Eye of Eywa -- and return. But Jakesully--
                    she is very weak.
          
          Jake kneels next to Grace, taking her tiny human hand in his
          avatar hand.
          
                              JAKE
                    Hang on, they're gonna fix you up.
          
          Grace is barely conscious.    She grips his hand.
          
                              GRACE
                    I -- always held back. But you gave them
                    your heart. I'm proud of you, Jake.
          
          Jake feels his throat close with emotion.
          
          Grace's eyes blaze with intensity though her voice is faint.
          
                                                                     121.
          
          
          
                                 GRACE
                    Help them.     You do whatever it takes. You
                    hear me?
          
                                 JAKE
                    I will.
          
          TIME CUT -- MO'AT stands in a kind of trance amongst the
          tendrils of the Mother Tree.
          
          NEYTIRI and the other acolytes dance hypnotically. All the
          Omaticaya sway and chant to the rhythm of the drums.
          
          MACRO SHOT -- fine, hairlike THREADS have emerged from the
          roots and are gently spreading over Grace's HUMAN skin.
          
          JAKE, still holding her hand, watches her body being fused to
          the root-floor by a thousand connections.
          
          GRACE'S AVATAR is gently connected by the same questing ROOT-
          CILIA-- they entwine with the QUEUE and spread over the body.
          
          The grotto is dark except for the spectral GLOW of the
          willows. The CHANT continues, hypnotically. MO'AT, on her
          knees beneath the Mother Tree, writhes her arms in the trance
          state. Her eyes are rolled back, showing only WHITE.
          
          GRACE GASPS and her eyes SNAP OPEN. Her expression is AMAZED,
          as if seeing something so beautiful it can never be
          explained.
          
          ON HER HAND -- GRIPPING Jake's convulsively, as she tries to
          anchor herself to this world for a few more seconds --
          
                              GRACE
                    I'm with her Jake --
                        (an amazed whisper)
                    -- she's real --
          
          Grace SHUDDERS, as pain shoots through her. BLOOD seeps
          through the silken white root-cilia growing across her
          abdomen. Drowning WHITE in shocking CRIMSON.
          
          She exhales a last shuddering breath -- and goes STILL.
          
                                 JAKE
                    Grace!
          
          He sees the roots falling away from her human body.
          
          JAKE TURNS hopefully toward her AVATAR -- but the roots are
          falling away from it as well. It sleeps -- VACANT.
          
                                                                       122.
          
          
          
          MO'AT stops the chant. She crosses to Jake and kneels with
          him, touching his shoulder.
          
                              MO'AT
                    Her wounds were too great, there was not
                    enough time. She is with Eywa now.
          
          NEYTIRI removes Grace's mask and gently closes her eyes.
          
          Jake stands slowly, barely holding it together.
          
          NEYTIRI comes to him and he sees the despair and hope
          conflicting on her face --
          
          -- and he raises his head.   TURNS to face TSU'TEY and the
          CROWD.
          
                              JAKE
                    With your permission, I will Speak now.
                    You would honor me by translating.
          
          Tsu'tey gestures assent, and they face the clan together.
          
          JAKE SPEAKS, the pain of Grace's death in the passion and
          fury of his voice. Tsu'tey TRANSLATES beside him.
          
                              JAKE
                    The Sky People have sent a message that
                    they can take whatever they want, and no
                    one can stop them. But we will send them
                    a message. Ride out, as fast as the wind
                    can carry you, tell the other clans to
                    come. Tell them Toruk Macto calls to
                    them. Fly now with me brothers and
                    sisters! Fly! And we will show the Sky
                    People that this is our land!
          
          TSU'TEY finishes with a bloodcurdling war-cry, and the entire
          CLAN responds, their shouts echoing across the forest.
          
          JAKE takes Neytiri's hand and runs to the leonopteryx.   He
          vaults onto its back and pulls her up behind him.
          
          THE HUNTERS run to their banshees, mounting quickly. Jake's
          leonopteryx rises on mighty wings into the night sky. With a
          thunder of wings, the banshees take off after it.
          
          LONG LENS -- POLYPHEMUS. Across its face, the banshees rise
          like a swarm of bats. Groups of riders peel off in different
          directions.
                                                                  CUT TO:

          EXT. CLAN GATHERING - NIGHT
          
          JAKE and NEYTIRI stand before the gathered members of ANOTHER
          CLAN. Jake speaks as she translates. We don't hear the
          words.
          
          TRACK ACROSS the faces of the clan, a sea of eyes in
          flickering fire-light.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    We rode out to the four winds. To the
                    horse clans of the plain, to the ikran
                    people of the mountains. When Toruk
                    Macto called them, they came.
          
          VARIOUS ANGLES -- SLOW MOTION as riders vault onto their
          armored direhorses. Banshee riders raise spears and bows,
          spurring their mounts to leap skyward.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          EXT. WELL OF SOULS - DAWN
          
          With a WHOOSH and the crack of mighty wings, JAKE RETURNS.
          Jake and Neytiri alight from his legendary mount.
          
          Around them HUNDREDS OF BANSHEES are landing.   A gathering of
          eagles.
          
          FROM ABOVE we can see hundreds of Na'vi streaming down into
          the Well of Souls and many hundreds more camped in the forest
          above it.
          
          DIREHORSE RIDERS are arriving along many trails.
          
          BANSHEE RIDERS circle and swoop, darkening the sky above the
          grotto.
          
          JAKE, standing next to the Leonopteryx, watches his army
          gathering.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          INT. COMMISSARY - DAY
          
          It's standing room only as all base personnel are crowded
          into the dining hall. A portable 3D GRAPHICS PROJECTOR has
          been set up, and the lights are down. QUARITCH stands in
          front of the display image -- a classic pre-mission briefing.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    People, you are fighting for survival.
                    There's an aboriginal horde out there
                    massing for an attack. First slide.
          
                                                                      124.
          
          
          
          The display shows an overhead image of the Well of Souls.    It
          looks like Woodstock in the jungle.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    These orbital images show the hostiles'
                    numbers have gone from a couple of
                    hundred to over two thousand in one day,
                    and more are pouring in. By next week it
                    could be twenty thousand. Then they'll be
                    overrunning our perimeter here. We can't
                    wait. Our only security lies in pre-
                    emptive attack. We will fight terror
                    with terror.
          
          TRACKING ACROSS the grim faces of the miners and troopers.
          Fear transforming to hatred in their eyes.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Next slide. This mountain stronghold is
                    supposedly protected by their deity.
                    When we destroy it, we will blast a
                    crater in their racial memory so deep
                    they won't come within a thousand klicks
                    of this place.
                                                                    CUT TO:
          
          INT. ARMOR BAY - DAY
          
          TROOPERS issue automatic weapons and magazines to a long line
          of mine workers. The miners lock and load like the red-
          blooded redneck NRA supporters they are.
          
          BLASTING TECHS are setting radio-detonated primer charges
          into two-ton stacks of EXPLOSIVE COMPOUND. The stacks are
          band-strapped together on pallets.
          
          TRACKING WITH SELFRIDGE, staring around him in growing dismay
          as he walks through the full-scale mobilization.
          
          He approaches Quaritch, who is barking orders amid a hive of
          activity around the ampsuits.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    This thing is completely out of control!
          
          Quaritch ignores him, turning away to focus on ordnance
          loading.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    Listen to me! I am not authorizing you to
                    turn the mine-workers local into a
                    freakin' militia!
          
                                                                     125.
          
          
          
                              QUARITCH
                    I declared threat condition red. That
                    puts all on-world assets under my
                    command.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    You think you can pull this palace coup
                    shit on me?! I can have your ass with
                    one call --
          
          Quaritch grabs him and PINS him against the side of an
          ampsuit.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    You're a long way from Earth.
          
          Selfridge is paralyzed. Physical force -- against him?
          Quaritch releases him and walks away.
          
                              QUARITCH
                        (to his men)
                    Get him out of here.
          
          Several troopers converge on Selfridge.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    You touch me you're so fired.
          
          He pushes through them and they escort him toward the door.

                              MAX
                    It's crazy here, Jake. It's full
                    mobilization. They're rigging the
                    shuttles as bombers. They've made up
                    these big pallets of mine explosives.
                    It's for some kind of shock and awe
                    campaign.

                        (to Max)
                    Can you talk to Selfridge? Maybe we can
                    cut some kinda deal before this thing
                    goes all the way.

                              TRUDY
                    You know he's gonna commit those bombers
                    straight to the Well of Souls.
          
                              JAKE
                    That's right. Because I gave it to him
                    on a plate.
          
                              TRUDY
                    We both did.
          
                              NORM
                    If he takes out the Well of Souls -- it's
                    over. It's their main line to Eywa, to
                    their ancestors -- it'll destroy them.
          
                              JAKE
                    Then I guess we better stop him.
          
          Jake looks like he's about to collapse.   He's gaunt, eyes
          deeply shadowed, hands shaking.
          
                              TRUDY
                    You need to get some rack.
          
                                                                      127.
          
          
          
          He grabs a packet of freeze-dried crystals and pours them
          directly into his mouth, chewing them up.
          
                              JAKE
                    Gonna have to settle for coffee.
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          EXT. BATTLE CAMP - DUSK
          
          TRACKING through the warrior camp above the Well of Souls.
          Hundreds of hunters from many clans prepare their weapons.
          
          Hunters paint the wings of their banshees like war ponies.
          DIREHORSES are painted and ornamented with totemic streamers.
          
          The Na'vi paint and pierce themselves. Dance. Bathe in the
          smoke of cleansing herbs -- RITUAL PURIFICATION. HUGE DRUMS
          are beaten. A dark primeval energy. They are psyching
          themselves up for battle.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    I was a warrior who dreamed he could
                    bring peace. But there was only one
                    thing I was ever really good at. Ooh-rah.
          
          TIME CUT -- Jake, Neytiri a group of banshee riders squat
          around an animal skin on which he has drawn the silhouette of
          a Scorpion gunship -- like a hunt totem.
          
                              JAKE
                        (Na'vi/subtitled)
                    Strike here and here.
          
          Jake splats red dye at the centers of the circles symbolizing
          the rotors. The Na'vi absorb the lesson eagerly, like kids.
          
          He sees TRUDY approaching and breaks off. Neytiri stays with
          the hunters, talking about what they've learned.
          
                              TRUDY
                        (LOW)
                    You know our chances suck.
          
                              JAKE
                    Yeah.
          
                              TRUDY
                    Going up against gunships with bows and
                    arrows...
          
                              JAKE
                    What's your point?
          
                                                                      128.
          
          
          
                              TRUDY
                        (NODDING)
                    Right.
          
          She taps his fist and walks away toward her SAMSON.
                                                                   CUT TO:
          
          EXT. WELL OF SOULS - NIGHT
          
          The cook-fires of the battle camp FLICKER like a
          constellation around the edge of the Well of Souls as --
          
          JAKE slips down into the darkened, empty amphitheater.
          
          He moves to the MOTHER TREE -- gnarled, ancient, MAJESTIC.
          The roots spread in all directions, like the center of the
          world.
          
          Jake steps forward. The willow-like tendrils SWAY toward
          him, moving in a breeze that isn't there.
          
                              JAKE
                    I've never done this in my life.
          
          He squats at the base of the tree.
          
                              JAKE
                    And I'm probably just talking to a tree
                    right now. But if you're there -- I need
                    to give you a heads up.
          
          He looks up into the tree. The hanging tendrils undulate
          softly. It's easy to imagine a presence.
          
                              JAKE
                    If Grace is there with you -- look in her
                    memories -- she can show you the world we
                    come from. There's no green there. They
                    killed their Mother, and they're gonna do
                    the same thing here.
          
          FROM UP IN THE TREE, looking down.   WOODSPRITES float in
          silence, moving around aimlessly.
          
                              JAKE
                    More Sky People are gonna come. They're
                    gonna come like a rain that never ends --
          
          Neytiri approaches silently behind him, listening.
          
                              JAKE
                    -- until they've covered the world.
                    Unless we stop them.
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                      129.
          
                              JAKE (cont'd)
                    Look, you chose me for somethin'. And
                    I'll stand and fight, you know I will.
                    But I could use a little help here.
          
          Jake senses Neytiri and turns.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    Our Great Mother does not take sides.
                    She protects only the balance of life.
          
          She comes to him, intertwining her long fingers with his.
          
                              JAKE
                    It was worth a try.
          
          They lean in, foreheads touching, bodies pressed together.
          Holding each other -- in this, the last moment of peace.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          TIGHT ON a turbine as it starts to turn. Its RISING WHINE
          carries over --
          
          A SERIES OF RHYTHMIC CUTS:
          
          MAGAZINES are slammed into automatic weapons. AMMO BELTS are
          fed into rotary cannons. MISSILES are attached to gunship
          stub-wings.
          
          TIGHT ON BLUE HANDS sharpening wooden arrows.   Stringing
          bows. Cinching direhorse harnesses.
          
          TROOPERS DROP into ampsuit cockpits. PILOTS close gunship
          canopies. TROOPERS run up shuttle ramps.
          
          LONG LENS STACK, tight and abstract on gunships as they rise
          in a swarm amid boiling turbine exhaust and blasting rotor
          wash.
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST/ AERIAL - DAWN
          
          WIDE SHOT -- TILTROTORS fill the sky. Deadly armored beetles.
          
          The DRAGON leads the formation, flanked by SCORPIONS. Behind
          that is a wave of SAMSONS, and last, the two enormous
          VALKYRIE shuttles, packed with troops and ampsuits.
          
          INSIDE THE DRAGON, Quaritch surveys his armada as they skim
          over the tree tops.
          
          THEY SWEEP toward the Hallelujah mountains in a thundering
          wave.
          
                                                                     130.
          
          
          
          EXT. MOUNTAINS/ AERIAL - DAWN
          
          SQUADRONS OF BANSHEES darken the sky in waves, led by a
          single GREAT LEONOPTERYX. Jake sits astride his mount,
          flanked by Neytiri and Tsu'tey on their banshees.
          
          EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAWN
          
          THE DRAGON DESCENDS on final approach to a large clearing --
          the LZ. The Samsons flair and touch down, disgorging troops,
          while the gunships hover protectively.
          
          THE VALKYRIES blast the ground with their powerful lift jets.
          They land. The ramps drop. Troopers pour out, weapons
          leveled, advancing in a cordon.
          
          UP ANGLE as AMPSUITS descend from the Dragon on cables.
          Their massive feet smash down, and they march forward,
          leading the army into the forest.
          
          LYLE WAINFLEET, walking point in his hydraulic suit, scans
          his cockpit screens. He sees movement on the FLIR display --
          ghostly THERMAL SIGNATURES.
          
                              WAINFLEET
                    Contact. Two hundred meters.
          
          A chilling SOUND echoes through the forest -- the ululating
          WAR CRIES of untold Na'vi. The troopers, look around,
          spooked. They can't tell where the sound is coming from.
          
          Then they feel it -- the GROUND ITSELF SHAKING.    They grip
          their weapons, bracing themselves as --
          
          THREE HUNDRED NA'VI HORSEMEN charge through the forest at a
          full gallop, their hooves POUNDING the earth. It is an
          awesome sight.
          
          NORM SPELLMAN rides with the Na'vi hunters, carrying an
          assault rifle.
          
          THE NA'VI CHARGE thunders toward the human line.   The hunters
          raise their bows as --
          
          THE AMPSUITS raise their GAU-90's.
          
          ON THE THERMAL IMAGERS target-cursors track the ghost riders.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Fire for effect.
          
          The entire line of troopers opens fire. TRACERS riddle the
          jungle, blasting foliage into confetti.
          
                                                                      131.
          
          
          
          CHARGING DIREHORSES crash down, flipping over. Riders are
          flung off. The withering fire continues, and the ranks are
          decimated as --
          
          RIDERS LAUNCH their arrows at a full gallop. A few hit their
          marks among the troopers. NORM FIRES his AR on full auto.
          
          TWO CHARGING DIREHORSES have a heavy log slung between them
          like a battering ram. At a full gallop they hit an ampsuit,
          FLIPPING IT onto its back with a blown-out canopy. Victory
          is short lived as the two riders are cut down.
          
          NORM'S HORSE is hit by tracer fire. He is flung off as the
          creature cartwheels. He hits hard, scrambling for cover as --
          
          A WARRIOR HURLS his spear a moment before his horse is cut
          down. It SLAMS through an ampsuit's canopy but --
          
          THE MERCILESS FIRE continues. Horses rear and collapse.
          Riders pivot their mounts to flee and --
          
          THE THERMAL SCREENS show the remaining ghost riders
          scattering.
          
          LYLE signals and the line advances, firing sporadically at
          moving targets.
          
          OVERHEAD, NA'VI HUNTERS stream through the trees, running
          along the branches.
          
          As the troopers advance into bow range, the NA'VI open fire
          and --
          
          TROOPERS SPROUT ARROWS in throat, legs, masks -- the targets
          Jake taught them, but --
          
          THE FIRING LINE aims upward, tracking the THERMAL TARGETS.
          TRACERS rip through the foliage and --
          
          NA'VI FALL while others retreat as bark and wood is blasted
          off the limbs beneath their feet.
          
          NORM sprints frantically through the woods, shouting into his
          HANDSET --
          
                               NORM
                    Jake!   Jake! We're falling back!
          
          SURVIVING NA'VI flee the horrific onslaught.   It is a total
          rout.
          
          IN THE DRAGON, Quaritch catches glimpses of the figures
          streaming through the forest below.
          
                                                                      132.
          
          
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Blue team, switch forties.   Fire at will.
          
          Led by the Dragon, the gunships FIRE streamers of 40mm
          ROCKETS ahead of them. The jungle EXPLODES with HE bursts.
          Circular SHOCK WAVES flash outward through the jungle --
          
          STROBOSCOPIC GLIMPSES of terrified horses rearing, Na'vi
          leaping, as the jungle rocks with the concussive onslaught.
          
          HUNTERS LOOK UP as a dark shape hovers overhead. The
          downblast of the VALKYRIE'S lift jets shreds the forest.
          
          INSIDE THE SHUTTLE'S cargo bay, a row of DAISYCUTTERS are
          lined up. Troopers roll the first pallet down the ramp.
          
          THE PALLET falls into the jungle below and --
          
          BA-WHOOOOOM! -- an enormous high-explosive blast rips a huge
          hole in the forest. A white concussion wave flashes out
          across the ground for hundreds of meters in all directions.
          
          AT GROUND LEVEL it is an apocalypse. Running Na'vi are
          blasted out of existence by fire and shock waves.
          
          IN THE CARGO BAY the troopers WHOOP and high-five.
          
                                 TROOPERS
                    Yeah baby!     Get some!
          
          GROUND TROOPS ADVANCE, firing flamethrowers, AR's and GAU-
          90's.
          
          EXT. FLOATING MOUNTAINS - AERIAL
          
          Quaritch's fleet flies into the shadow of the Mountain of
          Truth.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Blue team, stay with the ground units.
                    Red team, with me. We're punching for
                    the main target.
          
          Quaritch glances up to see --
          
          A squadron of WINGED SHAPES, diving out of the morning glare
          like birds of prey.
          
          CLOSE ON JAKE, rushing straight down, SCREAMING a war cry as
          he leads the charge and --
          
          SCORES OF BANSHEES SLAM into the gunships and Samsons like
          falcons hitting fat turkeys. The air battle is joined.
          
                                                                      133.
          
          
          
          JAKE'S GREAT LEONOPTERYX flairs into its signature crimson X
          shape just before --
          
          K-WHAM!! -- it knocks a Scorpion tumbling. It coils around
          the gunship, slashing furiously as they spin together. JAKE
          can barely hang onto the gyrating creature.
          
          The pilot of the Scorpion sees nothing but jaws slamming into
          his canopy.   Jake releases the gunship and it careens into a
          CLIFF, tearing off one rotor -- then plummets into the trees.
          There is a satisfying FIREBALL.
          
          SCORPIONS fall out of formation to pursue individual banshee
          riders, FIRING cannons and rockets.
          
          JAKE BANKS as the cliff face next to him explodes with
          cannon rounds. SCREAMING down on him is another Scorpion.
          
          JAKE tucks and dives along the cliff, feeling the rounds
          splitting the air around him and --
          
          The Scorpions bank after the furiously jinking banshees as
          they head for cover among the floating mountains, or dive
          down into the trees.
          
          DOOR GUNNERS in a SAMSON are shooting down banshees like
          Messerschmidts from a B-17 as --
          
          WE FOLLOW TSU'TEY'S BANSHEE in a full delta dive. He swoops
          in from its blind spot and --
          
          THE GUNNERS SWIVEL too late as Tsu'tey flashes past them,
          SHOOTING ARROWS with deadly accuracy.
          
          A SCORPION gunship dives after a banshee. It fires an air-to-
          air missile and the banshee vanishes in an EXPLOSION.
          
          WIDE SHOT as thirty ships and hundreds of banshees wheel and
          dive, like the Battle of Britain. Banshees are hit by guns
          and missiles, falling out of the sky. The occasional trail of
          smoke and fire marks the demise of a tilt-rotor.
          
          IN THE CENTER the Dragon is pouring out hellacious fire --
          tracer rounds from multiple turrets and missiles from the
          stub-wing pods.
          
          NEYTIRI BANKS hard as TRACERS flash past her.   A Scorpion is
          right on her ass as --
          
          SHE ROLLS inverted and dives under the edge of Mons
          Veritatis, then rolls out, zig-zagging through the dangling
          vines but --
          
                                                                     134.
          
          
          
          THE GUNSHIP stays on her. It rips through the vines, and
          tracers FLASH toward us as --
          
          SHE JINKS the banshee around a thundering waterfall but --
          
          HER PURSUER explodes right through the curtain of water. It
          launches an air-to-air missile. NEYTIRI jinks hard, diving.
          The missile hits a rock outcropping, pummeling her with the
          shock wave.
          
          THE GUNSHIP follows her through a narrow slit between Mons
          Veritatis and a smaller floating island. They run this slot
          rolled up on their sides and --
          
          THE SCORPION GUNNER locks up Neytiri for a missile shot but --
          
          A SHADOW crosses his canopy. Out of the sun comes a crimson
          demon, shrieking over the roar of the turbines, and --
          
          K-WHAMMM!! The leonopteryx SLAMS the gunship, driving it
          downward in a dive. The leonopteryx lashes at it with claws
          and teeth as they fall together out of control.
          
          Jake kicks the gunship loose and it falls like a brick,
          breaking its back on a rocky promontory and EXPLODING.
          
          FLYING WITH A SAMSON as a SECOND SAMSON falls in beside it.
          This one has its pilot door off, and the PILOT is wearing a
          breathing mask. The door gunners wave at --
          
          TRUDY, her expression grim behind her mask. She holds the
          cyclic stick between her knees while she RAKES the other ship
          with BURSTS from an AR in her lap.
          
          The pilot slumps over and the craft tumbles out of control.
          
                              TRUDY
                    You're not the only ones with guns, you
                    pricks.
          
          NEYTIRI JINKS her banshee hard, an enemy Samson right behind
          her. The pilot is a hotdog, following her down into the
          trees, under the canopy.
          
          They slalom among the trunks at high speed. The gunners hang
          half out the doors, firing. Bark and leaves explode around
          Neytiri as she zig-zags through the jungle.
          
          THE BANSHEE dives under a huge tree limb, and the pilot
          follows. He looks up at the last second, catching a glimpse
          of blue-skinned figures.
          
          THE HUNTERS drop a net of woven vines behind Neytiri and --
          
                                                                     135.
          
          
          
          The SAMSON hits it hard. The net fouls the ship, FLIPPING IT
          backwards. It crashes upside down to the forest floor.
          KABOOM!!
          
          NEYTIRI'S BANSHEE is hit by GROUND-FIRE. It folds up like a
          broken kite, crashing down through branches and --
          
          SHE SLAMS into the ground, stunned.
          
          IN THE DRAGON Quaritch looks ahead, seeing the WELL OF SOULS.
          He taps the pilot and points --
          
                              QUARITCH
                    There it is.
                        (into his headset)
                    Valkyrie One, this is Dragon. Target is
                    in sight.
          
          IN THE CARGO BAY of Valkyrie One, the troopers ready their
          deadly loads.
          
                              TROOPER
                    Target in sight.
          
          CIRCLING ABOVE, Tsu'tey falls in beside Jake, who talks to
          him by AIRCOM HEADSET.
          
                              JAKE
                    We have to stop the shuttles, no matter
                    what it takes.
          
          TSU'TEY nods. He signals, gathering other hunters, who fall
          in with him as he dives. Jake rolls in after them but --
          
          A GUNSHIP drops in behind him and he is forced to evade as --
          
          TSU'TEY LEADS the attack on the first shuttle. Hunters jink
          and weave through WITHERING FIRE from the escort ships.
          
          GUNNERS with jerry-rigged gun mounts ride the broad backs of
          the shuttles, picking off banshees who get past the escort.
          
          TSU'TEY is RAKED by a burst from the dorsal gunners. His
          mount crumples, plummeting with a dying scream and --
          
          WE SPIRAL DOWN with him, the forest rushing up and --
          
          A BLINDING BLIZZARD of green as he tears downward, catching
          at leaves and vines. He SLAMS to the ground, badly injured.
          
          NEARBY, ampsuits and troopers advance across the forest
          floor, firing their cannons and flamethrowers. The GAU-90s
          rip the forest to shreds.
          
                                                                     136.
          
          
          
          Norm, firing as he retreats, is HIT. He collapses, his avatar
          body mortally wounded as --
          
          HYDRAULIC FEET approach, passing the bodies of direhorses and
          Na'vi hunters. Norm painfully tries to load another
          magazine, panting in fear and pain as --
          
          AN AMPSUIT stomps up.    Aims its cannon point blank. B-BLAM!
          
          INT. SHACK
          
          The top of Norm's LINK bangs open. He reels out, collapsing
          onto the floor, clutching himself as if he can still feel the
          pain of death.
          
          He sits, huddled, shivering -- crazed.
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST
          
          TSU'TEY lies gasping, mortally injured. He looks up,
          grimacing, as an ampsuit looms over him.
          
          LYLE WAINFLEET reaches down and grabs Tsu'tey by his queue,
          lifting him painfully.
          
                                 WAINFLEET
                       I hear this is worse than death for you,
                       chief.
          
          WAINFLEET cuts Tsu'tey's queue off near the base. TSU'TEY
          SCREAMS in agony, his nervous system exploding on overload.
          Grinning, Lyle holds up the queue -- Tsu'tey's only
          connection to the world-consciousness which is his life.
          
          NEYTIRI -- bleeding, bruised -- staggers amid burning
          wreckage. AMPSUIT footsteps approach and she crouches behind
          a tree. Troopers are seconds from seeing her as --
          
          NEYTIRI knocks an arrow to HER FATHER'S BOW, and readies
          herself for a last kamikaze shot when --
          
          THE TROOPER on the far right of the firing line sees
          something on his screens.
          
                                 TROOPER
                       Right flank -- something's coming!   It's
                       all lit up out there.
          
          The troopers become aware of the GROUND SHAKING. A slow
          building thunderous ROAR and --
          
          AN AMPSUIT comes FLYING out of the trees, cartwheeling past
          them, and the SHAKING BUILDS --
          
                                                                      137.
          
          
          
          EXT. WELL OF SOULS
          
          Mo'at opens her eyes in sudden realization as --
          
          EXT. FOREST
          
          The troopers pivot to face --
          
          A WALL OF CHARGING HAMMERHEADS CRASHING out of the foliage in
          a shower of broken branches as --
          
          THE TROOPERS open fire but -- the stampede drives over them
          like a wave. Tree-trunk feet shatter the ampsuit cockpits.
          Troopers are crushed or asphyxiated.
          
          NEARBY the foot-soldiers see LIVING SHADOWS flow out of the
          gloom as --
          
          VIPERWOLVES race among them with flashing jaws. The troopers
          FIRE wildly as they go down, hitting each other as much as
          their attackers.
          
          The survivors break and run as more viperwolves bound out of
          the shadows.
          
          JAKE BANKS, watching as HUNDREDS of rider-less WILD BANSHEES
          converge on Quaritch's ships. They literally darken the sky.
          
                              JAKE
                    What the hell -- ?
          
          The wild banshees wheel among the ships, ripping into them.
          
          ON JAKE -- slowly getting it.   EYWA is in the fight.
          
                              JAKE
                    WHOO-HOOOO!
          
          A GUNNER fires from the door of a Samson. There is a CRASH
          and the head of a BANSHEE lunges in the open door, jerking
          him out. Other banshees tear at the pilot's windshield.
          
          NEYTIRI watches in awe as the ground troops scatter in
          disarray. The viperwolves flash past her, ignoring her.
          
          She senses something and turns slowly to see --
          
          A THANATOR emerging from the smoke behind her. A glistening
          black demon. She stands paralyzed before its stygian gaze--
          
          -- and the thanator lowers itself, until its head is just
          above the ground. It holds that position -- waiting.
          
                                                                    138.
          
          
          
          Trembling, she approaches the waiting demon.
          
          EXT. FOREST
          
          A smoky hell. Fires burn all around. The troopers are
          disorganized, falling back. Shooting at shadows. Panicked
          yelling fills the comm freq.
          
          WAINFLEET and another AMPSUIT are charging together through
          the smoky gloom.
          
                              WAINFLEET
                    A and C squads -- rally at my pos.   I
                    want --
                        (screaming on the comm)
                    Who's screaming God damn it?!
          
                              TROOPER (ON RADIO)
                    We gotta get outta here! Whoever's in
                    charge, call for extraction!
          
                              WAINFLEET
                    Shutup you crybabies!
          
          SOMETHING slams into the other `suit, tackling it OUT OF
          FRAME. Wainfleet whirls to see his squad-mate missing. He
          moves through a screen of foliage to reveal --
          
          The AMPSUIT -- ripped open. Driver gone. Blood inside the
          cockpit. He WHIRLS at a sound in time to see --
          
          A THANATOR LEAPING straight at him -- WAINFLEET raises his
          cannon but--
          
          WHAM!! It's on him, slamming him to the ground. The cannon
          goes flying. He's face to face with its nightmare jaws,
          right outside his canopy--
          
          On its back is NEYTIRI, and it's a toss up which one looks
          more pissed off. The thanator rears back, muscles rippling
          as it poises to strike and --
          
          K-KRAAACKK! Slams its teeth right through his canopy.
          Wainfleet's SCREAM is brief.
          
          Neytiri's demon mount rears up and its triumphant ROAR echoes
          through the forest.
          
          INT. CORRIDOR
          
          Max runs down the hall, leading the other scientists.   He's
          yelling into an AIRCOM HANDSET --
          
                                                                   139.

                           (to the scientists)
                       Get in there. Barricade the door!
          
          INT. LINK ROOM
          
          The door is hurled open and the SCIENTISTS charge in.
          
          Science geeks barricade the door as AVATAR-DRIVERS scramble
          into their link units, pulling the clamshells down.
          
          INT. CORRIDOR
          
          Max checks the door is secure from his side then runs down a
          connecting corridor.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          EXT. SHACK
          
          HUMAN NORM emerges from the airlock, wearing breathing gear
          and carrying an AR. He stumbles, dazed, toward the battle.
          
          EXT. MOUNTAINS/ AERIAL
          
          JAKE SIGNALS and a formation of hunters rolls in, diving at
          the lead shuttle, which is already besieged by winged
          creatures.
          
          THE CARGO RAMP is the scene of a pitched battle. Na'vi
          hunters hurl themselves off their mounts in waves,
          overwhelming the troopers.
          
          HUNTERS are shot, falling out of the ship, as others fly in.
          They shoot arrows and spears from the end of the ramp, and
          troopers fall back deeper into the fuselage.
          
          The panicked CREW CHIEF slams a switch and the ramp begins to
          close, a second before he is cut down by a spear.
          
          JAKE'S LEONOPTERYX plummets at the shuttle from behind. He
          swoops down, flairs to reduce speed, rolls off his mount and
          lands, tumbling on the shuttle's broad back as --
          
          GUNNERS try to swing their guns toward him but he RAKES them
          with his AR, still running forward and --
          
          JAKE PULLS two grenades from his battle harness, yanking the
          pins out with his teeth. He hurls them down the intakes of
          the VTOL turbofans as --
          
          HIS LEONOPTERYX BANKS in a tight arc back toward him and --
          
                                                                      140.
          
          
          
          HE SPRINTS ON as the grenades EXPLODE, shattering the
          turbines, which riddle the fuselage with shrapnel and --
          
          JAKE LEAPS INTO SPACE, landing on the back of his mount and
          reconnecting. They flap away, gaining altitude as fire
          BLASTS out of the bottom of the shuttle.
          
          ON THE FLIGHT DECK, the pilot feels the ship dropping.
          
                               PILOT
                     Mains to a hundred percent!   Get me
                     airspeed!
          
          The pilot and copilot slam the throttle levers forward and --
          
          The FUSION ENGINES BLAZE, thrusting the shuttle forward.    It
          still falls, its remaining lift fans screaming, until --
          
          IT'S CLIPPING the tree tops when it gets enough translational
          lift to fly and --
          
          THE PILOT PULLS back on the stick, lifting the nose.
          
                               PILOT
                     We're good!
          
          BEHIND HIM, a surviving Na'vi hunter runs forward and --
          
          THOONK!   ARROWHEADS sprout from the pilots' necks and chests.
          
          THE SHUTTLE CLIMBS out of control, at full acceleration. It
          SLAMS into the underside of MONS Veritatis. It EXPLODES, and
          hundreds of tons of flaming debris drop back into the forest.
          
          ON THE FLIGHT DECK of the other SHUTTLE, the pilots watch the
          wreckage falling.
          
                               PILOT
                     Valkyrie Two is breaking off. And if any
                     of ya'll want to get off this piece of
                     shit planet, you better cover our ass,
                     `cause we're the only way back to orbit.
          
                               GUNSHIP PILOT
                     Roger that.
          
          FROM THE DRAGON COCKPIT Quaritch watches the shuttle bank
          away, with most of the remaining gunships following.
          
                               QUARITCH
                     Get back here you worthless pukes!
          
                                                                     141.
          
          
          
                              PILOT
                    Are we breaking off?
          
          Quaritch draws his pistol.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    What do you think?
          
          He is over the edge-- no logic in his brain now.   Only death.
          
          INT. OPS CENTER/CORRIDOR
          
          Techs and troopers crowd around consoles, listening to all
          the yelling and confusion as they try to plot the
          disintegrating battle.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                        (in growing alarm)
                    What the hell is going on out there?
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST
          
          Regular troopers and volunteers FLEE through the jungle,
          scrambling to board SAMSONS as they touch down.
          
          INT. DRAGON COCKPIT
          
          The pilot listens to comms from Hell's Gate.
          
                              PILOT
                    Sir, all ground units are falling back to
                    the LZ.
          
          Quaritch's jaw clenches.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Stay on target.
          
          EXT. WELL OF SOULS
          
          Mo'at LOOKS UP as the DRAGON appears over the trees like the
          shadow of Death. Around her, the Na'vi mothers clutch their
          children to them. We see AKWEY'S BOY among them.
          
          INT. DRAGON COCKPIT
          
          Quaritch sets the target cursor on the MOTHER TREE and what
          we recognize is the ghostly figure of Mo'at.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Switch missiles. Arm all pods.
          
                                                                      142.

                                QUARITCH
                      Let's see what these blue bastards do
                      when I bitch-slap their goddess.
          
          EXT. MOUNTAINS/ AERIAL
          
          JAKE'S LEONOPTERYX drops toward the Dragon like a Mig 29.     He
          pulls out, skimming over the ship. Uncoupling, he rolls
          backward off his mount and --
          
          JAKE HITS, skidding, on the hull of the Dragon. He rolls to
          his feet, already running as --
          
          QUARITCH sees the leonopteryx WHOOSH overhead and flap away
          with no rider. He snap-looks aft to see --
          
          JAKE SPRINTING along the spine of the ship, yanking two
          grenades from his battle-harness, pulling the pins with his
          teeth, then --
          
          QUARITCH's hand shoots out and SLAMS the pilot's CYCLIC STICK
          hard over. THE DRAGON lurches sideways, rolling sharply with
          a ROAR of protesting rotors and --
          
          JAKE IS FLUNG off his feet. The grenades miss the TURBINE
          INTAKES. One bounces off the ship. The other lodges against
          a cowling and --
          
          JAKE SLIDES OFF the ship, falling as -- K-BLAM! The grenade
          blows a two meter hole in the hull --
          
          WHOOOSHH!   Pandoran air swirls inside.
          
                                QUARITCH
                          (to the pilot)
                      Put your mask on.
          
          Quaritch leaps out of his seat, heading aft as --
          
          JAKE GRABS the edge of a weapons pod, his feet dangling over
          open space.
          
          HOLDING HIS BREATH, Quaritch blows a RESCUE HATCH and leans
          outside. Jake sees him aim his massive PISTOL.
          
          K-WHAM! K-WHAM! Rounds clang next to Jake's head. He LETS GO,
          plummeting into the trees --
          
          Jake plunges through jungle canopy. He catches a HUGE LEAF,
          as Neytiri taught him -- it bends down, breaking his fall --
          
                                                                     143.
          
          
          
          HE LETS GO, dropping again only to catch ANOTHER LEAF, and
          then another, and --
          
          WE RUSH DOWN with him through this green blur.   Jake drops to
          the ground in a feral crouch. Unhurt.
          
                              JAKE
                        (into his headset)
                    Quaritch is gonna take out the Well of
                    Souls! He's got a clear shot. Hit him,
                    anybody that can! Do it now!
          
          IN HER SAMSON Trudy Chacon is all business.
          
                              TRUDY
                    On it.
          
          SHE BANKS hard, pulling g's, coming around on the Dragon.
          She pours on the coal and the Samson leaps forward, straight
          at the WARSHIP.
          
          QUARITCH, DRILLS a stream of tracers at her, tearing through
          her canopy, ripping chunks off her fuselage.
          
          IN THE JUNGLE BELOW, Norm watches her kamikaze run --
          
                              NORM
                    No!
          
                              TRUDY
                        (clipped, pilot-like)
                    Norm, I love you.
          
          TRUDY DIVES, raking through treetops and then, at the last
          instant, YANKS BACK on the stick and --
          
          THE SAMSON leaps straight up and -- K-KRASH!! SHEARS OFF THE
          COCKPIT of the Dragon as --
          
          QUARITCH THROWS HIMSELF aft along the aisle and --
          
          TRUDY'S SAMSON disintegrates, the wreckage burning as it
          tumbles into the jungle.
          
          MILES QUARITCH grips the bulkhead as he stares out the open
          front of the fuselage. Wind howls through wreckage where the
          pilot used to be. The forest rushes up to meet him and --
          
          THE DRAGON CRASHES through splintering trees, IMPACTING in a
          lake with a WHITE BLAST of water.
          
                                                                      144.
          
          
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST - DAY
          
          Norm takes a few steps and drops to his knees.    Imploded by
          grief.
          
          INT. OPS CENTER/ HELL'S GATE
          
          ON THE PLOTTING DISPLAY as Quaritch's TRANSPONDER ICON
          disappears.
          
                                TROOPER
                      Dragon is down. It's off the board.
          
                                SELFRIDGE
                      What do you mean, off the board?!
          
          Selfridge is stunned.    Suddenly the ROAR of an ENGINE makes
          them all look up.
          
          OUTSIDE THE WINDOW, MAX sits in the cab of an enormous SLASH-
          CUTTER. Max flips Selfridge the bird and pushes a lever
          forward --
          
                                 SELFRIDGE
                      Oh shit.
          
          Selfridge DIVES as --
          
          K-RASHHHHH! The SPINNING TEETH of the SLASH-CUTTER tear
          through the window in a blast of glass and lethal air. Alarms
          go off. The technicians dive for cover in a blizzard of
          glass and shredded debris.
          
          The slash-cutter head pulls back, and AVATARS SCRAMBLE
          through the gaping hole into the Ops Center --
          
          The TROOPERS look up to see blue giants aiming weapons down
          at them. The battle is over in seconds. The avatars are
          holding the Ops Center.
          
          Selfridge lies there gasping, in his emergency mask.   In
          shock. How could this be happening?
                                                                   CUT TO:
          
          EXT. LAKE
          
          THE DRAGON lies half submerged. Out of the water FG, a shape
          rises -- a AMPSUIT. Inside -- MILES QUARITCH, his face
          bloody, his eyes burning.
          
          He slogs out of the water, covered with mud, then strides
          into the forest.
          
                                                                      145.
          
          
          
          QUARITCH'S AMPSUIT THUDS relentlessly through the jungle.    He
          sees something through the foliage ahead -- the SHACK.
          
          INSIDE THE SHACK Jake is oblivious under the link. Through a
          window we see Quaritch's AMPSUIT step into the clearing.
          
          QUARITCH levels his GAU-90 at the shack. His finger goes to
          the firing button--
          
          WHAM!! A six-legged BLACK DEMON tackles him.
          
          Quaritch pivots as he falls, FIRING the cannon. It misses
          Neytiri by inches. He grapples with the THANATOR as its
          razor claws SCREECH over his metal armor.
          
          THE TITANS twist and struggle. QUARITCH UNLEASHES a long
          burst from the cannon. Rounds tear into the creature, which
          SHRIEKS but --
          
          NEYTIRI wills it to SMASH the cannon hard against a rock,
          tearing it loose from the `suit's hand but --
          
          Quaritch SLAMS the thanator back against a tree-trunk, almost
          crushing Neytiri.
          
          CLOSE ON one hydraulic hand, as it draws the `suit's KNIFE
          and --
          
          QUARITCH TWISTS violently, ramming the knife up under the
          thanator's chest armor. The creature ROARS and Quaritch flips
          on top of it, stabbing.
          
          QUARITCH STABS DOWN AGAIN. The thanator slumps, pinning
          Neytiri's legs under its great bulk. She is trapped.
          
          Quaritch looks down at Neytiri. She glares back at him,
          panting, scared but defiant.
          
                              JAKE (O.S.)
                    It's all over Quaritch --
          
          Quaritch turns, seeing Jake DROPPING from a tree limb. The
          `suit rises slowly, knife glinting in the morning sun.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Nothing's over while I'm breathing.
          
                              JAKE
                    Kinda hoped you'd say that.
          
          QUARITCH SURGES forward. JAKE closes fast, snatching up the
          broken CANNON as --
          
                                                                      146.
          
          
          
          Quaritch SLASHES DOWN with the knife and Jake parries,
          blocking it with the cannon. He CLOSES faster than the suit
          can move and --
          
          K-CRACK! -- SLAMS the end of the cannon into the canopy,
          crazing it with a web of cracks as QUARITCH SLICES air with
          the huge knife. Jake ducks, coming up to meet the next slash
          and --
          
          SMASHES the knife hand with the cannon once -- twice -- again
          -- in a furious attack -- knocking the knife flying.
          
          QUARITCH catches him with the other arm, hurling him away.
          Jake rolls just before --
          
          THUDDD! -- the massive foot stomps down where he just was. He
          scrambles up as Quaritch CHARGES and --
          
          JAKE DUCKS another round-house, LEAPING forward to smash the
          canopy again -- then again -- until it is WHITE with cracks.
          Quaritch manages to GRAB the cannon barrel but --
          
          INSIDE THE COCKPIT, he sees nothing but the sun on the
          shattered glass. HE HURLS the cannon blindly, but Jake ducks.
          The massive cylinder cartwheels toward the shack and --
          
          FROM INSIDE we see it CRASH against pressure window, crazing
          it but not penetrating. Jake's link sits just inside.
          
          INSIDE THE COCKPIT, Quaritch yanks a yellow handle and --
          
          P-FOOM! -- the canopy BLOWS OFF, flying through the air.
          Quaritch can see again. He dons his breathing mask. Bends to
          pick up his KNIFE.
          
          NEARBY NEYTIRI struggles furiously, trying to get her legs
          free from underneath three tons of thanator.
          
          QUARITCH, panting, glowers at Jake.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    How does it feel to betray your own race?
          
          Then, inexplicably, he TURNS.   Walks away.
          
          FROM INSIDE the shack, we see him charge straight toward us
          and --
          
          CRASH! -- he puts his hydraulic fist right through the
          window. He is reaching inside for the Link when --
          
          JAKE HITS in a flying tackle with every ounce of force he
          has, knocking the ampsuit sideways and --
          
                                                                      147.
          
          
          
          JAKE REACHES around the suit, grabbing Quaritch's shoulder
          and, yanks him forward HARD, SMASHING his face into the edge
          of the cockpit but --
          
          QUARITCH flings him off with a sweep of his arm, and Jake
          slams to the ground.
          
          INSIDE THE LINK Jake is holding his breath as the toxic
          Pandoran air swirls in. GAS ALARMS SHRIEK.
          
          NEYTIRI shoves with one free leg, desperately trying to pull
          her other leg out.
          
          THE AMPSUIT charges, the knife flashing down and --
          
          JAKE just manages to catch it in both hands, but the force of
          the attack drives him to his knees as --
          
          QUARITCH pushes the knife down inexorably, until Jake is
          pinned against a rock, the blade now inches from his throat.
          
          INSIDE THE LINK Jake is straining to stay conscious, to stay
          connected as --
          
          THE KNIFE reaches his throat as --
          
          THWAP! AN ARROW APPEARS in Quaritch's chest.   He looks up.
          
          NEYTIRI STANDS -- a FURY released. A classic archer figure,
          she NOCKS another arrow. Then draws and releases smoothly.
          
          TH-WHAP! The machine TOPPLES off Jake and lies still.
          
          QUARITCH STARES at the two arrows in his chest. He touches
          the feathers of the ancient weapon, then -- with an ironic
          laugh -- he dies.
          
          NEYTIRI runs up, another arrow nocked, bow drawn. Seeing
          Quaritch, she lowers her father's bow.
          
          JAKE sees her, then goes limp, his eyes rolling back, and --
          
          INT. SHACK
          
          HUMAN JAKE EXPLODES out of the Link, slamming to the floor
          where he gags for breath. With his last strength, he claws
          toward an emergency breathing mask -- across the room.
          
          He scrambles toward it, on the edge of unconsciousness.
          
          NEYTIRI VAULTS through the shattered window, landing in the
          debris like a cat. She GRABS the mask and flashes to Jake's
          side -- puts the mask over his face and --
          
                                                                    148.
          
          
          
          JAKE drags in breath after breath. He looks up at Neytiri,
          studying him as she holds him -- seeing his human body for
          the first time.
          
          Jake touches her face, his pale human hand against the blue
          of her skin. There eyes meet across the glass of the mask --
          together, separate. Worldless.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST - DAY
          
          MO'AT tends to the mortally wounded TSU'TEY as AVATAR JAKE
          arrives with Neytiri. Mo'at has bound his wounds, but by her
          expression, it is clear he cannot be saved.
          
          Jake kneels and Tsu'tey opens his eyes.   Through a haze of
          pain, he recognizes Jake.
          
                              TSU'TEY
                        (NA'VI)
                    I See you, Jakesully.
          
                              JAKE
                    I See you, Tsu'tey te Rongloa Ateyitan.
          
                              TSU'TEY
                    Are the people safe?
          
                              JAKE
                    They're safe.
          
          Tsu'tey weakly clutches his severed queue.
          
                               TSU'TEY
                    I can never ride again, or bond with my
                    woman -- or hear the voice of Eywa. I can
                    not lead the People. You will lead them,
                    Jakesully.
          
                              JAKE
                    No. I'm not officer material.
          
                              TSU'TEY
                    It is decided. Now do the duty of
                    Olo'eyctan. Set my spirit free.
          
                              JAKE
                    I'm not killing you.
          
                              TSU'TEY
                    I am already dead.
          
                                                                     149.
          
          
          
                              JAKE
                    No.
          
                              TSU'TEY
                    It is the way. And it is good. I will be
                    remembered --
          
          Tsu'tey's voice is weak, but thick with emotion.
          
                              TSU'TEY
                    -- I fought with Toruk Macto, we were
                    brothers -- and he was my last shadow.
          
          TSU'TEY'S HAND clasps with Jake's in a fierce grip. Jake
          draws his knife.
          
          TSU'TEY'S POV -- Jake leans forward, blocking the sun.
          HIS SHADOW falls across Tsu'tey.
          
                              JAKE
                        (NA'VI)
                    Forgive me, my Brother. Go now to the
                    Mother Spirit.
          
          By his movement, we know that he has ended Tsu'tey's pain.
          Jake's eyes well with tears as he continues reciting the
          prayer for the dead, and his Na'vi words carry over as we --
                                                             DISSOLVE TO:
          
          EXT. HELL'S GATE -DAY
          
          Na'vi ride direhorses among the abandoned machines of Hell's
          Gate.
          
          Banshees roost on the roofs of the modules, and stingbats
          flutter about, unimpeded. The SENTRY GUNS are silent, and
          the GATES are open to the forest.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    A few chose to stay. Fewer were chosen.
          
          Max, Norm, and a few of the avatars hold AR's as the
          personnel of Hell's Gate file up the cargo ramp of the
          remaining shuttle. The evicted humans are sullen and angry,
          like POW's.
          
          JAKE and NEYTIRI stand together, watching the departure of
          the Sky People.
          
          PARKER SELFRIDGE shuffles up the ramp. His eyes -- the eyes
          of a lost soul -- meet JAKE'S. He disappears into the ship.
                                                                 CUT TO:

          EXT. SPACE
          
          ISV VENTURE STAR hangs suspended against the dark side of
          PANDORA. The ISV's antimatter engines BLAZE to life and it
          accelerates out of orbit.
          
          What remains IN FRAME is a virgin, primeval world. Spanning
          the black continents is a vast reticulated lace-work of
          BIOLUMINESCENCE -- a ghostly WEB connecting all of Pandora.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST - DAY
          
          The sun's rays shaft down through the layers of canopy.
          
                                 JAKE (V.O.)
                       The forest will heal, and so will the
                       hearts of the People. New life keeps the
                       energy flowing, like the breath of the
                       world.
          
          NEYTIRI, obviously pregnant, is bow-fishing in the shallows.
          Children jump and squeal with laughter in the river.
          
                                 JAKE (V.O.)
                       This is my last videolog.
          
          INT. LINK ROOM
          
          VIDEO IMAGE -- Jake sits in a chair, talking straight TO
          CAMERA. He is thin, pale. He looks around the high tech room.
          
                                 JAKE
                       The science guys will keep the lights on,
                       here. But I won't miss this place.
          
          EXT. WELL OF SOULS - NIGHT
          
          THE WILLOWS glow softly. The entire Omaticaya clan is
          gathered, seated in a prayer circle around the Mother Tree.
          
                                 JAKE (V.O.)
                       I better wrap this up. There's a funeral
                       tonight, and I don't want to be late. It
                       was someone very close to me.
          
          WIDE SHOT, moving in across the concentric rings of people,
          all plugged-in and softly chanting. MOVING toward the
          center, over the figure of Mo'at, to hover above --
          
          NEYTIRI, kneeling beside two FIGURES on the dais --
          
                                                                     151.
          
          
          
          JAKE and his AVATAR lie head to head. Human Jake is wearing
          an exomask. Both figures are still, hands folded, covered in
          translucent silken shrouds of ROOT-CILIA.
          
          CAMERA CLOSES IN as Neytiri removes the mask from Jake's
          human face. She gently closes his dead eyes with her
          fingertips. Then bends and kisses him.
          
          MOVE INTO CU on AVATAR JAKE as Neytiri's hand comes into
          frame, stroking his cheek. TIGHTENING slowly to--
          
          ECU JAKE'S EYES. Hold a beat, then --
          
          They open.

					THE AVENGERS



				Screenplay by Don Macpherson



























					June 21, 1995







1	BLUE SKY WITH CLOUDS

	PAN DOWN to reveal:


2	EXT - SALTFLATS - DAY

	A flat horizon, stretching to infinity.

	A 360 degree pan reveals: nothing.  Deserted, no hiding places.  No animals, no
	humans, no objects.  Except in mid distance --


3	RED PHONE BOX

	brightly painted, traditional, comforting, belongs in a village green.  Perfectly
	ordinary -- except for its location.

	Silence.  Only the wind over the plain.  Except --

	The PHONE RINGS.

	RING-RING ... a mellow, old-fashioned tone.  We wait for someone to answer it.  But
	of course nothing and nobody for miles.  Except --


4	IN DISTANCE

	a CAR ENGINE ... A puff of smoke on the horizon ... VA-VA-VOOM of high geared
	acceleration, as INTO VIEW

	ZOOM! --


5	CAR	

	speeding like a bullet.  Driven at maximum, breakneck speed, 125 mph.  A petite open
	top '65 Lotus Elan, all streamlined curves, full throttle, it nears the phone box, and --

	SCREECHES to a halt.

	Dust clears, ENGINE NOISE FADES.  From the seat, hops --


6	KINKY BOOT

	in black leather.

	Buckled.  Strap at ankle.  Crunching into the ground.
	PAN UP TO:


7	BEAUTIFUL WOMAN

	late 20's.  In CLOSEUPS of -- Tight black leather catsuit.  A flash of auburn hair. 
	Black leather like a second skin.  Smoothed over legs, thighs.  Buckled at wrists, straps
	at ankles, zips --

	Pulled up over flesh.  This is EMMA PEEL, scientist.  Sexual, invulnerable, cool.  Very
	cool.  She locks up at clouds in the sky.  Then steps across to the phone box.  Picks up
	the phone.

					EMMA
			How now brown cow ...
				(pause)
			The rain in Spain falls mainly
			on the plain ...
				(pause)
			The quick brown fox jumped over
			the lazy --

	From the receiver, an irritated official voice.

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Password affirmative. Thank you,
			Doctor.

	Emma puts down receiver.  Hangs a cardboard outside the phone box.  Then presses
	button bakelite box.

	A second's wait.  A coin from the slot.  Then a HUM as --


8	INSIDE PHONE BOX

	the floor lowers automatically.  Emma disappears.  Hanging outside the box, a notice
	now reads "Out of Order."

	Next to the call box we notice a sign: an arrow pointing into the desert:  "London 84
	miles."


9	INT.  LABORATORY

	underground.  Emma descends on the lift platform; steps into a research lab in retro hi
	tech.  Walks past assistants, down long pink and orange steel corridors, Werner von
	Braun goes disco.  Nears a door, marked:  "Prospero Project -- Authorized Personnel
	Only." Logo with lightning emerging from a cloud.


10      FROM AIRLOCK DOOR

	A man enters, older.  In matching leather suit: like an astronaut.  Early 40's, handsome,
	charismatic, with swept-back silver-black hair.  His name tag: DR. PETER PEEL.

					PETER
			Ready, darling?

	Peter fixes her name tag: DR. EMMA PEEL; runs a finger down over her breast.  She
	smiles.

					EMMA
			Ready as I'll ever be ...

	Mutual erotic, intellectual attraction.  Peter takes her hand and they walk down:


11      LONG CORRIDOR

	air-lock doors: a series of sealed chambers inside a hitech Labyrinth --

	A man joins them.  A shyer, bespectacled, less handsome version of Peter.  On his name
	tag: DR. VALENTINE PEEL -- brother and partner.

	In b.g., a countdown starts, ECHOING thru the lab

					VALENTINE
			Atmospheric pressure checked, antenna ready... 
			Thermal chamber ready ... Compression module 
			set ... Temperature control on course between 
			one and one forty ... Water turbulence steady ...

					PETER
			Anything else?

	Valentine smiles, shrugs --

					VALENTINE
			Good luck ... Peter ... Emma.

					EMMA
			Thanks, Valentine ...

	Emma gives him a quick peck on the cheek.

	A shy look from Valentine at Emma.  Peter senses

					PETER
			Just a minute, darling. My brother's a 
			worry wart. I better have a word ...
			Valentine --

	Peter takes Valentine over to one side.  Emma checks gauges and dials.  Behind her a
	conversation.  Peter returns.

	He takes a ring from his finger --


12      CLOSEUP - DIAMOND GEM

	on a gold ring.


13      BACK TO SCENE

	He slips it onto her finger.

					PETER
			Something to remember me by.

	Peter smiles.  The remark strikes Emma as curious.  But no time to query.  She smiles
	back.  He gives her a kiss --

					PETER
				(checks his watch)
			See you in an hour ...

					EMMA
			One sunny day ...

	The countdown ECHOES around them as they separate.


14      IN DISTANCE

	Valentine watches her.


15      INT.  LAB CHAMBER

	Inside a bed of ice, Emma is lowered by hydraulic machine into a steel radioactive
	thermal chamber, glowing eerily blue

	The effect is very cold.  Frozen.  Numb.  Like a sci-fi Sleeping Beauty, beauty
	entombed and sealed in a glass coffin.  Plunged down into a vault.  Opposite her --

	In another glass coffin, Peter Peel, is lowered down.


16      FROM EMMA'S POV

	The sound of their HEARTBEATS.  Their BREATHING.  BLEEP and PULSE OF
	ELECTRONICS.  Thru glass and leather.  Like cerebral sex.  Technological, erotic.
	Peter winks at her -- Emma locks longingly at him, as --


17      UP IN CONTROL ROOM

	Valentine watches behind glass.  Like a kid excluded from a bedroom.  He attends to
	dials.  And to his female assistant --

					VALENTINE
				(thrilled)
			Readings still normal ...

	The assistant smiles oddly.  FOCUS ON --

	An insignia tattooed on her neck: "X404."  A replicant.
	They monitor screens.  A DULL HUM.


18      EXT.  SALTFLATS - DAY

	A weather antenna emerges from the ground:  an enigmatic phallic silver blob, like a
	Koons sculpture.  The sun glints off it ...


19      DOWN BELOW

	A temperature gauge rises.

	The ice is infused with pulsating colors: purple -- blue -- green -- red.  Starts to heat
up     as if --

	It soaks up temperature:  from cold to hot in instants.


20      CLOSEUP - WHITE GLOVED HAND ON DIAL

	"CUMULUS COLLECTOR." The graphs accelerate, but over the dull HUM -- a
	MURMUR, a BREATH.  As Emma's HEARTBEAT rises

	The gloved  hand turns up the dial, past a red danger mark.

	Suddenly a BLIP.  Something wrong.


21      DOWN IN HIS VAULT

	Peter Peel's "coffin" starts to overheat. Peter reacts --

					PETER
				(intercom cutting out)
			Losing control -- malfunction
			in thermal chamber -- for Christ's
			-- Emm --!


22      IN CONTROL ROOM

	Needles push off the dials, as --

	The ice swells: strange mix of colors, absorbing heat and energy in clusters of molten
	metal ... steam and sparks ignite ... Valentine's eyes widen in alarm ...

					COUNTDOWN (V.O.)
			Five -- four --  three -- two --
			one ... Three -- two -- one ...
				(repeating)
			Three -- two -- one ...


23      INSIDE COFFIN

	Peter's glass cracks

	The emergency light goes on -- the ALARM sounds -- lab assistants running ...


24      IN HER COFFIN

	Emma realizes; looks to Peter --


25      EXT.  SALTFLATS - DAY

	The "Koons" antenna is drawing a strange purple cloud towards it, from otherwise blue
	sky ... siphoning the purple atmosphere down itself into


26      INT.  CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Thru the air ducts the purple cloud starts to billow ... Panic stations! Valentine looks
	aghast at the graphs:  all systems fucked, over the intercom --

					VALENTINE
			Emma, Peter, get out! It's going to explode!

	FROM Valentine's anguished face TO Emma's face, as

					VALENTINE
			Emma ...


27      FROM HER VAULT

	Emma undoes the straps, clambers out of her pod


28      ANGLE (IN DREAMLIKE SLOW MOTION)

	Emma clambers onto her husband's pod -- in a sequence eternally replayed for her as a
	nightmare --


29      BACK TO SCENE

					VALENTINE
			Get out! Leave him -- ! Emma!


30      RAPID INTERCUTS

	The purple smoke enveloping Peter's	pod, soft caresses -- Peter struggling within,
	looking at Emma --

					EMMA
			Peter!

	Her leatherclad limbs straddled over his glass coffin.  Her HEARTBEAT sounds ... She
	grabs, claws on glass --

	Her fist draws back, blam! blam! blam! three deadly blows, Emma SMASHES the pod
	cover, it --

	Cracks -- splinters -- not breaking -- obscuring his face inside like a spider's web, as
	behind her

					VALENTINE
			Don't wait for him -- he's not --

	Breathless, blood smeared on glass, Emma's gashed fist bleeds thru torn leather glove --
	twisted mass of flesh and glass -- GROWLING sound growing as:


31      ABOVE GROUND

	The voluminous purple cloud being sucked by the antenna...!


32      CLOSEUP ON EMMA'S DIAMOND RING

	gleaming thru a tear of blood as she pounds the glass --


33      BACK TO SCENE

					PETER

			Emma ... Emma ...

	As a GROWLING sound grows till

	BOOM!  An EXPLOSION rocks the vault -- flames burst out -- sound and vision
	separate -- Emma hears explosion as a slow moving tear thru her psyche.  A trauma.


34      ANGLE (IN EXTREME SLOW MOTION)	

	The blast flings Emma back thru space, flying unconscious as if in a dream, floating
	backwards in --

	A milky way op-art swirl of glass and steel fragments, now -- out of control,
	weightless, powerless, as --

	The background of sealed doors, white corridors all vanish. A spinning, black void
	opens up behind her, as her eyes shut, head falls back --

	An orgasmic, dream of near-death, as a CRASH OF MUSIC BEGINS a hip new
	version of the "AVENGERS" THEME TUNE --

	CREDITS SEQUENCE.


35      SERIES OF SHOTS

	In stark silhouette  The swishing of a bowler hat spinning thru space
	
	An umbrella tossed in the air, flicked like a deadly weapon --

	A rich velvety feel, key colors black/white/red.  Dandyish and erotic followed by blasts
	of violence, dreamy op-art puzzles and psychedelic patterns over --

	A sensuous BLACK, background -- slowly revealed to be a woman's leather-clad 
	body --

	In silhouette -- A bowler hatted man, Steed, a catsuited woman Emma.  Flashes of: 
	hair -- eye -- a red rose -- in bloom -- petals folding and unfolding, then tightly shut.

	A thorned stem, sharp to the touch --

	FROM black and white INTO color -- leather Background metamorphosing into black
	and white of a chessboard as ...

	A medieval knight moves around its queen in a formal dance --

	A fetishistic attention to detail: leather catsuit, swish of legs, boots ... hair tossed
	back - - red nails over black ... creamy white skin ... zips ...

	A silhouetted man in bowler hat in Savile Row suit -- old Etonian knotted tie --
	umbrella stabs like a sword --

	Umbrella with knotted stems of a rose furling round -- then a tear, gash -- rose cut and
	tossed into --

	His lapel. Until, at the end: together in silhouette.
	Bowler hat thrown, skimming, swishing thru air, until --

	Now only a single HEARTBEAT ... BA-BOOM ... BA-BOOM ...
	Then --

	PISTOL SHOTS OVER as:


36      INT.  EMMA'S BEDROOM - PRE-DAWN

	A gasp as Emma wakes abruptly from her nightmare, years later, startled by the shots,
	naked beneath satin sheets.  Her HEARTBEAT FADES as she looks around her Klaus
	Oldenberg room, vinyl comforter, satin sheets.  A toss of her hair.

	Looks more mature. Sexual, haunted. Mrs. Emma Peel -- widow.

	Same every night.  Next to the clock, a framed photo of her dead husband, Peter Peel.
	From outside ANOTHER SHOT ...

	Emma flings on a satin robe, goes to the window and sees --


37      HER POV

	a CAR zooooming past, its bowler-hatted driver racing thru early morning streets.  The
	damn thing BACKFIRES again ...


38      BACK TO SCENE

	Emma frowns, annoyed.


39      EXT.  STREETS - DAWN

	Zoom!  The sleek, sporty black Jaguar SS100 burns down deserted streets.  Inside is a
	bowler-hatted man --

	JOHN STEED, late 30's.  Handsome English gent, roguish looks, dandy's clothes.  A
	Beau Brummel figure in a Savile Row suit, velvet collar, embroidered waistcoat.
	A debonair Etonian, Steed oozes charm, wit and - when he chooses to -- hard-edged,
	steely menace.  He drives through --

40      LONDON (1999)

	This is 'Avengersland': a parallel world painted by Rene Magritte, forever England.
	Bright pinks, greens and reds, an imperial city in final decadent bloom.  White stucco
	buildings. Regency style in candy colors.  A surreally 90's city like a hipper, edgier
	version of the 60's preserved in aspic, where --

	Over the RADIO, a plummy voice:

					ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			... The War Office today approved military 
			expenditure for the nation's new defense alert 
			system. A spokesman  said he would raise the 
			matter at the forthcoming World  Council of 
			Ministers, but that a state of vigilance was 
			still necessary in the uncertain climate.

	As Steed turns into a mews, we realize that in this kinky, pop world, ordinary life does
	not intrude.  No traffic.  No extras.  Nothing to spoil the view.

	As the radio continues with a weather forecast, Steed --


41      EXT.  STEED'S GARAGE - DAWN	

	Steed's car enters his garage -- Door closes as --


42      INT.  STEED'S FLAT - DAWN

	but the curtains are still drawn so the place is dark.

	A large bachelor's den.  Dark wood, leather armchairs ...

	Steed enters his library from a concealed door --
	Titles on wine and birdwatching.  He clicks the door, goes to his drinks cabinet. Pours
	a brandy.  Hears a noise ...

	Instantly on guard.  In his glass, sees a shadowy reflection move.  Steed peers 'round a
	corner.  Sees a silhouetted figure stand over his desk -- a burglar?
	Steed sneaks up behind -- raises his umbrella, and --

	Crack!  Brings the umbrella down -- on the suspect's head.  Who manages to dodge,
	swivel 'round, and --

	Bam!  Delivers an expert blow to Steed's stomach.  A rapid exchange of blows.  Steed
	recoils, about to jab the umbrella, when --

	His assailant about to deliver a kick to his crotch -- Steed covers the area -- bam! a
	spiked heel hits his bowler -- as the curtains are drawn back, light floods in -- they
	freeze.

	Steed knows his opponent:  a lethal blonde in red leather.

					STEED
			Brenda -- ?


43      FROM ABOVE HIM

	a voice --

					MOTHER (O.S.)
			Steed -- ?!


44      BACK TO SCENE

	Steed swivels 'round to face -- upside down -- a man hanging like a bat from the ceiling
	inches before him --

	Pommaded hair, fat, dandyish:  MOTHER, head of secret services; hands of extendable
	metal hooks.  And BRENDA, his beautiful leather-clad bodyguard.  Who smiles
	seductively.

					STEED
			Mother. I thought you were burglars.

					MOTHER
			Brenda and I thought we'd drop in.

	Mother suits action to the word, drops into his wheelchair.

					BRENDA
			See how you're getting on ...

					STEED
			Something in the wind?

	Mother wheels himself from the study.  Taps a barometer.  It whirls around.

					MOTHER
			Weather's turning nasty.

					STEED
			You didn't come to talk about the
			weather, surely.

					MOTHER
			Oh yes I did. I want you to meet
			somebody.
				(off Steed's look)
			I expect you'll like her.

	Brenda coolly files her nails.  A flash of jealousy.

					STEED
			'Her'?


45      INT.  EMMA'S FLAT (PRIMROSE HILL) - DAY

	A groovy penthouse (a Lichtenstein come to life?).  Bach PIANO MUSIC floats in the
	air.

	Hands gliding over keys, Emma Peel plays with virtuoso skill.  On the piano, a framed
	picture of her late husband.  And a photo of Emma between Peter and Valentine.

	A KNOCK.  Emma gets up, goes to the door.  The MUSIC KEEPS PLAYING, keys
	jumping up and down automatically, as --


46      AT DOOR

	Emma flicks open a large automated eye.  Peers thru.  Opens


47      IN CORRIDOR

	A MESSENGER (distinctive outfit) hands over a package tied in a bow.

					MESSENGER
			Dr. Peel?

					EMMA
			Thank you ...

	Emma shuts the door.  Unties the bow, opens up  Finds an embossed card:

					EMMA
				(reads)
			'Please answer the Telephone.'

	Emma looks: The phone sits there.

	Just then ... RING-RING.  Emma goes over, picks up the phone.  A recorded message,
	an upper-class woman's voice:

					WOMAN (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Boodles Club, the Mall, 2:30 p.m.
			Mr. John Steed ... Boodles Club,
			the Mall, 2:30 p.m. Mr. John
			Steed ...

	BEEP.  The phone goes dead.  Emma opens up the case.  Unveils a brace of kippers.
	Puzzled, she holds up a fish.

					EMMA
			Kippers ...?


48      EXT.  BOODLE-S CLUB (PALL MALL) - DAY

	Near the Mall, outside white stucco buildings, a Lotus Elan pulls up and parks as a car
	conveniently leaves, cutting off another angry CAR.  HONK!  A dash clock says 2:15.
	Out gets --

	-- Emma Peel, different attire.  She climbs steps.  On a brass plaque, "Boodles
	Gentlemen's Club."  She goes in, passing --

	-- an astonished uniformed commissionaire.


49      INT.  BOODLES' LOBBY - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	A PORTER approaches her, equally surprised.

					PORTER
			May I help you, madam ...

					EMMA
			Mr. John Steed, please.

					PORTER
			I'm afraid that's impossible.

					EMMA
			Impossible?

	The Porter points to a notice:  "No non-members.  No animals.  No women."

					PORTER
			You are female?

					EMMA
			As you see.

					PORTER
			Then you can't come in.

					EMMA
			I have an appointment.

					PORTER
			No women. Not in Boodles. Not
			since 1922.

					EMMA
			Really -- what happened in 1922?

	Bored, Emma breezes past, already inside the hall.  Old mahogany, portraits of dead
	politicians, leather chairs.  A male enclave.

	The Porter rushes up to restrain her.

	Hardly missing a step, Emma lays a gentle hand on his shoulder -- finds the nerve ends. 
	The Porter winces and --

					EMMA
			Thank you so much. I can find Mr.
			Steed myself ...

	-- collapses on the ground in agony.  Emma ignores him.  Pushes thru double doors,
	upstairs, statues of naked bronze warriors frown down on her, into


50      INT.  BOODLES - TURKISH BATHS - DAY

	Thru a cloud of steam in an oriental room

	Steed sits naked save for a towel.  He hears a disturbance, thru the mist, sees --

	Emma before him.  Automatically, Steed dons his bowler and tips it in her direction.

					STEED
			Doctor Peel, I presume?

					EMMA
			And you must be Steed. Please
			don't get up.

	He doesn't.  HISSING STEAM between them as they study.

					STEED
			I was about to throw in the towel.

					EMMA
			I had a spot of bother at the door.

					STEED
			I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman
			inside Boodles since --

					EMMA
			1922. Why the kippers?

					STEED
			Red herring would have been too
			obvious, don't you think?

					EMMA
				(looks around)
			So what was all this -- some sort
			of test?

					STEED
			Congratulations, you've penetrated a 
			bastion of male privilege. I guessed 
			you weren't a stickler for Tradition, 
			doctor.

					EMMA
			Whereas you are.

					STEED
			Dyed in the wool. But I can admire 
			someone who doesn't play by the 
			rules.

					EMMA
			Rules are made to be broken.

					STEED
			Not by me. Play by the rules,
			Doctor, or the game is nothing.

					EMMA
			And just what is the game?

					STEED
			I say, this is all terribly formal.  
			Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel?

					EMMA
				(re:  the steamroom) 
			Under the circumstances, you may 
			call me Mrs. Peel.

					STEED
			Much better.

					EMMA
			And now that we've settled the matter 
			of honorifics, will you kindly explain 
			why you wished me to meet you?

					STEED
			I didn't. Mother did.

					EMMA
			Mother?

	Steed steps closer, smiling.

					STEED
			I expect you'll like him.

	Off Emma's reaction --


51      EXT.  THAMES RIVER (NEAR WHITEHALL) - DAY

	CAR ROAR OVER.  Down the embankment Parliament and Big Ben in b.g., the sleek
	Jaguar zooms at 60mph.  Steed dodges traffic --

	Wearing racing goggles, windscreen down --

	Executes a nifty maneuver, swerves on a zebra crossing, scatters pedestrians,
	HONKING his HORN.  Beside him, Emma is cool as a cucumber.  Steed turns
	charmingly.

					STEED
			Tea time -- four o'clock.  Mustn't
			be late.
				(beat)
			A word of warning. Don't take the
			macaroon. Mother's favorite.

	Steed swerves down a narrow alleyway, into a secret car park entrance by the
	riverbank.  He pulls up before a sign:

			RIVER THAMES WATER AUTHORITY
					No Admittance

	At a control barrier Steed inserts a card.  Emma sees a light flash up: "Security -- Top
	Priority Clearance Only."  The barrier lifts.  She looks again at Steed, reappraising him
	as Big Ben approaches four.  The car disappears in darkness ...

52      LARGE WINDOW CURTAIN

	opens, revealing water!  We are beneath the Thames -- garbage and fish float past a
	window of reinforced glass.  An original Campbell's tomato soup can floats down as we
	WIDEN to reveal ...

53      INT. SECRET SERVICE HQ - UNDERWATER - DAY

	Mother in his wheelchair, pulling the curtain cord.

					MOTHER
			That's better. I much prefer a
			womb with view, don't you, Mrs.
			Peel?

	A delicate CLOCK on the mantel CHIMES FOUR.

	Mother wheels himself forward and hooks onto the kettle.

					MOTHER
			Shall I be mother?

	He pours, presiding like a fat spider at the center of a subterranean web, known as The
	Ministry: a vast bureaucracy in a labyrinth of tunnels.

	Catches Emma's wandering lock

					MOTHER
			I expect you're wondering where
			you are.

	An atmosphere of a gentleman's club reigns in the subterranean bureau -- Emma takes
	her tea ...

					EMMA
			Don't tell me: You're the shadow secret 
			service. You're so hushhush, even the 
			legit secret service knows nothing about 
			it. Am I right?

	Bodyguard Brenda, a glam leather Moneypenny, wheels a trolley brimming with fancies
	over to Emma and Steed.

					MOTHER
			Close. We're so hush-hush, even
			we know nothing about it.
				(before Emma can
				make sense of this) 
			Now let's see, there's coconut cake, 
			date and walnut; I recommend the 
			rum baba ...

					EMMA
			Hmmm ...

					MOTHER
			Looks like rain, Steed...

					STEED
			... Showers followed by sunny periods.

					EMMA
				(looks up from
				trolley)
			We're not here to talk about the
			weather, surely.

					MOTHER
			Oh, yes we are.

					BRENDA
				(to Emma, cunning)
			Macaroon?

	Emma hesitates; takes a cake.  About to take a bite, when --

	Mother switches off lights.  A screen drops, covering the water window as the mood
	changes from coziness to terror -- an ancient PROJECTOR RATTLES on ...

54      IN DARKNESS

	Emma watches on the wall, an official Ministry film of macabre death tableaux in the
	English countryside:

					MOTHER
			We've had a series of bizarre weather reports.  
			We kept them hush-hush and sent agents into 
			the field for data. Case number one: 
			April 14, 3:35 P.M., Special Agent Simkins 
			investigating mysterious fires in corn circles.  
			A field outside the village of Little Snoring, 
			one of the hottest days of the year. Trapped 
			by a sudden blizzard. Found frozen to death 
			in a giant ice cube -- like a mammoth in 
			perma-frost.
				(the picture changes)
			Case two: Pilot Raymond Shaw, May 6, 11:28 A.M. 
			Took off from a deserted airstrip near Stoke Poges, 
			investigating bizarre atmospheric reports. A freak 
			rainstorm downed him. Knocked unconscious by a 
			flying fish, falling from 15,000 feet. Twenty-five 
			inches of rain in eight minutes, over an area the size 
			of a cricket pitch ...
				(the picture changes)
			... Case three: June 2, 5:43 P.M. Defense Chief 
			Major Courtnay. Remains discovered in a turnip 
			field near Ashby de la Zouche. Our boffins 
			recorded a sudden blast of heat. Scorched earth, 
			temperature of 1000 degrees. Spontaneous 
			combustion. Not much of him left ...

	CLICK.  The lights go back on.  Emma notices - a new arrival
	
	a tall, striking OLDER WOMAN; dark glasses.

					MOTHER
			My number two. Special assignments.  
			She's --

					EMMA
			Let me guess -- 'Father'?

					FATHER (OLDER WOMAN)
			All happy families here, Mrs. Peel.

	Father's dark glasses turn to Emma like a hawk.  Runs her fingers over Emma's face. 
	Gets the outline.  Emma realizes --

					EMMA
			You're --

	Blind ... Father smiles.

					FATHER
			God, you're quick.

					MOTHER
			Have a look at these, Mrs. Peel --

	He passes 'round a box of evidence related to the screen events:  Steed investigates a
	pair of black shoes and bowler; Emma, a fish.  The shoes have agent Simkins' name
	in them ...

					STEED
			Ah ... From Trubshaw's.  My
			shoemaker.

					EMMA
				(unimpressed)
			A kipper. Or a red herring? What were 
			they investigating?

					FATHER
			A series of bizarre shifts in local weather 
			patterns ...

					STEED
			Global warming?

					FATHER
			Jungle plants in the Arctic? A lush 
			English village transformed overnight 
			into African scrubland? Blizzards in summer?

					EMMA
			How curious ...

					MOTHER
			Something strange is happening. And 
			whoever knows about it doesn't want 
			us to find out.

					FATHER
				(to Steed)
			Your mission is simple. Find out
			how and why these agents died.

					EMMA
			I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?

					MOTHER
			Your research into climate engineering was 
			state-of-the-art. Your experiments could 
			have revolutionized our knowledge of global 
			warming -- had they succeeded. We need 
			your expertise.

					STEED
			Perhaps I'd better start calling you doctor 
			again, Mrs. Peel --

	Emma hesitates, unsure for the first time ...

					EMMA
			I'm not sure I'm ready to return to work.  
			I've been out of action for some time. I'll 
			consider your proposal.

	She gets up, ready to go.

					FATHER
			One moment, Mrs. Peel. There's another 
			special reason we wanted you to join our 
			happy family; rather curious, actually ...

	Mother hits the lights.  He flicks the video into slow-mo.  File thru image clarification,
	identikit sketches.

					MOTHER
			Eye witness reports. Strangers in the area.  
			One description tallied in all three places.  
			Recognize her?

	Emma locks.  On the screen comes -- Emma Peel.  Steed reacts.

					EMMA
			Me, isn't it?

	Emma stares at the screen: incredible.  Like a twin sister.

					FATHER
			Think of it as special assignment, Mrs. Peel.  
			With a twist. You're our chief suspect.

					EMMA
			You're saying I have no choice.

					MOTHER
			Father will be your controller. Steed here 
			will show you the ropes.

					EMMA
				(very arch)
			Ropes?


55      INT.  SECRET SERVICE HQ SHOOTING GALLERY

	A life-size target of a man with blank face, bowler hat and umbrella, flips up, and --

	BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!  Is riddled with holes by

Emma, who works at reloading as


56      HIGH ABOVE IN ONE-WAY MIRRORED GALLERY

	looking on, Mother with Steed.

					STEED
			Think she really killed those agents?

					MOTHER
			She may not know. Theory goes she
			may be very ill.

					STEED
			Amnesia?

					MOTHER
			Possibly. Split personality ...

					STEED
			Insane ... ?

					MOTHER
			Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, 
			you should watch out.

					STEED
			Why?

					MOTHER
			She may try to kill you.


57      IN SHOOTING GALLERY

	Emma swiftly turns, aims, and --

	BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! FIRES with dead-eye precision. 
	All on target.  Steed reacts.  Ulp.

					STEED
			Perhaps I ought to talk with Dr. 
			Darling.

58      INT.  SECRET SERVICE HQ PSY OPS ROOM

	A gallery of portraits of Emma Peel projected on the wall based on Warhol's Jackie
	(1964) -- Poignant, inscrutable, fascinating, iconic -- blown up, dissected, analyzed. 
	The swirling newspaper dots cover Mother and Steed like bubbles from a light show.

	As DR. DARLING, head of the Ministry's Psychological Operations (Psy Ops) -- a
	kind of spy version of Timothy Leary, briefs them. In his thick dark glasses and beard,
	Darling's obsessive interest in Emma adds a sinister air.

					DR. DARLING
			One key point: Mrs. Peel is a widow:
			she's obsessively devoted to the memory 
			of her husband the scientist Peter Peel. 
			You may find her a little ... remote.

	Images of Peter Peel on the wall.  Of Emma with him.

					DR. DARLING
			They were a team. Met at Cambridge. 
			Working on a top secret research mission 
			into weather conditions, code name The
			Prospero Project, when Peel died.

	Steed looks meaningfully at Mother.

					MOTHER
			Something went wrong. System malfunction.  
			Explosion. Mrs. Peel had a narrow escape.  
			Suspected sabotage. Nothing proven. File 
			still open.

					STEED
			How come you took so much interest
			in her, Dr. Darling?

					DR. DARLING
			Her husband was one of ours.

					STEED
				(eyes Peel's photo,
				then Mother)
			Peel? Did she know?

					MOTHER
			Still doesn't. Better safe than sorry.  She 
			was in a dangerous game, Steed. High 
			stakes. She may prove to be a risk.  If 
			she is, there's only one solution.  Termination.

					STEED
			Anyone particular in mind?

					MOTHER
			You.

	OFF Steed's reaction.  CLASHING BLADES OVER ...


59      INT.  SECRET SERVICE FENCING SALON

	Steed and Emma (new outfit), cross swords.  Like everything else she does, Emma is a
	champion.  Steed is hard put.  Both fence attached to cables -- very high-tech 
	dueling ...

	Steed is in white; Emma (natch), in black ... yin and yang ...

					STEED
			You're a lady of hidden talents,
			Mrs. Peel ...

	Tic-tac ...

					EMMA
			I've no intention of hiding them ...

	Tic-tac ...

					STEED
			Scientist ...
				(tic-tac)
			... marksman ...
				(tic-tac)
			... swordsman ...
				(tic-tac)
			... To what do you attribute your 
			overachievements?

	Fast swordplay.  Tic-tac-tic-tac-tic.  Steed's good, too.

					EMMA
			My father always wanted a boy.

					STEED
			Really?  I fail to see the connection.

					EMMA
			I had a feeling you would. Touche!

	She lunges; her foil tips right into the heart on Steed's chest.  BUZZ!  Steed removes
	his mask; holds her foil tip.

					STEED
			I take your point.

	Emma takes off her mask.

					EMMA
			Do you?

					STEED
			Yes indeed. I need protection.


60      EXT.  SIGN - DAY

	"Trubshaw's of Jermyn Street, since 1756."  Steed's Jag parked in front -- of course
	there's a space.  Getting out

					EMMA
			I thought we were on our way.

					STEED
			Oh, absolutely, but Trubshaw's a man 
			worth meeting. No point setting out 
			half shod.

					EMMA
				(dry)
			Or half cocked.

61      CLOSEUP - TRUBSHAW

	slips Steed's hand-made shoes an.  The "lasts" shapes of shoes beside him -- bear
	Steed's name.

					STEED
			I couldn't agree more. Thank you, 
			Trubshaw.

					TRUBSHAW
				(significantly)
			Very good, Mr. Steed.

	WIDEN to reveal:


62      INT.  TRUBSHAW'S GENTLEMEN'S SHOP - DAY

	A bull moose's antlers.  A horned rhino.  A Leopard.  A tiger.  Then next to them, in a
	wall of hunting trophies Emma paces impatiently beneath them.  Shop assistants attend
	in tails and wing-collars, very old school tie.  Steed emerges helped into a new flashy
	waistcoat ...

					EMMA
				(gags at the waistcoat)
			Steed, we really must be --

					STEED 
				(relishing his shoes)
			Ahh. Perfect fit. The luxury of a 
			hand-made shoe. As unique as a face 
			or a fingerprint. Or should I say DNA?


63      BEHIND DISPLAY

	Eyes watching Emma and Steed rise ...

					EMMA
			You can but I wish you wouldn't ...

					STEED
			Thank you, Trubshaw ...

	A youngish man -- in black polo neck, Beatle-cut mop, pauting lips, smart suit, druggy
	high-pitched giggle.  BAILEY, a cocky, cool psychopath.  He watches Steed and
	Emma leave ...

	... and saunters after them ...  CAR ROAR OVER.


64      EXT.  LONDON STREETS - DAY

	as the Jag races through them, heading for the country.

					EMMA (V.O.)
			That place is so absurd, so out of date ...

					STEED (V.O.)
			Do you really think so?

	Another car follows them ... as they pass Buckingham Palace, now painted pink and
	guarded by female grenadiers ...

65      SIGN

	reading:  "Scotland" with an arrow, as Steed and Emma zoom past in the Jag ...

					STEED (V.O.)
			Press that button, would you?
			Tea?

66      CLOSEUP - SPECIAL DASHBOARD COMPARTMENT

	opens, revealing a tea service: a samovar of tea, feeding into a pre-warmed pot,
	pouring into two china cups ...

	WIDEN to reveal:

67      INT.  JAG - DAY

	Emma, reacts, pours from the samovar ...

					STEED
			Sorry. Didn't mean to interrupt
			your flow of oratory ...


	Steed's JAG BACKFIRES again as at the beginning ...

					EMMA
			You know what I mean. This car
			-- and you. Nobody walks around
			like that. Milk?

					STEED
			Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs.
			Peel. No thank you.

	She hands over a cup.

					EMMA
			But why? What's the point?

					STEED
			A Gentleman has to have a code.
			This is part of mine. A uniform.
			Think of it as my suit of shining
			armor.

					EMMA
			And I suppose you're the knight.

					STEED
			The most unpredictable piece on
			the board. And always ready to
			protect his queen.

					EMMA
			That's predictable. When I find
			a queen in need of protection
			I'll let you know.

	Steed looks in the mirror.  Behind them, a car.  Tailing?

					STEED
			I'm hoping you will.

	He puts his foot down.  Zoom ...


68      EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

	Towards picturesque Scotland.  The JAG ROARS by - then the other car ...


69      INT.  JAG - DAY

	Emma consults a list, reads --

					EMMA
			Sir August Merryweather ... why
			are we seeing him first?

					STEED
			As per mother's instructions.

					EMMA
			Do we always follow Mother's
			instructions?

					STEED
			For a man in my position --

					EMMA
			Just what is your position, if you don't 
			mind my asking.  How did a stuffed 
			shirt like you get into this line of work?

					STEED
				(smiles)
			They call me in when they've reached a 
			dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.

					EMMA
			I have no choice. Why should you
			risk your life?

					STEED
			After our fencing match, I was rather 
			hoping you would do the risking.  
			More tea?

					EMMA
			No thanks.

					STEED
			I meant me.

	Emma takes in Steed's evasive answers.  Sighing, she pours.


70      EXT.  HIGHLANDS - DAY

	The Jag winds around Loch Ness, followed by the car.

					STEED (V.O.)
			According to Mother, Sir August owns 
			half of the Highlands. A millionaire.  
			Former head of Special Projects at the 
			Ministry. Now ...

					EMMA (V.O.)
			An eccentric recluse?


71      INT.  JAG - DAY

					STEED
			Not so much eccentric. More barking 
			mad. He has a wife called June. And 
			a daughter somewhere -- Julie.

					EMMA
			June, July ... August?

					STEED
			The family does seem to be somewhat 
			meteorologically inclined.

					EMMA
			Any other vices?

					STEED
			All of a piece, really. A fanatical 
			weatherman. Chairman of BROLLY.
				(off her look)
			British Royal Organisation For
			Lasting Liquid Years. Thinks British 
			weather has been tampered with 
			by ... aliens.

	Emma takes this in.

					EMMA
			So ... I distract him while you snoop 
			around? How?

					STEED
			Small talk.  Try the weather.


72      EXT.  HUGE COUNTRY HOUSE - DAY

	Steed and Emma speed up to the huge open main gates

	Signs:  "Private: No Admittance."  Guards in hunting gear and plus fours, with loaded
	rifles.  They start up the drive ...

	Several peacocks on the lawn fan open their beautiful tails.

	One of them, a mechanical peacock whose thousand eyes CLICK with the WHIR of a
	CAMERA ...

	The other car pulls in behind. Inside, reveal Bailey watching them.


73      INT.  MANOR HOUSE CORRIDOR - DAY

	On a tartan carpet, a SCOTTIE BARKS furiously at a set of EXPIRING BAGPIPES
	on the floor.  PAN UP to reveal:

	A BUTLER leading Emma down the corridor --

	-- where she admires the eccentric fixtures, pausing to note a large teddy bear outfit
	with tartan trimmings instead of the usual suit of armor.

					EMMA
			Original ...

					BUTLER
			This way, miss ...

					EMMA
			Missus ...

	He opens the double doors, admitting Emma into


74      INT.  A LARGE ROOM

	of semi-tropical climate.  Jungle plants, parakeets, snakes.  Walls lined with display
	cabinets and bell jars:  stuffed birds, butterflies, spiders.  A thermometer reads:

	100 degrees with high humidity. The Butler leaves.

	Emma fans herself.  Nobody in the roam.  But hears a sound of RAINFALL from a
	smoked glass conservatory.

					EMMA
			Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ?

					VOICE (O.S.)
			Eh? In here!

	Emma follows the SOUND, steps cautiously forward.

75      INT.  CONSERVATORY

	beneath a sprinkler system of torrential rain, an old man splashes in bizarre rubber togs.
	Emma stays cool.

					EMMA
			I've come to apply for membership
			in Brolly --

					SIR AUGUST
				(shouts above the tempest)
			You don't get rain like you used to in 
			England. A good shower that's the ticket.  
			Stiffens resolve, puckers the spirit, quells 
			the namby-pamby in a man.

	SIR AUGUST steps out of the shower and wind machine.  A belted rubber macintosh,
	flippers, goggles.  He starts to disrobe, the NOISE DIES DOWN --

					EMMA
			I so agree. How did you acquire a 
			taste for it?

					SIR AUGUST
			Out in India. So character-forming for the 
			British. Not the heat. Good Lord, no. The 
			rain, dash it. A good monsoon. Fifteen 
			inches overnight. A whole week of lovely 
			rain. I remember one summer in Jaipur ...

	Sir August removes his goggles, recognizes her.

					SIR AUGUST
			You

					EMMA
			Have we met?

					SIR AUGUST
			You mean you don't recall??

	Before Emma can reply, the door opens...

					SIR AUGUST
			Ah, Lady June ...

	Emma's attention switches to LADY JUNE, a buxom lady in a sou'wester and galoshes,
	who wheels in a tray of scones.

					LADY JUNE
			Dear August.  Loves his showers.
			Like a baby.
				(beat)
			Scones, Mrs. Peel?

					EMMA
			Thank you, Lady -- June ...

	Emma sees Sir August gazing wistfully out of the window, which is rapidly 
	darkening ...

					SIR AUGUST
			Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised.

					EMMA
			Promised? Who promised?

					SIR AUGUST
			There, look!

	Emma looks, sees rain start to pitter-patter on the windows.  Emma exchanges looks
	with June as the rain starts pouring.

					SIR AUGUST
			Imagine being caught out in a blow 
			like that!

76      EXT.  MOORLAND - DAY

	THUNDER and lightning -- Steed is caught out in it; puts up his umbrella; wanders
	over the brow of a hill, past a big sign:  "No Trespassers."  Rains more.  And more.
	Turns to a tempest, as --

					STEED
			I say, this is a bit much.

	Lashed by rain ' Steed carries on to the brow of the hill.  He looks over, peers through
	the mist at --

	A deep purple cloud.  Mushrooming towards him.

	Steed can't escape it.  It envelops him.  Starts to blink.  Cough.  Footsteps less sure. 
	Surrounded by thick purple haze

	Steed stumbles and falls

	Down a hill.  Tumbles to the bottom.  He knocks his head on a rock.  Steed blinks,
	shakes his head.  Eyes refocus.  He sees


77      UNDULATING SAND DUNES

	Sun shining down on yellow sand, a barren vista.  Dead trees.  Suddenly Steed's in the
	Sahara.  A heat haze shimmers.

	Steed blinks, thinks he's dreaming when he sees ...


78      IN DISTANCE - RED PHONE BOX

	Steed heads towards it.  The PHONE BOX seems further away.  Like an optical
	illusion.  Then hears RINGING.

	Steed still bowler-hatted.  Overcoat.  Perspiring.  Takes off bowler, wipes brow. 
	Adjusts rose in buttonhole.  It wilts.

	He arrives at the phone box. Opens the door.  Steed picks up the RINGING PHONE,
	listens to --

	A SCRATCHY ORCHESTRAL RECORDING of "The Merry Widow."

					STEED
			'The Merry Widow'...?

	Over the MUSIC, a strange --

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			... Hello ... Hello? ... Who the
			hell...? Who is this? ... You must
			leave the test area. I repeat,
			leave the area ... Help is on the
			way ...

	CLICK.  The line goes dead.  Steed is baffled.  Steps out, sees --


79      ON HORIZON

	a shimmering heat haze.  A figure on a camel moving towards them.  Steed watches
	amazed, as the camel pads closer ...

	The mirage arrives. The rider dismounts. A woman in yashmak and veils. She draws
	closer. Drops the veils to reveal --

	Emma Peel.  In her black leather catsuit.

					.STEED
			Mrs. Peel. Good of you to drop by. 
			And I see you're wearing your - 
			riding outfit?

	Emma moves closer.  Steed smiles at her.  Emma closer and -- chop! -- gives a kung-fu
	jab to the throat, a kick to the balls, a jab to the stomach.  As Steed lies on the 
	ground --

					STEED
			Manners, Mrs. Peel.

	Emma takes out a .38 GUN, points at his heart, FIRES -- 

	BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!  FOUR SHOTS --


80      EMMA'S POV

	-- The bullets strike his chest.  Round his heart.  Steed slumps back on the sands.  Eyes
	close ...


81      EMMA

	moves over him. Drops a small toy snowshaker into his curled fingers. Blows a good
	bye kiss.


82      STEED'S POV	82

	The sun.  Clouds roll by.  The camel peers down at him.

									
		FADE TO BLACK.

	Sound of CLACKING ...

	FADE IN:

83      INT.  SECRET SERVICE HOSPITAL - DAY

	A hospital ward.  Empty apart from one bed.  A nurse (Brenda in her red leather), her
	spiked heels clacking on the floor, brings over a cup of tea to

	Steed in a hospital bed.  Who wakes, surprised to see Emma.  Peering over him.  Very
	nonchalant.  Eating his grapes.

					STEED
			Ah, Brenda ...
				(as she leaves)
			Mrs. Peel?

					EMMA
			You should be dead.  How do you
			feel?

					STEED
				(eyes her)
			Strange.

					EMMA
			You were very lucky.  Four shots to 
			the heart. I found you after I slipped 
			away from Sir August. Mother brought 
			you here. Not me you should thank.

					STEED
			I wasn't about to.

					EMMA
			I mean your man Trubshaw.  Your
			bullet-proof waistcoat.  I thought 
			you were just overdressed.

					STEED
			I might say the same.

84      FROM GALLERY

	Mother with Dr. Darling taking notes.  Emma looks up at them.  Drops to a whisper. 
	But they both are wearing headphones.

					EMMA
			Mother and Dr. Darling have me 
			under observation. They think I 
			tried to kill you.

					STEED
			Why should they think that?

					EMMA
			You told them. You said I arrived 
			on a camel, shot you four times. 
			Left you for dead.

					STEED
			Frankly that's how I remember it.

					EMMA
			But that's absurd. I may not be 
			over-fond of you, Steed, but it's 
			not my style.

					STEED
			Perhaps your memory plays tricks,
			Mrs. Peel.

					EMMA
				(conceding)
			That's possible. Sir August was convinced 
			he'd met me before. But I'd never met him.  
			Another odd thing. When it rained, he said 
			it was just as someone had promised.

					STEED
			Did he say who?

					EMMA
			No. But he must know. Incidentally, 
			my double left you with this.

	Emma shows Steed the toy snow scene.  A winter wonderland snow scene.  He looks
	puzzlingly at it.  On its underneath. "The Wonderland Corporation," followed by --

					STEED
			An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...?

					EMMA
			Did you say formal? I must dress.


85      EXT.  LONDON STREET - NIGHT

	The sporty Jag pulls up outside a tall, swanky building.  Steed gets out, opens her door.
	Irritated, Emma steps out of the car, clad in her leather suit --


86      CLOSEUP OF HER HEEL

	hitting the street.   PAN UP TO Steed, admiring --

					STEED
			I must say, you look more your
			old self --

					EMMA
			You mean my other self ...

					STEED
			Either way ... may I ask: why
			you dress in that fashion?

					EMMA
			I should have thought that was
			obvious ...
				(off his smirk)
			I'm in mourning.

	She moves off.  Stay on his poker face.

					STEED
			I can't wait to see afternoon.

	He joins her; they survey the building.

					EMMA
			Where's the picnic?

	They look up to --


87      INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

	A boardroom suite, overlooking London.  Lights twinkling --

	Around a conference table.  Twelve TEDDY BEARS.  Each six feet tall.  Ridiculous
	and sinister.  In pink, turquoise, brown, black, white, green.  Furry, giant paws and
	ears, swivel eyes.  One teddy sports a familiar tartan ...

	On the table, children's party food: jellies, hundreds and thousands, birthday cakes. 
	And wrapped presents before each.

	Each bear has a name-badge: Bobby, Bobo, Bruno, Bibi, Betty, Binky etc. pinned to
	their fur.  A children's tune, "THE TEDDY BEAR'S PICNIC," plays.  Followed by -
	a gavel rapping order.

	A distinctively chilling voice, eerily familiar and seductive, which ECHOES through our
	story --

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Ladies, gentlemen and bears ...

	The teddy bears look round.  Can't hear who's talking.

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Today is history. The first day of the future. 
			I welcome you to the first general meeting 
			of the Wonderland Corporation, now allied 
			with our colleagues from Brolly ...

	Murmurs of congratulations amongst the bears ...

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			You have all given time, money and expertise 
			to achieve our goal. But we are reaching a 
			new phase of our operation. From today, 
			many of you will no longer be needed. I have 
			to warn you ...

	Dismay from the teddy bears.  As a CUCKOO CLOCK RINGS OUT,

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			A cuckoo.  The first sign of spring, and ... 
			A cuckoo in our nest. Our organization is 
			no longer secret. Agents are investigating 
			us. Their names are John Steed and Emma 
			Peel. I believe we have a traitor among us 
			... perhaps more than one ...

	Uproar from the teddy bears.  Shouts of "Who?" (*PS: One of the Teddys is a giant
	rabbit who seems especially alarmed).

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			That remains to be seen. When we find 
			the traitors, they will be dealt with severely.

					TEDDY BEAR #l
			These agents.  Where are they?

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Here. In this building. By our estimate, they 
			will enter this room in thirty-five point five 
			seconds precisely ...

	Panic.  The bears scramble to go, bumping into each other.

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			I am sorry the party is over.  But we 
			shall meet again.
			To each of you a gift. A token of
			my appreciation.

	In front of the teddy bears, each one receives a present wrapped up in paper with a pink
	and silver bow.

	The tartan teddy opens his up:  A snow scene.  Anxious moans.


88      INT.  BUILDING - NIGHT

	UP and inside fire staircase, Emma and Steed run up -- Open the door to the
	conference room.  The CUCKOO RINGS on their entry.  To FIND an empty room.
	Only the party detritus plus little teddy bears sitting where formerly the big ones sat; the
	teddy bear picnic MUSIC PLAYING again OVER ...

	One snow shaker left.  Steed picks it up:  Inside it:


89      TINY EMMA PEEL

	in black leather.

					STEED (O.S.)
			For you, Mrs. Peel.


90      BACK TO SCENE

	Emma stares at it.  Turns it over:  an address.

					EMMA
			Another invitation. 38 Marlborough
			Terrace ...


91      INT.  EMBASSY (BELGRAVIA) - NIGHT

	Inside number 38, a deserted Eastern bloc embassy.  A dilapidated hammer and sickle
	tapestry in tatters.  Old spy techno-junk lies discarded in elegant living rooms.

	Steed and Emma open the door, rush inside.

	They search for clues.  A cigar left in an ashtray.  Steed picks it up with distaste. 
Then   moves over to the wine rack, picks up a vintage bottle of champagne --

					STEED
				(admiringly)
			Hm ... A Veuve-Cliquot '56 ...
				(then puzzled)
			But he bites the end of his
			Monte Cristos ... ?
				(frowning)
			Clearly, we're dealing with a
			maniac.

	Meanwhile, Emma goes into the --


92      NEXT ROOM - EMMA'S POV

	where she sees a blob of BUBBLING GUNK, like radioactive chewing gum.  A few
	pieces of charred clothing tell us this was once a man in a teddy bear outfit.


93      BACK TO SCENE

	Steed enters behind her, examines the gunk.

					STEED
			Colonel Crabtree. International
			Satellite Systems. Formerly of
			the Ministry.

					EMMA
			How on earth can you tell?

	Steed holds up the inside of a battered shoe:  the name.

					STEED
			Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw
			isn't the only shoemaker still
			practicing his trade ...

					EMMA
			Very good, Steed ...

	A MEWLING SOUND.

					EMMA
			What's that?

	Leaving Steed to ponder the remains, Emma goes into


94      ANOTHER ROOM

	Dark.  Switches on the light.  And gasps.


95      STEED

	looks up as Emma emerges with - 

	A Leopard cub.  Steed raises his brolly.

					STEED
			What on earth?

					EMMA
			Any ideas?

					STEED
			Well, he was a fellow of the Royal
			Zoological Society ...

					EMMA
			Is that written in his shoe?

					STEED
				(smug)
			Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...

					EMMA
				(shrugs)
			She had this in her mouth. There,
			there...

	Cooing to the cub, Emma tosses to Steed -- another snowshaker.  Inside -- another
	address:  84 Cadogan Place.

					STEED
			Not again.  There's got to be
			another. way to go about this.


96      EXT.  CADOGAN PLACE APARTMENT BUILDING (KNIGHTSBRIDGE) -
	NIGHT

	Down a sheer wall Emma Peel abseils with rope and crampons.  Before gliding through
	an open French window --


97      INT.  KNIGHTSBRIDGE FLAT - NIGHT

	Emma investigates.  Nobody there.  She looks 'round.  Military memorabilia.  Busts of
	Napoleon and Charlemagne.  Looks inside drawers.  Desks.  Meanwhile --


98      INT.  STEED'S JAG - NIGHT

	Steed feeds a carton of milk to the leopard, who is a handful ... licking, pawing him ...

					STEED
			Now, now ...
				(sings)
			'I can't give you anything but
			love, baby...'


99      INT.  KNIGHTSBRIDGE FLAT - NIGHT	

	Emma searching ...


100     OUTSIDE FLAT DOOR	100

		a key in lock.  Door opens.  Silence.


101     INSIDE - EMMA

	finds a snowshaker.  About to look underneath.  Hears a NOISE.  Looks up, in front of
	her in the mirror, sees -A giant teddy behind her.  Ready to strike --

	Emma swivels 'round,  a fluid balletic motion, and --

	Bam!  A kick to the teddy's stomach.  Then off balance, Emma hurls him over her
	shoulder, darts in to pin the teddy to the ground as --

	The teddy grabs Emma's legs, flings her off balance.  She falls.  Teddy grabs a military
	sabre from the wall, and Woosh!  Slices through air at Emma's head.  She ducks.  The
	sabre skims her hair.  Emma grabs another sabre; the fight is on!

	Emma counterattacks.  Slashes with the sabre and the teddy's head goes flying off! 
	Jesus.  The torso stands unsteadily.

	Emma's eyes widen as:

	A man's head emerges from the teddy torso.

	Emma's so surprised, he can slug her ...

	Emma's out.

102     INT.  STEED'S JAG - NIGHT

	so is Steed and the Leopard -- both asleep.  A little milk dribbles down Steed's chin ...


103     INT.  KNIGHTSBRIDGE FLAT - NIGHT

	The man goes to the other room.  Starts to take off the rest of his teddy costume. 
	Throws clothes into a suitcase.

	The PHONE.  Terrified, the Man picks it up ... The voice ...

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Naughty teddy ...

					MAN
			No! You can't ...

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Ask not for whom the telephone
			rings, it rings for thee ...

					MAN
			But I've got rid of her.  She's ...

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Go to the window ... To the window.

	Teddy moves to the open window.  Sudden PAIN.  LIGHTNING.

	Teddy looks up in terror as a purple cloud releases another BOLT.  Direct hit.  The
	teddy slumps to the ground.  Soggy, waterlogged, very dead.  Kinda like the
	other guy ...


104     IN OTHER ROOM

	Meanwhile Emma wakes up. Turns the corner.  Towards the other room, sees dead
	Teddy.  Reads the label on his suitcase ...

					EMMA
			Major D'Arcy ... ?


105     OVER HER SHOULDER

	from the window behind her like a spider on glass appears another "Emma" --

	-- let's call her Bad Emma -- coming straight for Emma.  She makes a NOISE.  Emma
	turns just in time to see.

					EMMA
			Well, well. If it isn't me ...

	Emma starts towards her double, who hesitates, then turns, leaping out the window ...
	she wears the same black catsuit.

	The real Emma rushes, follows her "double"

	Clambers outside to rappel up the line to


106     EXT. ROOFTOPS - NIGHT

	Emma looks.  Beneath a starlit sky criss-crossed by wires, a rooftop maze of buildings,
	flanked by giant gargoyles -- goblins, lions, griffins -- over twinkling lights ...

	Emma searches the roof -- no sign, only shadows.  Then turns a corner to see --

	Above the city, fairy lights on the rooftops of Harrods, lit by a million bulbs ... giant
	neon signs ...

	Several floors below, Emma sees the streets.  A twinge of vertigo.  Then she looks up,
	hears a NOISE -- From:


107     BEHIND GARGOYLE

	she sees her "double" run.  Emma gives chase.

	Hot pursuit.  Over rooftops.  'Round wires.  PAST neon signs high over the city ...

	Emma follows.  Gains on the "double," who --

	Pushes faster.  Gliding between rooftop buildings.  Dodging, weaving.  But Emma
	gains more.  Sleek limbs, muscular, perfect body machine, until --


108     EMMA'S POV

	as she sees her "double" leap over a yawning chasm.  And stumble on the other side for
	a footing.


109     BACK TO SCENE

	as Emma's adrenaline surges.  She cannot stop, she --

	Jumps!  Hangs in the air.  Limbs pushing out for the edge.  And only just, she lands
	perfectly, gaining, closing, until --


110     ON NEXT ROOFTOP

	Emma gains up close.  A final burst of acceleration.  Then without warning, her
	"double" --

	Turns, Emma catches up, and --

	Wham!  Wham!  A kick -- a chop to Emma's body - double scissorkick -- Emma reacts
	swiftly, surges into overdrive --

	In a lightning-fast kung fu duel -- CRACK OF BONE -- CRUNCH OF BLOWS -- a
	flurry of kicks as Emma --

	Lands on her back.  The "double" attacks.  Emma retaliates --

	Kicks up her leg -- flings the "double" over her head she lands awkwardly -- a
	METALLIC CRUNCH in a blow to her head -- but picks herself up without pausing

	And vanishes into the rooftop maze.


111     AGAINST SKYLINE

	Emma stands.  Looks.   She's lost her "double."  She stands alone, silhouetted against
	the night sky.

	Caught in the moonlight.  Above sparks of neon.  Daunting, muscular, poised for
	action, as --

	Ears listening to distant noises.  SWOOSHING TRAFFIC.  FLUTTER of BIRD
	WING.  HUM of WIND through wires.  Then an AUDIBLE SNAP --

112     EMMA'S POV - HIGH ANGLE

	above her a SPAM as a STEEL CABLE WIRE of an aerial is snapped.  Slowly wound 
	tightly 'round, bent back, coiled, ready to spring --

113     BACK TO SCENE - EMMA

	looks 'round.  Sees nothing, hears the sound of the WHIPLASH coming seconds 
	before --

	Through the air --


114     EMMA'S POV

	a flashing line like a bolt of lightning, but cannot move quickly enough as --


115     BACK TO SCENE

	as a cable wire whips across, coils 'round Emma, lashing her tight, crushing air from
	her, as the wire --

	Sweeps Emma off her feet, whiplashes her back like a spring, hoists her and dangles her
	over the city.  She looks down.

	A long way.

	Emma grabs hold of the wire, which pulls her back.  She drops down to the rooftop ...

	Slithers down the roof.  Slips --


116     OVER LEDGE

	Emma hangs on with fingertips.

	Overlooking city with 100-foot neon sign above her:


117     ADVERTISEMENT

	for "Wonderland Weather" with: a repeated loop of a 100-foot high bikini-clad
	"Emma" throwing head back in holiday fun -- Sign: "COMING SOON -- THE
	NATURAL BEAUTY OF WONDERLAND WEATHER."


118     BACK TO SCENE

	Emma hangs on, looks up, stares at "herself."  The surreal repetition of the loop. 
	Overlooking the whole city.

	Dizzy, Emma threatens to pass out.  Just when from --


119     ABOVE HER

	an unseen hand from Bad Emma winds down --

	Another CABLE for her to hold.  It uncoils down past the windows, telltale SPARKS
	flare up as it hits metal --

	Emma tries to grab for it.  Misses, then grabs hold, and -- a LIVE CABLE -- a
	thousand VOLTS surge through her body --

	-- A shock, Emma plummets DOWN TO --


120     STRIPED AWNING

	on a lower ledge.  She hangs precariously.  Catching her breath.  About to redouble her
	efforts.  When beside her from a --


121     BALCONY WINDOW

	an umbrella extended.  Steed reaches out, reels Emma in.  They are back in Teddy's 
	flat ... Emma collapses in Steed's arms.  He helps her up -- hands her a phone.

					STEED
			For you, Mrs. Peel.

					EMMA
			Thanks ...
				(dry)
			I see what you mean about letting
			me do the risking ... Hello?

	It's Sir August.

					SIR AUGUST (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Mrs. Peel ... Come quickly.
			Brolly's been betrayed! I'll tell
			you everything ... The weather's
			getting worse and worse ... they're
			after me ... coming for me ... come
			quickly!

	CLICK.

					EMMA
			Sir August...?
				(to Steed)
			What now?

					STEED
			Ask Mother.

	Sound OVER:  RING-RING.

122     INT.  MANOR HOUSE (SCOTLAND) - DAY

	Sir August gripped with terror, stares at the PHONE.  The scotty DOG BARKS.
	Finally, Sir August answers.

					SIR AUGUST
			Mrs. Peel -- ?

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Ask not for whom the telephone
			rings ...

					SIR AUGUST
			No, please! I beg you ...

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Walk over to the window ...

					SIR AUGUST
			Let it be rain, please let it be --

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Stay by the window. By the window.

	Mesmerized, Sir August goes to the window. Looks -- Lady June arrives, too late.


123     OUTSIDE

	a purple cloud of cyclone-force rages towards him.  A luminous glow.  Then a
	LIGHTNING STRIKE. And --

	BOOM!  An EXPLOSION BLASTS the WINDOWS.  A WIND rushes
	in ...

					FATHER (V.O.)
			Emergency alert ...


124     EXT.  WHITEHALL STREETS - DAY

	PAST obscure imperial statues a tiny micro Messerschmidt bubble car tootles down
	deserted streets.

					FATHER (V.O.)
			A cyclone hit Banffshire last night.
			Completely unpredicted ...


125     INSIDE CAR

					EMMA
			Where's Mother?

					FATHER
			Mobile HQ. In a blue funk.  Can't 
			take chances. I'm looking after 
			things while he's hiding out ...

	Father drives like a maniac.  She senses their unease.

					FATHER
			You're probably wondering how I 
			can drive 'blind.' Simple. A new 
			prototype from the boys in X division.  
			Micro-sensors in the system read 
			signals and road information. Converts 
			the info into miles per hour. 
			Ultra-sensitive.  Ultra-smart.

	Father jumps a red light.  CARS SCREECH together in a huge pile-up.  Not that smart. 
	Steed holds onto his hat.

					STEED
			We know one thing. That suspect
			was not Mrs. Peel.

					FATHER
			So you say ... 

					EMMA
			You don't believe him?

					FATHER
			It's Mother you have to convince.
			He's very agitated.  Wait here.

	Father SCREECHES to a halt on Holland Park Avenue

	Steed and Emma get out.  Father takes off ...

					EMMA
			But

					STEED
			Don't bother.  Here's a bus ...

	A red London number 22 bus drives up.  As it arrives, in a conductor's cap is -- the
	bodyguard, Brenda.

					BRENDA
			Fares, please,


126     INT.  BUS - DAY

	Steed and Emma board the bus.  Destination:  Not In Service.  They pay Brenda, the
	conductor.  Go upstairs.


127     UPSTAIRS

	is Mother's temporary mobile HQ.  He squats in a corner.  Metal hooks on electronic
	panels.  Now paranoid.  Suspicious.  All the upper windows have been blacked out.

					MOTHER
			Welcome to mobile H.Q. Weather's 
			turning quite nasty. Sir August was 
			blown to smithereens. Along with 
			half of Banffshire.  The Ministry's 
			worried.

					EMMA
			He tried to warn us ...

					STEED
			We had a lead to Wonderland
			Weather but we got there too late.
			Someone tipped them off ...

					MOTHER
			Too late anyway. Today's escapade 
			was only for starters. This is no 
			ordinary weather. It's manmade. A 
			kind of weather bomb.

					STEED
			Impossible.

					EMMA
			Not quite. This is my field.

					STEED
			Is there anything that isn't?

					EMMA
				(ignores)
			The Prospero Project was started by 
			my husband. It was an early attempt 
			to solve the problems of global warming.  
			In theory, climate engineering is entirely 
			feasible. We thought of injecting a 
			chemical cocktail into the atmosphere 
			by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'...

					STEED
			Filling in mother nature's blind
			spots ... ?

					EMMA
			Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts 
			to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea.  
			Propane gas mostly. In small quantities 
			it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone 
			layer. But it proved impractical. 
			Too bulky ...

					STEED
			But if someone miniaturized the
			process...

					EMMA
			That's what we were working on.

					STEED
			Sounds as if someone's hijacked
			your research.

					MOTHER
			Would it be possible to use it for
			military purposes?

					EMMA
			Directed by laser. Bounced by
			satellite. Quite possible.

					STEED
			Where would they aim for?

	Mother thinks, gets out of his wheelchair; takes a turn about the bus, sits down again. 
	No one pays any attention.

					MOTHER
			London. The World Council of Ministers 
			meets soon on global defence. If you can 
			control the weather, you control the world.

					EMMA
			After the cold war ...

					STEED
			The hot and cold war ...

	Sign "Grand Opening Soon."  WIDEN to reveal ...


128     EXT.  WONDERLAND WEATHER OFFICES - DAY

	Steed looks around, picks the lock ... hi-tech style ...


129     INT.  WONDERLAND WEATHER OFFICES - DAY

	A kind of space-age travel agency.  Steed enters.

	At the reception desk, the receptionist has her back turned.  Steed sneaks in, moves
	behind a screen, overhears --

	A man -- Bailey -- giving orders to the receptionist

					BAILEY
			New orders. The penultimate phase. 
			Now fully operational ...

	Steed moves away from them, pushes a set of double doors open, arrives inside --


130     INT.  WONDERLAND OFFICE - DISPLAY - DAY

	A long corridor surrounded by a presentation of --

	Virtual reality weather:  clouds, sunny vistas, lush meadows, desert.  And slogans: 
	"Be natural.  Act natural.  Think natural.  The natural beauty of Wonderland Weather."

	Steed reacts; the model is the same as Emma on the big neon sign near Harrods ...

	Steed finds a desk.  Inspects papers.  Sees a postcard of a large stately home.  He
	pockets it.  Then looks 'round to see --

	Bailey before him.  We recognize him as the young dandy trailing Steed.  Neither gives
	away the other.

					BAILEY
			We're not yet open for business,
			I'm afraid.

					STEED
			Shame. I was recommended. By a
			friend.

					BAILEY
			Really?

					STEED
			Sir August Merryweather? I was
			looking for something relaxing.
			Say, a Tuscan hillside in June?

					BAILEY
			Normally, we'd be eager to
			oblige --

					STEED
			Seriously?  

					BAILEY
			Of course. Natural weather delivered
			to your door on demand. Down your
			phoneline. For limited periods.

					STEED
			You don't say. How real does it feel?

					BAILEY
			As real as you wish. Hot or cold.
			Humid or dry. Anything you like.
			Within reason.

					STEED
			There are limits?

					BAILEY
			The technology is brand new. Soon 
			it will be more powerful. We 
			anticipate a huge demand. Leave us 
			your number. We'll be in touch.

					STEED
			No need. I'll call again.

	Steed raises his bowler.  Bailey watches him go.


131     EXT.  WONDERLAND OFFICES - STREET - DAY

	Steed emerges, stares at his postcard -- the stately home and:  
	"Headquarters, Wonderland Weather, Ltd." as --

					EMMA (V.O.)
			My car. I'll drive.


132     EXT.  COUNTRY ROADS - DAY

	Emma's LOTUS ELAN WHIZZES BY...

					STEED (V.O.)
			A day in the country ...


133     INT.  LOTUS - DAY

					EMMA
			Three agents killed by bad weather...

					STEED
			... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...

					EMMA
				(ignores)
			Then a mad millionaire. Head of a secret 
			defense establishment. A group of 
			eccentrics obsessed by weather ...

					STEED
			... And by you, Mrs. Peel. Everything 
			points to you.  No sisters?  No 
			undiscovered twin?

					EMMA
			Not that I know of.  Explanation?

					STEED
			According to Dr. Darling, you're a 
			psychopathic personality with 
			schizophrenic delusions, suffering from 
			recurring amnesia based on traumatic 
			repression, leading to outbursts of 
			anti-social and violent behavior.  Q.E.D.

	Steed lets it sink in.  Emma looks a little hurt.

					EMMA
			Is that what you think?

					STEED
			Oh, well ...
				(beat)
			Just my type, Mrs. Peel.


134     EXT.  COUNTRY LANES - SEVERAL ANGLES - DAY

	The Lotus races 'round blind corners.  Hairpin bends.  Across a train at a level crossing,
	which just misses them --


135     INT. LOTUS - DAY

	Emma sees Steed hold on for dear life. She smirks --

					STEED
			Do you always drive this fast?

					EMMA
			Have I trespassed on a male
			prerogative?
				(before his reply)
			We're being followed. I saw him
			at Trubshaw's ...

	Steed looks into the mirror, sees a car behind them.  Pulling up, trying to catch up.
	Emma glances in the mirror, and --

					EMMA
			Hold on ...

	Puts foot down.  ZOOM.  Extra ACCELERATION.  Steed's head pinned back to his
	seat.  Emma's hair tossed in the wind.


136     EXT.  COUNTRY LANES - DAY

	The Lotus twisting and turning.  The car behind always catches up.  Emma tries to
	shake it.  Gears up.  Mach force.  Over crossroads.  Shaking 'round corners, as ...


137     BEND

	before Emma pushes foot down.  Further ACCELERATION.  The car behind struggles
	to keep up.  Emma coasts ahead, turns a corner --

	And suddenly sees in front of her --


138     HUGE TRUCK

	crossing directly in their path!

					STEED
			Turn!


139     EMMA

	swerves, plunging the car into a haystack, where it is completely hidden as --


140     TRUCK

	clears in time for the following car, which keeps going.


141     ON HAYSTACK

	as Steed emerges, brushing off straw.  An old lady on a bicycle with a basket appears ...

					OLD LADY
			Are you alright, young man?

					STEED
			I think so, thank you so much ...

	A SQUEAL of TIRES as -

	The following car swerves back, stops and Bailey emerges, gun drawn as Steed and the
	Old Lady react ...

					BAILEY
				(relishing)
			Reach for the sky, pardner.

	Steed raises his hands.

					OLD LADY
			Oh, dear --

	To Steed's surprise, she pulls an Uzi from her basket and

	BANGBANGBANGBANG -- !  SPRAYS BULLETS into Bailey, who crumples, gun
	spinning along the tarmac.  Cute and sweetlooking, the Old Lady is unfazed.

					OLD LADY
			Cocky little bastard. I hope he
			was a baddy.

					STEED
			I feel sure of it.

					OLD LADY
			I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be
			on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?

					STEED
				(looks around)
			She was ...

	They start pulling away hay from the haystack ...

					OLD LADY
			You with Mother or Father?

					STEED
			Both, actually.

					OLD LADY
			Good. Glad to see they're together at last.  
			They don't get along. Promotion. Top job.  
			Most unfair. Quite a fuss at the Ministry.

					STEED
				(not paying attention)
			You don't say.
				(mumbles)
			Like looking for a needle in a ...


142     INSIDE HAYSTACK

	Coughing.  Then Emma, sputtering straw as Steed's face appears.  He tries to conceal
	his relief at seeing her.

					STEED
			What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet
			breathing?

					EMMA
			Barely.

					STEED
			You will let me know if you find
			that queen who's in need of
			protection, won't you?

	He pulls her out.  She's annoyed.

143     OUTSIDE HAYSTACK

	Emma brushes herself off; pulls off a piece of straw.

					EMMA
				(holding it ruefully)
			This must be the last straw.

					STEED
				(takes one off
				her back)
			Here's the one that broke the
			camel's back.

					EMMA
			Someone didn't want us to get to
			the party.

					STEED
			I expect we'll have to gatecrash.

					OLD LADY
			I may be able to help you.


144     EXT.  STATELY HOME FROM POSTCARD - DAY

	comes to life.  Steed, Emma and the Old Lady survey ...

					STEED
				(checks postcard)
			Wonderland Weather Ltd.

					OLD LADY
			This way ...


145     EXT.  HALLUCINOGEN HALL - GROTTO AND MAZE - DAY

	On a lawn, a peacock flares its thousand eye tail.  A MECHANICAL CLICK, its eyes
	conceal hidden cameras, recording Emma, Steed and the Old Lady, who've landed
	inside the walled grounds.  They move stealthily forward, unaware ...

					OLD LADY
			Over here ...

	The Old Lady waves them on.  They enter a tunnel into


146     MAZE

	Tall hedges surround Steed and Emma and the Old Lady on all sides.  They follow the
	path, slopes , round, curves, turns into hairpin bends and U-turns.  At first intrigued ...

	Then perplexed.  Emma leads the way, Steed following.  The Old Lady slips OUT OF
	VIEW.  Steed stops to pick a rose, puts it in his lapel.  Emma rushes ahead.

					EMMA
			Aha ... Yes ... It's clear now. A
			trapezoid shape, dictated by twin
			diagonal paths and a single
			curving path. A late Seventeenth
			Century design, originally for
			King William of Orange, copied...
			Ah ...

	Steed sees Emma slip 'round a corner.  He pursues her.  Glimpses her.  Then loses her.
	Another glimpse.  Sees her thru hedges, then seemingly --

	Thru the other side of the hedge.  In two places at once.

					STEED
			... Mrs. Peel? I think I'm seeing
			double again.

	Out of sight, Emma rushes on.  Around her, the hedges grow taller.  She seems to
	grow smaller.  Emma begins to realize things are not what they seem.  As she pushes
	her way thru --


147     FROM ABOVE

	the maze as a formal patter-n. Three tiny figures dart round.

									
	DISSOLVE THRU TO:


148     INT.  HALLUCINOGEN HALL - CONTROL ROOM - DAY

	A pattern on a screen.  The lines of the maze reformulated as abstract lines.  Steed,
	Emma and the Old Lady as three flashing dots.  Someone, somewhere is watching
	them.  Laughter, then a familiar voice --

					VOICE (O.S.)
			Now this is more like it ...


149     EXT.  MAZE - DAY

	Steed searches for an exit.


150     ANOTHER PART OF MAZE

	Emma sees a statue of a Butler.  Which springs to life.  Summons Emma.  She follows
	down a path strewn with leaves.

	As Emma steps on the leaves, she --

	Falls down -- a giant rabbit hole.


151     INT.  RABBIT HOLE

	Emma spins through darkness, like Alice in Wonderland ...

					EMMA
			Steed ... !

					STEED (V.O.)
			Mrs. Peel ... ?


152     EXT.  MAZE - DAY

	The identical face of Emma on a marble statue, as --

	Steed studies the classical statue ...

					STEED
			Mrs. Peel ... ?

	Steed hears a noise, turns to see --

	Emma walking towards him.  She picks the rose from his lapel, slowly coils an arm
	around his neck.  Pulls Steed towards her, closes her eyes -- kisses him full an the
	mouth.

					STEED
			Mrs. Peel ... !
				(more kiss)
			Mrs. Peel ...

	The kiss ends.  Steed recovers his composure, lips coated with her lipstick.  His tongue
	traces his lips; smarts ...

					STEED
			Your lipstick ...

	Poison.  He goes dizzy.  Steed collapses to the ground.


153     INT.  HALLUCINOGEN HALL - DAY

	Inside the house, a grand hall.  Deserted.  A cobweb hangs from ceiling.  A velvet
	curtain tattered and torn.
	Emma.

	A CUCKOO CLOCK RINGS the hour.  Ahead, the real Emma sees --

	A giant staircase.  There on the stairs -- a glass eye.
	She picks it up.  Puts it in a pocket.  Emma goes --


154     UPSTAIRS

	Sees a series of family portraits an the staircase.  One of herself in ornate aristocratic
	regalia.


155     LONG CORRIDOR UPSTAIRS

	Rooms on either side.  Emma goes down the hall, pushes doors.


156     INSIDE ROOMS

	A mad child's collections of ... toys... rocking horses ... train sets ... ventriloquists'
	dummies... and ...

	Butterflies ... scarabs ... beetles ... glass eyes, staring at her from the blackness ...

	Then Emma turns into a whole room of ...

	Snow shakers ... A wall of them in glass cabinets like insect specimens or fossils. 
	Emma picks up one snow scene.

	She shakes it.


157     EXT.  HOUSE

	as if in response, a storm gathers.  Shadowy clouds roll in.


158     IN MAZE

	A drop of rain starts to fall.  Steed's eyes flicker open.

					STEED
				(re: rain)
			Not again.

	He rises, looks down, reacts --

	Alice, the Old Lady, lies near him in the maze, her neck snapped... Steed kneels, next to
	her in the rain

					OLD LADY
			It's a trap. Tell Mother, beware.
			Tell Father.

	She dies in his arms.

	Wind picks up, too.

	Steed looks about, frowning with discouragement --


159     INT.  HALLUCINOGEN HALL   PLAYROOM - DAY

	THUNDER and lightning outside.  Inside the room of snow shakers, a CHILDHOOD
	TUNE PLAYS.  Emma shakes the snow scene.  The weather seems to grow darker.


160     FROM BEHIND

	Emma hears the unmistakable chilling voice:

					VOICE (V.O.)
			I wouldn't shake that too hard.
			The weather might turn nasty.

	From the shadows ... a man.  A silhouette.  Behind a distorting lens.  His shape and
	face unclear.  Emma puts down the shaker.

					EMMA
			Quite a collection.

					VOICE (V.O.)
			If nature gives a man a collector's mind, 
			it doesn't matter what he collects.  
			Butterflies. Old China. Penny farthings. 
			A true collector grows more obsessive 
			as the years pass.

	Outside the big window the weather is turning nasty ...

					EMMA
			Your voice -- it's so familiar ...

					VOICE (V.O.)
			We have met ...

	From the shadows, a man moves out, revealing:

	Peter Peel, Emma's husband!  THUNDER.

					EMMA
			Peter ... ?

	Instinctively Emma moves towards him.  A long pause.

					EMMA
			I must be dreaming ...

	Emma pulls back.  Before she can turn, Peter takes her hand, places it over his heart. 
	BA-BOOM, BA-BOOM, BA-BOOM ...

					PETER
			Listen... Very much alive.

	Peter touches her hand.  Emma looks into his eyes.  Intrigued but alarmed, disbelief. 
	Peter raises her hand to his lips.

					PETER
			Darling, it's me...

	Emma shudders, battles with herself.

					EMMA
			Peter ...

	Emma is tempted, yet filled with terror.


161     CLOSEUP - EMMA'S EYES

	Inside her pupil --

									
		FLASH CUTS TO:


162     MEMORY FLASHES

	His face as he kissed her -- his ring on her finger -the visor cracking -- the glass
	obscuring his face.


163     BACK TO SCENE

					EMMA
			Impossible ... how?

	Peter smiles disarmingly.  As if the answer was obvious.

					PETER
			For you ... all for you ...

	Peter comes over, folds her in his arms.  Takes her head between his hands.  Emma
	leans over to him, about to kiss him, both closing their eyes, until --

	Lips parted.  Before they kiss, Emma pulls back --

					PETER
			Don't be afraid, darling.

	She turns, runs to the door.  Like a trapped bird.  She tries the door -- locked.  Another
	door -- locked.  A window -- locked.

					PETER
			Don't run away. I forgive you, 
			Emma. I know you left me. But 
			I still love you. Do you still have 
			my ring? I need it.

	Peter grabs hold of Emma.  She pulls away.  Emma sees his face before her, pleading
	with her.  Seductive yet nightmarish.

	As if hallucinating, Emma runs away, towards --

	The big window overlooking the gardens.  She runs, leaps, and in SLOW MOTION --

	Crashes thru the GLASS, shards and splinters SHATTERING all 'round her, as she --


164     EXT.  HALLUCINOGEN HALL - WINDOW - DAY

	somersaults through the window down to the ground.  Lands with a THUD on the wet
	ground.  Looks up to see --

	Steed above her, the STORM RAGING.

					EMMA
			Steed!

	She struggles to her feet, comes towards him, upset.

					STEED
			Oh, no. First time, shame on
			you. Third time, shame on me.

	He slugs her and the SCREEN GOES BLACK.

					DR. DARLING (V.O.) 
			Diagnosis confirmed.  Mrs. Peel is 
			suffering from delusions and 
			hallucinations. An extreme personality 
			disorder. She imagines her husband 
			Peter Peel has come back to her ...

	CLOSE ON Emma's face.

					DR. DARLING (V.O.) 
			A classic syndrome, to overcome her 
			subconscious guilt at her other crimes.  
			We've attached her to the dreamscape 
			machine. We'll soon see what her 
			unconscious looks like...

	Emma's eyes flicker...

	Steed comes INTO FOCUS, sitting by Emma's bed.  This time he's eating her grapes ...

	Emma looks around ... Everything blurs.  A STEADY PULSE DRONE.  Tugs at
	leather straps.  No use.  WIDEN to reveal Emma strapped to a special couch --

	Her head surrounded by a plastic dome, terminals and wires leading out into a
	Dreamscape machine.  Drowsy, disoriented.

					EMMA
			Where am I?

					STEED
			The Winslow Home for Retired
			Lepidoptorists. I'm so sorry
			I struck you, Mrs. Peel. Please
			forgive me. I thought you were
			someone else ...

					EMMA
			Was I?

					STEED
				(no smile)
			I expect that's for you to know
			and me to find out ...

					EMMA
			It was Peter -- I saw him ...

	Drugged, Emma's eyes drop.  FOCUS CHANGES TO --


165     ABOVE HER

	A giant spiral HYPNODISC WHIRRS, creating trippy black and white zig zag op-art
	effects a la Bridget Riley.

	She blinks.

									
		DISSOLVE TO:


166     SAME SCENE - LATER

	Steed is gone.  Dr. Darling leans over her.  Emma stares at the hypnodisc.  Closes her
	eyes.


167     EXTREME CLOSEUP ON HER EYES

	Thousand REMs per sec -- a tiny chip next to her eyes, transmitting out via wires to --


168     UP ON WALL

	A "Dreamscape" apparatus like a liquid TV screen flicks thru random images from
	Emma's unconscious.  Peter Peel -- Teddy Bears -- post card views -- childhood 
	snaps --


169     BESIDE "BED"

	Dr. Darling furls his hand over Emma's, his fingers resting upon her ring.  During the
	interrogation, he soothingly strokes her hand -- tries to remove the ring without
	arousing her suspicion.  Pulls gently on it.


170     UP IN GALLERY

	In his wheelchair, Mother sits beside Steed.

					MOTHER
			This man -- did you see him?

					STEED
			No. Her husband, she says. Alice
			tried to warn us. A trap. Tell
			Mother beware. Tell Father
			That's all.


171     BY COUCH

	Dr. Darling leans forward to interrogate Emma.


172     FROM HER POV

	He looks and sounds sinister.  From a corner of her eye, she sees -- a clip of keys
	hanging from his pocket.


173     BACK TO SCENE

					DR. DARLING
			I want you to say the first thing
			that comes into your head when I
			say these words. Do you
			understand ... ?
				(as she nods)
			Blue ...

					EMMA
			... bottle ...

					DR. DARLING
			Red ...

					EMMA
			... head ...

	
					DR.  DARLING
			White ...


					EMMA
			Knight ...

					DR. DARLING
			Black...

					EMMA
			... death ...

					DR. DARLING
			Love...

					EMMA
			... death ...

	Steed watching, listening ...

					DR. DARLING
			Flower ...

					EMMA
			... power ...

	The exchange speeds up.  Unknown to Dr. Darling, Emma picks his keys; unlocks her
	straps.

					DR. DARLING
			Nature ...

					EMMA
			... preserve...

					DR. DARLING
			Secret ...

					EMMA
			... love...

					DR. DARLING
			Hope...

					EMMA
			... love ...

					DR. DARLING
			Fear ...

					EMMA
			... love ...

					DR. DARLING
			Peter ...

	As Emma talks, the "Dreamscape" plucks images from her unconscious in trippy
	psychedelic rush:  faces -- colors -- patterns flash past.

					EMMA
			... Piper picked a peck of pickled 
			peppers how many pecks of pickled 
			peppers did Peter Peel -- ?


174     CLOSEUP - EMMA

	Quietly unclicks a lock.  She stops in mid-gabble.

					EMMA
			How long have I been here?

					DR. DARLING
			Three days.

	Emma unlocks her straps.  Sits Up.  Woozy.

					EMMA
			Do you get paid by the hour?

	Dr. Darling is shocked, indignant.  Emma rips wires from her body.  The "Dreamscape"
	machine winds down.  Up in the gallery --

	BAM -- !  Mother bashes his metal cane on the railings

					MOTHER
				(filtered)
			You are here under observation, 
			Mrs. Peel. You must answer Dr. 
			Darling's questions

	Pushes Dr. Darling aside.

					EMMA
			I resign.

					MOTHER
				(filtered)
			You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You
			can't resign.

					EMMA
			Watch me.

	Emma staggers.  Mother looks at Steed.  Who snaps himself out of staring at the
	hypnodisc.

	Emma heads for the airlock door marked:

	"ANTI-GRAVITY CHAMBER -- NO ADMITTANCE"

					MOTHER
			Don't open that, Mrs. Peel!

	Fat chance ... she goes in ...


175     INT.  ANTI-GRAVITY CHAMBER

	Emma floats in the air, as Mother, Dr. Darling and Steed all follow.  And float
	helplessly, turning around madly.  Trying to gain on Emma.  Mother's wheelchair,
	Steed's umbrella and bowler, all tumble thru the air as Steed tries to reach the "OFF"
	switch

					EMMA
				(echoing)
			What are you trying to do to me?

					MOTHER
				(flailing)
			We want to help...!

					EMMA
			I thought I was a widow. My
			husband ... the only man I ever
			loved ... is dead. For the rest
			of my life I have to live with
			that.

					MOTHER
			The death of Peter Peel was a
			great loss. To us all ...

					EMMA
			To you ... ?

	Mother looks at Emma.  He's let the cat out the bag.  Steed finds the "OFF" switch.
	They all tumble to the floor, Mother landing perfectly in his wheelchair,
	Steed effortlessly catching his hat and umbrella.  He moves to Mother --

					STEED
			I think you owe Mrs. Peel an
			explanation ...

	Steed stares Mother out.  Who delivers his revelations.

					MOTHER
			Peter Peel was a first class agent.
			A senior operative.
			'X' department Special operations.  
			He was engaged in top secret research.  
			Top priority.  Government approved.

					EMMA
			The Institute ... the funding ...

					MOTHER
			A cover ... for us.
				(beat)
			I'm sorry...

	A turning moment for Emma.  A life lived on a lie.

					EMMA
			So all that time. Our work, our research 
			was for you ... for this? And the 
			accident --

					DARLING
			It was no accident.

					EMMA
			The official investigation ...

					MOTHER
			... was written by me.
				(beat)
			It was sabotage, Mrs. Peel.

	Deadly serious, Emma walks over to him.

					EMMA
			Who?

					MOTHER
			Quite frankly ... it could have
			been you.

	Silence.  Emma looks away, shocked.  Steed intervenes

					STEED
			You're accusing Mrs. Peel of
			killing her own husband?

					MOTHER
			Her husband suspected someone very 
			close to the operation. On the day he 
			died, he was setting a test.
			To prove to himself -- to us that his 
			wife was beyond suspicion. He had to 
			be certain. He said he was going to 
			give Mrs. Peel something ...

	Emma keeps staring at Mother, fingers her diamond ring.

					MOTHER
			... I want you to remember. Did
			Peter give you anything on-that 
			day?


176     CLOSEUP - EMMA

	touches her ring.


177     BACK TO SCENE

	Emma looks up at Mother.  A barefaced lie.

					EMMA
			No.

	Steed notices Emma touch her ring nervously.

					DR. DARLING
			He said if it vanished, he'd know
			it was ... you who betrayed him.
			He took a huge risk. The ultimate
			test.

					EMMA
			So I'm still ...

					MOTHER
			Under suspicion. Everyone died in 
			the explosion, Mrs. Peel. You were 
			the only survivor ...

	Mother waits.  Emma turns round.  Looks fiercely at him.  Mother shifts uneasily as
	Emma walks past him to the airlock.

					MOTHER
			This is an official matter, Mrs.
			Peel. No need to take it
			personally. Where are you going?

					EMMA
			To find out who killed my husband.

					MOTHER
			The doors and walls are monitored, 
			Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure 
			establishment.

					EMMA
			So am I.

	Emma pushes open the doors.  Walks out.  Down a corridor.  Dr. Darling grabs
	Mother, as he exits with Steed --

					DR. DARLING
			She must remain here. She's
			highly dangerous.


178     IN HALL - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Mother exits with Steed; they watch Emma going ...

					MOTHER
			Pity. I was growing fond of Mrs.
			Peel. Unfortunately --

					STEED
			Guilty until proven innocent?

					MOTHER
			Mother and Father know best.

	Mother wheels himself off.  Then stops; over his shoulder:

					MOTHER
			Something quick. Nothing too ...
			messy.

	ON Steed.  CAR ROAR over as --


179     EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE CLINIC - DAY

	Emma drives a hot-wired Morris Minor out the open gates of the manor house, past a
	sign which reads:

	"WINSLOW HOME FOR RETIRED LEPIDOPTORISTS" (Butterfly logo)

	In the b.g., a couple of old-timers race around with butterfly nets as Steed's jag pulls
	past them in hot pursuit.


180     EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

	Emma speeds down lanes ...

	Followed at a safe distance by Steed in his SS100.


181     INT.  STEED'S JAG - DAY

	Steed looks: a bleep on his radar screen tracks the --


182     CLOSEUP - CONCEALED MICRO-BUG - INTERCUT

	on Emma's shoulder as she drives ...


183     EXT.  LANES - DAY

	The cars whiz past ...


184     INT.  STEED'S JAG - DAY

	Keeping an eye on his radar and the road, Steed switches on the radio.  The weather
	forecast:

					RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			'... Sunny intervals leading to
			sudden storms and gale warnings
			for all areas.
				(as he frowns)
			... Outbursts of rain, scattered
			hailstorms and freezing fog
			greeted the World Council of
			Ministers as they arrived in
			London for their conference ...'

	Emma drives into a churchyard.  Steed follows her ...


185     INT.  COUNTRY CHURCH - DAY	

	A medieval country church.  Sunlight streams through stained glass, illumining Emma
	as Steed watches her lay --

	A red rose by an altar tomb:  an ornate mausoleum two hands clasped in a pose of
	eternal sleep:  Peter Peel.

	Emma pauses, as in the b.g., choirboys sing hymn practice.  Steed watches Emma move
	away, toward the door.  He drops a hymn book.  Emma swivels round -- sees Steed.

					EMMA
			You followed me.

					STEED
			Orders.

					EMMA
			To kill me?

					STEED
				(fractional pause)
			Nothing personal.

	Emma smiles. Then turns, and --

	Runs!  Steed follows Emma through a door to --


186     INT.  CHURCH BELL TOWER - DAY

	Steed enters, glimpses --

	Emma above.  He follows her.  Hears her footsteps.  Trip- trapping up the spiral
	staircase.  Steed listens, follows.


187     UP BELLTOWER

	From below, Steed hears a BELL RING.  A FLUTTER of BIRDS.  As debris falls
	down -- Steed runs up stairs, reaches --


188     EXT.  BELLTOWER TOP - DAY

	BELL still RINGING.  At the top, a sheer drop.  Steed edges closer to the ledge. 
	Looks.  A long way down.
	From behind --

					EMMA
			A long way down.

	Steed swivels.  Sees Emma blocking his path.  Cool menace.  Steed steps away from
	the edge, Emma circles him.

					STEED
			Careful. You might fall.

	Emma steps to the edge.  Steed freezes.  Emma locks down.  Feet resting on the ledge. 
	Rocking to and fro ...

					EMMA
			I could save you the trouble.

					STEED
			No trouble.

					EMMA
			Because you always obey orders ...

					STEED
			Always.
				(pause)
			Except ...

	Steed nears her.  Emma pushes herself right to the edge.

					EMMA
			Yes ... ?

					STEED
			... when I don't. It comes down to one 
			thing, Mrs. Peel. Trust.

	Steed reaches out for her.  Holds out his hand.

					EMMA
			And do you trust me?

					STEED
			I could be convinced, if ... I knew who 
			poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...

					EMMA
			It wasn't me; you have my word.

	Steed snatches her from the edge, holds her in his arms.

					STEED
			I need proof.

	Emma thinks.  Looks at him.  Deadly serious.  Their eyes lock.  She hesitates, then
	pecks him on the cheek.

					STEED
			It was longer. On the lips.

	Emma hesitates.  Then a kiss on the lips.  Longer.  But not much.  Steed grabs her
	hand, pulls her back.

					STEED
			Much longer.  Approximately ...
			fifteen seconds.

	Emma harumphs, exasperated.  Moves closer to him.

					EMMA
			... Ready?

	Steed nods.  Emma leans forward.  A full kiss.  At first reticent ... Emma looks at her
	watch.  Counts seconds ...

					EMMA
			... Four ... seven ... ni-...

	Then ... forgets.  Warmer, more relenting.  Edging towards passionate.  They stay
	embracing for fifteen seconds ...

					EMMA
				(aroused)
			Mmm ... what are you doing?

					STEED
			Keeping a stiff upper lip?

					EMMA
			Is that all?

	The kiss continues couple of seconds longer.  Before Emma withdraws.  With an effort,
	she regains her composure.  A long silence.

					EMMA
			So I'm in the clear?

	Steed savors the kiss.  No reply.  His smile says it all.

					EMMA
			But you did suspect me.

					STEED
			Not for a moment.

					EMMA
			You're playing games.

					STEED
			Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?

					EMMA
			I thought you played by the rules.

					STEED
			I thought you didn't.

					EMMA
			I'm playing to win.

					STEED
			Winning isn't everything.

					EMMA
			Please don't tell me it's how you
			play the game.

					STEED
				(smiles; stands
				aside)
			After you -- Mrs. Peel ...

	Steed motions down the stairs.  It's close to the edge.

					EMMA
			No, after you.

					STEED
				(back to square
				one)
			You don't trust me?

					EMMA
			As far as you trust me.

	Emma motions.  Steed goes down, passes close to the edge, and swivels round
	nervously.  Emma reads his thoughts.

					EMMA
			When it happens, Steed, you'll be
			the first to know ...

	With this comforting thought, Steed descends first.


189     EXT.  CHURCH TOWER - DAY

	As Steed and Emma exit from the tower, they see --

	A tranquil village scene.  Choirboys walk out from the church.  Nearby in the deserted
	village street.  A red PHONE BOX.  Which ...

	RING-RING ... Starts to RING.

					EMMA
			Who could that be?

	A ROLL of THUNDER.  Steed looks up: a clear sky.  He's puzzled.  Suddenly
	suspicious.  As Emma moves to the phone.

					STEED
			No -- don't answer it ...

	He pulls her back.  Emma looks at him.

					STEED
			That's it. The phones trigger
			the explosions --

	RING-RING ... Another ROLL of THUNDER.  Steed connects the two as -- an
	angelic CHOIRBOY walks towards the phone ...

	RING-RING ... A LOUDER ROLL of THUNDER.  As the Choirboy nears the
	PHONE, Steed shouts --

					STEED
		Don't -- don't answer it -- !


190     CLOSEUP - PHONE

	RING-RING -- the PHONE in the f.g. as the choirboy closes in, opens the door --


191     INSIDE PHONE BOX

	The door shuts.  Noise muffled.  The Choirboy can't hear Steed and Emma's shouted
	warnings, as he lifts his hand up, and --


192     OUTSIDE

	Steed sees him reach out, warns the vicar and choirboys.

					STEED
			Get down -- get down -- it's
			going to explode -- !

	Steed and Emma, all the choirboys hit the dirt, as


193     INSIDE PHONE BOX

	The Choirboy grabs the phone, and lifts it up, and

	Silence.

	No explosion.  A few seconds pass.  Steed and everyone
	are down on the ground.  As they see --


194     FROM PHONE BOX	

	-- the Choirboy leaves the phone hanging.  He gets out, scans the crowd.  Then walks
	calmly over to Steed, who's still prone.

					CHOIRBOY
			It's your mother.

	The vicar and choirboys look on sympathetically, as --

	Steed dusts himself off.  Emma and everyone gets up.  Steed goes to the phone box,
	takes the call.

					STEED
			Mother? How did you find me?

	His expression changes as he listens.  Emma goes to the phone box as Steed rings off.
	He emerges from the box.

					STEED
			I told Mother I took care of you.

					EMMA
			You lied.

					STEED
			I equivocated. But you're not
			their big worry at present. It's
			Dr. Darling:  he's disappeared ...

	OFF Emma's reaction to this news --


195     INT.  HALLUCINOGEN HALL - DAY

	Inside the upper room, in front of a mirror --

	With his back turned to us.  Dr. Darling holds something in his hand, and waits as --


196     DOWN LONG HALL

	Bad "Emma" walks over.  She stands in front of him.

	Blank expression.  Dr. Darling hardly even looks up.  With her hair up, we recognize
	on her neck a tattoo:  Z424.

					DR. DARLING
			We are in the final phase. I shall require 
			you to be especially obedient. There 
			must be no failures.


197     CLOSEUP - IN HIS HANDS - SNOWSHAKER

	which he grips tightly. As --


198     IN MIRROR

	a metamorphosis.  His features melt and bubble, a mask of plastic surgery and it's
	slipping around like Michael Jackson's face under kleig lights.  He adjusts it, then ...

	Shakes the snowshaker ...


199     EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

	THUNDER as the sky darkens -- PAN DOWN to reveal:

	Steed's Jag, zooming through country lanes.  Rain starts.


200     INT.  JAG - DAY

	Steed driving, winces with the drizzle.

					STEED
			Drat. Someone wants to implicate
			you in this affair, Mrs. Peel.
			Any idea who?

					EMMA
			No idea who. No idea why ...

					STEED
				(thinks)
			Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys
			All children's things ...

					EMMA
			... Or grown-ups, who still like
			to be children.

					STEED
			Quite. Any childhood friends?
			Enemies?

					EMMA
			Not to speak of. Peter and I
			were both loners. There was
			nobody.

	Steed thinks; sighs.

					STEED
			Very well. I have a friend who
			might be of assistance. He's at
			the Ministry. We'd better be
			careful.

					EMMA
			I'm a wanted woman, I know ...


201     INT.  MINISTRY CORRIDORS - DAY

	Through a door marked "Information & Counter Espionage" --

	-- walks Steed with another man in identical clothes:  dapper Savile Row suit, umbrella
	and bowler.  Which is

	Emma Peel, in disguise.  Steed furtively checks passers-by.

					STEED
			His name's Jones. 'Invisible' Jones.

					EMMA
			Why's he called 'Invisible'?

					STEED
			You'll find out.

	At a door marked "Information -- Col. I. Jones." Steed knocks, opens the door for her.

					EMMA
			Aren't you coming?

					STEED
			I'll catch you up. Don't worry;
			he's expecting you.

	Emma goes in as Steed walks down the corridor.


202     INT.  MINISTRY OFFICE - DAY

	A room full of archives and files.  Emma walks through tall corridors, stacks of cabinets
	full of old paper.

	Dusty, musty and mildewing.  Long forgotten.  Nobody there.  Suddenly Emma 
	hears --

	FOOTSTEPS.

	She follows them.  Round stacks, round corners.  The FOOTSTEPS get LOUDER. 
	She's closing in.  The FOOTSTEPS get LOUDER, until up ahead of her --

	A filing cabinet drawer opens up.  On its own.

	Emma watches as a file pops up, floats through air.  The drawer slams shut.  Still
	nobody there.  Emma follows the file to a --

	Desk.  Emma watches as -- the chair swivels round.  The file pages open up.  Then the
	phone lifts up by itself, a voice:

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Tell Miss Proudfoot, no calls.
				(beat)
			Colonel Jones at your service,
			Mrs. Peel. Just a moment --

	Emma looks ahead of her.  To the chair. As --

	A desk drawer opens up, a pipe is whisked through the air, a match is struck.  The pipe
	lights; smoke belches forth.

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Talk to the pipe, Mrs. Peel.
			That usually helps. Don't worry
			about me being invisible. Other
			than that I'm perfectly normal.

					EMMA
			I see.

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Or rather, you don't. Learnt the
			tricks in camouflage. Till this
			accident made a prang of things.
			How can I help you, Mrs. Peel?


203     INT.  MINISTRY - ANOTHER OFFICE

	Steed on the phone.

					STEED
			I say, Trubshaw, Steed here ...
			Barometer's falling fast. Mrs.
			Peel and I find ourselves in
			need of foul weather gear.
				(beat)
			Yes, I'd say gentlemen's snuff
			for starters. And then --


204     INT.  INVISIBLE JONES' OFFICE

	File pages flip through the air as Jones goes through them.

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Ah, here we are. Steed asked me
			to play a hunch:  Valentine Peel.

					EMMA
			Peter's brother?  But --

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Half-brother to be precise.

	Emma is surprised.

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Now let's see ... Eton, Cambridge ... 
			research into robotics and plastics.  
			Overtaken by Peter's work on the 
			physics of climate change ...

					EMMA
			I know all this.

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.) 
			Do you also know that during your 
			final experiment, your halfbrother-
			in-law was under surveillance?

					EMMA
			Surveillance? By whom?

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Father. She gave him an 'all clear' 
			after a security test by Dr. Darling.

					EMMA
			Who's now vanished.

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Makes two of us.

					EMMA
			Are you suggesting that Dr. Darling 
			and Valentine were somehow in this 
			together? But that's absurd.

	Steed enters behind them on the run --

					STEED
			We must hurry, Mrs. Peel ...

					EMMA
			Hurry?  What for?  I'm just
			now --

					STEED
			You didn't tell her?

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
				(testy)
			I was getting to it.

					EMMA
			Getting to what?

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			The World Council of Ministers meets 
			tomorrow to convene the new global 
			defense initiative --

					EMMA
			I fail to see --

					STEED
			There's a reception this evening. Colonel 
			Jones thinks it advisable we attend.

					EMMA
			Have we been invited?

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
				(poker-voiced)
			Under the circumstances Mother didn't 
			see fit, but I think I can get you in ...

					EMMA
				(surveys her male
				outfit)
			Well, I can't possibly go like this.

					STEED
			I had a feeling. That's why we're 
			in a hurry ...

	Steed proffers an arm to Emma.

					STEED
			May I have the honor, Mrs. Peel?

	She decides, takes his arm.

					EMMA
			You may, Mr. Steed.

	The A-team is born.  Steed and Emma tip their hats to Jones.


205     EXT.  LONDON STREETS - SEVERAL ANGLES - NIGHT

	Troops rushing in to take up defense positions.  Searchlights pierce the cloudy sky.  A
	protective ring of hardware surrounds the hall.


206     INT.  MOTHER'S 22 BUS (AKA INSIDE MOBILE HQ) - NIGHT

	At the controls, Brenda looks on.  She hands a bag of jelly babies to Mother.  Who
	picks out his favorites, as he gives a briefing to Father and others, sitting in
	passenger seats --

	ORDERS BARKED OUTSIDE as --

					MOTHER
			Inside that hall are some of the
			Most powerful figures in the
			world. Tight security. Our
			only option.

					FATHER
			I'll see to it personally.

	Brenda glances over at Father's imperturbable face. As --


207     EXT.  PALACE (WESTMINSTER) - NIGHT

	Wind picking up.  Outside the grand palace hall for the reception of the World Council
	of Ministers, guards stand on duty.  Barriers, flashing lights.  Nobody gets past, 
	except --


208     INT.  PALACE (WESTMINSTER) - NIGHT

	Up in the gallery, Steed and Emma enter through a secret passage behind a painting. 
	He with bowler and umbrella.  She in black leather and boots.  They find themselves in
	a niche and freeze, very close to one another.  Steed sniff s ...

					STEED
			What's that you're wearing?

					EMMA
			It's called Black Leather.

					STEED
			Intoxicating. Here, have one of
			these.

	He fumbles with a bulging jacket pocket

					EMMA
			What is it?

					STEED
			Limpet bomb. Small, very
			compact. From Trubshaw's.

					EMMA
				(hocks it on
				belt)
			When all this is over, we simply
			must get you out of that suit.

					STEED
			You first.

					EMMA
			Shall we?

	She leads the way through marble halls, arched galleries, red velvet carpets, glittering
	chandeliers.  From the hall, a SPEECH ECHOES:

					MINISTER (V.O.)
			... In the uncertain climate that threatens 
			this global initiative, no magic umbrella 
			can shield us.

	Steed checks out his own.

					MINISTER (V.O.)
			Only our own vigilance. Security and 
			stability are our watchwords.

	APPLAUSE.

	Steed pauses, offers Emma a small silver box.  Inside...

					EMMA
			Trubshaw again? What now?

					STEED
			Snuff.
				(off Emma's lock)
			I must insist you try some.

	Steed takes some; Emma follows his example.  Weird.  Does it make you high?  They
	walk on, open doors to --


209     INT.  PALACE HALLWAY - NIGHT

	An empty gallery.  Steed and Emma peer down at a --


210     MARBLE HALLWAY

	A black and white floor.  Butlers move across like surreal chess pieces.  Otherwise,
	empty.  A chamber ensemble plays "The Merry Widow" waltz, which floats through
	empty halls.

					STEED
			They're playing your song, Mrs.
			Peel.

					EMMA
				(annoyed)
			'The Merry Widow?' I might have
			known. Where's the reception?

	They move cautiously forward as


211     EXT.  LONDON STREETS - NIGHT

	Outside, snow begins to fall.  Trees and buildings shimmer under a light layer of white. 
	A Christmassy glow --

	Even troops play with snowflakes, until --


212     SEVERAL ANGLES

	The wind rises.  The snow falls harder.


213     INT.  PALACE - NIGHT

	Down in the hallway, Steed and Emma search for the Ministers.  They head down a 
	corridor, then hear a NOISE.  They hide behind pillers. As --

	Butlers walk past in military file, carrying elaborate displays of lobster and meats. 
	Steed steals --

	A chicken leg.  Nibbles on it.  Suddenly another door opens -- Emma hides.  Steed
	looks up to see -- Father "staring" at him.

					STEED
			Oh, hello ...

					FATHER
			We want Mrs. Peel.

					STEED
			Dead, I'm afraid.

	Emma in hiding, listens as --

					FATHER (O.S.)
			You disobeyed an order, Steed.  
			Mrs. Peel is dangerous; she cannot 
			be trusted.

	Emma looks out the window behind her; eyes widen ... back to --

					STEED (O.S.)
			I think she can.
				(beat)
			Can you?

	Emma is deeply affected by Steed's choice.

	Father's face, meantime, has turned to stone.

					FATHER
			I shall summon security.

	She turns, almost walks into the door as she slips away.

	Emma returns as the ALARM is raised --

					STEED
			Bad news. Father's looking for you.  
			Where are those bloody ministers?

					EMMA
			Have a look at this.

	She leads him to the window:  sure enough -- heavy snow.
	Steed reacts, eyes wide.

					STEED
			It's almost May, for heaven sake.


214     EXT.  LONDON STREETS - NIGHT

	The blizzard rages through streets --

	Now impassable.  Snow drifts block roads.  White mountains of snow start to climb up
	shop fronts.  And amid the sky --

	Filled with snowflakes, up round the roofs, a purple cloud descends on unsuspecting
	troops --


215     INT.  PALACE - NIGHT

	Steed returns, rushes across the marble halls --

	To Emma. But up ahead, sees --


216     STEED'S POV - FROM WINDOWS

	A purple fog seeping into the hallway, billowing through the corridors as --


217     INT.  PALACE ANTEROOM - NIGHT

	Inside an anteroom, like a Roman arena -- marble pillars, red carpet, golden walls,
	ceiling murals --

	The World Council ministers assemble:  slick pin-striped suits or African robes, Chinese
	Mao-suits, Indian Nehru-jackets, all distinguished men and women, surrounded by --

	Fussing officials, minor dignitaries, and butlers, bowing and weaving a web of
	diplomatic protocol, interrupted by --


218     CENTER OF HALL

	The sight of Emma Peel in black leather.

	She strides into the room.  Picks a glass of champagne from a passing butler.  All stare,
	Emma raises her glass --

					EMMA
			Gentlemen, ladies. Forgive the breach 
			of protocol. An emergency --

	From the hallway -- BOOM -- !  The door bursts open, Emma is blown over by the
	blast as the purple cloud races inside.


219     SEVERAL ANGLES

	as the smoke furls around the ministers, they choke, fall.

	From the doors -- Steed leaps in, gives Emma another snort of snuff --

					STEED
			Quick --it'll protect you --

	Emma inhales.  Now immune to the gas, Steed and Emma hear -- CRASH -- !  They
	see -- through thick cloud -a mysterious man in a white lab coat, wearing a gas mask,
	leading a group of butlers, all in gas masks -- heads like black flies -- in formation
	round the ministers, helpless on the floor.  A kidnapping --

	The man and butlers haul away several ministers, and --

	Escape from the rear doors.  The butlers form a guard to protect the man.

	Steed and Emma run after them.  More butlers pursue.


220     EXT.  PALACE - NIGHT

	As troops roll helplessly in the snow-covered purple haze, the butlers load the ministers
	onto waiting choppers as --


221     INT.  MOTHER'S HQ - CONTINUOUS ACTION	

	Mother, Brenda, et al choke on purple smoke in the bus ...


222     INT.  PALACE HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Behind pillars, Steed and Emma hide as --

	Butlers in gas masks patrol the halls.  A butler passes them without noticing.  They try
	to emerge.  But another patrols --

	Steed trips the butler with his umbrella, then chops him down on the ground.  He rises
	but Emma kicks him into as --

	Behind them Steed sees the lab-coated man escape up the stairs, protected by a posse
	of butlers.  He shouts --

					STEED
			After him, Mrs. Peel!

	A whole posse of butlers then advances.  Steed faces them.

					STEED
			Go -- !

	Emma hesitates.  Then turns, heads for an ornate dual shaft elevator.  She bangs the
	button, gets inside, doors shut, as the BULLETS from MACHINE-GUNNING gas
	masked butlers strike the brass door as --

	Steed whips his rapier from his umbrella and duels with the butlers.  To give Emma
	time, he uses every trick and prop at his disposal, plus, brute force to --

	Kick, chop, punch, and impale them into submission, as --


223     EXT.  ELEVATOR (UPPER FLOORS) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	The posse of butlers fan out on to keep pace with Emma.  They head upstairs, pressing
	elevator "CALL" buttons on every floor, as --


224     INSIDE ELEVATOR	

	Emma waits inside.  Until she reaches --


225     EXT.  ELEVATOR (2ND FLOOR) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Doors open.  A HAIL of BULLETS hit the lift as Emma hides to one side until the
	doors close.


226     INT.  ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Emma sighs with relief.  COOL HUM as the ELEVATOR rises.


227     ON STAIRS - MEANWHILE

	Steed gaining on the butlers, heading for the stairs, as --

228     INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	At the next floor, the doors open --

	Two butlers rush inside.  BLAM -- !  Emma cuts one in the throat with an elbow
	punch,  then --

	Punches -- kicks -- stabs the other butler, a more brutish type, who recovers enough to
	grab Emma by the throat.

	She chokes, breaks his stranglehold, swerves him round, gains a nelson hold on his
	arms and throat --

	And a knee in his back in time for --

	PING!  The BELL RINGS at --

	3rd floor where --

	Emma spins her captive butler round, in time to face --

	Whooomph!  a blast of fire from --

	A flamethrower launched in the hall.

	Aaargh -- !  The butler gets fried, but --


229     EXT.  ELEVATOR (3RD FLOOR) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Shields Emma from the worst of the blast. She  hurls him clear of the doors, which --


230     INT.  ELEVATORS - CONTINUOS ACTION

	Slam shut.  COOL HUM ...


231     EXT.  PALACE MAIN FLOOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Steed continues his one-sided duel with the other butlers, skewering madly, trying to
	get upstairs to help Emma...


232     INT.  ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Up Emma goes.  Looks for an escape route.  Bangs on the walls.  No trap doors.  No
	secret panels.  The "floor" light flickers between floors.

	Waiting, until ...


233     EXT.  ELEVATOR (4TH FLOOR) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	The doors open.  A grenade is hurled inside the doors, it rolls to one corner, Emma
	dives to the other side, then --

	Scrambles for the grenade.  Picks it up.  It slips out of her hands.  Scrambles more.  It
	slips out ...

	Just beyond the elevator doors.  Which start to shut.  Emma leans out a foot, kicks the
	grenade towards the butlers, and --

	As her elevator doors close --

	BOOM -- !  It EXPLODES among the butlers, one of whom --

	Rushes to --


234     ELEVATOR (5TH FLOOR) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Where he waits for the elevator.  Removes pin.  Grenade ready.  The light PINGS.
	Doors open.  About to throw it inside, when --


235     BUTLER'S POV

	No Emma.


236     BACK TO SCENE

	The butler hesitates.  Looks inside.  Still no Emma?  He wonders what to do, and --

	The doors shut; he jams his foot.  The doors open again.  He moves in --


237     INT.  ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	-- and looks round.  Nobody there.  Until, as we --

	PULL BACK UP to reveal -- FROM ABOVE, spread-eagled like an X on the elevator
	roof, limbs flexed against the walls is --

	Emma, who -- drops down and --

	Scissors the butler's head between her legs.

	The grenade rolls free ...

	Emma twists around, grabs his ears, and --

	Sits on his face.  Buries his head in her crotch.  A muffled sound from the guy, until --

	Emma scissor kicks, breaking his neck.  She drags --


238     EXT.  ELEVATOR (67H FLOOR) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	His head out.  Leaving his neck between the doors.  So as she leaps out, heads up for
	the stairs, the elevators doors.

	SLAM! And -- BOOM!  His GRENADE rocks the elevator, which


239     INT.  ELEVATOR SHAFT - ABOVE AND BELOW - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Breaks from its ropes, and --

	Plummets down the elevator shaft, shaking the building as it crashes --


240     INT.  PALACE STAIRS - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Everything shakes with the impact of the elevator as Steed battles his way up, step by
	step, throwing gas-masked butlers over his shoulder as he struggles...


241     INT.  PALACE ATTIC - NIGHT

	Up the winding staircase, at the top, a skylight, which --

	Flips open.  The man leaps out, throwing back inside a smoke grenade, and locks the
	skylight.  As the grenade --


242     INT.  NARROW STAIRCASE

	BOOM!  explodes in the narrow staircase, fills it with purple smoke.  Emma rushes
	thru smoke, choking.  She gets to the skylight, tries to open it -- locked.

	A moment's panic.  Then Emma -- punches a hole in the glass, flicks the switch, flips
	the skylight up, and --

	Emerges into the night air.  Snowflakes tumble around her.


243     EXT.  ROOFTOP - HELIPAD - NIGHT

	Blades whirling.  Amid the blizzard, the man ready to escape in a super-fab streamlined
	whirly chopper ...

	Another assassin attacks Emma, pins her on her back, overlooking the city.  Stands up
	before her --

	Emma held back over gargoyle, over now snow white city ...  Knees assassin in balls.
	Flicks him backwards ...

	As his body hurtles down into the snow-covered streets, Emma rushes forward.  
	But too late:  sees --

	The chopper -- about to take off.


244     FROM INSIDE CHOPPER

	The gas-masked MAN in the white lab coat:

					MAN
			Goodbye, Mrs. Peel!


245     EXT.  ROOFTOP

	The chopper rises slowly.

	Emma looks.  A fifteen foot leap ... Impossible.


246     FROM INSIDE CHOPPER

	A farewell wave from the gas-masked man.


247     CLOSEUP - EMMA

	contemplating the jump, beneath falling snowflakes, as the distance grows.


248     EMMA'S POV

	The rope/chain ladder coils into the chopper's belly.


249     INT.  CHOPPER - NIGHT

	Above London rooftops, after dark --

	The man (still wears gas mask) the Pilot, CO-PILOT and a Butler (ditto).  From the
	chopper, a giddy look down thru a glass command module.  A fairy tale, snow white
	city.

	OVER the RADIO, interference.  A changing of stations.  Then a CRACKLY
	broadcast of "The Merry Widow."

	As the WALTZ serenades them high above the city  -- 
	a KNOCKING from outside on the door --

	Surprised reactions.  The Butler opens the door, sees --

	Emma hanging onto the helicopter struts.  The Butler is too dumbstruck to say
	anything.

					EMMA
				(shouts, re:  the
				gas mask)
			Anyone ever tell you you look
			like a housefly?

	Emma grabs his epauletted shoulder, yanks him up, flicks him out --

	The Butler is jerked out -- flies into the open air.  Emma watches him fall ...

					EMMA
			Anyone else need a lift?

	The white-coated Man moves forward, but Emma is out, slamming the door, still
	clinging ...

					MAN
				(to Pilot; intercom)
			Can't you throw her off?

	The Pilot nods, works controls, the chopper dips as --

	Blam -- !  a kinky leather boot crashes --

	Into the Pilot's face as Emma kicks in the GLASS from the front of the chopper,
	SMASHES so the Pilots can't see -- a sudden rush of cold air --

	The INSTRUMENT PANELS WHIRR round as the Pilots struggle for control --

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(intercom)
			Where'd she go?


250     EXT.  CHOPPER TOP - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

	with the blades whirling directly over her head, Emma crawls over the top of the
	chopper and lets herself down the other side as London's lights twinkle beneath ...

	As the Co-Pilot pokes his head out of the cockpit --

	Emma grabs him with one hand, hoists him up into the air --

	The Co-Pilot dangles over the city.  Grabs Emma.  Slithers back onto the cockpit.
	Pistol whips her.  Emma crunches back onto the metal.  Blades whirring close!  
	The co-Pilot peers into her eyes from inside the gas mask --

					CO-PILOT
			Happy landings, Mrs. Peel.

	He raises his hand, ready to hit her again, Emma yanks him up, where his head get
	sliced off by the blades -- body and head fall away separately ...

	As Emma reacts, her legs are grabbed from below and the white-coated Man pulls her
	down the side of the chopper --

	Emma falls, but manages a flying handhold, hangs onto the chain wire below the
	chopper.  As --


251     EXT.  WIDE ANGLE - NIGHT

	The Pilot and his passenger zoom at low level over buildings.  Trying to dislodge
	Emma ...


252     THEIR POV

	Thru the blizzard, zooming down streets, landmark buildings looming up topped in
	snow, feet up ... shinnying up the chain wire ...

	"THE MERRY WIDOW WALTZ," no longer heard as old record or ensemble
	arrangement but enormous, for FULL ORCHESTRA ...


253     CLOSEUP - EMMA

	grimly hoists herself up along the struts again, hand over hand, coming up to the
	cockpit from behind --


254     BACK TO SCENE

	With a sudden movement, she yanks the Pilot out from behind and he goes flying
	towards eternity on his own.

	The chopper out of control as the white-coated Man is left to fly it himself ...


255     IN NIGHT AIR

	"THE MERRY WIDOW" BOOMS, the chopper lurches, spinning round -- up and
	down, over spiraling corkscrews, an insane waltz ...


256     INT.  CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

	The white-coated Man gets control ...


257     EXT.  CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

	Zig-zags down a narrow street, trying to smash Emma into sides of windows.


258     SEVERAL ANGLES

	as Emma bounces of buildings, holding on for dear life ...


259     EXT.  WIDE ANGLE OVER THAMES - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

	The chopper dips down, dragging Emma through icy water ...

	Up ahead ... Tower Bridge ... twin peaks ... a firework display going on ... rockets and
	lights in the sky thru snowflakes ...

	Emma sees the bridge coming, reaches down and --


260     CLOSEUP SHOT

	Detaches her pocket limpet bomb and lobs it into the chopper cockpit.


261     HER POV

	The bridge looms up, chopper rising to cross it as Emma leaps onto the bridge!


262     INT.  CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

	The Man sees the bomb ...

	Also flings himself onto the bridge as --

	Against b.g. of the fireworks display --


263     WIDE ANGLE - TOWER BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

	BOOM! -- the CHOPPER EXPLODES.  Ball of flames.  The crowd roars in
	appreciation ... great fireworks!


264     EXT.  TOP OF TOWER BRIDGE WALKWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

	Emma picks herself up, sees the Man in the white lab coat and runs for him.

	He runs too -- towards --


265     ANOTHER CHOPPER

	which unloads a rope ladder as Emma puts on every ounce of steam ... 
	The Man reaches for the dangling ladder --
	but --


266     CLOSEUP - ON HIS FOOT

	stuck, wedged between narrow battlements.


267     BACK TO SCENE

	The Man looks at his shoe, at Emma charging towards him, at the rope ladder.  He
	pulls his foot out of his shoe and grabs the ladder, sailing off in the second chopper,
	leaving Emma panting behind.  She's soaked, frozen, gasping for breath, bending over,
	when she sees --


268     CLOSEUP - SHOE

	Emma pulls it from its wedge, looks at the inside:  --  "Trubshaw's of Jermyn Street."

					STEED (V.O.)
			I thought it was Cinderella
			who lost her slipper ...


269     INT.  TRUBSHAW'S - DAWN

	On Jermyn Street, snow lies waist high.  BLARING SIRENS.  Searchlights.  PA
	announcements urge citizens to stay indoors ... PULL BACK to reveal a fire glows, a
	CLOCK TICKS calmly.  Emma sits with her shoe, surrounded by a pile of shoes. 
	Steed & Trubshaw beside her.

					EMMA
			This time the shoe's on the other
			foot. You said a hand-made shoe
			was as good as a photo-fit or
			D.N.A.? Well, all we have to do is
			find the shoe that fits ...

					TRUBSHAW
			It should be easy. A Trubshaw
			client has his shoes delivered
			personally. The Ministry should
			be able to confirm our delivery.

					STEED
			I'll be back ...

					EMMA
			Where are you going?

					STEED
			Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather 
			may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ...

					EMMA
			You needn't bother. I can't drag you 
			further into this. After all, I am still 
			the chief suspect.

					STEED
			No bother. Mother and Father think
			I've joined you. I might as well.

					EMMA
			But --

					STEED
				(comes back)
			Oh, and by the way, I think it's about 
			time you got rid of that chip on your 
			shoulder.

					EMMA
			If you'd been through what I have,
			you wouldn't --

	Steed reaches and pulls off the micro-bug from her shoulder.

					STEED
			A microtag. One of Mother's little
			toys. There you are. Free at last.

	He tips his bowler off her surprised reaction.


270     INT.  TRUBSHAW'S BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	An armory.  Steed stands before racks of umbrellas, displayed like ceremonial swords --
	ivory handles, duck handles, you name it ...

	Steed hefts a few, as picky as a Samurai ...


271     UPSTAIRS - HOURS LATER

	Emma surrounded by a mountain of shoes.  Triumphantly, she holds up a pair of shoe
	lasts.

					EMMA
			Prince Charming, I presume.
			Your name is ...


272     CLOSE ON WORN PAPER LABEL

	with the name:  DARLING.

					EMMA
			Oh my God ...


273     INT.  TRUBSHAW'S - DOWNSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Steed selects his umbrella and we FOLLOW UP TO:


274     INT.  TRUBSHAW'S - UPSTAIRS - DAY

	He sees only Trubshaw.

					STEED
			Where's Mrs. Peel?

					TRUBSHAW
			She just left, sir. In a hurry.

					STEED
			What?

					TRUBSHAW
			She said you'd understand.


275     ON STEED

	Worried.

					VOICE (V.O.)
			Ah, here we are ...


276     CLOSEUP - PIP PUFFING IN MID-AIR

	WIDEN to reveal:


277     INT.  MINISTRY ARCHIVES - DAY

	Inside the archives, among leather volumes.  A file goes through the air, passed to
	Emma ... As she reads.  A map is opened across a desk from her.

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			'X' marks the spot. The shoes were 
			delivered to ... an island in Hyde Park.
			Surrounded by the Serpentine. On the 
			site of a former Ministry installation...

					EMMA
			... and now?


					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Privately owned by ...

					EMMA
			Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather.

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Very good, Mrs. Peel ...

					EMMA
			I shall need a small plane.

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			You're not venturing alone, surely.

					EMMA
			I'm going to find out who killed
			my husband. Will you take these
			documents to Steed?


					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Of course.


278     ON EMMA

					EMMA
			Tell him I said ... goodbye.


279     INT.  SECRET SERVICE HQ - DAY

	below the Thames as at the beginning.

	In darkest paranoia, Mother lies at the heart of his Labyrinth.  Controls around him
	flash emergency.  Panic.  Cakes piled up beside him, uneaten.  Beside him, Father.
	Brenda hands a phone.


					BRENDA
			Steed for you.

	Mother grabs the phone, furious.

					MOTHER
			Where's Mrs. Peel?

	He signals frantically for Father to trace the call, but being blind, Father just sits
there.

					STEED (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			I was hoping you could tell me.

					MOTHER
			You're getting yourself into terrible 
			trouble, my son. Weather's turning 
			very nasty -- and so am I.

					STEED (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			I'm going to follow up on a hunch of 
			my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is 
			innocent and you have a mole.

					MOTHER
				(grabs mirror;
				searches his face)
			Where?

					STEED (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			In your operation.

					MOTHER
			I'm warning you for the last time, 
			Steed: whoever's behind all this, 
			looks like Mrs. Peel, walks like 
			Mrs. Peel and kills like Mrs. Peel.

	CLICK.  The line goes dead.


280     CLOSE ON MOTHER

	Furious.

					MOTHER
			Steed??
				(to Father)
			Find Mrs. Peel.

	Brenda smiles at the thought.  Father rises, grim.


281     EXT.  SKY - DAY

	Through mist, an ultralight plane zooms down -- From the plane, Emma leaps in
	parachute ...  Down, down, down through the mist ...

	Over parkland, the parachute floats down ... To an island in the middle of the
	Serpentine river.


282     EXT.  ISLAND (HYDE PARK) - DAY

	Emma lands, buries her parachute.  Walks towards a thick jungle, then a stream.  Emma
	hops across on water lilies until she reaches land again.  Where a peacock fans its tail of
	a thousand eyes.  A CLICK of CAMERAS.

	In the midst of the jungle, Emma sees --


283     HER POV

	A red phone box.  Emma frowns in recognition; goes inside.  Picks up the phone.
	Presses "Button B", and --

	The floor goes down.  Emma goes down with it, into --


284     INT.  HYDE PARK UNDERGROUND HQ

	Formerly a Ministry installation.  The "elevator" stops.  Remembering, as from a dream,
	Emma steps out into --


285     LONG DARK CORRIDOR

	A GUARD patrols.  Emma pushes herself against a wall.  The wall gives way to flip
	round, and Emma swivels into --


286     INT.  TOTALLY DARK CHAMBER

	The door locks behind.  Alone, Emma stands warily.

	From nowhere, a chilling, disembodied voice.  Intimate.  Seductive.

					VOICE (V.O.)
			Congratulations, Mrs. Peel. You have 
			been a worthy opponent. You have 
			tracked us down. You are within an 
			ace of winning.

					EMMA
			This isn't a game.

					VOICE (V.O.)
			Quite right, but we still make the rules.

					EMMA
			Rules are made to be broken.

					VOICE (V.O.)
			People, too.

					EMMA
			Then who wins?

					VOICE
			You and I. Together. But first you 
			must confront your greatest enemy.
			Who could that be, Mrs. Peel?  
			The answer is obvious ...

	Suddenly lights!

	Emma is in a hall of mirrors.

					VOICE (V.O.)
			Yourself.

	In every direction Emma turns, a thousand reflections of herself stare back at her,
	splintered into fragments as Emma spins, freaked and confused by the multiple images.

	Emma turns into herself -- only herself drapes arms around her and kisses her on the
	lips.

	Bad Emma -- whose eyes stare into Emma's startled ones as Emma pulls her mouth
	away, staggers back; realizes too late.  The hallucinogenic lip poison.  Emma crumples
	to her knees as --


287     EMMA'S POV

	Sees "herself" above her, before she -- falls unconscious.


288     EXT.  COUNTRY ROADS - DAY

	Steed's Jag races, skids in bad weather.


289     INT.  CAR

	Behind the wheel Steed, his face grim, concentrates on the slippery road.  On the seat
	next to him the snow shaker with little Emma inside --

									
		DISSOLVE TO:


290     INT.  UNDERGROUND H.Q.

	As if in a dream, Emma awakes captive inside a bizarre cage:  A life size snow shaker.
	Emma "swims" in viscous air,	suspended like a mermaid.  Thru glass she sees --

	A face peering in:  Father.

					FATHER
				(filtered)
			Emma in Wonderland. Welcome,
			Mrs. Peel.
				(filtered)
			We've been expecting you. We hope 
			you'll enjoy your stay with us. 
			Decontamination is almost complete.

					EMMA
			Decontamination -- ?

					FATHER
			And you've a new wardrobe. He
			does want you to look attractive.
				(beat )
			He tells me you're very beautiful.

	Emma pounds the glass in frustration.

					FATHER
			Relax, Mrs. Peel. We're hundreds
			of feet below ground. The Ministry
			made it impregnable. No one can
			save you.


291     EXT.  SPIRES OF ETON COLLEGE - EVENING

	as Steed drives towards it ...


292     INT.  UNDERGROUND HQ - DINING ROOM

	Bathed in candlelight.  A romantic supper for two ...

	A door opens, admitting -- Emma. Dressed, coiffed, super-glamorous.  She locks
	around, sees another door.  In search of escape she hastens to open it, only to reveal --

	A giant rabbit -- the one we saw at the Teddy Bear meeting.

	Emma gasps in surprise, moves back into the room as he advances, removing the 
	head -- it's Dr. Darling!!!


					DR. DARLING
			Emma, my dear. How lovely you
			look.

	He steps out of the rest of his costume ...

					EMMA
			Would that I could say the Same.

					DR. DARLING
			Ah, but you haven't see the real
			me. Watch closely ...

	He pulls at his face, which bubbles and collapses as he walks towards her --

	Emma's horrified expression, eyes widening as --

	Dr. Darling turns into ... Peter!

					EMMA
			Peter ...

					PETER
			Darling Emma --

					EMMA
			It was you ... all the time?

					PETER
			Not really. Not quite. I'm
			afraid you still don't see ...

	Again he claws at his face, pulling, twisting ...

	Emma winces at the sight, her eyes popping out of her head.

	It's Valentine!

					TEACHER (V.O.)
			Valentine Peel ...


293     EXT.  ETON COLLEGE - EVENING

	beneath Gothic turrets pupils in top hats and tails.

					OLD TEACHER (V.O.)
			Yes, I remember him quite well ...

	PULL BACK THROUGH windows to reveal:  Steed and an OLD TEACHER in the
	beautiful library.

					OLD TEACHER
			This is where he used to spend his
			days. We have an old photograph
			somewhere ...

	He's flipping through yearbooks, then shows Steed --


294     CLOSEUP - PHOTO

	of Valentine Peel on stage, in wizard's garb.  Made up as an old man ...


295     BACK TO SCENE

					TEACHER
			Absolute wizard with makeup. His

			Prospero ...

					STEED
			'The Prospero Project...'

	grim.

297     BACK TO DINNER TABLE

	Emma frozen, sinks into a chair, staring ...

					EMMA
			You.

					VALENTINE
			Darling Emma -- yes, we:  the true 
			genius behind the Prospero Project ...

	He walks around the dinner table as he talks ...

					EMMA
			But you died -- in the explosion ...


298     FLASHBACK - CLOSE ON HAND IN WHITE GLOVE

	Twisting the dial.  PAN UP the arm to reveal Valentine.

					VALENTINE (V.O.)
			Oh, no. I arranged the explosion.


299     BACK TO PRESENT

					VALENTINE
			A slight miscalculation -- my face 
			was burned beyond recognition.
			Fortunately my research into plastics 
			came in handy ...

					EMMA
				(stunned)
			Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ...

					VALENTINE
			An unholy trinity ...

					EMMA
				(stands)
			You killed my husband.

					VALENTINE
			For starters. Of course I had to kill 
			the Teddy Bears, as well ...

					EMMA
			Too many cooks --

					VALENTINE
			Spoil the majority shareholders. In 
			Wonderland Weather. I planned 
			everything, even the Ministry 
			recruiting you ...

					EMMA
			But I found you. All the clues
			led me here ...

					VALENTINE
			Of course. I planned that, too.

					EMMA
			But -- why?

					VALENTINE
			You disappoint me, Emma.  Can't
			you guess?
				(moves toward her)
			For you. It was all for you ...

					EMMA
				(cold)
			'Our revels now are ended.'

					VALENTINE
			Oh, no, Emma. They've only
			just begun ...


300     INT.  INVISIBLE JONES' OFFICE - NIGHT

	The phone hangs in the air -- with the smoking pipe.

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			The shoes were delivered to an island

goodbye. What?


301     CLOSEUP - STEED IN RED PHONEBOX (SOMEWHERE) - NIGHT

					STEED
			I said it's not goodbye yet.
			Listen, I'm going to need some

302     INT.  HYDE PARK UNDERGROUND - DINING ROOM

					VALENTINE
				(indicates supper)
			Think of this as your second
			wedding feast ...

					EMMA
			I'm already married ...

					VALENTINE
			Come, come, you're a widow -- a
			most attractive widow. Now I think 
			of it, we'll need a bridesmaid. Here.

	He pushes a button.  Bad Emma enters.  Tattooed Z424.  Unmistakably hostile.

					VALENTINE
			My latest model. A compound of 
			plastics and sensor chips. A big 
			improvement on the old X404s.
			The poor thing is quite fond of me. 
			Emma, say hello to Emma.

	BAD EMMA HISSES, a strange mix of STATIC and FEEDBACK.

					VALENTINE 
			You know, I believe she's actually 
			jealous.

					EMMA
			Valentine, listen to me ...

					VALENTINE
			Right, bridesmaid. Now what
			have I left out? Oh, yes, I know:
			the ring.

					EMMA
				(covers her hand)
			Ring?

	He stands very near her -- she's terrified -- then:

					VALENTINE
			How silly of me -- let me make
			you comfortable first ...

	As he advances, ZOOM IN EXTREME CLOSEUP Emma's eye

									
		DISSOLVE TO:


303     INT.  ISLAND (HYDE PARK) - NIGHT

	Another ball, WIDEN to reveal, from the lake, an odd eight foot high plastic ball
	emerges -- The ball lands on the shore.  From the inside, a zip peels away the plastic
	layer to reveal --

	Steed, like an urban dandy in suit and bowler.  A rose in his lapel.  He steps out, and,
	poking with his umbrella --

	Deflates the inflatable plastic submarine.  Steed heads off -- CAMERA EYES the
	peacock swivel towards him, as he heads into the jungle where he sees the --


304     RED PHONEBOX

	Steed picks up the phone.  Presses all the buttons until he hits "Button B."  As the floor
	lowers, his eyes widen in surprise ...



305     SARCOPHAGUS

	carved in Emma's likeness.  Lowered from the ceiling hydraulically into --


306     INT.  VALENTINE'S HIGH-TECH TORTURE CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS
	ACTION

	as Valentine descends spiral steps to join it.

	Valentine opens the coffin to reveal Emma strapped within.

					VALENTINE
			That's better. I say, isn't this 
			where you came in? It's
			impenetrable, by the way ...

					EMMA
			You're mad.

					VALENTINE
			Entirely. On the other hand
				(he advances towards
				her, smiling)
			Mad people get things done. Let
			me show you --


307     INT.  UNDERGROUND H.Q. - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Steed stealing down a corridor and --

	hides, as a posse of guards rushes past, alerted by the peacock cameras.  He waits till
	they pass, then reaches out his umbrella, and --

	Nabs Father around the neck who was feeling her way after them.  Brings her down.

					FATHER
			Steed

					STEED
			How did you guess?

					FATHER
			You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black
			Leather ...

					STEED
			It was you who gave Valentine
			Peel his security clearance ...
			you're the mole who betrayed
			the Ministry.


					FATHER
			Mother betrayed me. She was 
			going to replace me with a younger 
			Father.  Errand boy that's all I was.  
			'Find Steed...'

					STEED
			Well, you found me. Have a sniff of 
			this, why don't you? Careful, the 
			scent can be overpowering ...

	Holding Father securely, Steed forces her nose into his rose boutonniere, squeezes the
	rubber tube, sprays a Mist.  Father passes out.  Steed rises, locks around.
	Sees --

	A grille and removes it, climbs in and replaces it before the guards return.  He turns 
	and --


308     INT.  DUCTS - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	crawls forward through a mass of wires and plumbing --
	until he hears a VOICE -- VALENTINE'S.

	Steed reaches another grille, through which he can see --


309     INT.  TORTURE CHAMBER

	Emma's coffin, standing on end, like the Iron Maiden faces a wall of TV monitors as
	Valentine explains.

					VALENTINE
			People expect weather to be free. 
			They're used to it. I call that a 
			denial of freedom. No freedom of 
			choice. An abuse of human rights. 
			They buy water, electricity, gas. 
			Why shouldn't they be able to buy 
			their own weather if they want to? 
			If they have a little incentive ...

	Emma reacts -- also Steed (unseen) behind her.

					EMMA
			Such as?

					VALENTINE
			Destruction of their local weather 
			systems. I can zap a thousand 
			Chernobyls into the air.

					EMMA
			The result would be ...

					VALENTINE
			Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop 
			failure.  Economic disaster.  
			Frostbite or sunburn ... on a 
			massive scale. 
			You've seen a few samples...

					EMMA
			Then what's stopping you?

					VALENTINE
			One very small thing. A diamond
			'cyclone' chip. A thousand times
			more information on a fraction of
			the size. If I possess that, my
			powers would be unlimited. My
			dear half-brother was developing
			it. But he suspected sabotage.
			He gave the chip to ... you,
			'Mrs.' Peel. I want you. But
			also your ring.

	Valentine takes her by the hand. Kisses --


310     CLOSEUP - HER RING

A diamond.  In the light, a patterned imprint.  ZOOM IN -- a complex fractal equation of circuits.


311     BACK TO SCENE

					VALENTINE
			The missing piece of the jigsaw.
			I tried to get you to give it to me 
			as Peter; I tried to steal it from 
			you as Dr. Darling. As myself I'll 
			be a bit less subtle.
				(he slips it off her
				finger; holds it up)
			With this ring my plan will be
			complete.

					EMMA
			How Wagnerian ... Do you mean 
			to say you've waited all these 
			years because you couldn't create 
			a chip on your own? That would 
			have amused Peter.

					VALENTINE
			Speaking of Peter, there's more good 
			news: You won't even have to change 
			your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel.

					EMMA
			What are my choices?

					VALENTINE
			Choices?

					EMMA
			I'll never marry you.

	Valentine is philosophical.  He spins the sarcophagus on an axis, lying it flat -- Emma 
	lying in her coffin as he looks down at her --

					VALENTINE
			One out of two isn't bad. I'll keep you 
			alive, darling Emma. In a year or five, 
			you may change your mind. If you're 
			still in it.

	Valentine presses a button.  From the ceiling -- a surgical laser.  Moves down to within
	inches of her face.

					VALENTINE
			This little toy gave me back my face.
			It can replace yours. What do you think?
			Medusa? Madame Defarge? Maggie
			Thatcher?

	He marks an imaginary line round Emma's face.

	An ALARM BELL RINGS.  Emma reacts.

					FATHER (V.O.)
			Dr. Darling, this is Father. We
			have an intruder. I repeat --

	Valentine switches off the PA.

					VALENTINE
			Ah. That will be Steed. He followed 
			you. Please excuse me. I have work 
			to do. My most spectacular 
			performance. A ballet of clouds. It 
			was made for you. I want to give you 
			a heart, Emma. I want all of London 
			to see it. And now with this ...
				(flourishes ring)
			They will.
				(leans close)
			And for an encore: the biggest cyclone 
			in history will wipe the City from the 
			face of the earth.
				(winks)
			Shape of things to come, my darling.

	He stuffs a gag into Emma's mouth and closes the coffin on her muffled protests. 
	Darkness.

	Immediately, Steed tries to force his way through the grille.  No such luck.

					STEED
			Blast. What to do? Mrs. Peel!

	He doesn't dare say her name too loud -- and there's no telling if she could hear him in
	that thing, anyway.

	He turns around in the tunnel -- heads the other way.


312     EXT.  SKY OVER LONDON - NIGHT

	Moonlight night.  Dark clouds approach like an army, spreading shadows.


313     INSIDE CLOUDS

	MOISTURE SPITS and CRACKLES, static energy waiting to explode ...

	In the sky -- clouds join together like a genie from a lamp, forming -- over the city -- a
	strange dark sensuous figure, half human, half dreamlike.

	That stalks the city....


314     INT.  DUCTS - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Steed crawling.  A rat runs over him ...

					STEED
			The things I do for England ...

	Pitch dark, then --

	Emma's coffin is opened and we see Bad Emma, looking down.

	Bad Emma stares at her human double -- Emma: who looks imploringly at her to undo
	the gag.  Bad Emma removes it, she --

	Runs a finger down Emma's body, inside a hole torn in the leather -- warm human flesh.
	Blood.  Her flesh.  Her blood.  Fascinated.

					EMMA
			You must let me go ...

	Bad Emma listens.  Gently lays her head on Emma's breast, listens to --
	the HEARTBEAT.  Ba-boom.  Ba-boom ...

					EMMA
			Don't you understand? If he has
			me, he'll have no use for you ...
			he'll destroy you ...

	The words jolt Bad Emma back, remembering her mission.  She goes to the laser, aims
	it at Emma's face!

					EMMA
			No...

	Bad Emma hesitates, looks strangely human as --


315     ANOTHER PART OF UNDERGROUND H.Q.

	The grille pops off and Steed emerges where the guards are waiting for him --

					STEED
			Oh, dear.

	No escape.  He takes off his bowler -- deftly removes a strip from its brim, aims it at
	the guards, and --

	Hurls it ...


316     CLOSEUP - BOWLER (IN FLIGHT)

	A glinting razor's edge, which --

	Swoosh -- !  Slices into the closest guard before returning, like a boomerang to Steed.
	He taps twice hard steel as ...


317     OTHER GUARDS

	run towards him, Steed swivels gracefully and - slams the bowler in their faces, a
	sartorial knuckleduster -- wham -- !  One drops -- Bam -- !  The other collapses, slump
	to the ground.  Steed stoops down, picks up his hat, sees --

	A dent in its steel top.  For the first time, Steed loses his cool.  Genuine rage.

					STEED
			Someone's going to pay for this.

	Stepping over the nearest body, Steed moves on his way, as --


318     CLOSEUP - VALENTINE

	places a ring inside a control module filled with identical-looking diamond chips ...

	WIDEN to reveal ...


319     INT.  CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

	Masses of dials and switches.  ( Off to one side, on a wall, a rack of rapiers ... )

	Valentine hits a switch ...

					VALENTINE
			Start the countdown. Action
			stations. Five minutes ...

	The countdown starts, red digitals going backwards --

	Colorized computer screens map out hostile weather fronts.
	A COMPUTERIZED VOICE STARTS to COUNT.  The CLOCK TICKS.

	Father enters behind him.

					FATHER
			Congratulations. The clouds are
			on course ...

					VALENTINE
			To explode. London will be ashes.

					FATHER
			Not yet! They haven't heard our
			terms ... !

	Father tries to hit the switch.  Valentine yanks her off.

					VALENTINE
			Are you insane? Stop the program
			and you activate the auto-destruct!

					FATHER
			But all those people -- !

	Valentine strikes her hard --

					VALENTINE
			My cloud ballet! My cyclone!

	Father slides to the floor.  Valentine ignores her.  Concentrates on the control panel red
	lights, as --


320     EXT.  PARLIAMENT SQUARE - NIGHT

	Up in the sky, more white clouds --

	Darken into boiling black.  They move and billow.  Bubbling with gases and energy
	Swirling with motion, a life of their own.

	FROM river, a scarlet fog floats upwards.  It gains mass and weight, slowly forming as
	it rolls --


321     THROUGH CITY STREETS

	then RISES ABOVE them -- into a weird pulsating red shape.
	A love heart.


322     CLOSEUP - DIGITAL READOUTS

	Whirling backwards ...


323     INT.  MOTHER'S UNDERWATER HQ - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Mother at the controls.  RINGS the ALARM.  Panic stations as -- SIRENS BLARE. 
	WARNINGS RING OUT OVER TV and RADIO --

					MOTHER
			Dense cloud formation moving south-
			west. On course for the center of the 
			city. A fog floating in from the river. 
			The prediction is ... unstable chemical 
			reaction. Enforce the curfew ... 
			Emergency stand by ... !


324     EXT.  SKY OVER BUCKINGHAM PALACE - NIGHT

	Bad storm clouds advance over London ... black and furious.


325     OVER CITY - SEVERAL ANGLES

	As shadows in a whirl of chemical matter.  An airborne CYCLONE of BELCHING
	static ELECTRICITY.  The black shape now --

	Forming a sensuous female shape.  Like a dream wisp of ...

	Emma Peel with an hourglass figure.  While --


326     FROM RIVER

	The heart-shaped cloud seems to -- move towards the black genie shape -- trying to
	connect, to form the cyclone ...


327     EXT.  LONDON STREETS - SEVERAL ANGLES - NIGHT

	Action stations.  AIR RAID SIRENS ...

	Like a re-run Blitz.  Streets now eerily empty and dark.
	Through deserted streets --

	Troops race to positions in gas masks.  Searchlights illuminate clouds.  Worried faces
	watch the skies, as --


328     CLOSEUP - DIGITAL NUMBERS

	Fly ...


329     INT.  HI-TECH TORTURE CHAMBER - DAY

	Chaos on all TV monitors as ...

	Valentine hastens down the spiral steps and opens Emma's coffin.  What will he find??
	Emma's there, still gagged.  Looks asleep.

					VALENTINE
			My dear.
				(pulls the gag:
				kisses her)
			I wouldn't want you to miss the
			grand finale ...

	Emma opens her eyes.  Valentine looks down at her, until -- a tell-tale sign:  Z424. 
	Bad Emma is unmistakable.  He strikes her -- yanks her out of the coffin.

					VALENTINE
			Find her. Kill her ...

	He races back upstairs as ...


330     INT.  UNDERGROUND HYDE PARK - HQ CATWALKS - CONTINUOUS
	ACTION

	Emma makes her way through the labyrinthine superstructure of the place, crawling
	high on a girder over some BURBLING LIQUID below.  She hears NOISE IN the
	DISTANCE.  Suddenly --


331     INT.  UNDERGROUND HQ - STEED - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Steed battles more guards!  No time to lose.

	Wham -- ! Bam -- ! Now moving with deadly earnest, Steed downs all oncomers,
	closing in on --


332     INT.  UNDERGROUND CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Steed rushes in, BOLTS the AIRLOCK behind.  Pounding on door.

	He sees the timer racing backwards -- stands over the controls, trying to figure out how
	to stop the program.

	Looks for the chip -- amongst all the rest it's like trying to find a contact lens in
water.


333     FLOOR-LEVEL HATCH

	opens behind.  Valentine emerges, drops the HATCH COVER with a THUD.  Steed
	whirls.

					VALENTINE
			John Steed.

					STEED
			Valentine Peel. I see you've gone 
			back to using your original face.

					VALENTINE
			The last one you'll ever see.

					STEED
			Perish the thought.

	Valentine fulls forth a rapier from the wall.

					VALENTINE
			Did they tell you at Eton that I
			was fencing champion, too?

	Steed unsheathes his umbrella, revealing ditto.

					STEED
			They said you were a very naughty 
			boy.

	The fight is on as the numbers grow smaller!


334     SEVERAL ANGLES

					VALENTINE
			You're better than I expected.

					STEED
			I was at Harrow ...

					VALENTINE
			But did they teach you this?

	Valentine whacks the blade off Steed's umbrella handle.  Laughs.  A diminished phallic
	symbol.  Steed, dumbfounded.

	Valentine advances towards Steed --

	Who points the umbrella at him.

					STEED
			Bang-bang ... you're dead.

					VALENTINE
			You wish.

	He moves to close in, when ...


335     CLOSEUP - FLASH OF LIGHT

	from the muzzle, as a BULLET ZIPS out, and --


336     VALENTINE

	recoils.  Blood streams from his shoulder.  He looks up, devastated.  Steed blows
	smoke away from the muzzle.

					STEED
			One shot -- for emergencies.

					VALENTINE
				(clutches wound)
			That's not playing by the rules.

					STEED
				(echoes Emma!)
			Rules are made to be broken.

					VALENTINE
				(pulls his own gun)
			If you say so.

					STEED
			I do.

	He FIRES again.  To the heart.  Valentine spins to the floor.

					VALENTINE
			You said ... one shot.

					STEED
			Did I? My mistake.

	Steed turns to the console, tries to figure out how to stop the countdown, when behind
	the hatch opens again, revealing Emma.  Valentine pulls her up, grabs her as hostage --

					VALENTINE
			I wouldn't do that, if I were you.

	Steed turns.

					STEED
			Mrs. Peel -- !

	Valentine has Emma, a knife to her throat, stands over the hatch.

					VALENTINE
			Bullet-proof waistcoats -- just the 
			thing. I get mine from Trubshaw's. 
			We'll be off now, won't we, darling?
				(to Steed)
			We wouldn't want to miss the
			fireworks. Figure it out if you can, 
			Steed ...


337     DOWN HATCH

	Valentine drags Emma, bolting the hatch.


338     ON STEED

	He's torn briefly, but there are thousands of lives at stake; Steed goes to the control
	module and starts pulling out chips, looking ...


339     EXT.  LONDON - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

	The biggest cyclone you've ever seen starts slowly whirling above the city, gathering
	momentum ...


340     NUMBERS

	going down, down, down, as ...


341     INT.  CATWALKS - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Valentine drags Emma backwards ...


342     EXT.  LONDON - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

	The cyclone picking up force ...


343     CLOSEUP - STEED'S HANDS

	pull up a chip.  The red numbers freeze.  WIDEN to reveal...


344     INT.  CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	The SIRENS CEASE.  Steed allows himself a smile of relief.


345     EXT.  LONDON - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

	The giant cyclone begins to break apart ...


346     SEVERAL ANGLES - DYING STORM


347     CLOSEUP - RELIEVED FACES

	Troops pulling off gas masks as ...


348     INT.  CONTROL ROOM - ON SCREENS - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Steed sees the breakup of the cyclone ...

	Then -- behind him -- an ominous CLICK-CLICKING as the PROGRAM reconfigures.
	A DIFFERENT ALARM BUZZER SOUNDS and the words: 

	"AUTO-DESTRUCT, 3 MINUTES"

	start flashing ...

	A different set of numbers start running backwards ...

					STEED
			You must be joking ...

349     EXT.  CATWALKS - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Valentine, dragging Emma, reacts to the new ALARMS.

					VALENTINE
			Fool ...

	In his hesitation, Emma suddenly makes her move.  A struggle -- Emma takes a bad fall
	down a landing below.  Ugly THUD.  Dead.

					STEED
			That will do.

	He's materialized across the girder from Valentine.  Who pulls his revolver.

					VALENTINE
			Aren't you forgetting about
			something?

					STEED
			You are, and it's behind you.

					VALENTINE
			Come, come. You don't really
			expect me to fall for --

	Bad Emma's arms go 'round Valentine in a lethal embrace.

					VALENTINE
			Let go, you ... idiot ...

	Uh uh.  She holds him in a vice-like grip.  Hugging Valentine.

					STEED
			I think she really likes you ...
			Where's Mrs. Peel?

					VALENTINE
			Ugh ...

	As the life is squeezed out of him, Bad Emma finally smiles.  Cradled together, she
	chokes Valentine, who gasps for breath, as --

	One last desperate move on his part and Bad Emma tumbles backwards, Valentine
	locked in her arms in a dying embrace.

	They fall into the mists and liquid below.

	Steed almost falls himself as he grabs a beam for support.  Looks down, sees ...


350     EMMA

	Dead.

					STEED
			Emma!

	He has said her name.  He scrambles down to her body.

	Emma lying sprawled out on the ground.

	Steed picks up her limp body in his arms like "Sleeping Beauty."  His eyes fill with
	tears.  He lays her down.

					STEED
			Emma ...

	He produces Peter's ring.


351     CLOSEUP - RING

	Slips it onto her finger and ...


352     BACK TO SCENE

	Kisses her.  A chaste kiss on the lips.  But with the force and passion of a lover.  He
	closes his eyes, looks away in grief.  The ALARM STILL SOUNDS but Steed doesn't
	give a damn.

	Behind, Emma opens her eyes.  As if revived by the kiss.  Or the ring.  Looks up at
	him.

					EMMA
			Steed?

	Steed looks back at her -- surprise, delight.

					STEED
			Mrs. Peel?

					EMMA
			What kept you?

					STEED
			The plot.
				(realizing)
			Hello, we must be going ...


353     CLOSEUP - AUTO-DESTRUCT NUMBERS

	Racing backwards as ...


354     SEVERAL ANGLES

	Steed pulls Emma through the catwalks and corridors of Valentine's Labyrinth ...


355     MORE NUMBERS

	racing to zero, nothing to stop them ...


356     INT.  TORTURE CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Steed and Emma race in -- she sees the sarcophagus.

					EMMA
			Quick!

	Emma scrambles in and Steed leaps on top of her, bringing down the lid as ...


357     SEVERAL ANGLES

	3-2-1 -- and a BLAST like a nuclear EXPLOSION -- as the Underground HQ is
	fragmented to smithereens -- Emma's " coffin" goes flying ... as the SCREEN WHITES
	OUT.


358     EXT.  ALBERT BRIDGE - NIGHT

		Beneath the clear moonlight, all bulbs on -- like Xmas.


359     BELOW

	it floats the coffin -- which opens, revealing ...

	Steed and Emma, squashed together, gasping for breath.

					STEED
			'The owl and the pussycat went
			to sea -'

					EMMA
			'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'

					STEED
			A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...

					EMMA
			Still a bit chilly ...

					STEED
			English weather. You know, after 
			all we've been through, I should 
			say we deserve a long holiday ...

					EMMA
			Have you any place in mind?

					STEED
			As a matter of fact I have ...

	The coffin drifts downstream in the moonlight.

									
	SLOW DISSOLVE TO:


360     EXT.  SIBERIAN ICE FIELDS - DAY				360

	A few weeks later.  Across snowy wastes, a pack of Huskies drag a sled behind them,
	WHIP CRACKED by a --

	Frozen fur-clad Siberian peasant.  As he turns a corner, dogs stumble from ice and
	snow into --


361     SAND

	The peasant stops, stares.


362     AHEAD OF HIM

	Sun beats down.  A tropical beach.  A warm sea.  A butler, Trubshaw.  POPS a
	CHAMPAGNE CORK.  From a tent, he brings two glasses down the beach to


363     TWO DIVAN-STYLE DECK CHAIRS

	Where Steed and Emma toast in the sun.  Steed in a smoking jacket, Emma in a bikini.

					EMMA
			I don't recall Siberia being this
			warm, Steed.

					STEED
			It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.

					EMMA
			Our little paradise -- just made
			for two?

					STEED
				(looks; frowns)
			Not quite.

	On cue from the water, Mother emerges, snorkeling in his wheelchair contraption --
	with Brenda.  He waves to --

					STEED
			Our chaperon.

					EMMA
			Pity your mother came, too ...

	Steed seems peeved that his chance to be alone with EMMA is spoiled.  Trubshaw
	pours glasses of champagne.

					STEED
			Still a little warm, Trubshaw.
			Is this the '28? A little more
			ice, I think ...

	Trubshaw trots off dutifully.  A large ice bucket appears.  Mother moves in.  Absorbed
	by Emma, now his new protegee.

					MOTHER
			About your next assignment, Mrs.
			Peel ...

					EMMA
			Next assignment?

	Steed gives his champagne to the Siberian peasant.  He presses a switch -- an umbrella
	shoots up between them, opens up, twirls.

	PULL BACK to reveal the strip of beach, like a tiny bubble of tropical weather. 
	Against a Siberian b.g. of snow.  As we WIDEN we REVEAL a giant glass bubble,
	hearing --

					EMMA (V.O.)
			Ah ... sun tan lotion. Any shops
			nearby?

					STEED (V.O.)
			Must be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll
			send Mother ...

	PULL BACK to reveal no shop for miles around.

					MOTHER (V.O.)
			Ahem. As I was saying, perhaps
			another macaroon ...

					EMMA (V.O.)
			Thank you, Steed.

					STEED (V.O.)
			Thank you, Mrs. Peel.

	Behind the umbrella -- LAUGHTER.  CHINK of GLASSES.

									
			FADE OUT.

	PAN DOWN to reveal:


2	EXT - SALTFLATS - DAY

	A flat horizon, stretching to infinity.

	A 360 degree pan reveals: nothing.  Deserted, no hiding places.  No animals, no

	brightly painted, traditional, comforting, belongs in a village green.  Perfectly
	ordinary -- except for its location.

	Silence.  Only the wind over the plain.  Except --

	RING-RING ... a mellow, old-fashioned tone.  We wait for someone to answer it.  But
	of course nothing and nobody for miles.  Except --

	ZOOM! --


5	CAR	

	speeding like a bullet.  Driven at maximum, breakneck speed, 125 mph.  A petite open
	top '65 Lotus Elan, all streamlined curves, full throttle, it nears the phone box, and --

	SCREECHES to a halt.

	Dust clears, ENGINE NOISE FADES.  From the seat, hops --


6	KINKY BOOT

	Buckled.  Strap at ankle.  Crunching into the ground.
	PAN UP TO:


7	BEAUTIFUL WOMAN

	late 20's.  In CLOSEUPS of -- Tight black leather catsuit.  A flash of auburn hair. 
	Black leather like a second skin.  Smoothed over legs, thighs.  Buckled at wrists, straps
	at ankles, zips --

	Pulled up over flesh.  This is EMMA PEEL, scientist.  Sexual, invulnerable, cool.  Very
	cool.  She locks up at clouds in the sky.  Then steps across to the phone box.  Picks up
	the phone.

					EMMA
			How now brown cow ...

			The rain in Spain falls mainly

			The quick brown fox jumped over

	From the receiver, an irritated official voice.

	Emma puts down receiver.  Hangs a cardboard outside the phone box.  Then presses
	button bakelite box.

	A second's wait.  A coin from the slot.  Then a HUM as --


8	INSIDE PHONE BOX

	the floor lowers automatically.  Emma disappears.  Hanging outside the box, a notice
	now reads "Out of Order."

	Next to the call box we notice a sign: an arrow pointing into the desert:  "London 84
	miles."


9	INT.  LABORATORY

	underground.  Emma descends on the lift platform; steps into a research lab in retro hi
	tech.  Walks past assistants, down long pink and orange steel corridors, Werner von
	Braun goes disco.  Nears a door, marked:  "Prospero Project -- Authorized Personnel
	Only." Logo with lightning emerging from a cloud.


10      FROM AIRLOCK DOOR

	A man enters, older.  In matching leather suit: like an astronaut.  Early 40's, handsome,
	charismatic, with swept-back silver-black hair.  His name tag: DR. PETER PEEL.

					PETER
			Ready, darling?

	Peter fixes her name tag: DR. EMMA PEEL; runs a finger down over her breast.  She
	smiles.

					EMMA
			Ready as I'll ever be ...

	Mutual erotic, intellectual attraction.  Peter takes her hand and they walk down:


11      LONG CORRIDOR

	air-lock doors: a series of sealed chambers inside a hitech Labyrinth --

	A man joins them.  A shyer, bespectacled, less handsome version of Peter.  On his name
	tag: DR. VALENTINE PEEL -- brother and partner.

	In b.g., a countdown starts, ECHOING thru the lab

					VALENTINE
			Atmospheric pressure checked, antenna ready... 
			Thermal chamber ready ... Compression module 
			set ... Temperature control on course between 
			one and one forty ... Water turbulence steady ...

					PETER
			Anything else?

	Valentine smiles, shrugs --

					VALENTINE
			Good luck ... Peter ... Emma.

					EMMA
			Thanks, Valentine ...

	Emma gives him a quick peck on the cheek.

	A shy look from Valentine at Emma.  Peter senses

					PETER
			Just a minute, darling. My brother's a 
			worry wart. I better have a word ...
			Valentine --

	Peter takes Valentine over to one side.  Emma checks gauges and dials.  Behind her a
	conversation.  Peter returns.

	He takes a ring from his finger --


12      CLOSEUP - DIAMOND GEM

	on a gold ring.


13      BACK TO SCENE

	He slips it onto her finger.

					PETER
			Something to remember me by.

	Peter smiles.  The remark strikes Emma as curious.  But no time to query.  She smiles
	back.  He gives her a kiss --

					PETER
				(checks his watch)
			See you in an hour ...

					EMMA
			One sunny day ...

	The countdown ECHOES around them as they separate.


14      IN DISTANCE

	Valentine watches her.


15      INT.  LAB CHAMBER

	Inside a bed of ice, Emma is lowered by hydraulic machine into a steel radioactive
	thermal chamber, glowing eerily blue

	The effect is very cold.  Frozen.  Numb.  Like a sci-fi Sleeping Beauty, beauty
	entombed and sealed in a glass coffin.  Plunged down into a vault.  Opposite her --

	In another glass coffin, Peter Peel, is lowered down.


16      FROM EMMA'S POV

	The sound of their HEARTBEATS.  Their BREATHING.  BLEEP and PULSE OF
	ELECTRONICS.  Thru glass and leather.  Like cerebral sex.  Technological, erotic.
	Peter winks at her -- Emma locks longingly at him, as --


17      UP IN CONTROL ROOM

	Valentine watches behind glass.  Like a kid excluded from a bedroom.  He attends to
	dials.  And to his female assistant --

					VALENTINE
				(thrilled)
			Readings still normal ...

	The assistant smiles oddly.  FOCUS ON --

	An insignia tattooed on her neck: "X404."  A replicant.
	They monitor screens.  A DULL HUM.


18      EXT.  SALTFLATS - DAY

	A weather antenna emerges from the ground:  an enigmatic phallic silver blob, like a
	Koons sculpture.  The sun glints off it ...


19      DOWN BELOW

	A temperature gauge rises.

	The ice is infused with pulsating colors: purple -- blue -- green -- red.  Starts to heat
up     as if --

	It soaks up temperature:  from cold to hot in instants.


20      CLOSEUP - WHITE GLOVED HAND ON DIAL

	"CUMULUS COLLECTOR." The graphs accelerate, but over the dull HUM -- a
	MURMUR, a BREATH.  As Emma's HEARTBEAT rises

	The gloved  hand turns up the dial, past a red danger mark.

	Suddenly a BLIP.  Something wrong.


21      DOWN IN HIS VAULT

	Peter Peel's "coffin" starts to overheat. Peter reacts --

					PETER
				(intercom cutting out)
			Losing control -- malfunction
			in thermal chamber -- for Christ's
			-- Emm --!


22      IN CONTROL ROOM

	Needles push off the dials, as --

	The ice swells: strange mix of colors, absorbing heat and energy in clusters of molten
	metal ... steam and sparks ignite ... Valentine's eyes widen in alarm ...

					COUNTDOWN (V.O.)
			Five -- four --  three -- two --
			one ... Three -- two -- one ...
				(repeating)
			Three -- two -- one ...


23      INSIDE COFFIN

	Peter's glass cracks

	The emergency light goes on -- the ALARM sounds -- lab assistants running ...


24      IN HER COFFIN

	Emma realizes; looks to Peter --


25      EXT.  SALTFLATS - DAY

	The "Koons" antenna is drawing a strange purple cloud towards it, from otherwise blue
	sky ... siphoning the purple atmosphere down itself into


26      INT.  CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Thru the air ducts the purple cloud starts to billow ... Panic stations! Valentine looks
	aghast at the graphs:  all systems fucked, over the intercom --

					VALENTINE
			Emma, Peter, get out! It's going to explode!

	FROM Valentine's anguished face TO Emma's face, as

					VALENTINE
			Emma ...


27      FROM HER VAULT

	Emma undoes the straps, clambers out of her pod


28      ANGLE (IN DREAMLIKE SLOW MOTION)

	Emma clambers onto her husband's pod -- in a sequence eternally replayed for her as a
	nightmare --


29      BACK TO SCENE

					VALENTINE
			Get out! Leave him -- ! Emma!


30      RAPID INTERCUTS

	The purple smoke enveloping Peter's	pod, soft caresses -- Peter struggling within,
	looking at Emma --

					EMMA
			Peter!

	Her leatherclad limbs straddled over his glass coffin.  Her HEARTBEAT sounds ... She
	grabs, claws on glass --

	Her fist draws back, blam! blam! blam! three deadly blows, Emma SMASHES the pod
	cover, it --

	Cracks -- splinters -- not breaking -- obscuring his face inside like a spider's web, as
	behind her

					VALENTINE
			Don't wait for him -- he's not --

	Breathless, blood smeared on glass, Emma's gashed fist bleeds thru torn leather glove --
	twisted mass of flesh and glass -- GROWLING sound growing as:


31      ABOVE GROUND

	The voluminous purple cloud being sucked by the antenna...!


32      CLOSEUP ON EMMA'S DIAMOND RING

	gleaming thru a tear of blood as she pounds the glass --


33      BACK TO SCENE

					PETER
				(faint)
			Emma ... Emma ...

	As a GROWLING sound grows till

	BOOM!  An EXPLOSION rocks the vault -- flames burst out -- sound and vision
	separate -- Emma hears explosion as a slow moving tear thru her psyche.  A trauma.


34      ANGLE (IN EXTREME SLOW MOTION)	

	The blast flings Emma back thru space, flying unconscious as if in a dream, floating
	backwards in --

	A milky way op-art swirl of glass and steel fragments, now -- out of control,
	weightless, powerless, as --

	The background of sealed doors, white corridors all vanish. A spinning, black void
	opens up behind her, as her eyes shut, head falls back --

	An orgasmic, dream of near-death, as a CRASH OF MUSIC BEGINS a hip new
	version of the "AVENGERS" THEME TUNE --

	CREDITS SEQUENCE.


35      SERIES OF SHOTS

	In stark silhouette  The swishing of a bowler hat spinning thru space
	
	An umbrella tossed in the air, flicked like a deadly weapon --

	A rich velvety feel, key colors black/white/red.  Dandyish and erotic followed by blasts
	of violence, dreamy op-art puzzles and psychedelic patterns over --

	A sensuous BLACK, background -- slowly revealed to be a woman's leather-clad 
	body --

	In silhouette -- A bowler hatted man, Steed, a catsuited woman Emma.  Flashes of: 
	hair -- eye -- a red rose -- in bloom -- petals folding and unfolding, then tightly shut.

	A thorned stem, sharp to the touch --

	FROM black and white INTO color -- leather Background metamorphosing into black
	and white of a chessboard as ...

	A medieval knight moves around its queen in a formal dance --

	A fetishistic attention to detail: leather catsuit, swish of legs, boots ... hair tossed
	back - - red nails over black ... creamy white skin ... zips ...

	A silhouetted man in bowler hat in Savile Row suit -- old Etonian knotted tie --
	umbrella stabs like a sword --

	Umbrella with knotted stems of a rose furling round -- then a tear, gash -- rose cut and
	tossed into --

	His lapel. Until, at the end: together in silhouette.
	Bowler hat thrown, skimming, swishing thru air, until --

	Now only a single HEARTBEAT ... BA-BOOM ... BA-BOOM ...
	Then --

	PISTOL SHOTS OVER as:


36      INT.  EMMA'S BEDROOM - PRE-DAWN

	A gasp as Emma wakes abruptly from her nightmare, years later, startled by the shots,
	naked beneath satin sheets.  Her HEARTBEAT FADES as she looks around her Klaus
	Oldenberg room, vinyl comforter, satin sheets.  A toss of her hair.

	Looks more mature. Sexual, haunted. Mrs. Emma Peel -- widow.

	Same every night.  Next to the clock, a framed photo of her dead husband, Peter Peel.
	From outside ANOTHER SHOT ...

	Emma flings on a satin robe, goes to the window and sees --


37      HER POV

	a CAR zooooming past, its bowler-hatted driver racing thru early morning streets.  The
	damn thing BACKFIRES again ...


38      BACK TO SCENE

	Emma frowns, annoyed.


39      EXT.  STREETS - DAWN

	Zoom!  The sleek, sporty black Jaguar SS100 burns down deserted streets.  Inside is a
	bowler-hatted man --

	JOHN STEED, late 30's.  Handsome English gent, roguish looks, dandy's clothes.  A
	Beau Brummel figure in a Savile Row suit, velvet collar, embroidered waistcoat.
	A debonair Etonian, Steed oozes charm, wit and - when he chooses to -- hard-edged,
	steely menace.  He drives through --

40      LONDON (1999)

	This is 'Avengersland': a parallel world painted by Rene Magritte, forever England.
	Bright pinks, greens and reds, an imperial city in final decadent bloom.  White stucco
	buildings. Regency style in candy colors.  A surreally 90's city like a hipper, edgier
	version of the 60's preserved in aspic, where --

	Over the RADIO, a plummy voice:

					ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			... The War Office today approved military 
			expenditure for the nation's new defense alert 
			system. A spokesman  said he would raise the 
			matter at the forthcoming World  Council of 
			Ministers, but that a state of vigilance was 
			still necessary in the uncertain climate.

	As Steed turns into a mews, we realize that in this kinky, pop world, ordinary life does
	not intrude.  No traffic.  No extras.  Nothing to spoil the view.

	As the radio continues with a weather forecast, Steed --


41      EXT.  STEED'S GARAGE - DAWN	

	Steed's car enters his garage -- Door closes as --


42      INT.  STEED'S FLAT - DAWN

	but the curtains are still drawn so the place is dark.

	A large bachelor's den.  Dark wood, leather armchairs ...

	Steed enters his library from a concealed door --
	Titles on wine and birdwatching.  He clicks the door, goes to his drinks cabinet. Pours
	a brandy.  Hears a noise ...

	Instantly on guard.  In his glass, sees a shadowy reflection move.  Steed peers 'round a
	corner.  Sees a silhouetted figure stand over his desk -- a burglar?
	Steed sneaks up behind -- raises his umbrella, and --

	Crack!  Brings the umbrella down -- on the suspect's head.  Who manages to dodge,
	swivel 'round, and --

	Bam!  Delivers an expert blow to Steed's stomach.  A rapid exchange of blows.  Steed
	recoils, about to jab the umbrella, when --

	His assailant about to deliver a kick to his crotch -- Steed covers the area -- bam! a
	spiked heel hits his bowler -- as the curtains are drawn back, light floods in -- they
	freeze.

	Steed knows his opponent:  a lethal blonde in red leather.

					STEED
			Brenda -- ?


43      FROM ABOVE HIM

	a voice --

					MOTHER (O.S.)
			Steed -- ?!


44      BACK TO SCENE

	Steed swivels 'round to face -- upside down -- a man hanging like a bat from the ceiling
	inches before him --

	Pommaded hair, fat, dandyish:  MOTHER, head of secret services; hands of extendable
	metal hooks.  And BRENDA, his beautiful leather-clad bodyguard.  Who smiles
	seductively.

					STEED
			Mother. I thought you were burglars.

					MOTHER
			Brenda and I thought we'd drop in.

	Mother suits action to the word, drops into his wheelchair.

					BRENDA
			See how you're getting on ...

					STEED
			Something in the wind?

	Mother wheels himself from the study.  Taps a barometer.  It whirls around.

					MOTHER
			Weather's turning nasty.

					STEED
			You didn't come to talk about the
			weather, surely.

					MOTHER
			Oh yes I did. I want you to meet
			somebody.
				(off Steed's look)
			I expect you'll like her.

	Brenda coolly files her nails.  A flash of jealousy.

					STEED
			'Her'?


45      INT.  EMMA'S FLAT (PRIMROSE HILL) - DAY

	A groovy penthouse (a Lichtenstein come to life?).  Bach PIANO MUSIC floats in the
	air.

	Hands gliding over keys, Emma Peel plays with virtuoso skill.  On the piano, a framed
	picture of her late husband.  And a photo of Emma between Peter and Valentine.

	A KNOCK.  Emma gets up, goes to the door.  The MUSIC KEEPS PLAYING, keys
	jumping up and down automatically, as --


46      AT DOOR

	Emma flicks open a large automated eye.  Peers thru.  Opens


47      IN CORRIDOR

	A MESSENGER (distinctive outfit) hands over a package tied in a bow.

					MESSENGER
			Dr. Peel?

					EMMA
			Thank you ...

	Emma shuts the door.  Unties the bow, opens up  Finds an embossed card:

					EMMA
				(reads)
			'Please answer the Telephone.'

	Emma looks: The phone sits there.

	Just then ... RING-RING.  Emma goes over, picks up the phone.  A recorded message,
	an upper-class woman's voice:

					WOMAN (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Boodles Club, the Mall, 2:30 p.m.
			Mr. John Steed ... Boodles Club,
			the Mall, 2:30 p.m. Mr. John
			Steed ...

	BEEP.  The phone goes dead.  Emma opens up the case.  Unveils a brace of kippers.
	Puzzled, she holds up a fish.

					EMMA
			Kippers ...?


48      EXT.  BOODLE-S CLUB (PALL MALL) - DAY

	Near the Mall, outside white stucco buildings, a Lotus Elan pulls up and parks as a car
	conveniently leaves, cutting off another angry CAR.  HONK!  A dash clock says 2:15.
	Out gets --

	-- Emma Peel, different attire.  She climbs steps.  On a brass plaque, "Boodles
	Gentlemen's Club."  She goes in, passing --

	-- an astonished uniformed commissionaire.


49      INT.  BOODLES' LOBBY - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	A PORTER approaches her, equally surprised.

					PORTER
			May I help you, madam ...

					EMMA
			Mr. John Steed, please.

					PORTER
			I'm afraid that's impossible.

					EMMA
			Impossible?

	The Porter points to a notice:  "No non-members.  No animals.  No women."

					PORTER
			You are female?

					EMMA
			As you see.

					PORTER
			Then you can't come in.

					EMMA
			I have an appointment.

					PORTER
			No women. Not in Boodles. Not
			since 1922.

					EMMA
			Really -- what happened in 1922?

	Bored, Emma breezes past, already inside the hall.  Old mahogany, portraits of dead
	politicians, leather chairs.  A male enclave.

	The Porter rushes up to restrain her.

	Hardly missing a step, Emma lays a gentle hand on his shoulder -- finds the nerve ends. 
	The Porter winces and --

					EMMA
			Thank you so much. I can find Mr.
			Steed myself ...

	-- collapses on the ground in agony.  Emma ignores him.  Pushes thru double doors,
	upstairs, statues of naked bronze warriors frown down on her, into


50      INT.  BOODLES - TURKISH BATHS - DAY

	Thru a cloud of steam in an oriental room

	Steed sits naked save for a towel.  He hears a disturbance, thru the mist, sees --

	Emma before him.  Automatically, Steed dons his bowler and tips it in her direction.

					STEED
			Doctor Peel, I presume?

					EMMA
			And you must be Steed. Please
			don't get up.

	He doesn't.  HISSING STEAM between them as they study.

					STEED
			I was about to throw in the towel.

					EMMA
			I had a spot of bother at the door.

					STEED
			I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman
			inside Boodles since --

					EMMA
			1922. Why the kippers?

					STEED
			Red herring would have been too
			obvious, don't you think?

					EMMA
				(looks around)
			So what was all this -- some sort
			of test?

					STEED
			Congratulations, you've penetrated a 
			bastion of male privilege. I guessed 
			you weren't a stickler for Tradition, 
			doctor.

					EMMA
			Whereas you are.

					STEED
			Dyed in the wool. But I can admire 
			someone who doesn't play by the 
			rules.

					EMMA
			Rules are made to be broken.

					STEED
			Not by me. Play by the rules,
			Doctor, or the game is nothing.

					EMMA
			And just what is the game?

					STEED
			I say, this is all terribly formal.  
			Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel?

					EMMA
				(re:  the steamroom) 
			Under the circumstances, you may 
			call me Mrs. Peel.

					STEED
			Much better.

					EMMA
			And now that we've settled the matter 
			of honorifics, will you kindly explain 
			why you wished me to meet you?

					STEED
			I didn't. Mother did.

					EMMA
			Mother?

	Steed steps closer, smiling.

					STEED
			I expect you'll like him.

	Off Emma's reaction --


51      EXT.  THAMES RIVER (NEAR WHITEHALL) - DAY

	CAR ROAR OVER.  Down the embankment Parliament and Big Ben in b.g., the sleek
	Jaguar zooms at 60mph.  Steed dodges traffic --

	Wearing racing goggles, windscreen down --

	Executes a nifty maneuver, swerves on a zebra crossing, scatters pedestrians,
	HONKING his HORN.  Beside him, Emma is cool as a cucumber.  Steed turns
	charmingly.

					STEED
			Tea time -- four o'clock.  Mustn't
			be late.
				(beat)
			A word of warning. Don't take the
			macaroon. Mother's favorite.

	Steed swerves down a narrow alleyway, into a secret car park entrance by the
	riverbank.  He pulls up before a sign:

			RIVER THAMES WATER AUTHORITY
					No Admittance

	At a control barrier Steed inserts a card.  Emma sees a light flash up: "Security -- Top
	Priority Clearance Only."  The barrier lifts.  She looks again at Steed, reappraising him
	as Big Ben approaches four.  The car disappears in darkness ...

52      LARGE WINDOW CURTAIN

	opens, revealing water!  We are beneath the Thames -- garbage and fish float past a
	window of reinforced glass.  An original Campbell's tomato soup can floats down as we
	WIDEN to reveal ...

53      INT. SECRET SERVICE HQ - UNDERWATER - DAY

	Mother in his wheelchair, pulling the curtain cord.

					MOTHER
			That's better. I much prefer a
			womb with view, don't you, Mrs.
			Peel?

	A delicate CLOCK on the mantel CHIMES FOUR.

	Mother wheels himself forward and hooks onto the kettle.

					MOTHER
			Shall I be mother?

	He pours, presiding like a fat spider at the center of a subterranean web, known as The
	Ministry: a vast bureaucracy in a labyrinth of tunnels.

	Catches Emma's wandering lock

					MOTHER
			I expect you're wondering where
			you are.

	An atmosphere of a gentleman's club reigns in the subterranean bureau -- Emma takes
	her tea ...

					EMMA
			Don't tell me: You're the shadow secret 
			service. You're so hushhush, even the 
			legit secret service knows nothing about 
			it. Am I right?

	Bodyguard Brenda, a glam leather Moneypenny, wheels a trolley brimming with fancies
	over to Emma and Steed.

					MOTHER
			Close. We're so hush-hush, even
			we know nothing about it.
				(before Emma can
				make sense of this) 
			Now let's see, there's coconut cake, 
			date and walnut; I recommend the 
			rum baba ...

					EMMA
			Hmmm ...

					MOTHER
			Looks like rain, Steed...

					STEED
			... Showers followed by sunny periods.

					EMMA
				(looks up from
				trolley)
			We're not here to talk about the
			weather, surely.

					MOTHER
			Oh, yes we are.

					BRENDA
				(to Emma, cunning)
			Macaroon?

	Emma hesitates; takes a cake.  About to take a bite, when --

	Mother switches off lights.  A screen drops, covering the water window as the mood
	changes from coziness to terror -- an ancient PROJECTOR RATTLES on ...

54      IN DARKNESS

	Emma watches on the wall, an official Ministry film of macabre death tableaux in the
	English countryside:

					MOTHER
			We've had a series of bizarre weather reports.  
			We kept them hush-hush and sent agents into 
			the field for data. Case number one: 
			April 14, 3:35 P.M., Special Agent Simkins 
			investigating mysterious fires in corn circles.  
			A field outside the village of Little Snoring, 
			one of the hottest days of the year. Trapped 
			by a sudden blizzard. Found frozen to death 
			in a giant ice cube -- like a mammoth in 
			perma-frost.
				(the picture changes)
			Case two: Pilot Raymond Shaw, May 6, 11:28 A.M. 
			Took off from a deserted airstrip near Stoke Poges, 
			investigating bizarre atmospheric reports. A freak 
			rainstorm downed him. Knocked unconscious by a 
			flying fish, falling from 15,000 feet. Twenty-five 
			inches of rain in eight minutes, over an area the size 
			of a cricket pitch ...
				(the picture changes)
			... Case three: June 2, 5:43 P.M. Defense Chief 
			Major Courtnay. Remains discovered in a turnip 
			field near Ashby de la Zouche. Our boffins 
			recorded a sudden blast of heat. Scorched earth, 
			temperature of 1000 degrees. Spontaneous 
			combustion. Not much of him left ...

	CLICK.  The lights go back on.  Emma notices - a new arrival
	
	a tall, striking OLDER WOMAN; dark glasses.

					MOTHER
			My number two. Special assignments.  
			She's --

					EMMA
			Let me guess -- 'Father'?

					FATHER (OLDER WOMAN)
			All happy families here, Mrs. Peel.

	Father's dark glasses turn to Emma like a hawk.  Runs her fingers over Emma's face. 
	Gets the outline.  Emma realizes --

					EMMA
			You're --

	Blind ... Father smiles.

					FATHER
			God, you're quick.

					MOTHER
			Have a look at these, Mrs. Peel --

	He passes 'round a box of evidence related to the screen events:  Steed investigates a
	pair of black shoes and bowler; Emma, a fish.  The shoes have agent Simkins' name
	in them ...

					STEED
			Ah ... From Trubshaw's.  My
			shoemaker.

					EMMA
				(unimpressed)
			A kipper. Or a red herring? What were 
			they investigating?

					FATHER
			A series of bizarre shifts in local weather 
			patterns ...

					STEED
			Global warming?

					FATHER
			Jungle plants in the Arctic? A lush 
			English village transformed overnight 
			into African scrubland? Blizzards in summer?

					EMMA
			How curious ...

					MOTHER
			Something strange is happening. And 
			whoever knows about it doesn't want 
			us to find out.

					FATHER
				(to Steed)
			Your mission is simple. Find out
			how and why these agents died.

					EMMA
			I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?

					MOTHER
			Your research into climate engineering was 
			state-of-the-art. Your experiments could 
			have revolutionized our knowledge of global 
			warming -- had they succeeded. We need 
			your expertise.

					STEED
			Perhaps I'd better start calling you doctor 
			again, Mrs. Peel --

	Emma hesitates, unsure for the first time ...

					EMMA
			I'm not sure I'm ready to return to work.  
			I've been out of action for some time. I'll 
			consider your proposal.

	She gets up, ready to go.

					FATHER
			One moment, Mrs. Peel. There's another 
			special reason we wanted you to join our 
			happy family; rather curious, actually ...

	Mother hits the lights.  He flicks the video into slow-mo.  File thru image clarification,
	identikit sketches.

					MOTHER
			Eye witness reports. Strangers in the area.  
			One description tallied in all three places.  
			Recognize her?

	Emma locks.  On the screen comes -- Emma Peel.  Steed reacts.

					EMMA
			Me, isn't it?

	Emma stares at the screen: incredible.  Like a twin sister.

					FATHER
			Think of it as special assignment, Mrs. Peel.  
			With a twist. You're our chief suspect.

					EMMA
			You're saying I have no choice.

					MOTHER
			Father will be your controller. Steed here 
			will show you the ropes.

					EMMA
				(very arch)
			Ropes?

					STEED
			Think she really killed those agents?

					STEED
			Amnesia?

					MOTHER
			Possibly. Split personality ...

					STEED
			Insane ... ?

					MOTHER
			Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, 
			you should watch out.

					STEED
			Why?

					MOTHER
			She may try to kill you.


57      IN SHOOTING GALLERY

	Emma swiftly turns, aims, and --

	BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! FIRES with dead-eye precision. 
	All on target.  Steed reacts.  Ulp.

					STEED
			Perhaps I ought to talk with Dr. 
			Darling.

58      INT.  SECRET SERVICE HQ PSY OPS ROOM

	A gallery of portraits of Emma Peel projected on the wall based on Warhol's Jackie
	(1964) -- Poignant, inscrutable, fascinating, iconic -- blown up, dissected, analyzed. 
	The swirling newspaper dots cover Mother and Steed like bubbles from a light show.

	As DR. DARLING, head of the Ministry's Psychological Operations (Psy Ops) -- a
	kind of spy version of Timothy Leary, briefs them. In his thick dark glasses and beard,
	Darling's obsessive interest in Emma adds a sinister air.

					DR. DARLING
			One key point: Mrs. Peel is a widow:
			she's obsessively devoted to the memory 
			of her husband the scientist Peter Peel. 
			You may find her a little ... remote.

	Images of Peter Peel on the wall.  Of Emma with him.

					DR. DARLING
			They were a team. Met at Cambridge. 
			Working on a top secret research mission 
			into weather conditions, code name The
			Prospero Project, when Peel died.

	Steed looks meaningfully at Mother.

					MOTHER
			Something went wrong. System malfunction.  
			Explosion. Mrs. Peel had a narrow escape.  
			Suspected sabotage. Nothing proven. File 
			still open.

					STEED
			How come you took so much interest
			in her, Dr. Darling?

					DR. DARLING
			Her husband was one of ours.

					STEED
				(eyes Peel's photo,
				then Mother)
			Peel? Did she know?

					MOTHER
			Still doesn't. Better safe than sorry.  She 
			was in a dangerous game, Steed. High 
			stakes. She may prove to be a risk.  If 
			she is, there's only one solution.  Termination.

					STEED
			Anyone particular in mind?

					MOTHER
			You.

	OFF Steed's reaction.  CLASHING BLADES OVER ...


59      INT.  SECRET SERVICE FENCING SALON

	Steed and Emma (new outfit), cross swords.  Like everything else she does, Emma is a
	champion.  Steed is hard put.  Both fence attached to cables -- very high-tech 
	dueling ...

	Steed is in white; Emma (natch), in black ... yin and yang ...

					STEED
			You're a lady of hidden talents,
			Mrs. Peel ...

	Tic-tac ...

					EMMA
			I've no intention of hiding them ...

	Tic-tac ...

					STEED
			Scientist ...
				(tic-tac)
			... marksman ...
				(tic-tac)
			... swordsman ...
				(tic-tac)
			... To what do you attribute your 
			overachievements?

	Fast swordplay.  Tic-tac-tic-tac-tic.  Steed's good, too.

					EMMA
			My father always wanted a boy.

					STEED
			Really?  I fail to see the connection.

					EMMA
			I had a feeling you would. Touche!

	She lunges; her foil tips right into the heart on Steed's chest.  BUZZ!  Steed removes
	his mask; holds her foil tip.

					STEED
			I take your point.

	Emma takes off her mask.

					EMMA
			Do you?

					STEED
			Yes indeed. I need protection.


60      EXT.  SIGN - DAY

	"Trubshaw's of Jermyn Street, since 1756."  Steed's Jag parked in front -- of course
	there's a space.  Getting out

					EMMA
			I thought we were on our way.

					STEED
			Oh, absolutely, but Trubshaw's a man 
			worth meeting. No point setting out 
			half shod.

					EMMA
				(dry)
			Or half cocked.

61      CLOSEUP - TRUBSHAW

	slips Steed's hand-made shoes an.  The "lasts" shapes of shoes beside him -- bear
	Steed's name.

					STEED
			I couldn't agree more. Thank you, 
			Trubshaw.

					TRUBSHAW
				(significantly)
			Very good, Mr. Steed.

	WIDEN to reveal:


62      INT.  TRUBSHAW'S GENTLEMEN'S SHOP - DAY

	A bull moose's antlers.  A horned rhino.  A Leopard.  A tiger.  Then next to them, in a
	wall of hunting trophies Emma paces impatiently beneath them.  Shop assistants attend
	in tails and wing-collars, very old school tie.  Steed emerges helped into a new flashy
	waistcoat ...

					EMMA
				(gags at the waistcoat)
			Steed, we really must be --

					STEED 
				(relishing his shoes)
			Ahh. Perfect fit. The luxury of a 
			hand-made shoe. As unique as a face 
			or a fingerprint. Or should I say DNA?


63      BEHIND DISPLAY

	Eyes watching Emma and Steed rise ...

					EMMA
			You can but I wish you wouldn't ...

					STEED
			Thank you, Trubshaw ...

	A youngish man -- in black polo neck, Beatle-cut mop, pauting lips, smart suit, druggy
	high-pitched giggle.  BAILEY, a cocky, cool psychopath.  He watches Steed and
	Emma leave ...

	... and saunters after them ...  CAR ROAR OVER.


64      EXT.  LONDON STREETS - DAY

	as the Jag races through them, heading for the country.

					EMMA (V.O.)
			That place is so absurd, so out of date ...

					STEED (V.O.)
			Do you really think so?

	Another car follows them ... as they pass Buckingham Palace, now painted pink and
	guarded by female grenadiers ...

65      SIGN

	reading:  "Scotland" with an arrow, as Steed and Emma zoom past in the Jag ...

					STEED (V.O.)
			Press that button, would you?
			Tea?

66      CLOSEUP - SPECIAL DASHBOARD COMPARTMENT

	opens, revealing a tea service: a samovar of tea, feeding into a pre-warmed pot,
	pouring into two china cups ...

	WIDEN to reveal:

67      INT.  JAG - DAY

	Emma, reacts, pours from the samovar ...

					STEED
			Sorry. Didn't mean to interrupt
			your flow of oratory ...


	Steed's JAG BACKFIRES again as at the beginning ...

					EMMA
			You know what I mean. This car
			-- and you. Nobody walks around
			like that. Milk?

					STEED
			Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs.
			Peel. No thank you.

	She hands over a cup.

					EMMA
			But why? What's the point?

					STEED
			A Gentleman has to have a code.
			This is part of mine. A uniform.
			Think of it as my suit of shining
			armor.

					EMMA
			And I suppose you're the knight.

					STEED
			The most unpredictable piece on
			the board. And always ready to
			protect his queen.

					EMMA
			That's predictable. When I find
			a queen in need of protection
			I'll let you know.

	Steed looks in the mirror.  Behind them, a car.  Tailing?

					STEED
			I'm hoping you will.

	He puts his foot down.  Zoom ...


68      EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

	Towards picturesque Scotland.  The JAG ROARS by - then the other car ...


69      INT.  JAG - DAY

	Emma consults a list, reads --

					EMMA
			Sir August Merryweather ... why
			are we seeing him first?

					STEED
			As per mother's instructions.

					EMMA
			Do we always follow Mother's
			instructions?

					STEED
			For a man in my position --

					EMMA
			Just what is your position, if you don't 
			mind my asking.  How did a stuffed 
			shirt like you get into this line of work?

					STEED
				(smiles)
			They call me in when they've reached a 
			dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.

					EMMA
			I have no choice. Why should you
			risk your life?

					STEED
			After our fencing match, I was rather 
			hoping you would do the risking.  
			More tea?

					EMMA
			No thanks.

					STEED
			I meant me.

	Emma takes in Steed's evasive answers.  Sighing, she pours.


70      EXT.  HIGHLANDS - DAY

	The Jag winds around Loch Ness, followed by the car.

					STEED (V.O.)
			According to Mother, Sir August owns 
			half of the Highlands. A millionaire.  
			Former head of Special Projects at the 
			Ministry. Now ...

					EMMA (V.O.)
			An eccentric recluse?


71      INT.  JAG - DAY

					STEED
			Not so much eccentric. More barking 
			mad. He has a wife called June. And 
			a daughter somewhere -- Julie.

					EMMA
			June, July ... August?

					STEED
			The family does seem to be somewhat 
			meteorologically inclined.

					EMMA
			Any other vices?

					STEED
			All of a piece, really. A fanatical 
			weatherman. Chairman of BROLLY.
				(off her look)
			British Royal Organisation For
			Lasting Liquid Years. Thinks British 
			weather has been tampered with 
			by ... aliens.

	Emma takes this in.

					EMMA
			So ... I distract him while you snoop 
			around? How?

					STEED
			Small talk.  Try the weather.


72      EXT.  HUGE COUNTRY HOUSE - DAY

	Steed and Emma speed up to the huge open main gates

	Signs:  "Private: No Admittance."  Guards in hunting gear and plus fours, with loaded
	rifles.  They start up the drive ...

	Several peacocks on the lawn fan open their beautiful tails.

	One of them, a mechanical peacock whose thousand eyes CLICK with the WHIR of a
	CAMERA ...

	The other car pulls in behind. Inside, reveal Bailey watching them.


73      INT.  MANOR HOUSE CORRIDOR - DAY

	On a tartan carpet, a SCOTTIE BARKS furiously at a set of EXPIRING BAGPIPES
	on the floor.  PAN UP to reveal:

	A BUTLER leading Emma down the corridor --

	-- where she admires the eccentric fixtures, pausing to note a large teddy bear outfit
	with tartan trimmings instead of the usual suit of armor.

					EMMA
			Original ...

					BUTLER
			This way, miss ...

					EMMA
			Missus ...

	He opens the double doors, admitting Emma into


74      INT.  A LARGE ROOM

	of semi-tropical climate.  Jungle plants, parakeets, snakes.  Walls lined with display
	cabinets and bell jars:  stuffed birds, butterflies, spiders.  A thermometer reads:

	100 degrees with high humidity. The Butler leaves.

	Emma fans herself.  Nobody in the roam.  But hears a sound of RAINFALL from a
	smoked glass conservatory.

					EMMA
			Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ?

					VOICE (O.S.)
			Eh? In here!

	Emma follows the SOUND, steps cautiously forward.

75      INT.  CONSERVATORY

	beneath a sprinkler system of torrential rain, an old man splashes in bizarre rubber togs.
	Emma stays cool.

					EMMA
			I've come to apply for membership
			in Brolly --

					SIR AUGUST
				(shouts above the tempest)
			You don't get rain like you used to in 
			England. A good shower that's the ticket.  
			Stiffens resolve, puckers the spirit, quells 
			the namby-pamby in a man.

	SIR AUGUST steps out of the shower and wind machine.  A belted rubber macintosh,
	flippers, goggles.  He starts to disrobe, the NOISE DIES DOWN --

					EMMA
			I so agree. How did you acquire a 
			taste for it?

					SIR AUGUST
			Out in India. So character-forming for the 
			British. Not the heat. Good Lord, no. The 
			rain, dash it. A good monsoon. Fifteen 
			inches overnight. A whole week of lovely 
			rain. I remember one summer in Jaipur ...

	Sir August removes his goggles, recognizes her.

					SIR AUGUST
			You

					EMMA
			Have we met?

					SIR AUGUST
			You mean you don't recall??

	Before Emma can reply, the door opens...

					SIR AUGUST
			Ah, Lady June ...

	Emma's attention switches to LADY JUNE, a buxom lady in a sou'wester and galoshes,
	who wheels in a tray of scones.

					LADY JUNE
			Dear August.  Loves his showers.
			Like a baby.
				(beat)
			Scones, Mrs. Peel?

					EMMA
			Thank you, Lady -- June ...

	Emma sees Sir August gazing wistfully out of the window, which is rapidly 
	darkening ...

					SIR AUGUST
			Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised.

					EMMA
			Promised? Who promised?

					SIR AUGUST
			There, look!

	Emma looks, sees rain start to pitter-patter on the windows.  Emma exchanges looks
	with June as the rain starts pouring.

					SIR AUGUST
			Imagine being caught out in a blow 
			like that!

76      EXT.  MOORLAND - DAY

	THUNDER and lightning -- Steed is caught out in it; puts up his umbrella; wanders
	over the brow of a hill, past a big sign:  "No Trespassers."  Rains more.  And more.
	Turns to a tempest, as --

					STEED
			I say, this is a bit much.

	Lashed by rain ' Steed carries on to the brow of the hill.  He looks over, peers through
	the mist at --

	A deep purple cloud.  Mushrooming towards him.

	Steed can't escape it.  It envelops him.  Starts to blink.  Cough.  Footsteps less sure. 
	Surrounded by thick purple haze

	Steed stumbles and falls

	Down a hill.  Tumbles to the bottom.  He knocks his head on a rock.  Steed blinks,
	shakes his head.  Eyes refocus.  He sees


77      UNDULATING SAND DUNES

	Sun shining down on yellow sand, a barren vista.  Dead trees.  Suddenly Steed's in the
	Sahara.  A heat haze shimmers.

	Steed blinks, thinks he's dreaming when he sees ...


78      IN DISTANCE - RED PHONE BOX

	Steed heads towards it.  The PHONE BOX seems further away.  Like an optical
	illusion.  Then hears RINGING.

	Steed still bowler-hatted.  Overcoat.  Perspiring.  Takes off bowler, wipes brow. 
	Adjusts rose in buttonhole.  It wilts.

	He arrives at the phone box. Opens the door.  Steed picks up the RINGING PHONE,
	listens to --

	A SCRATCHY ORCHESTRAL RECORDING of "The Merry Widow."

					STEED
			'The Merry Widow'...?

	Over the MUSIC, a strange --

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			... Hello ... Hello? ... Who the
			hell...? Who is this? ... You must
			leave the test area. I repeat,
			leave the area ... Help is on the
			way ...

	CLICK.  The line goes dead.  Steed is baffled.  Steps out, sees --


79      ON HORIZON

	a shimmering heat haze.  A figure on a camel moving towards them.  Steed watches
	amazed, as the camel pads closer ...

	The mirage arrives. The rider dismounts. A woman in yashmak and veils. She draws
	closer. Drops the veils to reveal --

	Emma Peel.  In her black leather catsuit.

					.STEED
			Mrs. Peel. Good of you to drop by. 
			And I see you're wearing your - 
			riding outfit?

	Emma moves closer.  Steed smiles at her.  Emma closer and -- chop! -- gives a kung-fu
	jab to the throat, a kick to the balls, a jab to the stomach.  As Steed lies on the 
	ground --

					STEED
			Manners, Mrs. Peel.

	Emma takes out a .38 GUN, points at his heart, FIRES -- 

	BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!  FOUR SHOTS --


80      EMMA'S POV

	-- The bullets strike his chest.  Round his heart.  Steed slumps back on the sands.  Eyes
	close ...


81      EMMA

	moves over him. Drops a small toy snowshaker into his curled fingers. Blows a good
	bye kiss.


82      STEED'S POV	82

	The sun.  Clouds roll by.  The camel peers down at him.

									
		FADE TO BLACK.

	Sound of CLACKING ...

	FADE IN:

83      INT.  SECRET SERVICE HOSPITAL - DAY

	A hospital ward.  Empty apart from one bed.  A nurse (Brenda in her red leather), her
	spiked heels clacking on the floor, brings over a cup of tea to

	Steed in a hospital bed.  Who wakes, surprised to see Emma.  Peering over him.  Very
	nonchalant.  Eating his grapes.

					STEED
			Ah, Brenda ...
				(as she leaves)
			Mrs. Peel?

					EMMA
			You should be dead.  How do you
			feel?

					STEED
				(eyes her)
			Strange.

					EMMA
			You were very lucky.  Four shots to 
			the heart. I found you after I slipped 
			away from Sir August. Mother brought 
			you here. Not me you should thank.

					STEED
			I wasn't about to.

					EMMA
			I mean your man Trubshaw.  Your
			bullet-proof waistcoat.  I thought 
			you were just overdressed.

					STEED
			I might say the same.

84      FROM GALLERY

	Mother with Dr. Darling taking notes.  Emma looks up at them.  Drops to a whisper. 
	But they both are wearing headphones.

					EMMA
			Mother and Dr. Darling have me 
			under observation. They think I 
			tried to kill you.

					STEED
			Why should they think that?

					EMMA
			You told them. You said I arrived 
			on a camel, shot you four times. 
			Left you for dead.

					STEED
			Frankly that's how I remember it.

					EMMA
			But that's absurd. I may not be 
			over-fond of you, Steed, but it's 
			not my style.

					STEED
			Perhaps your memory plays tricks,
			Mrs. Peel.

					EMMA
				(conceding)
			That's possible. Sir August was convinced 
			he'd met me before. But I'd never met him.  
			Another odd thing. When it rained, he said 
			it was just as someone had promised.

					STEED
			Did he say who?

					EMMA
			No. But he must know. Incidentally, 
			my double left you with this.

	Emma shows Steed the toy snow scene.  A winter wonderland snow scene.  He looks
	puzzlingly at it.  On its underneath. "The Wonderland Corporation," followed by --

					STEED
			An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...?

					EMMA
			Did you say formal? I must dress.


85      EXT.  LONDON STREET - NIGHT

	The sporty Jag pulls up outside a tall, swanky building.  Steed gets out, opens her door.
	Irritated, Emma steps out of the car, clad in her leather suit --


86      CLOSEUP OF HER HEEL

	hitting the street.   PAN UP TO Steed, admiring --

					STEED
			I must say, you look more your
			old self --

					EMMA
			You mean my other self ...

					STEED
			Either way ... may I ask: why
			you dress in that fashion?

					EMMA
			I should have thought that was
			obvious ...
				(off his smirk)
			I'm in mourning.

	She moves off.  Stay on his poker face.

					STEED
			I can't wait to see afternoon.

	He joins her; they survey the building.

					EMMA
			Where's the picnic?

	They look up to --


87      INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

	A boardroom suite, overlooking London.  Lights twinkling --

	Around a conference table.  Twelve TEDDY BEARS.  Each six feet tall.  Ridiculous
	and sinister.  In pink, turquoise, brown, black, white, green.  Furry, giant paws and
	ears, swivel eyes.  One teddy sports a familiar tartan ...

	On the table, children's party food: jellies, hundreds and thousands, birthday cakes. 
	And wrapped presents before each.

	Each bear has a name-badge: Bobby, Bobo, Bruno, Bibi, Betty, Binky etc. pinned to
	their fur.  A children's tune, "THE TEDDY BEAR'S PICNIC," plays.  Followed by -
	a gavel rapping order.

	A distinctively chilling voice, eerily familiar and seductive, which ECHOES through our
	story --

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Ladies, gentlemen and bears ...

	The teddy bears look round.  Can't hear who's talking.

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Today is history. The first day of the future. 
			I welcome you to the first general meeting 
			of the Wonderland Corporation, now allied 
			with our colleagues from Brolly ...

	Murmurs of congratulations amongst the bears ...

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			You have all given time, money and expertise 
			to achieve our goal. But we are reaching a 
			new phase of our operation. From today, 
			many of you will no longer be needed. I have 
			to warn you ...

	Dismay from the teddy bears.  As a CUCKOO CLOCK RINGS OUT,

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			A cuckoo.  The first sign of spring, and ... 
			A cuckoo in our nest. Our organization is 
			no longer secret. Agents are investigating 
			us. Their names are John Steed and Emma 
			Peel. I believe we have a traitor among us 
			... perhaps more than one ...

	Uproar from the teddy bears.  Shouts of "Who?" (*PS: One of the Teddys is a giant
	rabbit who seems especially alarmed).

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			That remains to be seen. When we find 
			the traitors, they will be dealt with severely.

					TEDDY BEAR #l
			These agents.  Where are they?

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Here. In this building. By our estimate, they 
			will enter this room in thirty-five point five 
			seconds precisely ...

	Panic.  The bears scramble to go, bumping into each other.

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			I am sorry the party is over.  But we 
			shall meet again.
			To each of you a gift. A token of
			my appreciation.

	In front of the teddy bears, each one receives a present wrapped up in paper with a pink
	and silver bow.

	The tartan teddy opens his up:  A snow scene.  Anxious moans.


88      INT.  BUILDING - NIGHT

	UP and inside fire staircase, Emma and Steed run up -- Open the door to the
	conference room.  The CUCKOO RINGS on their entry.  To FIND an empty room.
	Only the party detritus plus little teddy bears sitting where formerly the big ones sat; the
	teddy bear picnic MUSIC PLAYING again OVER ...

	One snow shaker left.  Steed picks it up:  Inside it:


89      TINY EMMA PEEL

	in black leather.

					STEED (O.S.)
			For you, Mrs. Peel.


90      BACK TO SCENE

	Emma stares at it.  Turns it over:  an address.

					EMMA
			Another invitation. 38 Marlborough
			Terrace ...


91      INT.  EMBASSY (BELGRAVIA) - NIGHT

	Inside number 38, a deserted Eastern bloc embassy.  A dilapidated hammer and sickle
	tapestry in tatters.  Old spy techno-junk lies discarded in elegant living rooms.

	Steed and Emma open the door, rush inside.

	They search for clues.  A cigar left in an ashtray.  Steed picks it up with distaste. 
Then   moves over to the wine rack, picks up a vintage bottle of champagne --

					STEED
				(admiringly)
			Hm ... A Veuve-Cliquot '56 ...
				(then puzzled)
			But he bites the end of his
			Monte Cristos ... ?
				(frowning)
			Clearly, we're dealing with a
			maniac.

	Meanwhile, Emma goes into the --


92      NEXT ROOM - EMMA'S POV

	where she sees a blob of BUBBLING GUNK, like radioactive chewing gum.  A few
	pieces of charred clothing tell us this was once a man in a teddy bear outfit.


93      BACK TO SCENE

	Steed enters behind her, examines the gunk.

					STEED
			Colonel Crabtree. International
			Satellite Systems. Formerly of
			the Ministry.

					EMMA
			How on earth can you tell?

	Steed holds up the inside of a battered shoe:  the name.

					STEED
			Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw
			isn't the only shoemaker still
			practicing his trade ...

					EMMA
			Very good, Steed ...

	A MEWLING SOUND.

					EMMA
			What's that?

	Leaving Steed to ponder the remains, Emma goes into


94      ANOTHER ROOM

	Dark.  Switches on the light.  And gasps.


95      STEED

	looks up as Emma emerges with - 

	A Leopard cub.  Steed raises his brolly.

					STEED
			What on earth?

					EMMA
			Any ideas?

					STEED
			Well, he was a fellow of the Royal
			Zoological Society ...

					EMMA
			Is that written in his shoe?

					STEED
				(smug)
			Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...

					EMMA
				(shrugs)
			She had this in her mouth. There,
			there...

	Cooing to the cub, Emma tosses to Steed -- another snowshaker.  Inside -- another
	address:  84 Cadogan Place.

					STEED
			Not again.  There's got to be
			another. way to go about this.


96      EXT.  CADOGAN PLACE APARTMENT BUILDING (KNIGHTSBRIDGE) -
	NIGHT

	Down a sheer wall Emma Peel abseils with rope and crampons.  Before gliding through
	an open French window --


97      INT.  KNIGHTSBRIDGE FLAT - NIGHT

	Emma investigates.  Nobody there.  She looks 'round.  Military memorabilia.  Busts of
	Napoleon and Charlemagne.  Looks inside drawers.  Desks.  Meanwhile --


98      INT.  STEED'S JAG - NIGHT

	Steed feeds a carton of milk to the leopard, who is a handful ... licking, pawing him ...

					STEED
			Now, now ...
				(sings)
			'I can't give you anything but
			love, baby...'


99      INT.  KNIGHTSBRIDGE FLAT - NIGHT	

	Emma searching ...


100     OUTSIDE FLAT DOOR	100

		a key in lock.  Door opens.  Silence.


101     INSIDE - EMMA

	finds a snowshaker.  About to look underneath.  Hears a NOISE.  Looks up, in front of
	her in the mirror, sees -A giant teddy behind her.  Ready to strike --

	Emma swivels 'round,  a fluid balletic motion, and --

	Bam!  A kick to the teddy's stomach.  Then off balance, Emma hurls him over her
	shoulder, darts in to pin the teddy to the ground as --

	The teddy grabs Emma's legs, flings her off balance.  She falls.  Teddy grabs a military
	sabre from the wall, and Woosh!  Slices through air at Emma's head.  She ducks.  The
	sabre skims her hair.  Emma grabs another sabre; the fight is on!

	Emma counterattacks.  Slashes with the sabre and the teddy's head goes flying off! 
	Jesus.  The torso stands unsteadily.

	Emma's eyes widen as:

	A man's head emerges from the teddy torso.

	Emma's so surprised, he can slug her ...

	Emma's out.

102     INT.  STEED'S JAG - NIGHT

	so is Steed and the Leopard -- both asleep.  A little milk dribbles down Steed's chin ...


103     INT.  KNIGHTSBRIDGE FLAT - NIGHT

	The man goes to the other room.  Starts to take off the rest of his teddy costume. 
	Throws clothes into a suitcase.

	The PHONE.  Terrified, the Man picks it up ... The voice ...

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Naughty teddy ...

					MAN
			No! You can't ...

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Ask not for whom the telephone
			rings, it rings for thee ...

					MAN
			But I've got rid of her.  She's ...

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Go to the window ... To the window.

	Teddy moves to the open window.  Sudden PAIN.  LIGHTNING.

	Teddy looks up in terror as a purple cloud releases another BOLT.  Direct hit.  The
	teddy slumps to the ground.  Soggy, waterlogged, very dead.  Kinda like the
	other guy ...


104     IN OTHER ROOM

	Meanwhile Emma wakes up. Turns the corner.  Towards the other room, sees dead
	Teddy.  Reads the label on his suitcase ...

					EMMA
			Major D'Arcy ... ?


105     OVER HER SHOULDER

	from the window behind her like a spider on glass appears another "Emma" --

	-- let's call her Bad Emma -- coming straight for Emma.  She makes a NOISE.  Emma
	turns just in time to see.

					EMMA
			Well, well. If it isn't me ...

	Emma starts towards her double, who hesitates, then turns, leaping out the window ...
	she wears the same black catsuit.

	The real Emma rushes, follows her "double"

	Clambers outside to rappel up the line to


106     EXT. ROOFTOPS - NIGHT

	Emma looks.  Beneath a starlit sky criss-crossed by wires, a rooftop maze of buildings,
	flanked by giant gargoyles -- goblins, lions, griffins -- over twinkling lights ...

	Emma searches the roof -- no sign, only shadows.  Then turns a corner to see --

	Above the city, fairy lights on the rooftops of Harrods, lit by a million bulbs ... giant
	neon signs ...

	Several floors below, Emma sees the streets.  A twinge of vertigo.  Then she looks up,
	hears a NOISE -- From:


107     BEHIND GARGOYLE

	she sees her "double" run.  Emma gives chase.

	Hot pursuit.  Over rooftops.  'Round wires.  PAST neon signs high over the city ...

	Emma follows.  Gains on the "double," who --

	Pushes faster.  Gliding between rooftop buildings.  Dodging, weaving.  But Emma
	gains more.  Sleek limbs, muscular, perfect body machine, until --


108     EMMA'S POV

	as she sees her "double" leap over a yawning chasm.  And stumble on the other side for
	a footing.


109     BACK TO SCENE

	as Emma's adrenaline surges.  She cannot stop, she --

	Jumps!  Hangs in the air.  Limbs pushing out for the edge.  And only just, she lands
	perfectly, gaining, closing, until --


110     ON NEXT ROOFTOP

	Emma gains up close.  A final burst of acceleration.  Then without warning, her
	"double" --

	Turns, Emma catches up, and --

	Wham!  Wham!  A kick -- a chop to Emma's body - double scissorkick -- Emma reacts
	swiftly, surges into overdrive --

	In a lightning-fast kung fu duel -- CRACK OF BONE -- CRUNCH OF BLOWS -- a
	flurry of kicks as Emma --

	Lands on her back.  The "double" attacks.  Emma retaliates --

	Kicks up her leg -- flings the "double" over her head she lands awkwardly -- a
	METALLIC CRUNCH in a blow to her head -- but picks herself up without pausing

	And vanishes into the rooftop maze.


111     AGAINST SKYLINE

	Emma stands.  Looks.   She's lost her "double."  She stands alone, silhouetted against
	the night sky.

	Caught in the moonlight.  Above sparks of neon.  Daunting, muscular, poised for
	action, as --

	Ears listening to distant noises.  SWOOSHING TRAFFIC.  FLUTTER of BIRD
	WING.  HUM of WIND through wires.  Then an AUDIBLE SNAP --

112     EMMA'S POV - HIGH ANGLE

	above her a SPAM as a STEEL CABLE WIRE of an aerial is snapped.  Slowly wound 
	tightly 'round, bent back, coiled, ready to spring --

113     BACK TO SCENE - EMMA

	looks 'round.  Sees nothing, hears the sound of the WHIPLASH coming seconds 
	before --

	Through the air --


114     EMMA'S POV

	a flashing line like a bolt of lightning, but cannot move quickly enough as --


115     BACK TO SCENE

	as a cable wire whips across, coils 'round Emma, lashing her tight, crushing air from
	her, as the wire --

	Sweeps Emma off her feet, whiplashes her back like a spring, hoists her and dangles her
	over the city.  She looks down.

	A long way.

	Emma grabs hold of the wire, which pulls her back.  She drops down to the rooftop ...

	Slithers down the roof.  Slips --


116     OVER LEDGE

	Emma hangs on with fingertips.

	Overlooking city with 100-foot neon sign above her:


117     ADVERTISEMENT

	for "Wonderland Weather" with: a repeated loop of a 100-foot high bikini-clad
	"Emma" throwing head back in holiday fun -- Sign: "COMING SOON -- THE
	NATURAL BEAUTY OF WONDERLAND WEATHER."


118     BACK TO SCENE

	Emma hangs on, looks up, stares at "herself."  The surreal repetition of the loop. 
	Overlooking the whole city.

	Dizzy, Emma threatens to pass out.  Just when from --


119     ABOVE HER

	an unseen hand from Bad Emma winds down --

	Another CABLE for her to hold.  It uncoils down past the windows, telltale SPARKS
	flare up as it hits metal --

	Emma tries to grab for it.  Misses, then grabs hold, and -- a LIVE CABLE -- a
	thousand VOLTS surge through her body --

	-- A shock, Emma plummets DOWN TO --


120     STRIPED AWNING

	on a lower ledge.  She hangs precariously.  Catching her breath.  About to redouble her
	efforts.  When beside her from a --


121     BALCONY WINDOW

	an umbrella extended.  Steed reaches out, reels Emma in.  They are back in Teddy's 
	flat ... Emma collapses in Steed's arms.  He helps her up -- hands her a phone.

					STEED
			For you, Mrs. Peel.

					EMMA
			Thanks ...
				(dry)
			I see what you mean about letting
			me do the risking ... Hello?

	It's Sir August.

					SIR AUGUST (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Mrs. Peel ... Come quickly.
			Brolly's been betrayed! I'll tell
			you everything ... The weather's
			getting worse and worse ... they're
			after me ... coming for me ... come
			quickly!

	CLICK.

					EMMA
			Sir August...?
				(to Steed)
			What now?

					STEED
			Ask Mother.

	Sound OVER:  RING-RING.

122     INT.  MANOR HOUSE (SCOTLAND) - DAY

	Sir August gripped with terror, stares at the PHONE.  The scotty DOG BARKS.
	Finally, Sir August answers.

					SIR AUGUST
			Mrs. Peel -- ?

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Ask not for whom the telephone
			rings ...

					SIR AUGUST
			No, please! I beg you ...

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Walk over to the window ...

					SIR AUGUST
			Let it be rain, please let it be --

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Stay by the window. By the window.

	Mesmerized, Sir August goes to the window. Looks -- Lady June arrives, too late.


123     OUTSIDE

	a purple cloud of cyclone-force rages towards him.  A luminous glow.  Then a
	LIGHTNING STRIKE. And --

	BOOM!  An EXPLOSION BLASTS the WINDOWS.  A WIND rushes
	in ...

					FATHER (V.O.)
			Emergency alert ...


124     EXT.  WHITEHALL STREETS - DAY

	PAST obscure imperial statues a tiny micro Messerschmidt bubble car tootles down
	deserted streets.

					FATHER (V.O.)
			A cyclone hit Banffshire last night.
			Completely unpredicted ...


125     INSIDE CAR

					EMMA
			Where's Mother?

					FATHER
			Mobile HQ. In a blue funk.  Can't 
			take chances. I'm looking after 
			things while he's hiding out ...

	Father drives like a maniac.  She senses their unease.

					FATHER
			You're probably wondering how I 
			can drive 'blind.' Simple. A new 
			prototype from the boys in X division.  
			Micro-sensors in the system read 
			signals and road information. Converts 
			the info into miles per hour. 
			Ultra-sensitive.  Ultra-smart.

	Father jumps a red light.  CARS SCREECH together in a huge pile-up.  Not that smart. 
	Steed holds onto his hat.

					STEED
			We know one thing. That suspect
			was not Mrs. Peel.

					FATHER
			So you say ... 

					EMMA
			You don't believe him?

					FATHER
			It's Mother you have to convince.
			He's very agitated.  Wait here.

	Father SCREECHES to a halt on Holland Park Avenue

	Steed and Emma get out.  Father takes off ...

					EMMA
			But

					STEED
			Don't bother.  Here's a bus ...

	A red London number 22 bus drives up.  As it arrives, in a conductor's cap is -- the
	bodyguard, Brenda.

					BRENDA
			Fares, please,


126     INT.  BUS - DAY

	Steed and Emma board the bus.  Destination:  Not In Service.  They pay Brenda, the
	conductor.  Go upstairs.


127     UPSTAIRS

	is Mother's temporary mobile HQ.  He squats in a corner.  Metal hooks on electronic
	panels.  Now paranoid.  Suspicious.  All the upper windows have been blacked out.

					MOTHER
			Welcome to mobile H.Q. Weather's 
			turning quite nasty. Sir August was 
			blown to smithereens. Along with 
			half of Banffshire.  The Ministry's 
			worried.

					EMMA
			He tried to warn us ...

					STEED
			We had a lead to Wonderland
			Weather but we got there too late.
			Someone tipped them off ...

					MOTHER
			Too late anyway. Today's escapade 
			was only for starters. This is no 
			ordinary weather. It's manmade. A 
			kind of weather bomb.

					STEED
			Impossible.

					EMMA
			Not quite. This is my field.

					STEED
			Is there anything that isn't?

					EMMA
				(ignores)
			The Prospero Project was started by 
			my husband. It was an early attempt 
			to solve the problems of global warming.  
			In theory, climate engineering is entirely 
			feasible. We thought of injecting a 
			chemical cocktail into the atmosphere 
			by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'...

					STEED
			Filling in mother nature's blind
			spots ... ?

					EMMA
			Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts 
			to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea.  
			Propane gas mostly. In small quantities 
			it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone 
			layer. But it proved impractical. 
			Too bulky ...

					STEED
			But if someone miniaturized the
			process...

					EMMA
			That's what we were working on.

					STEED
			Sounds as if someone's hijacked
			your research.

					MOTHER
			Would it be possible to use it for
			military purposes?

					EMMA
			Directed by laser. Bounced by
			satellite. Quite possible.

					STEED
			Where would they aim for?

	Mother thinks, gets out of his wheelchair; takes a turn about the bus, sits down again. 
	No one pays any attention.

					MOTHER
			London. The World Council of Ministers 
			meets soon on global defence. If you can 
			control the weather, you control the world.

					EMMA
			After the cold war ...

					STEED
			The hot and cold war ...

	Sign "Grand Opening Soon."  WIDEN to reveal ...


128     EXT.  WONDERLAND WEATHER OFFICES - DAY

	Steed looks around, picks the lock ... hi-tech style ...


129     INT.  WONDERLAND WEATHER OFFICES - DAY

	A kind of space-age travel agency.  Steed enters.

	At the reception desk, the receptionist has her back turned.  Steed sneaks in, moves
	behind a screen, overhears --

	A man -- Bailey -- giving orders to the receptionist

					BAILEY
			New orders. The penultimate phase. 
			Now fully operational ...

	Steed moves away from them, pushes a set of double doors open, arrives inside --


130     INT.  WONDERLAND OFFICE - DISPLAY - DAY

	A long corridor surrounded by a presentation of --

	Virtual reality weather:  clouds, sunny vistas, lush meadows, desert.  And slogans: 
	"Be natural.  Act natural.  Think natural.  The natural beauty of Wonderland Weather."

	Steed reacts; the model is the same as Emma on the big neon sign near Harrods ...

	Steed finds a desk.  Inspects papers.  Sees a postcard of a large stately home.  He
	pockets it.  Then looks 'round to see --

	Bailey before him.  We recognize him as the young dandy trailing Steed.  Neither gives
	away the other.

					BAILEY
			We're not yet open for business,
			I'm afraid.

					STEED
			Shame. I was recommended. By a
			friend.

					BAILEY
			Really?

					STEED
			Sir August Merryweather? I was
			looking for something relaxing.
			Say, a Tuscan hillside in June?

					BAILEY
			Normally, we'd be eager to
			oblige --

					STEED
			Seriously?  

					BAILEY
			Of course. Natural weather delivered
			to your door on demand. Down your
			phoneline. For limited periods.

					STEED
			You don't say. How real does it feel?

					BAILEY
			As real as you wish. Hot or cold.
			Humid or dry. Anything you like.
			Within reason.

					STEED
			There are limits?

					BAILEY
			The technology is brand new. Soon 
			it will be more powerful. We 
			anticipate a huge demand. Leave us 
			your number. We'll be in touch.

					STEED
			No need. I'll call again.

	Steed raises his bowler.  Bailey watches him go.


131     EXT.  WONDERLAND OFFICES - STREET - DAY

	Steed emerges, stares at his postcard -- the stately home and:  
	"Headquarters, Wonderland Weather, Ltd." as --

					EMMA (V.O.)
			My car. I'll drive.


132     EXT.  COUNTRY ROADS - DAY

	Emma's LOTUS ELAN WHIZZES BY...

					STEED (V.O.)
			A day in the country ...


133     INT.  LOTUS - DAY

					EMMA
			Three agents killed by bad weather...

					STEED
			... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...

					EMMA
				(ignores)
			Then a mad millionaire. Head of a secret 
			defense establishment. A group of 
			eccentrics obsessed by weather ...

					STEED
			... And by you, Mrs. Peel. Everything 
			points to you.  No sisters?  No 
			undiscovered twin?

					EMMA
			Not that I know of.  Explanation?

					STEED
			According to Dr. Darling, you're a 
			psychopathic personality with 
			schizophrenic delusions, suffering from 
			recurring amnesia based on traumatic 
			repression, leading to outbursts of 
			anti-social and violent behavior.  Q.E.D.

	Steed lets it sink in.  Emma looks a little hurt.

					EMMA
			Is that what you think?

					STEED
			Oh, well ...
				(beat)
			Just my type, Mrs. Peel.


134     EXT.  COUNTRY LANES - SEVERAL ANGLES - DAY

	The Lotus races 'round blind corners.  Hairpin bends.  Across a train at a level crossing,
	which just misses them --


135     INT. LOTUS - DAY

	Emma sees Steed hold on for dear life. She smirks --

					STEED
			Do you always drive this fast?

					EMMA
			Have I trespassed on a male
			prerogative?
				(before his reply)
			We're being followed. I saw him
			at Trubshaw's ...

	Steed looks into the mirror, sees a car behind them.  Pulling up, trying to catch up.
	Emma glances in the mirror, and --

					EMMA
			Hold on ...

	Puts foot down.  ZOOM.  Extra ACCELERATION.  Steed's head pinned back to his
	seat.  Emma's hair tossed in the wind.


136     EXT.  COUNTRY LANES - DAY

	The Lotus twisting and turning.  The car behind always catches up.  Emma tries to
	shake it.  Gears up.  Mach force.  Over crossroads.  Shaking 'round corners, as ...


137     BEND

	before Emma pushes foot down.  Further ACCELERATION.  The car behind struggles
	to keep up.  Emma coasts ahead, turns a corner --

	And suddenly sees in front of her --


138     HUGE TRUCK

	crossing directly in their path!

					STEED
			Turn!


139     EMMA

	swerves, plunging the car into a haystack, where it is completely hidden as --


140     TRUCK

	clears in time for the following car, which keeps going.


141     ON HAYSTACK

	as Steed emerges, brushing off straw.  An old lady on a bicycle with a basket appears ...

					OLD LADY
			Are you alright, young man?

					STEED
			I think so, thank you so much ...

	A SQUEAL of TIRES as -

	The following car swerves back, stops and Bailey emerges, gun drawn as Steed and the
	Old Lady react ...

					BAILEY
				(relishing)
			Reach for the sky, pardner.

	Steed raises his hands.

					OLD LADY
			Oh, dear --

	To Steed's surprise, she pulls an Uzi from her basket and

	BANGBANGBANGBANG -- !  SPRAYS BULLETS into Bailey, who crumples, gun
	spinning along the tarmac.  Cute and sweetlooking, the Old Lady is unfazed.

					OLD LADY
			Cocky little bastard. I hope he
			was a baddy.

					STEED
			I feel sure of it.

					OLD LADY
			I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be
			on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?

					STEED
				(looks around)
			She was ...

	They start pulling away hay from the haystack ...

					OLD LADY
			You with Mother or Father?

					STEED
			Both, actually.

					OLD LADY
			Good. Glad to see they're together at last.  
			They don't get along. Promotion. Top job.  
			Most unfair. Quite a fuss at the Ministry.

					STEED
				(not paying attention)
			You don't say.
				(mumbles)
			Like looking for a needle in a ...


142     INSIDE HAYSTACK

	Coughing.  Then Emma, sputtering straw as Steed's face appears.  He tries to conceal
	his relief at seeing her.

					STEED
			What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet
			breathing?

					EMMA
			Barely.

					STEED
			You will let me know if you find
			that queen who's in need of
			protection, won't you?

	He pulls her out.  She's annoyed.

143     OUTSIDE HAYSTACK

	Emma brushes herself off; pulls off a piece of straw.

					EMMA
				(holding it ruefully)
			This must be the last straw.

					STEED
				(takes one off
				her back)
			Here's the one that broke the
			camel's back.

					EMMA
			Someone didn't want us to get to
			the party.

					STEED
			I expect we'll have to gatecrash.

					OLD LADY
			I may be able to help you.


144     EXT.  STATELY HOME FROM POSTCARD - DAY

	comes to life.  Steed, Emma and the Old Lady survey ...

					STEED
				(checks postcard)
			Wonderland Weather Ltd.

					OLD LADY
			This way ...


145     EXT.  HALLUCINOGEN HALL - GROTTO AND MAZE - DAY

	On a lawn, a peacock flares its thousand eye tail.  A MECHANICAL CLICK, its eyes
	conceal hidden cameras, recording Emma, Steed and the Old Lady, who've landed
	inside the walled grounds.  They move stealthily forward, unaware ...

					OLD LADY
			Over here ...

	The Old Lady waves them on.  They enter a tunnel into


146     MAZE

	Tall hedges surround Steed and Emma and the Old Lady on all sides.  They follow the
	path, slopes , round, curves, turns into hairpin bends and U-turns.  At first intrigued ...

	Then perplexed.  Emma leads the way, Steed following.  The Old Lady slips OUT OF
	VIEW.  Steed stops to pick a rose, puts it in his lapel.  Emma rushes ahead.

					EMMA
			Aha ... Yes ... It's clear now. A
			trapezoid shape, dictated by twin
			diagonal paths and a single
			curving path. A late Seventeenth
			Century design, originally for
			King William of Orange, copied...
			Ah ...

	Steed sees Emma slip 'round a corner.  He pursues her.  Glimpses her.  Then loses her.
	Another glimpse.  Sees her thru hedges, then seemingly --

	Thru the other side of the hedge.  In two places at once.

					STEED
			... Mrs. Peel? I think I'm seeing
			double again.

	Out of sight, Emma rushes on.  Around her, the hedges grow taller.  She seems to
	grow smaller.  Emma begins to realize things are not what they seem.  As she pushes
	her way thru --


147     FROM ABOVE

	the maze as a formal patter-n. Three tiny figures dart round.

									
	DISSOLVE THRU TO:


148     INT.  HALLUCINOGEN HALL - CONTROL ROOM - DAY

	A pattern on a screen.  The lines of the maze reformulated as abstract lines.  Steed,
	Emma and the Old Lady as three flashing dots.  Someone, somewhere is watching
	them.  Laughter, then a familiar voice --

					VOICE (O.S.)
			Now this is more like it ...


149     EXT.  MAZE - DAY

	Steed searches for an exit.


150     ANOTHER PART OF MAZE

	Emma sees a statue of a Butler.  Which springs to life.  Summons Emma.  She follows
	down a path strewn with leaves.

	As Emma steps on the leaves, she --

	Falls down -- a giant rabbit hole.


151     INT.  RABBIT HOLE

	Emma spins through darkness, like Alice in Wonderland ...

					EMMA
			Steed ... !

					STEED (V.O.)
			Mrs. Peel ... ?


152     EXT.  MAZE - DAY

	The identical face of Emma on a marble statue, as --

	Steed studies the classical statue ...

					STEED
			Mrs. Peel ... ?

	Steed hears a noise, turns to see --

	Emma walking towards him.  She picks the rose from his lapel, slowly coils an arm
	around his neck.  Pulls Steed towards her, closes her eyes -- kisses him full an the
	mouth.

					STEED
			Mrs. Peel ... !
				(more kiss)
			Mrs. Peel ...

	The kiss ends.  Steed recovers his composure, lips coated with her lipstick.  His tongue
	traces his lips; smarts ...

					STEED
			Your lipstick ...

	Poison.  He goes dizzy.  Steed collapses to the ground.


153     INT.  HALLUCINOGEN HALL - DAY

	Inside the house, a grand hall.  Deserted.  A cobweb hangs from ceiling.  A velvet
	curtain tattered and torn.
	Emma.

	A CUCKOO CLOCK RINGS the hour.  Ahead, the real Emma sees --

	A giant staircase.  There on the stairs -- a glass eye.
	She picks it up.  Puts it in a pocket.  Emma goes --


154     UPSTAIRS

	Sees a series of family portraits an the staircase.  One of herself in ornate aristocratic
	regalia.


155     LONG CORRIDOR UPSTAIRS

	Rooms on either side.  Emma goes down the hall, pushes doors.


156     INSIDE ROOMS

	A mad child's collections of ... toys... rocking horses ... train sets ... ventriloquists'
	dummies... and ...

	Butterflies ... scarabs ... beetles ... glass eyes, staring at her from the blackness ...

	Then Emma turns into a whole room of ...

	Snow shakers ... A wall of them in glass cabinets like insect specimens or fossils. 
	Emma picks up one snow scene.

	She shakes it.


157     EXT.  HOUSE

	as if in response, a storm gathers.  Shadowy clouds roll in.


158     IN MAZE

	A drop of rain starts to fall.  Steed's eyes flicker open.

					STEED
				(re: rain)
			Not again.

	He rises, looks down, reacts --

	Alice, the Old Lady, lies near him in the maze, her neck snapped... Steed kneels, next to
	her in the rain

					OLD LADY
			It's a trap. Tell Mother, beware.
			Tell Father.

	She dies in his arms.

	Wind picks up, too.

	Steed looks about, frowning with discouragement --


159     INT.  HALLUCINOGEN HALL   PLAYROOM - DAY

	THUNDER and lightning outside.  Inside the room of snow shakers, a CHILDHOOD
	TUNE PLAYS.  Emma shakes the snow scene.  The weather seems to grow darker.


160     FROM BEHIND

	Emma hears the unmistakable chilling voice:

					VOICE (V.O.)
			I wouldn't shake that too hard.
			The weather might turn nasty.

	From the shadows ... a man.  A silhouette.  Behind a distorting lens.  His shape and
	face unclear.  Emma puts down the shaker.

					EMMA
			Quite a collection.

					VOICE (V.O.)
			If nature gives a man a collector's mind, 
			it doesn't matter what he collects.  
			Butterflies. Old China. Penny farthings. 
			A true collector grows more obsessive 
			as the years pass.

	Outside the big window the weather is turning nasty ...

					EMMA
			Your voice -- it's so familiar ...

					VOICE (V.O.)
			We have met ...

	From the shadows, a man moves out, revealing:

	Peter Peel, Emma's husband!  THUNDER.

					EMMA
			Peter ... ?

	Instinctively Emma moves towards him.  A long pause.

					EMMA
			I must be dreaming ...

	Emma pulls back.  Before she can turn, Peter takes her hand, places it over his heart. 
	BA-BOOM, BA-BOOM, BA-BOOM ...

					PETER
			Listen... Very much alive.

	Peter touches her hand.  Emma looks into his eyes.  Intrigued but alarmed, disbelief. 
	Peter raises her hand to his lips.

					PETER
			Darling, it's me...

	Emma shudders, battles with herself.

					EMMA
			Peter ...

	Emma is tempted, yet filled with terror.


161     CLOSEUP - EMMA'S EYES

	Inside her pupil --

									
		FLASH CUTS TO:


162     MEMORY FLASHES

	His face as he kissed her -- his ring on her finger -the visor cracking -- the glass
	obscuring his face.


163     BACK TO SCENE

					EMMA
			Impossible ... how?

	Peter smiles disarmingly.  As if the answer was obvious.

					PETER
			For you ... all for you ...

	Peter comes over, folds her in his arms.  Takes her head between his hands.  Emma
	leans over to him, about to kiss him, both closing their eyes, until --

	Lips parted.  Before they kiss, Emma pulls back --

					PETER
			Don't be afraid, darling.

	She turns, runs to the door.  Like a trapped bird.  She tries the door -- locked.  Another
	door -- locked.  A window -- locked.

					PETER
			Don't run away. I forgive you, 
			Emma. I know you left me. But 
			I still love you. Do you still have 
			my ring? I need it.

	Peter grabs hold of Emma.  She pulls away.  Emma sees his face before her, pleading
	with her.  Seductive yet nightmarish.

	As if hallucinating, Emma runs away, towards --

	The big window overlooking the gardens.  She runs, leaps, and in SLOW MOTION --

	Crashes thru the GLASS, shards and splinters SHATTERING all 'round her, as she --


164     EXT.  HALLUCINOGEN HALL - WINDOW - DAY

	somersaults through the window down to the ground.  Lands with a THUD on the wet
	ground.  Looks up to see --

	Steed above her, the STORM RAGING.

					EMMA
			Steed!

	She struggles to her feet, comes towards him, upset.

					STEED
			Oh, no. First time, shame on
			you. Third time, shame on me.

	He slugs her and the SCREEN GOES BLACK.

					DR. DARLING (V.O.) 
			Diagnosis confirmed.  Mrs. Peel is 
			suffering from delusions and 
			hallucinations. An extreme personality 
			disorder. She imagines her husband 
			Peter Peel has come back to her ...

	CLOSE ON Emma's face.

					DR. DARLING (V.O.) 
			A classic syndrome, to overcome her 
			subconscious guilt at her other crimes.  
			We've attached her to the dreamscape 
			machine. We'll soon see what her 
			unconscious looks like...

	Emma's eyes flicker...

	Steed comes INTO FOCUS, sitting by Emma's bed.  This time he's eating her grapes ...

	Emma looks around ... Everything blurs.  A STEADY PULSE DRONE.  Tugs at
	leather straps.  No use.  WIDEN to reveal Emma strapped to a special couch --

	Her head surrounded by a plastic dome, terminals and wires leading out into a
	Dreamscape machine.  Drowsy, disoriented.

					EMMA
			Where am I?

					STEED
			The Winslow Home for Retired
			Lepidoptorists. I'm so sorry
			I struck you, Mrs. Peel. Please
			forgive me. I thought you were
			someone else ...

					EMMA
			Was I?

					STEED
				(no smile)
			I expect that's for you to know
			and me to find out ...

					EMMA
			It was Peter -- I saw him ...

	Drugged, Emma's eyes drop.  FOCUS CHANGES TO --


165     ABOVE HER

	A giant spiral HYPNODISC WHIRRS, creating trippy black and white zig zag op-art
	effects a la Bridget Riley.

	She blinks.

									
		DISSOLVE TO:


166     SAME SCENE - LATER

	Steed is gone.  Dr. Darling leans over her.  Emma stares at the hypnodisc.  Closes her
	eyes.


167     EXTREME CLOSEUP ON HER EYES

	Thousand REMs per sec -- a tiny chip next to her eyes, transmitting out via wires to --


168     UP ON WALL

	A "Dreamscape" apparatus like a liquid TV screen flicks thru random images from
	Emma's unconscious.  Peter Peel -- Teddy Bears -- post card views -- childhood 
	snaps --


169     BESIDE "BED"

	Dr. Darling furls his hand over Emma's, his fingers resting upon her ring.  During the
	interrogation, he soothingly strokes her hand -- tries to remove the ring without
	arousing her suspicion.  Pulls gently on it.


170     UP IN GALLERY

	In his wheelchair, Mother sits beside Steed.

					MOTHER
			This man -- did you see him?

					STEED
			No. Her husband, she says. Alice
			tried to warn us. A trap. Tell
			Mother beware. Tell Father
			That's all.


171     BY COUCH

	Dr. Darling leans forward to interrogate Emma.


172     FROM HER POV

	He looks and sounds sinister.  From a corner of her eye, she sees -- a clip of keys
	hanging from his pocket.


173     BACK TO SCENE

					DR. DARLING
			I want you to say the first thing
			that comes into your head when I
			say these words. Do you
			understand ... ?
				(as she nods)
			Blue ...

					EMMA
			... bottle ...

					DR. DARLING
			Red ...

					EMMA
			... head ...

	
					DR.  DARLING
			White ...


					EMMA
			Knight ...

					DR. DARLING
			Black...

					EMMA
			... death ...

					DR. DARLING
			Love...

					EMMA
			... death ...

	Steed watching, listening ...

					DR. DARLING
			Flower ...

					EMMA
			... power ...

	The exchange speeds up.  Unknown to Dr. Darling, Emma picks his keys; unlocks her
	straps.

					DR. DARLING
			Nature ...

					EMMA
			... preserve...

					DR. DARLING
			Secret ...

					EMMA
			... love...

					DR. DARLING
			Hope...

					EMMA
			... love ...

					DR. DARLING
			Fear ...

					EMMA
			... love ...

					DR. DARLING
			Peter ...

	As Emma talks, the "Dreamscape" plucks images from her unconscious in trippy
	psychedelic rush:  faces -- colors -- patterns flash past.

					EMMA
			... Piper picked a peck of pickled 
			peppers how many pecks of pickled 
			peppers did Peter Peel -- ?


174     CLOSEUP - EMMA

	Quietly unclicks a lock.  She stops in mid-gabble.

					EMMA
			How long have I been here?

					DR. DARLING
			Three days.

	Emma unlocks her straps.  Sits Up.  Woozy.

					EMMA
			Do you get paid by the hour?

	Dr. Darling is shocked, indignant.  Emma rips wires from her body.  The "Dreamscape"
	machine winds down.  Up in the gallery --

	BAM -- !  Mother bashes his metal cane on the railings

					MOTHER
				(filtered)
			You are here under observation, 
			Mrs. Peel. You must answer Dr. 
			Darling's questions

	Pushes Dr. Darling aside.

					EMMA
			I resign.

					MOTHER
				(filtered)
			You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You
			can't resign.

					EMMA
			Watch me.

	Emma staggers.  Mother looks at Steed.  Who snaps himself out of staring at the
	hypnodisc.

	Emma heads for the airlock door marked:

	"ANTI-GRAVITY CHAMBER -- NO ADMITTANCE"

					MOTHER
			Don't open that, Mrs. Peel!

	Fat chance ... she goes in ...


175     INT.  ANTI-GRAVITY CHAMBER

	Emma floats in the air, as Mother, Dr. Darling and Steed all follow.  And float
	helplessly, turning around madly.  Trying to gain on Emma.  Mother's wheelchair,
	Steed's umbrella and bowler, all tumble thru the air as Steed tries to reach the "OFF"
	switch

					EMMA
				(echoing)
			What are you trying to do to me?

					MOTHER
				(flailing)
			We want to help...!

					EMMA
			I thought I was a widow. My
			husband ... the only man I ever
			loved ... is dead. For the rest
			of my life I have to live with
			that.

					MOTHER
			The death of Peter Peel was a
			great loss. To us all ...

					EMMA
			To you ... ?

	Mother looks at Emma.  He's let the cat out the bag.  Steed finds the "OFF" switch.
	They all tumble to the floor, Mother landing perfectly in his wheelchair,
	Steed effortlessly catching his hat and umbrella.  He moves to Mother --

					STEED
			I think you owe Mrs. Peel an
			explanation ...

	Steed stares Mother out.  Who delivers his revelations.

					MOTHER
			Peter Peel was a first class agent.
			A senior operative.
			'X' department Special operations.  
			He was engaged in top secret research.  
			Top priority.  Government approved.

					EMMA
			The Institute ... the funding ...

					MOTHER
			A cover ... for us.
				(beat)
			I'm sorry...

	A turning moment for Emma.  A life lived on a lie.

					EMMA
			So all that time. Our work, our research 
			was for you ... for this? And the 
			accident --

					DARLING
			It was no accident.

					EMMA
			The official investigation ...

					MOTHER
			... was written by me.
				(beat)
			It was sabotage, Mrs. Peel.

	Deadly serious, Emma walks over to him.

					EMMA
			Who?

					MOTHER
			Quite frankly ... it could have
			been you.

	Silence.  Emma looks away, shocked.  Steed intervenes

					STEED
			You're accusing Mrs. Peel of
			killing her own husband?

					MOTHER
			Her husband suspected someone very 
			close to the operation. On the day he 
			died, he was setting a test.
			To prove to himself -- to us that his 
			wife was beyond suspicion. He had to 
			be certain. He said he was going to 
			give Mrs. Peel something ...

	Emma keeps staring at Mother, fingers her diamond ring.

					MOTHER
			... I want you to remember. Did
			Peter give you anything on-that 
			day?


176     CLOSEUP - EMMA

	touches her ring.


177     BACK TO SCENE

	Emma looks up at Mother.  A barefaced lie.

					EMMA
			No.

	Steed notices Emma touch her ring nervously.

					DR. DARLING
			He said if it vanished, he'd know
			it was ... you who betrayed him.
			He took a huge risk. The ultimate
			test.

					EMMA
			So I'm still ...

					MOTHER
			Under suspicion. Everyone died in 
			the explosion, Mrs. Peel. You were 
			the only survivor ...

	Mother waits.  Emma turns round.  Looks fiercely at him.  Mother shifts uneasily as
	Emma walks past him to the airlock.

					MOTHER
			This is an official matter, Mrs.
			Peel. No need to take it
			personally. Where are you going?

					EMMA
			To find out who killed my husband.

					MOTHER
			The doors and walls are monitored, 
			Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure 
			establishment.

					EMMA
			So am I.

	Emma pushes open the doors.  Walks out.  Down a corridor.  Dr. Darling grabs
	Mother, as he exits with Steed --

					DR. DARLING
			She must remain here. She's
			highly dangerous.


178     IN HALL - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Mother exits with Steed; they watch Emma going ...

					MOTHER
			Pity. I was growing fond of Mrs.
			Peel. Unfortunately --

					STEED
			Guilty until proven innocent?

					MOTHER
			Mother and Father know best.

	Mother wheels himself off.  Then stops; over his shoulder:

					MOTHER
			Something quick. Nothing too ...
			messy.

	ON Steed.  CAR ROAR over as --


179     EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE CLINIC - DAY

	Emma drives a hot-wired Morris Minor out the open gates of the manor house, past a
	sign which reads:

	"WINSLOW HOME FOR RETIRED LEPIDOPTORISTS" (Butterfly logo)

	In the b.g., a couple of old-timers race around with butterfly nets as Steed's jag pulls
	past them in hot pursuit.


180     EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

	Emma speeds down lanes ...

	Followed at a safe distance by Steed in his SS100.


181     INT.  STEED'S JAG - DAY

	Steed looks: a bleep on his radar screen tracks the --


182     CLOSEUP - CONCEALED MICRO-BUG - INTERCUT

	on Emma's shoulder as she drives ...


183     EXT.  LANES - DAY

	The cars whiz past ...


184     INT.  STEED'S JAG - DAY

	Keeping an eye on his radar and the road, Steed switches on the radio.  The weather
	forecast:

					RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			'... Sunny intervals leading to
			sudden storms and gale warnings
			for all areas.
				(as he frowns)
			... Outbursts of rain, scattered
			hailstorms and freezing fog
			greeted the World Council of
			Ministers as they arrived in
			London for their conference ...'

	Emma drives into a churchyard.  Steed follows her ...


185     INT.  COUNTRY CHURCH - DAY	

	A medieval country church.  Sunlight streams through stained glass, illumining Emma
	as Steed watches her lay --

	A red rose by an altar tomb:  an ornate mausoleum two hands clasped in a pose of
	eternal sleep:  Peter Peel.

	Emma pauses, as in the b.g., choirboys sing hymn practice.  Steed watches Emma move
	away, toward the door.  He drops a hymn book.  Emma swivels round -- sees Steed.

					EMMA
			You followed me.

					STEED
			Orders.

					EMMA
			To kill me?

					STEED
				(fractional pause)
			Nothing personal.

	Emma smiles. Then turns, and --

	Runs!  Steed follows Emma through a door to --


186     INT.  CHURCH BELL TOWER - DAY

	Steed enters, glimpses --

	Emma above.  He follows her.  Hears her footsteps.  Trip- trapping up the spiral
	staircase.  Steed listens, follows.


187     UP BELLTOWER

	From below, Steed hears a BELL RING.  A FLUTTER of BIRDS.  As debris falls
	down -- Steed runs up stairs, reaches --


188     EXT.  BELLTOWER TOP - DAY

	BELL still RINGING.  At the top, a sheer drop.  Steed edges closer to the ledge. 
	Looks.  A long way down.
	From behind --

					EMMA
			A long way down.

	Steed swivels.  Sees Emma blocking his path.  Cool menace.  Steed steps away from
	the edge, Emma circles him.

					STEED
			Careful. You might fall.

	Emma steps to the edge.  Steed freezes.  Emma locks down.  Feet resting on the ledge. 
	Rocking to and fro ...

					EMMA
			I could save you the trouble.

					STEED
			No trouble.

					EMMA
			Because you always obey orders ...

					STEED
			Always.
				(pause)
			Except ...

	Steed nears her.  Emma pushes herself right to the edge.

					EMMA
			Yes ... ?

					STEED
			... when I don't. It comes down to one 
			thing, Mrs. Peel. Trust.

	Steed reaches out for her.  Holds out his hand.

					EMMA
			And do you trust me?

					STEED
			I could be convinced, if ... I knew who 
			poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...

					EMMA
			It wasn't me; you have my word.

	Steed snatches her from the edge, holds her in his arms.

					STEED
			I need proof.

	Emma thinks.  Looks at him.  Deadly serious.  Their eyes lock.  She hesitates, then
	pecks him on the cheek.

					STEED
			It was longer. On the lips.

	Emma hesitates.  Then a kiss on the lips.  Longer.  But not much.  Steed grabs her
	hand, pulls her back.

					STEED
			Much longer.  Approximately ...
			fifteen seconds.

	Emma harumphs, exasperated.  Moves closer to him.

					EMMA
			... Ready?

	Steed nods.  Emma leans forward.  A full kiss.  At first reticent ... Emma looks at her
	watch.  Counts seconds ...

					EMMA
			... Four ... seven ... ni-...

	Then ... forgets.  Warmer, more relenting.  Edging towards passionate.  They stay
	embracing for fifteen seconds ...

					EMMA
				(aroused)
			Mmm ... what are you doing?

					STEED
			Keeping a stiff upper lip?

					EMMA
			Is that all?

	The kiss continues couple of seconds longer.  Before Emma withdraws.  With an effort,
	she regains her composure.  A long silence.

					EMMA
			So I'm in the clear?

	Steed savors the kiss.  No reply.  His smile says it all.

					EMMA
			But you did suspect me.

					STEED
			Not for a moment.

					EMMA
			You're playing games.

					STEED
			Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?

					EMMA
			I thought you played by the rules.

					STEED
			I thought you didn't.

					EMMA
			I'm playing to win.

					STEED
			Winning isn't everything.

					EMMA
			Please don't tell me it's how you
			play the game.

					STEED
				(smiles; stands
				aside)
			After you -- Mrs. Peel ...

	Steed motions down the stairs.  It's close to the edge.

					EMMA
			No, after you.

					STEED
				(back to square
				one)
			You don't trust me?

					EMMA
			As far as you trust me.

	Emma motions.  Steed goes down, passes close to the edge, and swivels round
	nervously.  Emma reads his thoughts.

					EMMA
			When it happens, Steed, you'll be
			the first to know ...

	With this comforting thought, Steed descends first.


189     EXT.  CHURCH TOWER - DAY

	As Steed and Emma exit from the tower, they see --

	A tranquil village scene.  Choirboys walk out from the church.  Nearby in the deserted
	village street.  A red PHONE BOX.  Which ...

	RING-RING ... Starts to RING.

					EMMA
			Who could that be?

	A ROLL of THUNDER.  Steed looks up: a clear sky.  He's puzzled.  Suddenly
	suspicious.  As Emma moves to the phone.

					STEED
			No -- don't answer it ...

	He pulls her back.  Emma looks at him.

					STEED
			That's it. The phones trigger
			the explosions --

	RING-RING ... Another ROLL of THUNDER.  Steed connects the two as -- an
	angelic CHOIRBOY walks towards the phone ...

	RING-RING ... A LOUDER ROLL of THUNDER.  As the Choirboy nears the
	PHONE, Steed shouts --

					STEED
		Don't -- don't answer it -- !


190     CLOSEUP - PHONE

	RING-RING -- the PHONE in the f.g. as the choirboy closes in, opens the door --


191     INSIDE PHONE BOX

	The door shuts.  Noise muffled.  The Choirboy can't hear Steed and Emma's shouted
	warnings, as he lifts his hand up, and --


192     OUTSIDE

	Steed sees him reach out, warns the vicar and choirboys.

					STEED
			Get down -- get down -- it's
			going to explode -- !

	Steed and Emma, all the choirboys hit the dirt, as


193     INSIDE PHONE BOX

	The Choirboy grabs the phone, and lifts it up, and

	Silence.

	No explosion.  A few seconds pass.  Steed and everyone
	are down on the ground.  As they see --


194     FROM PHONE BOX	

	-- the Choirboy leaves the phone hanging.  He gets out, scans the crowd.  Then walks
	calmly over to Steed, who's still prone.

					CHOIRBOY
			It's your mother.

	The vicar and choirboys look on sympathetically, as --

	Steed dusts himself off.  Emma and everyone gets up.  Steed goes to the phone box,
	takes the call.

					STEED
			Mother? How did you find me?

	His expression changes as he listens.  Emma goes to the phone box as Steed rings off.
	He emerges from the box.

					STEED
			I told Mother I took care of you.

					EMMA
			You lied.

					STEED
			I equivocated. But you're not
			their big worry at present. It's
			Dr. Darling:  he's disappeared ...

	OFF Emma's reaction to this news --


195     INT.  HALLUCINOGEN HALL - DAY

	Inside the upper room, in front of a mirror --

	With his back turned to us.  Dr. Darling holds something in his hand, and waits as --


196     DOWN LONG HALL

	Bad "Emma" walks over.  She stands in front of him.

	Blank expression.  Dr. Darling hardly even looks up.  With her hair up, we recognize
	on her neck a tattoo:  Z424.

					DR. DARLING
			We are in the final phase. I shall require 
			you to be especially obedient. There 
			must be no failures.


197     CLOSEUP - IN HIS HANDS - SNOWSHAKER

	which he grips tightly. As --


198     IN MIRROR

	a metamorphosis.  His features melt and bubble, a mask of plastic surgery and it's
	slipping around like Michael Jackson's face under kleig lights.  He adjusts it, then ...

	Shakes the snowshaker ...


199     EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

	THUNDER as the sky darkens -- PAN DOWN to reveal:

	Steed's Jag, zooming through country lanes.  Rain starts.


200     INT.  JAG - DAY

	Steed driving, winces with the drizzle.

					STEED
			Drat. Someone wants to implicate
			you in this affair, Mrs. Peel.
			Any idea who?

					EMMA
			No idea who. No idea why ...

					STEED
				(thinks)
			Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys
			All children's things ...

					EMMA
			... Or grown-ups, who still like
			to be children.

					STEED
			Quite. Any childhood friends?
			Enemies?

					EMMA
			Not to speak of. Peter and I
			were both loners. There was
			nobody.

	Steed thinks; sighs.

					STEED
			Very well. I have a friend who
			might be of assistance. He's at
			the Ministry. We'd better be
			careful.

					EMMA
			I'm a wanted woman, I know ...


201     INT.  MINISTRY CORRIDORS - DAY

	Through a door marked "Information & Counter Espionage" --

	-- walks Steed with another man in identical clothes:  dapper Savile Row suit, umbrella
	and bowler.  Which is

	Emma Peel, in disguise.  Steed furtively checks passers-by.

					STEED
			His name's Jones. 'Invisible' Jones.

					EMMA
			Why's he called 'Invisible'?

					STEED
			You'll find out.

	At a door marked "Information -- Col. I. Jones." Steed knocks, opens the door for her.

					EMMA
			Aren't you coming?

					STEED
			I'll catch you up. Don't worry;
			he's expecting you.

	Emma goes in as Steed walks down the corridor.


202     INT.  MINISTRY OFFICE - DAY

	A room full of archives and files.  Emma walks through tall corridors, stacks of cabinets
	full of old paper.

	Dusty, musty and mildewing.  Long forgotten.  Nobody there.  Suddenly Emma 
	hears --

	FOOTSTEPS.

	She follows them.  Round stacks, round corners.  The FOOTSTEPS get LOUDER. 
	She's closing in.  The FOOTSTEPS get LOUDER, until up ahead of her --

	A filing cabinet drawer opens up.  On its own.

	Emma watches as a file pops up, floats through air.  The drawer slams shut.  Still
	nobody there.  Emma follows the file to a --

	Desk.  Emma watches as -- the chair swivels round.  The file pages open up.  Then the
	phone lifts up by itself, a voice:

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Tell Miss Proudfoot, no calls.
				(beat)
			Colonel Jones at your service,
			Mrs. Peel. Just a moment --

	Emma looks ahead of her.  To the chair. As --

	A desk drawer opens up, a pipe is whisked through the air, a match is struck.  The pipe
	lights; smoke belches forth.

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Talk to the pipe, Mrs. Peel.
			That usually helps. Don't worry
			about me being invisible. Other
			than that I'm perfectly normal.

					EMMA
			I see.

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Or rather, you don't. Learnt the
			tricks in camouflage. Till this
			accident made a prang of things.
			How can I help you, Mrs. Peel?


203     INT.  MINISTRY - ANOTHER OFFICE

	Steed on the phone.

					STEED
			I say, Trubshaw, Steed here ...
			Barometer's falling fast. Mrs.
			Peel and I find ourselves in
			need of foul weather gear.
				(beat)
			Yes, I'd say gentlemen's snuff
			for starters. And then --


204     INT.  INVISIBLE JONES' OFFICE

	File pages flip through the air as Jones goes through them.

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Ah, here we are. Steed asked me
			to play a hunch:  Valentine Peel.

					EMMA
			Peter's brother?  But --

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Half-brother to be precise.

	Emma is surprised.

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Now let's see ... Eton, Cambridge ... 
			research into robotics and plastics.  
			Overtaken by Peter's work on the 
			physics of climate change ...

					EMMA
			I know all this.

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.) 
			Do you also know that during your 
			final experiment, your halfbrother-
			in-law was under surveillance?

					EMMA
			Surveillance? By whom?

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Father. She gave him an 'all clear' 
			after a security test by Dr. Darling.

					EMMA
			Who's now vanished.

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Makes two of us.

					EMMA
			Are you suggesting that Dr. Darling 
			and Valentine were somehow in this 
			together? But that's absurd.

	Steed enters behind them on the run --

					STEED
			We must hurry, Mrs. Peel ...

					EMMA
			Hurry?  What for?  I'm just
			now --

					STEED
			You didn't tell her?

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
				(testy)
			I was getting to it.

					EMMA
			Getting to what?

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			The World Council of Ministers meets 
			tomorrow to convene the new global 
			defense initiative --

					EMMA
			I fail to see --

					STEED
			There's a reception this evening. Colonel 
			Jones thinks it advisable we attend.

					EMMA
			Have we been invited?

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
				(poker-voiced)
			Under the circumstances Mother didn't 
			see fit, but I think I can get you in ...

					EMMA
				(surveys her male
				outfit)
			Well, I can't possibly go like this.

					STEED
			I had a feeling. That's why we're 
			in a hurry ...

	Steed proffers an arm to Emma.

					STEED
			May I have the honor, Mrs. Peel?

	She decides, takes his arm.

					EMMA
			You may, Mr. Steed.

	The A-team is born.  Steed and Emma tip their hats to Jones.


205     EXT.  LONDON STREETS - SEVERAL ANGLES - NIGHT

	Troops rushing in to take up defense positions.  Searchlights pierce the cloudy sky.  A
	protective ring of hardware surrounds the hall.


206     INT.  MOTHER'S 22 BUS (AKA INSIDE MOBILE HQ) - NIGHT

	At the controls, Brenda looks on.  She hands a bag of jelly babies to Mother.  Who
	picks out his favorites, as he gives a briefing to Father and others, sitting in
	passenger seats --

	ORDERS BARKED OUTSIDE as --

					MOTHER
			Inside that hall are some of the
			Most powerful figures in the

					FATHER
			I'll see to it personally.

	Brenda glances over at Father's imperturbable face. As --


207     EXT.  PALACE (WESTMINSTER) - NIGHT

	Wind picking up.  Outside the grand palace hall for the reception of the World Council
	of Ministers, guards stand on duty.  Barriers, flashing lights.  Nobody gets past, 
	except --


208     INT.  PALACE (WESTMINSTER) - NIGHT

	Up in the gallery, Steed and Emma enter through a secret passage behind a painting. 
	He with bowler and umbrella.  She in black leather and boots.  They find themselves in
	a niche and freeze, very close to one another.  Steed sniff s ...

					STEED
			What's that you're wearing?

					EMMA
			It's called Black Leather.

					STEED
			Intoxicating. Here, have one of
			these.

	He fumbles with a bulging jacket pocket

					EMMA
			What is it?

					STEED
			Limpet bomb. Small, very
			compact. From Trubshaw's.

					EMMA
				(hocks it on
				belt)
			When all this is over, we simply
			must get you out of that suit.

					STEED
			You first.

					EMMA
			Shall we?

	She leads the way through marble halls, arched galleries, red velvet carpets, glittering
	chandeliers.  From the hall, a SPEECH ECHOES:

					MINISTER (V.O.)
			... In the uncertain climate that threatens 
			this global initiative, no magic umbrella 
			can shield us.

	Steed checks out his own.

					MINISTER (V.O.)
			Only our own vigilance. Security and 
			stability are our watchwords.

	APPLAUSE.

	Steed pauses, offers Emma a small silver box.  Inside...

					EMMA
			Trubshaw again? What now?

					STEED
			Snuff.
				(off Emma's lock)
			I must insist you try some.

	Steed takes some; Emma follows his example.  Weird.  Does it make you high?  They
	walk on, open doors to --


209     INT.  PALACE HALLWAY - NIGHT

	An empty gallery.  Steed and Emma peer down at a --


210     MARBLE HALLWAY

	A black and white floor.  Butlers move across like surreal chess pieces.  Otherwise,
	empty.  A chamber ensemble plays "The Merry Widow" waltz, which floats through
	empty halls.

					STEED
			They're playing your song, Mrs.
			Peel.

					EMMA
				(annoyed)
			'The Merry Widow?' I might have
			known. Where's the reception?

	They move cautiously forward as


211     EXT.  LONDON STREETS - NIGHT

	Outside, snow begins to fall.  Trees and buildings shimmer under a light layer of white. 
	A Christmassy glow --

	Even troops play with snowflakes, until --


212     SEVERAL ANGLES

	The wind rises.  The snow falls harder.


213     INT.  PALACE - NIGHT

	Down in the hallway, Steed and Emma search for the Ministers.  They head down a 
	corridor, then hear a NOISE.  They hide behind pillers. As --

	Butlers walk past in military file, carrying elaborate displays of lobster and meats. 
	Steed steals --

	A chicken leg.  Nibbles on it.  Suddenly another door opens -- Emma hides.  Steed
	looks up to see -- Father "staring" at him.

					STEED
			Oh, hello ...

					FATHER
			We want Mrs. Peel.

					STEED
			Dead, I'm afraid.

	Emma in hiding, listens as --

					FATHER (O.S.)
			You disobeyed an order, Steed.  
			Mrs. Peel is dangerous; she cannot 
			be trusted.

	Emma looks out the window behind her; eyes widen ... back to --

					STEED (O.S.)
			I think she can.
				(beat)
			Can you?

	Emma is deeply affected by Steed's choice.

	Father's face, meantime, has turned to stone.

					FATHER
			I shall summon security.

	She turns, almost walks into the door as she slips away.

	Emma returns as the ALARM is raised --

					STEED
			Bad news. Father's looking for you.  
			Where are those bloody ministers?

					EMMA
			Have a look at this.

	She leads him to the window:  sure enough -- heavy snow.
	Steed reacts, eyes wide.

					STEED
			It's almost May, for heaven sake.


214     EXT.  LONDON STREETS - NIGHT

	The blizzard rages through streets --

	Now impassable.  Snow drifts block roads.  White mountains of snow start to climb up
	shop fronts.  And amid the sky --

	Filled with snowflakes, up round the roofs, a purple cloud descends on unsuspecting
	troops --


215     INT.  PALACE - NIGHT

	Steed returns, rushes across the marble halls --

	To Emma. But up ahead, sees --


216     STEED'S POV - FROM WINDOWS

	A purple fog seeping into the hallway, billowing through the corridors as --


217     INT.  PALACE ANTEROOM - NIGHT

	Inside an anteroom, like a Roman arena -- marble pillars, red carpet, golden walls,
	ceiling murals --

	The World Council ministers assemble:  slick pin-striped suits or African robes, Chinese
	Mao-suits, Indian Nehru-jackets, all distinguished men and women, surrounded by --

	Fussing officials, minor dignitaries, and butlers, bowing and weaving a web of
	diplomatic protocol, interrupted by --


218     CENTER OF HALL

	The sight of Emma Peel in black leather.

	She strides into the room.  Picks a glass of champagne from a passing butler.  All stare,
	Emma raises her glass --

					EMMA
			Gentlemen, ladies. Forgive the breach 
			of protocol. An emergency --

	From the hallway -- BOOM -- !  The door bursts open, Emma is blown over by the
	blast as the purple cloud races inside.


219     SEVERAL ANGLES

	as the smoke furls around the ministers, they choke, fall.

	From the doors -- Steed leaps in, gives Emma another snort of snuff --

					STEED
			Quick --it'll protect you --

	Emma inhales.  Now immune to the gas, Steed and Emma hear -- CRASH -- !  They
	see -- through thick cloud -a mysterious man in a white lab coat, wearing a gas mask,
	leading a group of butlers, all in gas masks -- heads like black flies -- in formation
	round the ministers, helpless on the floor.  A kidnapping --

	The man and butlers haul away several ministers, and --

	Escape from the rear doors.  The butlers form a guard to protect the man.

	Steed and Emma run after them.  More butlers pursue.


220     EXT.  PALACE - NIGHT

	As troops roll helplessly in the snow-covered purple haze, the butlers load the ministers
	onto waiting choppers as --


221     INT.  MOTHER'S HQ - CONTINUOUS ACTION	

	Mother, Brenda, et al choke on purple smoke in the bus ...


222     INT.  PALACE HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Behind pillars, Steed and Emma hide as --

	Butlers in gas masks patrol the halls.  A butler passes them without noticing.  They try
	to emerge.  But another patrols --

	Steed trips the butler with his umbrella, then chops him down on the ground.  He rises
	but Emma kicks him into as --

	Behind them Steed sees the lab-coated man escape up the stairs, protected by a posse
	of butlers.  He shouts --

					STEED
			After him, Mrs. Peel!

	A whole posse of butlers then advances.  Steed faces them.

					STEED
			Go -- !

	Emma hesitates.  Then turns, heads for an ornate dual shaft elevator.  She bangs the
	button, gets inside, doors shut, as the BULLETS from MACHINE-GUNNING gas
	masked butlers strike the brass door as --

	Steed whips his rapier from his umbrella and duels with the butlers.  To give Emma
	time, he uses every trick and prop at his disposal, plus, brute force to --

	Kick, chop, punch, and impale them into submission, as --


223     EXT.  ELEVATOR (UPPER FLOORS) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	The posse of butlers fan out on to keep pace with Emma.  They head upstairs, pressing
	elevator "CALL" buttons on every floor, as --


224     INSIDE ELEVATOR	

	Emma waits inside.  Until she reaches --


225     EXT.  ELEVATOR (2ND FLOOR) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Doors open.  A HAIL of BULLETS hit the lift as Emma hides to one side until the
	doors close.


226     INT.  ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Emma sighs with relief.  COOL HUM as the ELEVATOR rises.


227     ON STAIRS - MEANWHILE

	Steed gaining on the butlers, heading for the stairs, as --

228     INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	At the next floor, the doors open --

	Two butlers rush inside.  BLAM -- !  Emma cuts one in the throat with an elbow
	punch,  then --

	Punches -- kicks -- stabs the other butler, a more brutish type, who recovers enough to
	grab Emma by the throat.

	She chokes, breaks his stranglehold, swerves him round, gains a nelson hold on his
	arms and throat --

	And a knee in his back in time for --

	PING!  The BELL RINGS at --

	3rd floor where --

	Emma spins her captive butler round, in time to face --

	Whooomph!  a blast of fire from --

	A flamethrower launched in the hall.

	Aaargh -- !  The butler gets fried, but --


229     EXT.  ELEVATOR (3RD FLOOR) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Shields Emma from the worst of the blast. She  hurls him clear of the doors, which --


230     INT.  ELEVATORS - CONTINUOS ACTION

	Slam shut.  COOL HUM ...


231     EXT.  PALACE MAIN FLOOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Steed continues his one-sided duel with the other butlers, skewering madly, trying to
	get upstairs to help Emma...


232     INT.  ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Up Emma goes.  Looks for an escape route.  Bangs on the walls.  No trap doors.  No
	secret panels.  The "floor" light flickers between floors.

	Waiting, until ...


233     EXT.  ELEVATOR (4TH FLOOR) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	The doors open.  A grenade is hurled inside the doors, it rolls to one corner, Emma
	dives to the other side, then --

	Scrambles for the grenade.  Picks it up.  It slips out of her hands.  Scrambles more.  It
	slips out ...

	Just beyond the elevator doors.  Which start to shut.  Emma leans out a foot, kicks the
	grenade towards the butlers, and --

	As her elevator doors close --

	BOOM -- !  It EXPLODES among the butlers, one of whom --

	Rushes to --


234     ELEVATOR (5TH FLOOR) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Where he waits for the elevator.  Removes pin.  Grenade ready.  The light PINGS.
	Doors open.  About to throw it inside, when --


235     BUTLER'S POV

	No Emma.


236     BACK TO SCENE

	The butler hesitates.  Looks inside.  Still no Emma?  He wonders what to do, and --

	The doors shut; he jams his foot.  The doors open again.  He moves in --


237     INT.  ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	-- and looks round.  Nobody there.  Until, as we --

	PULL BACK UP to reveal -- FROM ABOVE, spread-eagled like an X on the elevator
	roof, limbs flexed against the walls is --

	Emma, who -- drops down and --

	Scissors the butler's head between her legs.

	The grenade rolls free ...

	Emma twists around, grabs his ears, and --

	Sits on his face.  Buries his head in her crotch.  A muffled sound from the guy, until --

	Emma scissor kicks, breaking his neck.  She drags --


238     EXT.  ELEVATOR (67H FLOOR) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	His head out.  Leaving his neck between the doors.  So as she leaps out, heads up for
	the stairs, the elevators doors.

	SLAM! And -- BOOM!  His GRENADE rocks the elevator, which


239     INT.  ELEVATOR SHAFT - ABOVE AND BELOW - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Breaks from its ropes, and --

	Plummets down the elevator shaft, shaking the building as it crashes --


240     INT.  PALACE STAIRS - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Everything shakes with the impact of the elevator as Steed battles his way up, step by
	step, throwing gas-masked butlers over his shoulder as he struggles...


241     INT.  PALACE ATTIC - NIGHT

	Up the winding staircase, at the top, a skylight, which --

	Flips open.  The man leaps out, throwing back inside a smoke grenade, and locks the
	skylight.  As the grenade --


242     INT.  NARROW STAIRCASE

	BOOM!  explodes in the narrow staircase, fills it with purple smoke.  Emma rushes
	thru smoke, choking.  She gets to the skylight, tries to open it -- locked.

	A moment's panic.  Then Emma -- punches a hole in the glass, flicks the switch, flips
	the skylight up, and --

	Emerges into the night air.  Snowflakes tumble around her.


243     EXT.  ROOFTOP - HELIPAD - NIGHT

	Blades whirling.  Amid the blizzard, the man ready to escape in a super-fab streamlined
	whirly chopper ...

	Another assassin attacks Emma, pins her on her back, overlooking the city.  Stands up
	before her --

	Emma held back over gargoyle, over now snow white city ...  Knees assassin in balls.
	Flicks him backwards ...

	As his body hurtles down into the snow-covered streets, Emma rushes forward.  
	But too late:  sees --

	The chopper -- about to take off.


244     FROM INSIDE CHOPPER

	The gas-masked MAN in the white lab coat:

					MAN
			Goodbye, Mrs. Peel!


245     EXT.  ROOFTOP

	The chopper rises slowly.

	Emma looks.  A fifteen foot leap ... Impossible.


246     FROM INSIDE CHOPPER

	A farewell wave from the gas-masked man.


247     CLOSEUP - EMMA

	contemplating the jump, beneath falling snowflakes, as the distance grows.


248     EMMA'S POV

	The rope/chain ladder coils into the chopper's belly.


249     INT.  CHOPPER - NIGHT

	Above London rooftops, after dark --

	The man (still wears gas mask) the Pilot, CO-PILOT and a Butler (ditto).  From the
	chopper, a giddy look down thru a glass command module.  A fairy tale, snow white
	city.

	OVER the RADIO, interference.  A changing of stations.  Then a CRACKLY
	broadcast of "The Merry Widow."

	As the WALTZ serenades them high above the city  -- 
	a KNOCKING from outside on the door --

	Surprised reactions.  The Butler opens the door, sees --

	Emma hanging onto the helicopter struts.  The Butler is too dumbstruck to say
	anything.

					EMMA
				(shouts, re:  the
				gas mask)
			Anyone ever tell you you look
			like a housefly?

	Emma grabs his epauletted shoulder, yanks him up, flicks him out --

	The Butler is jerked out -- flies into the open air.  Emma watches him fall ...

					EMMA
			Anyone else need a lift?

	The white-coated Man moves forward, but Emma is out, slamming the door, still
	clinging ...

					MAN
				(to Pilot; intercom)
			Can't you throw her off?

	The Pilot nods, works controls, the chopper dips as --

	Blam -- !  a kinky leather boot crashes --

	Into the Pilot's face as Emma kicks in the GLASS from the front of the chopper,
	SMASHES so the Pilots can't see -- a sudden rush of cold air --

	The INSTRUMENT PANELS WHIRR round as the Pilots struggle for control --

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(intercom)
			Where'd she go?


250     EXT.  CHOPPER TOP - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

	with the blades whirling directly over her head, Emma crawls over the top of the
	chopper and lets herself down the other side as London's lights twinkle beneath ...

	As the Co-Pilot pokes his head out of the cockpit --

	Emma grabs him with one hand, hoists him up into the air --

	The Co-Pilot dangles over the city.  Grabs Emma.  Slithers back onto the cockpit.
	Pistol whips her.  Emma crunches back onto the metal.  Blades whirring close!  
	The co-Pilot peers into her eyes from inside the gas mask --

					CO-PILOT
			Happy landings, Mrs. Peel.

	He raises his hand, ready to hit her again, Emma yanks him up, where his head get
	sliced off by the blades -- body and head fall away separately ...

	As Emma reacts, her legs are grabbed from below and the white-coated Man pulls her
	down the side of the chopper --

	Emma falls, but manages a flying handhold, hangs onto the chain wire below the
	chopper.  As --


251     EXT.  WIDE ANGLE - NIGHT

	The Pilot and his passenger zoom at low level over buildings.  Trying to dislodge
	Emma ...


252     THEIR POV

	Thru the blizzard, zooming down streets, landmark buildings looming up topped in
	snow, feet up ... shinnying up the chain wire ...

	"THE MERRY WIDOW WALTZ," no longer heard as old record or ensemble
	arrangement but enormous, for FULL ORCHESTRA ...


253     CLOSEUP - EMMA

	grimly hoists herself up along the struts again, hand over hand, coming up to the
	cockpit from behind --


254     BACK TO SCENE

	With a sudden movement, she yanks the Pilot out from behind and he goes flying
	towards eternity on his own.

	The chopper out of control as the white-coated Man is left to fly it himself ...


255     IN NIGHT AIR

	"THE MERRY WIDOW" BOOMS, the chopper lurches, spinning round -- up and
	down, over spiraling corkscrews, an insane waltz ...


256     INT.  CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

	The white-coated Man gets control ...


257     EXT.  CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

	Zig-zags down a narrow street, trying to smash Emma into sides of windows.


258     SEVERAL ANGLES

	as Emma bounces of buildings, holding on for dear life ...


259     EXT.  WIDE ANGLE OVER THAMES - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

	The chopper dips down, dragging Emma through icy water ...

	Up ahead ... Tower Bridge ... twin peaks ... a firework display going on ... rockets and
	lights in the sky thru snowflakes ...

	Emma sees the bridge coming, reaches down and --


260     CLOSEUP SHOT

	Detaches her pocket limpet bomb and lobs it into the chopper cockpit.


261     HER POV

	The bridge looms up, chopper rising to cross it as Emma leaps onto the bridge!


262     INT.  CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

	The Man sees the bomb ...

	Also flings himself onto the bridge as --

	Against b.g. of the fireworks display --


263     WIDE ANGLE - TOWER BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

	BOOM! -- the CHOPPER EXPLODES.  Ball of flames.  The crowd roars in
	appreciation ... great fireworks!


264     EXT.  TOP OF TOWER BRIDGE WALKWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

	Emma picks herself up, sees the Man in the white lab coat and runs for him.

	He runs too -- towards --


265     ANOTHER CHOPPER

	which unloads a rope ladder as Emma puts on every ounce of steam ... 
	The Man reaches for the dangling ladder --
	but --


266     CLOSEUP - ON HIS FOOT

	stuck, wedged between narrow battlements.


267     BACK TO SCENE

	The Man looks at his shoe, at Emma charging towards him, at the rope ladder.  He
	pulls his foot out of his shoe and grabs the ladder, sailing off in the second chopper,
	leaving Emma panting behind.  She's soaked, frozen, gasping for breath, bending over,
	when she sees --


268     CLOSEUP - SHOE

	Emma pulls it from its wedge, looks at the inside:  --  "Trubshaw's of Jermyn Street."

					STEED (V.O.)
			I thought it was Cinderella
			who lost her slipper ...


269     INT.  TRUBSHAW'S - DAWN

	On Jermyn Street, snow lies waist high.  BLARING SIRENS.  Searchlights.  PA
	announcements urge citizens to stay indoors ... PULL BACK to reveal a fire glows, a
	CLOCK TICKS calmly.  Emma sits with her shoe, surrounded by a pile of shoes. 
	Steed & Trubshaw beside her.

					EMMA
			This time the shoe's on the other
			foot. You said a hand-made shoe
			was as good as a photo-fit or
			D.N.A.? Well, all we have to do is
			find the shoe that fits ...

					TRUBSHAW
			It should be easy. A Trubshaw
			client has his shoes delivered
			personally. The Ministry should
			be able to confirm our delivery.

					STEED
			I'll be back ...

					EMMA
			Where are you going?

					STEED
			Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather 
			may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ...

					EMMA
			You needn't bother. I can't drag you 
			further into this. After all, I am still 
			the chief suspect.

					STEED
			No bother. Mother and Father think
			I've joined you. I might as well.

					EMMA
			But --

					STEED
				(comes back)
			Oh, and by the way, I think it's about 
			time you got rid of that chip on your 
			shoulder.

					EMMA
			If you'd been through what I have,
			you wouldn't --

	Steed reaches and pulls off the micro-bug from her shoulder.

					STEED
			A microtag. One of Mother's little
			toys. There you are. Free at last.

	He tips his bowler off her surprised reaction.


270     INT.  TRUBSHAW'S BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	An armory.  Steed stands before racks of umbrellas, displayed like ceremonial swords --
	ivory handles, duck handles, you name it ...

	Steed hefts a few, as picky as a Samurai ...


271     UPSTAIRS - HOURS LATER

	Emma surrounded by a mountain of shoes.  Triumphantly, she holds up a pair of shoe
	lasts.

					EMMA
			Prince Charming, I presume.
			Your name is ...


272     CLOSE ON WORN PAPER LABEL

	with the name:  DARLING.

					EMMA
			Oh my God ...


273     INT.  TRUBSHAW'S - DOWNSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Steed selects his umbrella and we FOLLOW UP TO:


274     INT.  TRUBSHAW'S - UPSTAIRS - DAY

	He sees only Trubshaw.

					STEED
			Where's Mrs. Peel?

					TRUBSHAW
			She just left, sir. In a hurry.

					STEED
			What?

					TRUBSHAW
			She said you'd understand.


275     ON STEED

	Worried.

					VOICE (V.O.)
			Ah, here we are ...


276     CLOSEUP - PIP PUFFING IN MID-AIR

	WIDEN to reveal:


277     INT.  MINISTRY ARCHIVES - DAY

	Inside the archives, among leather volumes.  A file goes through the air, passed to
	Emma ... As she reads.  A map is opened across a desk from her.

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			'X' marks the spot. The shoes were 
			delivered to ... an island in Hyde Park.
			Surrounded by the Serpentine. On the 
			site of a former Ministry installation...

					EMMA
			... and now?


					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Privately owned by ...

					EMMA
			Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather.

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Very good, Mrs. Peel ...

					EMMA
			I shall need a small plane.

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			You're not venturing alone, surely.

					EMMA
			I'm going to find out who killed
			my husband. Will you take these
			documents to Steed?


					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Of course.


278     ON EMMA

					EMMA
			Tell him I said ... goodbye.


279     INT.  SECRET SERVICE HQ - DAY

	below the Thames as at the beginning.

	In darkest paranoia, Mother lies at the heart of his Labyrinth.  Controls around him
	flash emergency.  Panic.  Cakes piled up beside him, uneaten.  Beside him, Father.
	Brenda hands a phone.


					BRENDA
			Steed for you.

	Mother grabs the phone, furious.

					MOTHER
			Where's Mrs. Peel?

	He signals frantically for Father to trace the call, but being blind, Father just sits
there.

					STEED (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			I was hoping you could tell me.

					MOTHER
			You're getting yourself into terrible 
			trouble, my son. Weather's turning 
			very nasty -- and so am I.

					STEED (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			I'm going to follow up on a hunch of 
			my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is 
			innocent and you have a mole.

					MOTHER
				(grabs mirror;
				searches his face)
			Where?

					STEED (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			In your operation.

					MOTHER
			I'm warning you for the last time, 
			Steed: whoever's behind all this, 
			looks like Mrs. Peel, walks like 
			Mrs. Peel and kills like Mrs. Peel.

	CLICK.  The line goes dead.


280     CLOSE ON MOTHER

	Furious.

					MOTHER
			Steed??
				(to Father)
			Find Mrs. Peel.

	Brenda smiles at the thought.  Father rises, grim.


281     EXT.  SKY - DAY

	Through mist, an ultralight plane zooms down -- From the plane, Emma leaps in
	parachute ...  Down, down, down through the mist ...

	Over parkland, the parachute floats down ... To an island in the middle of the
	Serpentine river.


282     EXT.  ISLAND (HYDE PARK) - DAY

	Emma lands, buries her parachute.  Walks towards a thick jungle, then a stream.  Emma
	hops across on water lilies until she reaches land again.  Where a peacock fans its tail of
	a thousand eyes.  A CLICK of CAMERAS.

	In the midst of the jungle, Emma sees --


283     HER POV

	A red phone box.  Emma frowns in recognition; goes inside.  Picks up the phone.
	Presses "Button B", and --

	The floor goes down.  Emma goes down with it, into --


284     INT.  HYDE PARK UNDERGROUND HQ

	Formerly a Ministry installation.  The "elevator" stops.  Remembering, as from a dream,
	Emma steps out into --


285     LONG DARK CORRIDOR

	A GUARD patrols.  Emma pushes herself against a wall.  The wall gives way to flip
	round, and Emma swivels into --


286     INT.  TOTALLY DARK CHAMBER

	The door locks behind.  Alone, Emma stands warily.

	From nowhere, a chilling, disembodied voice.  Intimate.  Seductive.

					VOICE (V.O.)
			Congratulations, Mrs. Peel. You have 
			been a worthy opponent. You have 
			tracked us down. You are within an 
			ace of winning.

					EMMA
			This isn't a game.

					VOICE (V.O.)
			Quite right, but we still make the rules.

					EMMA
			Rules are made to be broken.

					VOICE (V.O.)
			People, too.

					EMMA
			Then who wins?

					VOICE
			You and I. Together. But first you 
			must confront your greatest enemy.
			Who could that be, Mrs. Peel?  
			The answer is obvious ...

	Suddenly lights!

	Emma is in a hall of mirrors.

					VOICE (V.O.)
			Yourself.

	In every direction Emma turns, a thousand reflections of herself stare back at her,
	splintered into fragments as Emma spins, freaked and confused by the multiple images.

	Emma turns into herself -- only herself drapes arms around her and kisses her on the
	lips.

	Bad Emma -- whose eyes stare into Emma's startled ones as Emma pulls her mouth
	away, staggers back; realizes too late.  The hallucinogenic lip poison.  Emma crumples
	to her knees as --


287     EMMA'S POV

	Sees "herself" above her, before she -- falls unconscious.


288     EXT.  COUNTRY ROADS - DAY

	Steed's Jag races, skids in bad weather.


289     INT.  CAR

	Behind the wheel Steed, his face grim, concentrates on the slippery road.  On the seat
	next to him the snow shaker with little Emma inside --

									
		DISSOLVE TO:


290     INT.  UNDERGROUND H.Q.

	As if in a dream, Emma awakes captive inside a bizarre cage:  A life size snow shaker.
	Emma "swims" in viscous air,	suspended like a mermaid.  Thru glass she sees --

	A face peering in:  Father.

					FATHER
				(filtered)
			Emma in Wonderland. Welcome,
			Mrs. Peel.
				(filtered)
			We've been expecting you. We hope 
			you'll enjoy your stay with us. 
			Decontamination is almost complete.

					EMMA
			Decontamination -- ?

					FATHER
			And you've a new wardrobe. He
			does want you to look attractive.
				(beat )
			He tells me you're very beautiful.

	Emma pounds the glass in frustration.

					FATHER
			Relax, Mrs. Peel. We're hundreds
			of feet below ground. The Ministry
			made it impregnable. No one can
			save you.


291     EXT.  SPIRES OF ETON COLLEGE - EVENING

	as Steed drives towards it ...


292     INT.  UNDERGROUND HQ - DINING ROOM

	Bathed in candlelight.  A romantic supper for two ...

	A door opens, admitting -- Emma. Dressed, coiffed, super-glamorous.  She locks
	around, sees another door.  In search of escape she hastens to open it, only to reveal --

	A giant rabbit -- the one we saw at the Teddy Bear meeting.

	Emma gasps in surprise, moves back into the room as he advances, removing the 
	head -- it's Dr. Darling!!!


					DR. DARLING
			Emma, my dear. How lovely you
			look.

	He steps out of the rest of his costume ...

					EMMA
			Would that I could say the Same.

					DR. DARLING
			Ah, but you haven't see the real
			me. Watch closely ...

	He pulls at his face, which bubbles and collapses as he walks towards her --

	Emma's horrified expression, eyes widening as --

	Dr. Darling turns into ... Peter!

					EMMA
			Peter ...

					PETER
			Darling Emma --

					EMMA
			It was you ... all the time?

					PETER
			Not really. Not quite. I'm
			afraid you still don't see ...

	Again he claws at his face, pulling, twisting ...

	Emma winces at the sight, her eyes popping out of her head.

	It's Valentine!

					TEACHER (V.O.)
			Valentine Peel ...


293     EXT.  ETON COLLEGE - EVENING

	beneath Gothic turrets pupils in top hats and tails.

					OLD TEACHER (V.O.)
			Yes, I remember him quite well ...

	PULL BACK THROUGH windows to reveal:  Steed and an OLD TEACHER in the
	beautiful library.

					OLD TEACHER
			This is where he used to spend his
			days. We have an old photograph
			somewhere ...

	He's flipping through yearbooks, then shows Steed --


294     CLOSEUP - PHOTO

	of Valentine Peel on stage, in wizard's garb.  Made up as an old man ...


295     BACK TO SCENE

					TEACHER
			Absolute wizard with makeup. His
			favorite roll from Shakespeare.
			Prospero ...

					STEED
			'The Prospero Project...'

					TEACHER
			... From The Tempest. A banished
			duke, ousted by his brother,
			marooned on a magic island. Who
			controlled the weather.


296     CLOSEUP - STEED

	grim.

					STEED
			'O Brave New World that hath
			such people in it.'


297     BACK TO DINNER TABLE

	Emma frozen, sinks into a chair, staring ...

					EMMA
			You.

					VALENTINE
			Darling Emma -- yes, we:  the true 
			genius behind the Prospero Project ...

	He walks around the dinner table as he talks ...

					EMMA
			But you died -- in the explosion ...


298     FLASHBACK - CLOSE ON HAND IN WHITE GLOVE

	Twisting the dial.  PAN UP the arm to reveal Valentine.

					VALENTINE (V.O.)
			Oh, no. I arranged the explosion.


299     BACK TO PRESENT

					VALENTINE
			A slight miscalculation -- my face 
			was burned beyond recognition.
			Fortunately my research into plastics 
			came in handy ...

					EMMA
				(stunned)
			Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ...

					VALENTINE
			An unholy trinity ...

					EMMA
				(stands)
			You killed my husband.

					VALENTINE
			For starters. Of course I had to kill 
			the Teddy Bears, as well ...

					EMMA
			Too many cooks --

					VALENTINE
			Spoil the majority shareholders. In 
			Wonderland Weather. I planned 
			everything, even the Ministry 
			recruiting you ...

					EMMA
			But I found you. All the clues
			led me here ...

					VALENTINE
			Of course. I planned that, too.

					EMMA
			But -- why?

					VALENTINE
			You disappoint me, Emma.  Can't
			you guess?
				(moves toward her)
			For you. It was all for you ...

					EMMA
				(cold)
			'Our revels now are ended.'

					VALENTINE
			Oh, no, Emma. They've only
			just begun ...


300     INT.  INVISIBLE JONES' OFFICE - NIGHT

	The phone hangs in the air -- with the smoking pipe.

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			The shoes were delivered to an island 
			in the Serpentine - former Ministry 
			installation ... she said to tell you 
goodbye. What?


301     CLOSEUP - STEED IN RED PHONEBOX (SOMEWHERE) - NIGHT

					STEED
			I said it's not goodbye yet.
			Listen, I'm going to need some
			help. In a hurry ...


302     INT.  HYDE PARK UNDERGROUND - DINING ROOM

					VALENTINE
				(indicates supper)
			Think of this as your second
			wedding feast ...

					EMMA
			I'm already married ...

					VALENTINE
			Come, come, you're a widow -- a
			most attractive widow. Now I think 
			of it, we'll need a bridesmaid. Here.

	He pushes a button.  Bad Emma enters.  Tattooed Z424.  Unmistakably hostile.

					VALENTINE
			My latest model. A compound of 
			plastics and sensor chips. A big 
			improvement on the old X404s.
			The poor thing is quite fond of me. 
			Emma, say hello to Emma.

	BAD EMMA HISSES, a strange mix of STATIC and FEEDBACK.

					VALENTINE 
			You know, I believe she's actually 
			jealous.

					EMMA
			Valentine, listen to me ...

					VALENTINE
			Right, bridesmaid. Now what
			have I left out? Oh, yes, I know:
			the ring.

					EMMA
				(covers her hand)
			Ring?

	He stands very near her -- she's terrified -- then:

					VALENTINE
			How silly of me -- let me make
			you comfortable first ...

	As he advances, ZOOM IN EXTREME CLOSEUP Emma's eye

									
		DISSOLVE TO:


303     INT.  ISLAND (HYDE PARK) - NIGHT

	Another ball, WIDEN to reveal, from the lake, an odd eight foot high plastic ball
	emerges -- The ball lands on the shore.  From the inside, a zip peels away the plastic
	layer to reveal --

	Steed, like an urban dandy in suit and bowler.  A rose in his lapel.  He steps out, and,
	poking with his umbrella --

	Deflates the inflatable plastic submarine.  Steed heads off -- CAMERA EYES the
	peacock swivel towards him, as he heads into the jungle where he sees the --


304     RED PHONEBOX

	Steed picks up the phone.  Presses all the buttons until he hits "Button B."  As the floor
	lowers, his eyes widen in surprise ...



305     SARCOPHAGUS

	carved in Emma's likeness.  Lowered from the ceiling hydraulically into --


306     INT.  VALENTINE'S HIGH-TECH TORTURE CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS
	ACTION

	as Valentine descends spiral steps to join it.

	Valentine opens the coffin to reveal Emma strapped within.

					VALENTINE
			That's better. I say, isn't this 
			where you came in? It's
			impenetrable, by the way ...

					EMMA
			You're mad.

					VALENTINE
			Entirely. On the other hand
				(he advances towards
				her, smiling)
			Mad people get things done. Let
			me show you --


307     INT.  UNDERGROUND H.Q. - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Steed stealing down a corridor and --

	hides, as a posse of guards rushes past, alerted by the peacock cameras.  He waits till
	they pass, then reaches out his umbrella, and --

	Nabs Father around the neck who was feeling her way after them.  Brings her down.

					FATHER
			Steed

					STEED
			How did you guess?

					FATHER
			You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black
			Leather ...

					STEED
			It was you who gave Valentine
			Peel his security clearance ...
			you're the mole who betrayed
			the Ministry.


					FATHER
			Mother betrayed me. She was 
			going to replace me with a younger 
			Father.  Errand boy that's all I was.  
			'Find Steed...'

					STEED
			Well, you found me. Have a sniff of 
			this, why don't you? Careful, the 
			scent can be overpowering ...

	Holding Father securely, Steed forces her nose into his rose boutonniere, squeezes the
	rubber tube, sprays a Mist.  Father passes out.  Steed rises, locks around.
	Sees --

	A grille and removes it, climbs in and replaces it before the guards return.  He turns 
	and --


308     INT.  DUCTS - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	crawls forward through a mass of wires and plumbing --
	until he hears a VOICE -- VALENTINE'S.

	Steed reaches another grille, through which he can see --


309     INT.  TORTURE CHAMBER

	Emma's coffin, standing on end, like the Iron Maiden faces a wall of TV monitors as
	Valentine explains.

					VALENTINE
			People expect weather to be free. 
			They're used to it. I call that a 
			denial of freedom. No freedom of 
			choice. An abuse of human rights. 
			They buy water, electricity, gas. 
			Why shouldn't they be able to buy 
			their own weather if they want to? 
			If they have a little incentive ...

	Emma reacts -- also Steed (unseen) behind her.

					EMMA
			Such as?

					VALENTINE
			Destruction of their local weather 
			systems. I can zap a thousand 
			Chernobyls into the air.

					EMMA
			The result would be ...

					VALENTINE
			Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop 
			failure.  Economic disaster.  
			Frostbite or sunburn ... on a 
			massive scale. 
			You've seen a few samples...

					EMMA
			Then what's stopping you?

					VALENTINE
			One very small thing. A diamond
			'cyclone' chip. A thousand times
			more information on a fraction of
			the size. If I possess that, my
			powers would be unlimited. My
			dear half-brother was developing
			it. But he suspected sabotage.
			He gave the chip to ... you,
			'Mrs.' Peel. I want you. But
			also your ring.

	Valentine takes her by the hand. Kisses --


310     CLOSEUP - HER RING

A diamond.  In the light, a patterned imprint.  ZOOM IN -- a complex fractal equation of circuits.


311     BACK TO SCENE

					VALENTINE
			The missing piece of the jigsaw.
			I tried to get you to give it to me 
			as Peter; I tried to steal it from 
			you as Dr. Darling. As myself I'll 
			be a bit less subtle.
				(he slips it off her
				finger; holds it up)
			With this ring my plan will be
			complete.

					EMMA
			How Wagnerian ... Do you mean 
			to say you've waited all these 
			years because you couldn't create 
			a chip on your own? That would 
			have amused Peter.

					VALENTINE
			Speaking of Peter, there's more good 
			news: You won't even have to change 
			your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel.

					EMMA
			What are my choices?

					VALENTINE
			Choices?

					EMMA
			I'll never marry you.

	Valentine is philosophical.  He spins the sarcophagus on an axis, lying it flat -- Emma 
	lying in her coffin as he looks down at her --

					VALENTINE
			One out of two isn't bad. I'll keep you 
			alive, darling Emma. In a year or five, 
			you may change your mind. If you're 
			still in it.

	Valentine presses a button.  From the ceiling -- a surgical laser.  Moves down to within
	inches of her face.

					VALENTINE
			This little toy gave me back my face.
			It can replace yours. What do you think?
			Medusa? Madame Defarge? Maggie
			Thatcher?

	He marks an imaginary line round Emma's face.

	An ALARM BELL RINGS.  Emma reacts.

					FATHER (V.O.)
			Dr. Darling, this is Father. We
			have an intruder. I repeat --

	Valentine switches off the PA.

					VALENTINE
			Ah. That will be Steed. He followed 
			you. Please excuse me. I have work 
			to do. My most spectacular 
			performance. A ballet of clouds. It 
			was made for you. I want to give you 
			a heart, Emma. I want all of London 
			to see it. And now with this ...
				(flourishes ring)
			They will.
				(leans close)
			And for an encore: the biggest cyclone 
			in history will wipe the City from the 
			face of the earth.
				(winks)
			Shape of things to come, my darling.

	He stuffs a gag into Emma's mouth and closes the coffin on her muffled protests. 
	Darkness.

	Immediately, Steed tries to force his way through the grille.  No such luck.

					STEED
			Blast. What to do? Mrs. Peel!

	He doesn't dare say her name too loud -- and there's no telling if she could hear him in
	that thing, anyway.

	He turns around in the tunnel -- heads the other way.


312     EXT.  SKY OVER LONDON - NIGHT

	Moonlight night.  Dark clouds approach like an army, spreading shadows.


313     INSIDE CLOUDS

	MOISTURE SPITS and CRACKLES, static energy waiting to explode ...

	In the sky -- clouds join together like a genie from a lamp, forming -- over the city -- a
	strange dark sensuous figure, half human, half dreamlike.

	That stalks the city....


314     INT.  DUCTS - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Steed crawling.  A rat runs over him ...

					STEED
			The things I do for England ...

	Pitch dark, then --

	Emma's coffin is opened and we see Bad Emma, looking down.

	Bad Emma stares at her human double -- Emma: who looks imploringly at her to undo
	the gag.  Bad Emma removes it, she --

	Runs a finger down Emma's body, inside a hole torn in the leather -- warm human flesh.
	Blood.  Her flesh.  Her blood.  Fascinated.

					EMMA
			You must let me go ...

	Bad Emma listens.  Gently lays her head on Emma's breast, listens to --
	the HEARTBEAT.  Ba-boom.  Ba-boom ...

					EMMA
			Don't you understand? If he has
			me, he'll have no use for you ...
			he'll destroy you ...

	The words jolt Bad Emma back, remembering her mission.  She goes to the laser, aims
	it at Emma's face!

					EMMA
			No...

	Bad Emma hesitates, looks strangely human as --


315     ANOTHER PART OF UNDERGROUND H.Q.

	The grille pops off and Steed emerges where the guards are waiting for him --

					STEED
			Oh, dear.

	No escape.  He takes off his bowler -- deftly removes a strip from its brim, aims it at
	the guards, and --

	Hurls it ...


316     CLOSEUP - BOWLER (IN FLIGHT)

	A glinting razor's edge, which --

	Swoosh -- !  Slices into the closest guard before returning, like a boomerang to Steed.
	He taps twice hard steel as ...


317     OTHER GUARDS

	run towards him, Steed swivels gracefully and - slams the bowler in their faces, a
	sartorial knuckleduster -- wham -- !  One drops -- Bam -- !  The other collapses, slump
	to the ground.  Steed stoops down, picks up his hat, sees --

	A dent in its steel top.  For the first time, Steed loses his cool.  Genuine rage.

					STEED
			Someone's going to pay for this.

	Stepping over the nearest body, Steed moves on his way, as --


318     CLOSEUP - VALENTINE

	places a ring inside a control module filled with identical-looking diamond chips ...

	WIDEN to reveal ...


319     INT.  CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

	Masses of dials and switches.  ( Off to one side, on a wall, a rack of rapiers ... )

	Valentine hits a switch ...

					VALENTINE
			Start the countdown. Action
			stations. Five minutes ...

	The countdown starts, red digitals going backwards --

	Colorized computer screens map out hostile weather fronts.
	A COMPUTERIZED VOICE STARTS to COUNT.  The CLOCK TICKS.

	Father enters behind him.

					FATHER
			Congratulations. The clouds are
			on course ...

					VALENTINE
			To explode. London will be ashes.

					FATHER
			Not yet! They haven't heard our
			terms ... !

	Father tries to hit the switch.  Valentine yanks her off.

					VALENTINE
			Are you insane? Stop the program
			and you activate the auto-destruct!

					FATHER
			But all those people -- !

	Valentine strikes her hard --

					VALENTINE
			My cloud ballet! My cyclone!

	Father slides to the floor.  Valentine ignores her.  Concentrates on the control panel red
	lights, as --


320     EXT.  PARLIAMENT SQUARE - NIGHT

	Up in the sky, more white clouds --

	Darken into boiling black.  They move and billow.  Bubbling with gases and energy
	Swirling with motion, a life of their own.

	FROM river, a scarlet fog floats upwards.  It gains mass and weight, slowly forming as
	it rolls --


321     THROUGH CITY STREETS

	then RISES ABOVE them -- into a weird pulsating red shape.
	A love heart.


322     CLOSEUP - DIGITAL READOUTS

	Whirling backwards ...


323     INT.  MOTHER'S UNDERWATER HQ - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Mother at the controls.  RINGS the ALARM.  Panic stations as -- SIRENS BLARE. 
	WARNINGS RING OUT OVER TV and RADIO --

					MOTHER
			Dense cloud formation moving south-
			west. On course for the center of the 
			city. A fog floating in from the river. 
			The prediction is ... unstable chemical 
			reaction. Enforce the curfew ... 
			Emergency stand by ... !


324     EXT.  SKY OVER BUCKINGHAM PALACE - NIGHT

	Bad storm clouds advance over London ... black and furious.


325     OVER CITY - SEVERAL ANGLES

	As shadows in a whirl of chemical matter.  An airborne CYCLONE of BELCHING
	static ELECTRICITY.  The black shape now --

	Forming a sensuous female shape.  Like a dream wisp of ...

	Emma Peel with an hourglass figure.  While --


326     FROM RIVER

	The heart-shaped cloud seems to -- move towards the black genie shape -- trying to
	connect, to form the cyclone ...


327     EXT.  LONDON STREETS - SEVERAL ANGLES - NIGHT

	Action stations.  AIR RAID SIRENS ...

	Like a re-run Blitz.  Streets now eerily empty and dark.
	Through deserted streets --

	Troops race to positions in gas masks.  Searchlights illuminate clouds.  Worried faces
	watch the skies, as --


328     CLOSEUP - DIGITAL NUMBERS

	Fly ...


329     INT.  HI-TECH TORTURE CHAMBER - DAY

	Chaos on all TV monitors as ...

	Valentine hastens down the spiral steps and opens Emma's coffin.  What will he find??
	Emma's there, still gagged.  Looks asleep.

					VALENTINE
			My dear.
				(pulls the gag:
				kisses her)
			I wouldn't want you to miss the
			grand finale ...

	Emma opens her eyes.  Valentine looks down at her, until -- a tell-tale sign:  Z424. 
	Bad Emma is unmistakable.  He strikes her -- yanks her out of the coffin.

					VALENTINE
			Find her. Kill her ...

	He races back upstairs as ...


330     INT.  UNDERGROUND HYDE PARK - HQ CATWALKS - CONTINUOUS
	ACTION

	Emma makes her way through the labyrinthine superstructure of the place, crawling
	high on a girder over some BURBLING LIQUID below.  She hears NOISE IN the
	DISTANCE.  Suddenly --


331     INT.  UNDERGROUND HQ - STEED - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Steed battles more guards!  No time to lose.

	Wham -- ! Bam -- ! Now moving with deadly earnest, Steed downs all oncomers,
	closing in on --


332     INT.  UNDERGROUND CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Steed rushes in, BOLTS the AIRLOCK behind.  Pounding on door.

	He sees the timer racing backwards -- stands over the controls, trying to figure out how
	to stop the program.

	Looks for the chip -- amongst all the rest it's like trying to find a contact lens in
water.


333     FLOOR-LEVEL HATCH

	opens behind.  Valentine emerges, drops the HATCH COVER with a THUD.  Steed
	whirls.

					VALENTINE
			John Steed.

					STEED
			Valentine Peel. I see you've gone 
			back to using your original face.

					VALENTINE
			The last one you'll ever see.

					STEED
			Perish the thought.

	Valentine fulls forth a rapier from the wall.

					VALENTINE
			Did they tell you at Eton that I
			was fencing champion, too?

	Steed unsheathes his umbrella, revealing ditto.

					STEED
			They said you were a very naughty 
			boy.

	The fight is on as the numbers grow smaller!


334     SEVERAL ANGLES

					VALENTINE
			You're better than I expected.

					STEED
			I was at Harrow ...

					VALENTINE
			But did they teach you this?

	Valentine whacks the blade off Steed's umbrella handle.  Laughs.  A diminished phallic
	symbol.  Steed, dumbfounded.

	Valentine advances towards Steed --

	Who points the umbrella at him.

					STEED
			Bang-bang ... you're dead.

					VALENTINE
			You wish.

	He moves to close in, when ...


335     CLOSEUP - FLASH OF LIGHT

	from the muzzle, as a BULLET ZIPS out, and --


336     VALENTINE

	recoils.  Blood streams from his shoulder.  He looks up, devastated.  Steed blows
	smoke away from the muzzle.

					STEED
			One shot -- for emergencies.

					VALENTINE
				(clutches wound)
			That's not playing by the rules.

					STEED
				(echoes Emma!)
			Rules are made to be broken.

					VALENTINE
				(pulls his own gun)
			If you say so.

					STEED
			I do.

	He FIRES again.  To the heart.  Valentine spins to the floor.

					VALENTINE
			You said ... one shot.

					STEED
			Did I? My mistake.

	Steed turns to the console, tries to figure out how to stop the countdown, when behind
	the hatch opens again, revealing Emma.  Valentine pulls her up, grabs her as hostage --

					VALENTINE
			I wouldn't do that, if I were you.

	Steed turns.

					STEED
			Mrs. Peel -- !

	Valentine has Emma, a knife to her throat, stands over the hatch.

					VALENTINE
			Bullet-proof waistcoats -- just the 
			thing. I get mine from Trubshaw's. 
			We'll be off now, won't we, darling?
				(to Steed)
			We wouldn't want to miss the
			fireworks. Figure it out if you can, 
			Steed ...


337     DOWN HATCH

	Valentine drags Emma, bolting the hatch.


338     ON STEED

	He's torn briefly, but there are thousands of lives at stake; Steed goes to the control
	module and starts pulling out chips, looking ...


339     EXT.  LONDON - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

	The biggest cyclone you've ever seen starts slowly whirling above the city, gathering
	momentum ...


340     NUMBERS

	going down, down, down, as ...


341     INT.  CATWALKS - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Valentine drags Emma backwards ...


342     EXT.  LONDON - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

	The cyclone picking up force ...


343     CLOSEUP - STEED'S HANDS

	pull up a chip.  The red numbers freeze.  WIDEN to reveal...


344     INT.  CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	The SIRENS CEASE.  Steed allows himself a smile of relief.


345     EXT.  LONDON - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

	The giant cyclone begins to break apart ...


346     SEVERAL ANGLES - DYING STORM


347     CLOSEUP - RELIEVED FACES

	Troops pulling off gas masks as ...


348     INT.  CONTROL ROOM - ON SCREENS - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Steed sees the breakup of the cyclone ...

	Then -- behind him -- an ominous CLICK-CLICKING as the PROGRAM reconfigures.
	A DIFFERENT ALARM BUZZER SOUNDS and the words: 

	"AUTO-DESTRUCT, 3 MINUTES"

	start flashing ...

	A different set of numbers start running backwards ...

					STEED
			You must be joking ...

349     EXT.  CATWALKS - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Valentine, dragging Emma, reacts to the new ALARMS.

					VALENTINE
			Fool ...

	In his hesitation, Emma suddenly makes her move.  A struggle -- Emma takes a bad fall
	down a landing below.  Ugly THUD.  Dead.

					STEED
			That will do.

	He's materialized across the girder from Valentine.  Who pulls his revolver.

					VALENTINE
			Aren't you forgetting about
			something?

					STEED
			You are, and it's behind you.

					VALENTINE
			Come, come. You don't really
			expect me to fall for --

	Bad Emma's arms go 'round Valentine in a lethal embrace.

					VALENTINE
			Let go, you ... idiot ...

	Uh uh.  She holds him in a vice-like grip.  Hugging Valentine.

					STEED
			I think she really likes you ...
			Where's Mrs. Peel?

					VALENTINE
			Ugh ...

	As the life is squeezed out of him, Bad Emma finally smiles.  Cradled together, she
	chokes Valentine, who gasps for breath, as --

	One last desperate move on his part and Bad Emma tumbles backwards, Valentine
	locked in her arms in a dying embrace.

	They fall into the mists and liquid below.

	Steed almost falls himself as he grabs a beam for support.  Looks down, sees ...


350     EMMA

	Dead.

					STEED
			Emma!

	He has said her name.  He scrambles down to her body.

	Emma lying sprawled out on the ground.

	Steed picks up her limp body in his arms like "Sleeping Beauty."  His eyes fill with
	tears.  He lays her down.

					STEED
			Emma ...

	He produces Peter's ring.


351     CLOSEUP - RING

	Slips it onto her finger and ...


352     BACK TO SCENE

	Kisses her.  A chaste kiss on the lips.  But with the force and passion of a lover.  He
	closes his eyes, looks away in grief.  The ALARM STILL SOUNDS but Steed doesn't
	give a damn.

	Behind, Emma opens her eyes.  As if revived by the kiss.  Or the ring.  Looks up at
	him.

					EMMA
			Steed?

	Steed looks back at her -- surprise, delight.

					STEED
			Mrs. Peel?

					EMMA
			What kept you?

					STEED
			The plot.
				(realizing)
			Hello, we must be going ...


353     CLOSEUP - AUTO-DESTRUCT NUMBERS

	Racing backwards as ...


354     SEVERAL ANGLES

	Steed pulls Emma through the catwalks and corridors of Valentine's Labyrinth ...


355     MORE NUMBERS

	racing to zero, nothing to stop them ...


356     INT.  TORTURE CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Steed and Emma race in -- she sees the sarcophagus.

					EMMA
			Quick!

	Emma scrambles in and Steed leaps on top of her, bringing down the lid as ...


357     SEVERAL ANGLES

	3-2-1 -- and a BLAST like a nuclear EXPLOSION -- as the Underground HQ is
	fragmented to smithereens -- Emma's " coffin" goes flying ... as the SCREEN WHITES
	OUT.


358     EXT.  ALBERT BRIDGE - NIGHT

		Beneath the clear moonlight, all bulbs on -- like Xmas.


359     BELOW

	it floats the coffin -- which opens, revealing ...

	Steed and Emma, squashed together, gasping for breath.

					STEED
			'The owl and the pussycat went
			to sea -'

					EMMA
			'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'

					STEED
			A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...

					EMMA
			Still a bit chilly ...

					STEED
			English weather. You know, after 
			all we've been through, I should 
			say we deserve a long holiday ...

					EMMA
			Have you any place in mind?

					STEED
			As a matter of fact I have ...

	The coffin drifts downstream in the moonlight.

									
	SLOW DISSOLVE TO:


360     EXT.  SIBERIAN ICE FIELDS - DAY				360

	A few weeks later.  Across snowy wastes, a pack of Huskies drag a sled behind them,
	WHIP CRACKED by a --

	Frozen fur-clad Siberian peasant.  As he turns a corner, dogs stumble from ice and
	snow into --


361     SAND

	The peasant stops, stares.


362     AHEAD OF HIM

	Sun beats down.  A tropical beach.  A warm sea.  A butler, Trubshaw.  POPS a
	CHAMPAGNE CORK.  From a tent, he brings two glasses down the beach to


363     TWO DIVAN-STYLE DECK CHAIRS

	Where Steed and Emma toast in the sun.  Steed in a smoking jacket, Emma in a bikini.

					EMMA
			I don't recall Siberia being this
			warm, Steed.

					STEED
			It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.

					EMMA
			Our little paradise -- just made
			for two?

					STEED
				(looks; frowns)
			Not quite.

	On cue from the water, Mother emerges, snorkeling in his wheelchair contraption --
	with Brenda.  He waves to --

					STEED
			Our chaperon.

					EMMA
			Pity your mother came, too ...

	Steed seems peeved that his chance to be alone with EMMA is spoiled.  Trubshaw
	pours glasses of champagne.

					STEED
			Still a little warm, Trubshaw.
			Is this the '28? A little more
			ice, I think ...

	Trubshaw trots off dutifully.  A large ice bucket appears.  Mother moves in.  Absorbed
	by Emma, now his new protegee.

					MOTHER
			About your next assignment, Mrs.
			Peel ...

					EMMA
			Next assignment?

	Steed gives his champagne to the Siberian peasant.  He presses a switch -- an umbrella
	shoots up between them, opens up, twirls.

	PULL BACK to reveal the strip of beach, like a tiny bubble of tropical weather. 
	Against a Siberian b.g. of snow.  As we WIDEN we REVEAL a giant glass bubble,
	hearing --

					EMMA (V.O.)
			Ah ... sun tan lotion. Any shops
			nearby?

					STEED (V.O.)
			Must be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll
			send Mother ...

	PULL BACK to reveal no shop for miles around.

					MOTHER (V.O.)
			Ahem. As I was saying, perhaps
			another macaroon ...

					EMMA (V.O.)
			Thank you, Steed.

					STEED (V.O.)
			Thank you, Mrs. Peel.

	Behind the umbrella -- LAUGHTER.  CHINK of GLASSES.

									
			FADE OUT.




					THE END
THE AVENGERS

           THE OTHER (V.O.)
           The Tesseract has awakened. It is on a
           little world. A human world. They would
           wield its power,...

                          CUT TO:
          THE OTHER faces a HORNED SHAPED SHADOW. LOKI. Loki is handed the

           But our ally knows its workings as they
           never will. He is ready to lead. And

          EXT. S.H.I.E.L.D. PROJECT P.E.G.A.S.U.S FACILITY ­ NIGHT

          Out in the NEW MEXICO desert, a remote research facility is in a
          state of panic. It's an evacuation. A SWOOPING helicopter flies
          in.

          CHAOS. Men in suits run around like in the typical `we have to
          leave' fashion. Soldiers on foot jump onto Humvees, accelerating
          the hell out of there. A VOICE bellows from hidden loudspeakers.

          EXT. HELICOPTER PAD ­ CONTINUOUS

          Standing a few yards from the landing pad, A Fed in a suit with
          badass shades, peers at the helicopter as it lands. This is

          SHIELD AGENT PHIL COULSON.

          Walking out of the helicopter is SHIELD AGENT MARIA HILL, SEXY,
          FIERCE AND DETERMINED. Following her, SHIELD DIRECTOR NICK FURY
          climbs out. Hill and Fury approach Agent Coulson.

                          NICK FURY
           How bad is it?

                       AGENT PHIL COULSON
           That's the problem, sir. We don't know.

          INT. FACILITY FLOOR ­ NIGHT

          Agent Coulson leads Hill and Fury through the radiation section
          of the facility. Hundreds of technicians and other staff run
          around, taking only the essentials.

                       AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Dr. Selvig read an energy surge from
           the Tesseract four hours ago.

                          NICK FURY
           NASA didn't authorize Selvig to test
           phase.

                        AGENT PHIL COULSON
           He wasn't testing it, he wasn't even in
           the room. Spontaneous advancement.

                        AGENT MARIA HILL
           It just turned itself on?

                          NICK FURY
           What are the energy levels now?

                        AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Climbing. When Selvig couldn't shut it
           down, we ordered the evac.

                          NICK FURY
           How long to get everyone out?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Campus should be clear in the next half
           hour.

                          NICK FURY
           Do better.

          CONTINUOUSLY HEADING DOWN TO RADIATION FACILITY FLOOR

                         AGENT MARIA HILL
           Sir, evacuation may be futile.

                          NICK FURY
           We should tell them to go back to
           sleep?

                         AGENT MARIA HILL
           If we can't control the Tesseract's
           energy, there may not be a minimum safe
           distance.

                          NICK FURY
           I need you to make sure that PHASE 2
           prototypes are shipped out.

                          AGENT MARIA HILL
           Sir, is that really a priority right
           now?

                          NICK FURY
           Until such time as the world ends, we
           will act as though it intends to spin
           on. Clear out the tech below. Every
           piece of PHASE 2 on a truck and gone.

                          AGENT MARIA HILL
           Yes, sir.
           (to standing agents)
           With me.

          INT. NASA SPACE RADIATION FACILITY, VACUUM CHAMBER ­ CONTINUOUS

          Fury enters the lab facility where the Tesseract is being held
          by a COMPACT MUON SOLENOID COIL CHAMBER.

                          NICK FURY
           Talk to me, doctor.
          DR. ERIK SELVIG emerges from behind the CMS machine, concerned.
          The Tesseract is glowing unusually brighter and flare rings
          shoot out at random.

                          SELVIG
           Director.

                          NICK FURY
           Is there anything we know for certain?

                          SELVIG
           Tesseract is misbehaving.

                          NICK FURY
           Is that supposed to be funny?

                          SELVIG
           No, it's not funny at all. The
           Tesseract is not only active,
           she's...misbehaving.

                          NICK FURY
           How soon until you pull the plug?

                          SELVIG
           She's an energy source. If we turn off
           the power, she turns it back on. If she
           reaches peak level...

                          NICK FURY
           We've prepared for this, doctor.
           Harnessing energy from space.

                          SELVIG
           We don't have the harness. Our
           calculations are far from complete. Now
           she's throwing off interference,
           radiation. Nothing harmful, low levels
           of gamma radiation.

                          NICK FURY
           That can be harmful. Where's Barton?

                          SELVIG
           The Hawk? Up in his nest, as usual.
          We see CLINT BARTON, dressed in black tactical gear, is up on
          the railings watching them below, Fury calls Barton on his
          earpiece.

                          NICK FURY
           Agent Barton, report.
          BARTON rappels down from the catwalk. Walks up to Fury. They
          both walk around the facility in a discreet manner.

                          NICK FURY
           I gave you this detail so you could
           keep a close eye on things.

                          CLINT BARTON
           Well, I see better from a distance.

                          NICK FURY
           Are you seeing anything that might set
           this thing off?

                          NASA SCIENTIST

                          (TO SELVIG)
           Doctor, it's spiking again.

                          CLINT BARTON
           No one's come or gone. It's oven is
           clean. No contacts, no I.M.'s. If there
           was any tampering, sir, it wasn't at
           this end.

                          NICK FURY
           At this end?

                          CLINT BARTON
           Yeah, the cube is a doorway to the
           other end of space, right? The doors
           open from both sides.
          DR. SELVIG clacks away at the keyboard and sees on the
          monitoring his worst nightmares. Suddenly- the Tesseract
          THUNDERS and SHAKES the entire facility. Big enough where both
          Agents Hill and Coulson can feel and they're at different ends
          of the facility.
          The flaring rings and glow of the cube spout out brighter and
          louder, like a boiling pot of water. The Tesseract's energy
          builds up into a BEAM much like the Bifrost Bridge, which HITS
          at the end of a platform that is wired to the CMS device. The
          great maelstrom beam FIRES the TESSERACT energy. The beam then
          forms a VORTEX, which then opens up a PORTAL.
          A BLACK HOLE IS CREATED. From the portal, the blackness of
          SPACE, beautiful and mysterious, strewn with a billion stars
          appears and a GUST of BLUE ENERGY CLOUDS fill the room, blinding
          everyone.
          The Tesseract's energy forms into a cloud that reaches to the
          top the facility's vacuum chamber ceiling. It's abnormally
          quiet. Then... HEAVY BREATHING is heard from the platform.
          SHIELD GUARDS slowly approach, weapons in hands. A figure is
          kneeling on the platform, smoke coming off it. It's LOKI.
          Smiling in his mischievous manner, he raises his head. The smile
          dies down. He looks deep into the eyes of Fury, Barton and
          Selvig. He stands up, holing the scepter.

                          NICK FURY
           Sir, please put down the spear!
          Loki looks at his spear then suddenly points it at where Fury
          and Barton are standing and SHOOTS OUT A BLUE EXPLODING LIGHT
          TOWARDS THEM. BARTON TACKLES Fury and they both barely miss
          Loki's fired shot.
          ALL HELL BREAKS. Machine gun fire is shot at Loki, but the
          bullets bounce off him like a boss. Loki jumps high from the
          platform and ATTACKS those firing at him.
          In the blink of an eye, Loki takes down several guards with his
          KNIVES and ENERGY BLASTS from the scepter. He stops and waits to
          see who will attack him next. Honestly, the whole lab has almost
          gone to shit.
          Barton tries to stand up. Loki quickly walks towards him. Barton
          raises his gun, but Loki grabs Barton's hand.

                          LOKI
           You have heart.
          Loki points the head of his spear at Barton's head. Barton's
          eyes suddenly glow BLACK. The ability to control Barton's mind
          is now in Loki's hand. Barton puts his piece away and stands
          straight.
          As Loki is busy using his abilities to control the minds of
          several S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel, Fury takes the Tesseract,
          placing it back into its case and tries to leave the lab.Then...

                          LOKI
           Please don't. I still need that.

                          NICK FURY

                          (TURNING)
           This doesn't have to get any messier.

                          LOKI
           Of course it does. I've come too far
           for anything else. I am Loki of Asgard,
           and I am burdened with glorious
           purpose.

                          SELVIG
           Loki? Brother of Thor?

                          NICK FURY
           We have no quarrel with your people.

                          LOKI
           An ant has no quarrel with a boot.

                          NICK FURY
           You planning to step on us?

                          LOKI
           I come with glad tidings, of a world
           made free.

                          NICK FURY
           Free from what?

                          LOKI
           Freedom. Freedom is life's great lie.
           Once you accept that, in your heart...
          Like a gunslinger, Loki turns to face Selvig who's
          standingbehind him and places his spear against Selvig's heart.
          Selvig's eyes glow BLACK.

                          LOKI
           You will know peace.

                          NICK FURY
           Yeah, you say peace, I kind of think
           you mean the other thing.
          From the vacuum chamber ceiling, Tesseract's energy cloud
          RAPIDLY builds into what may be an implosion.

                          CLINT BARTON
           Sir, Director Fury is stalling. This
           place is about to blow. Drop a hundred
           feet of rock on us. He means to bury
           us.

                          NICK FURY
           Like The Pharaohs of Odin.

                          SELVIG
           He's right. The portal is collapsing in
           on itself. You got maybe two minutes
           before this goes critical.

                          LOKI
           Well, then...
          Loki, looking at Barton, who doesn't even hesitate, SHOOTS FURY
          WHO FALLS TO THE GROUND. Barton grabs the case containing the
          Tesseract and leaves the lab with Loki, Selvig and the other
          S.H.I.E.L.D personnel Loki is controlling.

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S BUNKER, ENTRANCE OF EXITING TUNNEL ­ NIGHT

          Loki, Barton, Selvig and the other S.H.I.E.L.D personnel are in
          the parking lot of the facility, quickly gathering certain
          weapons. Agent Hill watches in confusion, referring to Loki.

                          CLINT BARTON
           (pointing to the Loki team)
           Need these vehicles.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           Who's that?

                          CLINT BARTON
           He didn't tell me.
          Agent Hill looks suspiciously at them as they get into the truck
          and turns to leave, as she's walking away...

                          NICK FURY
           (through the walkie talkie)
           Hill, do you copy?!
          Loki and Barton SHARPLY look at Agent Hill.

          BACK AT THE LAB
          Fury is sitting up, pulling out the bullet, breathing heavily.

                          NICK FURY
           Barton is...

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S BUNKER ­ NIGHT

          Suddenly, Hill turns to SHOOT AT BARTON, but Barton is already
          POINTING HIS GUN at her and starts SHOOTING, he moves the
          driver's seat of the truck and DRIVES OFF as Hill keeps
          shooting.

          BACK AT THE LAB
          Fury is holding his side, running.

                          NICK FURY
           He's got the Tesseract! Track it down!
          The energy is really brewing a fucking shit storm from the
          vacuum chamber ceiling.

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S BUNKER/TUNNEL ­ NIGHT

          Agent Hill SLIPS into a JEEP and follows after Barton's
          truck.Loki's trucks SCREECH across the tunnel. Several SHIELD
          trucks pull up to them. A drive-by shooting ensues.
          Loki, who stands on top of the bed of the truck, uses his
          scepter and EMITS energy blasts, flipping over SHIELD trucks.
          They get in, the cars roar out after them. Agent Hill puts
          herself at a distance.

          INT. FACILITY FLOOR ­ NIGHT

          Fury races out of the hallway, avoiding falling pipes. The
          entire facility is now in a full earthquake.

          INT. FACILITY FLOOR, ELSEWHERE ­ CONTINUOUS

          Agent Coulson and several SHIELD agents fall down the steps,
          dropping SILVER CASES of information. They attempt to grab them,
          but...

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           No! Leave it!
          They run out of there like a bat from hell.

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S TUNNEL ­ NIGHT

          Agent Hill's JEEP ROARS out of a side of Barton's truck and
          pulls up alongside them on the left. She goes way ahead and
          pulls her brake, swerving into a 360, facing Barton's truck and
          driving in reverse.
          Barton's ARMS reach out the open window and OPENS FIRE. Agent
          Hill figures `fuck it' and SHOOTS her windshield OPENING FIRE on
          Barton.

          EXT. VAN ­ NIGHT

          Agent Coulson jumps into a SHIELD VAN. On his walkie:

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           You're clear, sir! You need to go!

          EXT. HELICOPTER PAD ­ CONTINUOUS

          Fury BOLTS out of the facility and jumps into a helicopter. The
          surface of the pad gives way, PLUNGING the helicopter through
          the surface. But Fury's chopper BARELY makes it out.

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S TUNNEL ­ NIGHT

          Still in a chase and drive-by sequence, Barton's pushes the
          pedal harder, which causes Agent Hill's JEEP to WOBBLE out and
          put her back behind.

          INT. RADIATION FACILITY, VACUUM CHAMBER ­ NIGHT

          The Tesseract's energy cloud now SHRINKS into a SMALL BALL OF
          WHITE LIGHT. Then...

          A CLOUD OF BLUE LIGHT CONSUMES THE ENTIRE FACILITY AND PARTS OF
          THE DESERT. Fury watches from below, a RAPID build-up into what
          may be an implosion. Several miles away, Agent Coulson's van
          feels a JOLT of the Tesseract's BLASTWAVE. THE ENTIRE FACILITY

          SWALLOWS INTO ITSELF-- A TERRIFYING, UNIMAGINABLE IMPLOSION.

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S TUNNEL ­ NIGHT

          The BLASTWAVE of the Tesseract causes the tunnel to cave it.
          Like an ocean wave, blinding crumbles of falling rock, fall onto
          Agent Hill's JEEP, leaving her NEARLY trapped under this blanket
          of rock.
          On the Barton's truck, they escape the tunnel and drive into the
          desert landscape. Fury's helicopter ROARS over Barton's truck.
          Loki looks up.
          From the chopper's door, it slides open and Fury stands there,
          holding a gun, SHOOTING at Barton's, giving an honoring image of

          JULES WINNFIELD.
          Loki looks at Fury and in a fit of RAGE, points his scepter
          SHOOTS OUT THE BLUE LIGHT. The chopper CATCHES on fire, GOING
          DOWN in a FIERY BALL. Fury, like the boss he is, JUMPS OUT and
          touches down onto the desert floor. The chopper BARRELS along
          the ground.
          Fury, coming back to his senses, FIRES at Loki, but they're
          toofar and too late. Loki looks back, smiling. Fury stands
          there, MIND REELING. Then...

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

                          (WALKIE TALKIE)
           Director? Director Fury, do you copy?

                          NICK FURY
           The Tesseract is with the hostile
           force. I have men down. Hill?

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S TUNNEL ­ NIGHT

          Agent Hill climbs out her JEEP, which is sandwiched in, but
          luckily, not her.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           A lot of men still under, don't know
           how many survivors.

          EXT. DESERT ­ NIGHT


                          NICK FURY
           Sound the general call. I want every
           living soul not working rescue looking
           for that brief case.

           AGENT MARIA HILL

                          (WALKIE TALKIE)
           Roger that.

                          NICK FURY
           Coulson, get back to base. This is a
           LEVEL SEVEN. As of right now, we are at
           war.
          A beat.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

                          (WALKIE TALKIE)
           What do we do?
          Fury stands there. Thinking. He looks up. On his face is sign of
          hope.

                         THE AVENGERS

          EXT. RUSSIA, SOLENSKI PLAZA, 3RD FLOOR ­ NIGHT

          Out in the outskirts, near a railroad, a still in construction
          building is being occupied by GEORGI LUCHKOV, a LARGE, RUSSIAN
          GENERAL along with his THUGS.
          TALL THUG is in the middle of a brutal beating on NATASHA
          ROMANOFF, a SLEWING, FOXY, UNBELIEVABLY SEXY SPY. He BACKHANDS
          NATASHA'S face. She feels the pain, but does not breakdown.
          LUCHKOV, smiling, walks up to her. Dialogue is in RUSSIAN.

                          LUCHKOV
           This is not how I wanted the evening to
           go.

                          NATASHA
           I know how you wanted this evening to
           go. Believe me, this is better.

                          LUCHKOV
           I'd like to know why they sent you to
           carry out a carrier, a stained glass
           and other random items.
          TALL THUG rocks her chair back, balancing her off the edge of an
          open floor. Natasha is now scared.

                          NATASHA
           I thought General Soholob was in charge
           of the export business.

                          LUCHKOV
           Soholob? Your reputation is quite a
           progression. THE FAMOUS BLACK WIDOW.
           Nothing but a pretty face.

                          NATASHA
           You really think I'm pretty?
          LUCHKOV slowly walks over to a table filled with tools. He picks
          up a pair of pliers. TALL THUG opens up her mouth wide open.

                          LUCHKOV
           We do not need the Lermontov to
           transfer the tanks. Tell him, well,...

                          (IN ENGLISH)
           You may have to write it down.
          Suddenly, WEASELLY THUG'S cell rings. Confused, he answers.

                          WEASELLY THUG
           Ya?
           (looks at LUCHKOV)
           It's for you.
          LUCHKOV takes the phone, pissed.

                          LUCHKOV
           Who the hell is...

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           You're at 114 Solenski Plaza, 3rd floor.
           We have an F22 exactly 8 miles out. Put
           the woman on the phone or I will blow
           up the block before you can make the
           lobby.
          HOLY SHIT. LUCHKOV places the cell phone against Natasha's ear
          seeing how she's tied to a chair with her hands tied behind her
          back.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           We need you to come in.

                          NATASHA
           Are you kidding? I'm working!

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           This takes precedence.

                          NATASHA
           I'm in the middle of an interrogation
           and this moron is giving me everything.

                          LUCHKOV
           I don't give everything.
          Natasha gives him a look.

                          NATASHA
           Look, you can't pull me out of this
           right now.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Natasha. Barton's been compromised.
          A beat.

                          NATASHA
           Let me put you on hold.
          She nods to LUCHKOV. As Luchkov comes to take the phone off her,
          Natasha HITS him with her leg and HEADBUUTS him. Like a spider,
          she stands up elegantly and starts ATTACKING TALL THUG by
          KICKBOXING him in the face.
          Still tied, she ROLLS over WEASELLY THUG after she trips him.
          She then STOMPS on TALL THUG foot with peg of the chair, then

          KNOCKS HIM OUT WITH HER HEAD.
          Yeah, during all this Coulson is still waiting on the line. She
          then FLIPS over and FALLS down hard on WEASELLY THUG, BREAKING
          THE CHAIR. She sees TALL THUG stand.
          Giving her momentum, she runs at him DROP KICKING him, FALLS
          DOWN and FLIPS right back up and WRAPS HER LEGS AROUND HIS NECK

          AND KNOCKS HIM OUT COLD.
          She grabs LUCHKOV, wraps his leg around with a hanging chain and
          drops him down the open floor, dangling. She picks up the phone
          and her heels, like a boss.

                          NATASHA
           Where's Barton now?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           We don't know.

                          NATASHA
           But he's alive.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           We think so. I'll brief you on
           everything when you get back. But
           first, we need you to talk to the big
           guy.

                          NATASHA
           Coulson, you know that Stark trusts me
           about as far as he can throw me.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           No, I've got Stark. You get the big
           guy.

                          NATASHA
           Bozhe moi.

          EXT. INDIAN SLUM ­ NIGHT

          A LITTLE GIRL runs through the crowd, trying to force a way
          through.

          INT. SHACK ­ NIGHT

          A tiny shack. The LITTLE GIRL runs up the steps, only to be
          stopped by an attending woman. Then, the LITTLE GIRL spots him.
          BRUCE BANNER, their LOCAL doctor.

                          ATTENDING WOMAN
           What are doing here?! Get out! You
           shouldn't be here!

                          LITTLE GIRL
           I have to see the doctor! It's my
           father!

                          BANNER
           Calm down. What's wrong?

                          LITTLE GIRL
           My father...
          Banner looks behind him seeing how the girl is staring at a few
          people, lying down, looking very sick.

                          BANNER
           Is he like them?
          The LITTLE GIRL holds out all the money she has in the world.

                          LITTLE GIRL
           Please.

          EXT. SLUMS ­ CONTINUOUS

          Banner and the LITTLE GIRL hastily run nearly to the edge of
          town. The LITTLE GIRL gets ahead of herself. Banner spots local
          government car, he turns around, blocking any view of him.

          EXT/INT. LITTLE GIRL'S SHACK ­ NIGHT

          Banner quickly follows the LITTLE GIRL inside her house. As he
          walks in, the LITTLE GIRL ESCAPES THROUGH THE WINDOW. Banner is
          left standing there like a dumbass.

                          BANNER
           Should have got paid up front, Banner.
          Natasha then appears from behind the curtains. Banner turns
          around, quietly.

                          NATASHA
           You know, for a man who's supposed to
           be avoiding stress, you picked a hell
           of a place to settle.

                          BANNER
           Avoiding stress isn't the secret.

                          NATASHA
           Then, what is it? Yoga?

                          BANNER
           You brought me to the edge of the city,
           smart. I uh... assume the whole place
           is surrounded?

                          NATASHA
           Just you and me.

                          BANNER
           And your actress buddy, is she a spy
           too? Do they start that young?

                          NATASHA
           I did.

                          BANNER
           Who are you?

                          NATASHA
           Natasha Romanoff.

                          BANNER
           Are you here to kill me, Miss Romanoff?
           Because that's not gonna work out for
           everyone.

                          NATASHA
           No. No. Of course not. I'm here on
           behalf of SHIELD.

                          BANNER
           SHIELD. How did they find me?

                          NATASHA
           We never lost you, doctor. We've kept
           our distance, even helped keep some
           other interested parties off your
           scent.

                          BANNER
           Why?

                          NATASHA
           Nick Fury seems to trust you. But now I
           need you to come in.

                          BANNER
           What if I said no?

                          NATASHA
           I'll persuade you.

                          BANNER
           And what if the... other guy says no?

                          NATASHA
           You've been more than a year without an
           incident. I don't think you wanna break
           that streak.

                          BANNER
           I don't always get what I want.

                          NATASHA
           Doctor, we're facing a potential global
           catastrophe.

                          BANNER
           Well, those I actively try to avoid.

                          NATASHA
           This is the Tesseract. It has the
           potential energy to wipe out the
           planet.
          She shows him a photo of the Tesseract on her cell phone. Banner
          takes a closer look.

                          BANNER
           What does Fury want me to do? Swallow
           it?

                          NATASHA
           Well, he wants you to find it. It's
           been taken. It emits a gamma signature
           that's too weak for us to trace.
           There's no one that knows gamma
           radiation like you do. If there was,
           that's where I'd be.

                          BANNER
           So Fury isn't after the monster?

                          NATASHA
           Not that he's told me.

                          BANNER
           And he tells you everything?

                          NATASHA
           Talk to Fury, he needs you on this.

                          BANNER
           He needs me in a cage?

                          NATASHA
           No one's gonna put you in a...

                          BANNER

           STOP LYING TO ME!
          The THUNDEROUS TONE in is voice makes Natasha QUICKLY grab her
          gun and point it at him, but something is now OFF in the
          atmosphere. Banner stands straight up, smiling.

                          BANNER
           I'm sorry, that was mean. I just wanted
           to see what you'd do. Why don't we do
           this the easy way, where you don't use
           that, and the other guy doesn't make a
           mess? Okay? Natasha...
          Natasha, still wary, doesn't lower her gun. She lowers her gun
          and speaks into her earpiece.

                          NATASHA
           Stand down. We're good here.

          EXT. OUTSIDE THE LITTLE GIRL'S SHACK ­ NIGHT

          Amazingly, DOZENS OF SHIELD AGENTS are surrounding the shack
          outside.

          INT. LITTLE GIRL'S SHACK ­ NIGHT

          Banner looks at Natasha, charming a smile at her.

                          BANNER
           Just you and me?
          Natasha fidgets now that she exposed her guard down.

          INT. SHIELD ANALYTICAL ROOM ­ NIGHT

          Fury is facing several LARGE MONITORS as he as a conference with
          members of the WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           This is out of line, Director. You're
           dealing with forces you can't control.

                          NICK FURY
           You ever been in a war, Councilman? In
           a firefight? Did you feel an
           overabundance of control?

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           You saying that this Asgard has
           declared war on our planet?

                          NICK FURY
           Not Asgard. Loki.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #2
           He can't be working alone. What about
           the other one? His brother.

                          NICK FURY
           Our intelligence says, Thor is not a
           hostile. But he's worlds away, we can't
           depend on him to help. It's up to us.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           Which is why you should be focusing on
           phase 2, it was designed for exactly...

                          NICK FURY
           PHASE 2 isn't ready, our enemy is. We
           need a response team.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           The Avengers Initiative was shut down.

                          NICK FURY
           This isn't about The Avengers.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           We're running the world's greatest
           covert security network and you're
           gonna leave the fate of human race to a
           handful of freaks.

                          NICK FURY
           I'm not leaving anything to anyone. We
           need a response team. These people
           maybe isolated, unbalanced even, but I
           believe with the right push they can be
           exactly what we need.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #2
           You believe?

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           War isn't won by sentiment, Director.

                          NICK FURY
           No, it's won by soldiers.

          INT. BROOKLYN GYM ­ NIGHT

          Somewhere in an old, almost WWII-esque boxing gym, STEVE ROGERS,
          a man out of time, THE FIRST AVENGER, FUCKIN' CAPTAIN AMERICA is
          PUMMELING a punching bag. With every swing, it's like a memory
          he's trying to fight off and repress.

          EXT. HYDRA BASE ­ DAY (FLASHBACK)

          Captain America is running through the forest, dodging mortars,
          gunfire and the Tesseract's energy firearms.

           STEVE (V.O.)
           There's not enough time! I gotta put
           her in the water!

          INT. BROOKLYN GYM ­ NIGHT

          Steve's rage keeps building as he punches the bag. It gets
          harder...

          INT. HORTEN H.XVIII, RED SKULL'S SHIP ­ DAY (FLASHBACK)

          Steve places his COMPASS with an image of PEGGY CARTER. The time
          is here for him to crash the plane.

          INT. BROOKLYN GYM ­ NIGHT

          Steve closes his eyes. Goes at the bag harder.

           PEGGY (V.O.)
           You won't be alone.

          INT. HORTEN H.XVIII, RED SKULL'S SHIP ­ DAY (FLASHBACK)

          The RED SKULL picks up the TESSERACT.

          INT. BROOKLYN GYM ­ NIGHT

          Steve opens his eyes and fuckin' tears the bag as the last
          memory kicks in. I don't think he can physically stop...

           SHIELD SCIENTIST (V.O.)
           Oh my god!

          INT. PROJECT P.E.G.A.S.U.S, ANTARCTICA ­ DAY (FLASHBACK)

          A half frozen Steve Roger is lying down on a medical slab. Two
          SHIELD SCIENTISTS run over hi-tech devices to see if his vitals
          are up. And it seems...

                          SHIELD SCIENTIST
           This guy is still alive!

          INT. BROOKLYN GYM ­ NIGHT

          Steve FUCKING tears the bag open, off its chain, spilling out
          the sand. He stands, breathing hard, letting out 70 years of
          over repressed feeling.
          After taking a few breathers, Steve picks up another punching
          bag, which is laying next another DOZEN BAGS. He hooks the bag
          up and starts punching again. Fury walks in.

                          NICK FURY
           Trouble sleeping?

                          STEVE
           I slept for seventy years, sir. I think
           I've had my fill.

                          NICK FURY
           Then you should be out, celebrating,
           seeing the world.
          Steve stops punching and walks over to the bench, unraveling the
          tape off his hands. He sits down.

                          STEVE
           I went under, the world was at war, I
           wake up, they say we won. They didn't
           say what we lost.

                          NICK FURY
           We've made some mistakes along the way.
           Some very recently.

                          STEVE
           You here with a mission, sir?

                          NICK FURY
           I am.

                          STEVE
           Trying to get me back in the world?

                          NICK FURY
           Trying to save it.
          Fury hands Steve a file on the Tesseract, along with other files
          on HYDRA'S projects.

                          STEVE
           Hydra's secret weapon.

                          NICK FURY
           Howard Stark fished that out of the
           ocean when he was looking for you. He
           thought what we think, the Tesseract
           could be the key to unlimited
           sustainable energy. That's something
           the world sorely needs.

                          STEVE
           Who took it from you?

                          NICK FURY
           He's called Loki. He's not from around
           here. There's a lot we'll have to bring
           you up to speed on if you're in. The
           world has gotten even stranger than you
           already know.

                          STEVE
           At this point, I doubt anything would
           surprise me.

                          NICK FURY
           Ten bucks says you're wrong. There's a
           debriefing package waiting for you back
           at your apartment.
          Steve turns and picks up a punching bag. Starts walking out of
          the gym.

                          NICK FURY
           Is there anything you can tell us about
           the Tesseract that we ought to know
           now?

                          STEVE
           You should have left it in the ocean.

          INT. OCEAN ­ NIGHT

          Out in the Atlantic Ocean, TONY STARK, in his IRON MAN suit, is
          cutting a PIPELINE TRANSPORT with a laser cutter coming from his
          hand. He then places a STARK ENERGY REACTOR. It lights up. IRON
          MAN rockets out of the water and flies towards STARK TOWER.

                          TONY
           You're good on this end. The rest is up
           to you.

                          PEPPER POTTS
           (on the other line)
           You disconnected the transition lines?
           Are we off the grid?

          INSIDE THE SUIT -- PEPPER APPEARS ON HIS HUD MONITOR.

                          TONY
           Stark Tower is about to become a beacon
           of self-sustaining clean energy.

                          PEPPER
           Wow. So maybe our reactor takes over
           and it actually works?

                          TONY
           I assume. Light her up.
          As IRON MAN flies to the STARK TOWER BUILDING, the power is
          switched on and the STARK sign LIGHTS UP.

                          PEPPER
           How does it look?

                          TONY
           Like Christmas, but with more... me.

                          PEPPER
           Gotta go wider on the public awareness
           campaign. You need to do some press. I
           can do some more tomorrow. I'm working
           on the zoning for the next billboards.

                          TONY
           Pepper, you're killing me. Remember?
           Enjoy the moment.

                          PEPPER
           Then get in here and I will.
          TONY arrives at his skyscraper penthouse and is in the process
          of taking off his IRON MAN suit through a hi-tech gauntlet of
          gadgets.

                          JARVIS
           Sir, Agent Coulson of SHIELD is on the
           line.

                          TONY
           I'm not in. I'm actually out.

                          JARVIS
           Sir, I'm afraid he's insisting.

                          TONY
           Close the line Jarvis. I got a date.

          INT. TONY'S PENTHOUSE ­ NIGHT

          PEPPER POTTS stares up at the monitors of the reactor device.

                          PEPPER
           Levels are holding steady... I think.

                          TONY
           Of course they are, I was directly
           involved. Which brings me to my next
           question: how does it feel to be a
           genius?

                          PEPPER
           Well, ha, I really wouldn't know now,
           would I?

                          TONY
           What do you mean? All this came from
           you.

                          PEPPER
           No. All this came from that.
          Points to the energy in his chest plate.

                          TONY
           Give yourself some credit, please.
           Stark Tower is your baby. Give
           yourself... twelve percent of the
           credit.

                          PEPPER
           Twelve percent?

                          TONY
           An argument can be made for fifteen.

                          PEPPER
           Twelve percent? For my baby?

                          TONY
           Well, I did do all the heavy lifting.
           Literally, I lifted the heavy things.
           And sorry, but the security snafu? That
           was on you.

                          PEPPER
           Oooooh.

                          TONY
           My private elevator...

                          PEPPER
           You mean OUR elevator?

                          TONY
           ...was teeming with sweaty workmen. I'm
           going to pay for that comment about
           percentages in some subtle way later,
           aren't I?
          Pepper pours herself and Tony a glass of champagne.

                          PEPPER
           Not gonna be that subtle.

                          TONY
           I'll tell you what. Next building's
           gonna say 'Potts' on the tower.

                          PEPPER
           On the lease.

                          TONY
           ...Call your mom, can you bunk over?

                          JARVIS
           Sir, the telephone. I'm afraid my
           protocols are being overwritten.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Stark, we need to talk. Tony picks up
           his phone and looks into it at Coulson.

                          TONY
           You have reached the life model decoy
           of Tony Stark, please leave a message.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           This is urgent.

                          TONY
           Then leave it urgently.
          At that moment the elevator door opens and Coulson appears.

                          TONY
           Security breach.

                          (TO PEPPER)
           That's on you.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Mr. Stark.

                          PEPPER
           Phil! Come in.

                          TONY
           Phil? Uh, his first name is Agent.

                          PEPPER
           Come on in, we're celebrating.

                          TONY
           Which is why he can't stay.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           We need you to look this over.
           (he holds out a file towards

                          STARK)
           Soon as possible.

                          TONY
           I don't like being handed things.

                          PEPPER
           That's alright, `cause I love to be
           handed things. So, let's trade.
          She passes her glass of champagne to Coulson and takes the file
          from him, then takes her champagne glass back from Coulson and
          passes the file over to Stark.

                          PEPPER
           Thank you.

                          TONY
           Official consulting hours are between
           eight and five every other Thursday.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           This isn't a consultation.

                          PEPPER
           Is this about The Avengers? Which I...I
           know nothing about.

                          TONY
           The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I
           thought. And I didn't even qualify.

                          PEPPER
           I didn't know that either.

                          TONY
           Yeah, apparently I'm volatile, self-
           obsessed, don't play well with others.

                          PEPPER
           That I did know.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           This isn't about personality profiles
           anymore.

                          TONY
           Whatever. Miss Potts, got a minute?
          Pepper walks over to Tony who places the files into his own
          databases.

                          TONY
           You know, I thought we were having a
           moment.

                          PEPPER
           I was having twelve percent of a
           moment. This seems serious, Phil's
           pretty shaken.

                          TONY
           How did you notice? Why is he Phil?

                          PEPPER
           What is all of this?

                          TONY
           This is, uh...
          Tony EXPANDS his arms and different profiles appear in
          holographic form floating in the air in front of Tony and
          Pepper.

                          TONY
           This.
          Screens appear of CAPTAIN AMERICA IN ACTION, the HULK ROARING AS

          HE ATTACKS THE ARMY AT CULVER UNIVERSITY, THOR FIGHTING THE
          DESTROYER and another is of Loki and the Tesseract, to which
          Stark and Pepper look on in awe.

                          PEPPER
           I'm going to take the jet to D.C.
           tonight.

                          TONY
           Tomorrow.

                          PEPPER
           You've got homework. You've got a lot
           of homework.

                          TONY
           Well, what if I didn't?

                          PEPPER
           If you didn't?

                          TONY
           Yeah.

                          PEPPER
           You mean if you finished?
           (Stark nods his head)
           Well, um...then...
          She whispers something in his ear. Tony GASPS. Coulson looks
          away in embarrassment.

                          TONY
           Square deal. It's the last date.
          Pepper kisses him.

                          PEPPER
           Work hard.
          As Pepper leaves with Agent Coulson, Tony grabs the Tesseract in
          holograph form, worried.

          INT. QUINJET ­ DAY

          Inside the QUINJET, Steve is sitting down, holding a TABLET,
          watching the footage of the Hulk's attack on the Army at Culver
          University.

                          PILOT
           We're about forty minutes out from
           base, sir.
          Agent Coulson stands up from his seat and walks over to Steve.

                          STEVE
           So, this Doctor Banner was trying to
           replicate the serum that was used on
           me?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           A lot of people were. You were the
           world's first superhero. Banner thought
           gamma radiation might hold the key to
           unlocking Erskine's original formula.
          The Hulk roars with fury as he slams a jeep apart.

                          STEVE
           Didn't really go his way, did it?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Not so much. When he's not that thing
           though, guy's like a Stephen Hawking.
          Steve looks confused.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           He's like a smart person. I gotta say,
           it's an honor to meet you, officially.
          Steve smiles at Coulson.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           I sort of met you, I mean, I watched
           you while you were sleeping.
          Steve looks down. He stands up, closes his laptop and walks to
          the side with Coulson following.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           I mean, I was... I was present while
           you were unconscious from the ice. You
           know, it's really, it's just a... just
           a huge honor to have you on board.

                          STEVE
           Well, I hope I'm the man for the job.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Oh, you are. Absolutely. Uh... we've
           made some modifications to the uniform.
           I had a little design input.

                          STEVE
           The uniform? Aren't the stars and
           stripes a little... old fashioned?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           With everything that's happening, the
           things that are about to come to light,
           people might just need a little old
           fashioned.
          Steve takes in Coulson's sentiment.

          INT. UNDERGROUND LAB ­ DAY

          Several soldiers under Loki's mind control run around, preparing
          to infiltrate whatever Loki has planned. Loki sits down,
          watching Selvig work with a CMS device. Loki meditates, until...

          EXT. THRONE ROOM ­ NIGHT

          ...the scepter materializes him back into the throne room of THE
          OTHER, fully armed in his horned helmet and armor. THE OTHER
          appears from the steps.

                          THE OTHER
           The Chitauri grow restless.

                          LOKI
           Let them go at themselves. I will lead
           them into glorious battle.

                          THE OTHER
           Battle? Against the meager might of
           Earth?

                          LOKI
           Glorious, not lengthy. If your force is
           as formidable as you claim.

                          THE OTHER
           You question us? You question HIM? He,
           who put the scepter in your hand, who
           gave you ancient knowledge and new
           purpose when you were cast out,
           defeated?

                          LOKI
           I was a king! The rightful king of
           Asgard! Betrayed!

                          THE OTHER
           Your ambition is little, born of
           childish need. We look beyond the Earth
           to greater worlds the Tesseract will
           unveil.

                          LOKI
           You don't have the Tesseract yet.
          THE OTHER runs over to attack him, but stops as Loki points his
          scepter.

                          LOKI
           I don't threaten, but until I open the
           doors, until your force is mine to
           command, you are but words.

                          THE OTHER
           You will have your war, Asgardian. If
           you fail, if the Tesseract is kept from
           us, there will be no realm, no barren
           moon, no crevice where he can't find
           you. You think you know pain? He will
           make you long for something as sweet as
           pain.
          THE OTHER places his hand on Loki's head and transports him back
          to Earth. Loki looks around, menacing.

          EXT. HELICARRIER LANDING STRIP ­ DAY

          The QUINJET lands down a MASSIVE BATTLESHIP known as the
          HELICARRIER. It has two runways. One with direct access to a
          hangar at the rear is aligned along the spine of the vessel.
          Agent Coulson and Steve walk down the ramp, meeting up with
          Natasha.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Agent Romanoff. Captain Rogers.

                          STEVE
           Ma'am?

                          NATASHA
           Hi.

                          (TO COULSON)
           They need you on the bridge. Face time.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           See you there.
          Agent Coulson walks away leaving Steve with Natasha, walking
          towards the railing of the ship.

                          NATASHA
           There was quite the buzz around here,
           finding you in the ice. I thought
           Coulson was gonna swoon. Did he ask you
           to sign his Captain America trading
           cards yet?

                          STEVE
           Trading cards?

                          NATASHA
           They're vintage, he's very proud.
          Without realizing, Banner doesn't notice them walking as he
          isnervous as hell. He moves around as people keep walking in
          hisway.

                          STEVE
           Dr. Banner.
          Steve walks up to Banner and shakes his hands.

                          BANNER
           Oh, yeah. Hi. They told me you'd be
           coming.

                          STEVE
           Word is you can find the cube.

                          BANNER
           Is that the only word on me?

                          STEVE
           Only word I care about.

                          BANNER
           (takes in the sentiment)
           Must be strange for you, all of this.

                          STEVE
           Well, this is actually kind of
           familiar.

                          NATASHA
           Gentlemen, you may wanna step inside in
           a minute. It's gonna get a little hard
           to breath.
          Suddenly the HELICARRIER starts SHAKING as it prepares to fly
          "sail."

                          STEVE
           Is this is a submarine?

                          BANNER
           Really? They wanted me in a submerged
           pressurized metal container?
          They both move closer to the edge of the HELICARRIER. FOUR HUGE

          LIFT FANS MOUNTED ON THE SIDES STARTS TO LIFT INTO THE AIR IN
          VTOL FLIGHT. Steve watches in AWE as Banner smiles.

                          BANNER

           OH, NO. THIS IS MUCH WORSE.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY

          The doors part and we enter THE BRIDGE OF THE SHIP ­ a flurry of
          activity ­ dozens of agents sit in front of their VIEWSCREENS.
          Agent Hill shouts her instructs to leave. Turns to NICK FURY,
          who is at the command chair.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           We're at lock, sir.

                          NICK FURY
           Good. Let's vanish.

          EXT. SKY

          The HELICARRIER rises high into the heavens. Suddenly, the
          entire ship is covered in reflecting mirrors, which then
          camouflages in the sky.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ CONTINUOUS

          Steve and Banner walk through the glorious, gleaming bridge,
          taking his position at the SCIENCE CONSOLE.

                          NICK FURY
           Gentlemen.
          Steve gives Fury 10 bucks, referring to his earlier statement
          about never being surprised again. Fury walks over Banner and
          extends his hand. Banner, reluctantly shakes it.

                          NICK FURY
           Doctor, thank you for coming.

                          BANNER
           Thanks for asking nicely. So, uh... how
           long am I staying?

                          NICK FURY
           Once we get our hands on the Tesseract,
           you're in the clear.

                          BANNER
           Where are you with that?
          Nick Fury turns to Agent Coulson to explain, while Natasha
          Romanoff eyes an image of Clint Barton on a computer screen.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           We're sweeping every wirelessly
           accessible camera on the planet.
           Cellphones, laptops. If it's connected
           to a satellite, it's eyes and ears for
           us.

                          NATASHA
           That's still not gonna find them in
           time.

                          BANNER
           You have to narrow the field. How many
           spectrometers do you have access to?

                          NICK FURY
           How many are there?

                          BANNER
           Call every lab you know, tell them to
           put the spectrometers on the roof and
           calibrate them for gamma rays. I'll
           rough out a tracking algorithm based on
           cluster recognition. At least we could
           rule out a few places. Do you have
           somewhere for me to work?

                          NICK FURY
           Agent Romanoff, would you show
           Dr.Banner to his laboratory, please.
          Natasha nods and walks off, leading Banner down the hall.

                          NATASHA
           You're gonna love it, Doc. We got all
           the toys.

          INT. UNDERGROUND LAB, VACUUM ROOM ­ DAY

          Selvig and several scientists work around the CMS device.
          Bartonwalks in, holding a tablet.

                          SELVIG
           Put it over there!

                          (TO BARTON)
           Where did you find all these people?

                          CLINT BARTON
           SHIELD has not shortage of enemies,
           Doctor.
          He holds up a screen showing information on IRIDIUM.

                          CLINT BARTON
           Is this the stuff you need?

                          SELVIG
           Yeah, iridium. It's found in
           meteorites, it forms anti-protons. It's
           very hard to get hold of.

                          CLINT BARTON
           Especially if SHIELD knows you need it.

                          SELVIG
           Well, I didn't know!
           (sees Loki coming)
           Hey! The Tesseract is showing me so
           much. It's more than just knowledge,
           it's... truth.

                          LOKI
           I know. What did it show you, Agent
           Barton?

                          CLINT BARTON
           My next target.

                          LOKI
           Tell me what you need.

                          CLINT BARTON
           I'll need a distraction.
           (grabs his bow)
           And an eyeball.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ NIGHT

          As they are waiting to locate Loki using satellite facial
          recognition, Coulson and Steve stand side by side, waiting.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           I mean, if it's not too much trouble.

                          STEVE
           No, no. It's fine.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           It's a vintage set. It took me a couple
           of years to collect them all. Near
           mint, slight foxing around the edges,
           but...

           AGENT JASPER SITWELL
           We got a hit. Sixty-seven percent
           match. Weight, cross match, seventy-
           nine percent.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Location?

           AGENT JASPER SITWELL
           Stuttgart, Germany. 28, Konigstrasse.
           He's not exactly hiding.

                          NICK FURY
           Captain, you're up.
          Steve nods. Leaves.

          EXT. STUTTGART MUSEUM ­ NIGHT

          Loki standing in front of the museum, dressed in 21st century
          attire and with the scepter, disguised as a cane, walks up to
          the entrance of the gala.

          INT. STUTTGART GALA ­ NIGHT

          Inside, a lavished gala with an orchestra playing, is
          interrupted as the HEAD DOCTOR walks up to the mic.

          INT. HELICARRIER, STEVE'S LOCKER ­ NIGHT

          Steve walks into his own locker room. As he approaches to the
          steel cabinet, the doors already reveal the updated CAPTAIN
          AMERICA UNIFORM, along with the famous SHIELD. He stands in
          silence.

          EXT. STUTTGART MUSEUM ­ NIGHT

          Outside the museum, GERMAN GUARDS stand in their positions. One
          of them is standing on top of the roof, scoping. He then hears a

          THWACK!
          He looks down. One of his guards is shot with an ARROW. He
          raises his gun. He is shot dead by an arrow. Falls down. Barton
          and his CREW arrive at the doors of the locked science building.
          Barton looks at the retinal scanner. He pulls out a SHIELD eye
          scanner instrument.

          INT. STUTTGART GALA ­ NIGHT

          Loki looks from above the museum and descends down to where the
          HEAD DOCTOR is. As he makes it down and near the stage, he FLIPS
          his cane the other end. The guard there notices him, pulls out
          his gun, but Loki CLUBS his head in. CHAOS ERUPTS.
          Guests begin to leave the museum. Loki grabs the doctor and
          flips him over onto a marble table of the mythological creatures
          BILCHSTEIM. Loki pulls out an OPTICAL TORTURE DEVICE. He PLUNGES
          down the doctor's eye. The doctor TWISTS in pain.

          EXT. STUTTGART MUSEUM ­ NIGHT

          Suddenly, from Barton's instrument, a holographic eye of the
          head doctor appears and the image of the doctor appears on
          screen.
          The doors to the facility open. Barton walks in and finds in a
          cabinet, a glass thermos with a cylinder of iridium.

          EXT. STUTTGART GALA ­ NIGHT

          As the crowd runs away, Loki slowly walks out and materializes
          in his gold armor and helmet. The POLICE arrive and with no
          hesitation, he BLASTS the cars, FLIPPING them over and over.

                          LOKI
           Kneel before me.
          The crowd ignores him. Another LOKI appears, blocking the crowd.
          Loki after Loki appears, they all grin as they raise their
          spears, encircling the crowd.

                          LOKI
           I said. KNEEL!!!
          Everyone becomes quiet and kneels in front him. Loki embracing
          his arms out, smiling.

                          LOKI
           Is not this simpler? Is this not your
           natural state? It's the unspoken truth
           of humanity, that you crave
           subjugation. The bright lure of freedom
           diminishes your life's joy in a mad
           scramble for power, for identity. You
           were made to be ruled. In the end, you
           will always kneel.
          As the words resonate to the kneeling crowd, an ELDER GERMAN MAN
          refuses to kneel and stands, heroic.

           ELDER GERMAN MAN
           Not to men like you.

                          LOKI
           There are no men like me.

           ELDER GERMAN MAN
           There are always men like you.

                          LOKI
           Look to your elder, people. Let him be
           an example.
          Loki is about to execute him with his scepter as the light GLOWS
          blue. Just as the ENERGY BEAM shoots out, FUCKING CAPTAIN
          AMERICA arrives! He dives in just in time and BLOCKS the blast
          with his SHIELD, knocking down Loki on his ass.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           You know, the last time I was in
           Germany and saw a man standing above
           everybody else, we ended up
           disagreeing.

                          LOKI

                          (STANDING UP)
           The soldier. A man out of time.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           I'm not the one who's out of time.
          From above Cap, the QUINJET arrives. A machine gun is pointed
          towards Loki.

                          NATASHA
           Loki, drop the weapon and stand down.
          Like greased lighting, Loki sends a BLAST of blue at the
          QUINJET. Natasha MANEUVERS it just in time, giving Cap the time
          to throw his shield at Loki. They both begin to DUKE IT OUT.
          Loki FLINGS Cap to the ground. Cap then throws his shield, but
          Loki SWATS it way. Cap, using all the moves of a boxer, is
          KNOCKED down by Loki. Standing over him, he points the scepter's
          tip on his helmet.

                          LOKI
           Kneel.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Not today!
          Cap FLIPS and KNOCKS him out with his leg. Loki grabs him and
          FLIPS him over.

          INT. QUINJET ­ NIGHT


                          NATASHA
           The guy's all over the place.
          Suddenly, AC/DC's "Shoot to Thrill" overdrives the QUINJET'S
          speakers.

                          IRON MAN
           Agent Romanoff, did you miss me?
          Both Cap and Loki look up at the sky. Tony flies over in his
          IRON MAN suit and blasts Loki right back to the ground. IRON MAN
          touches down. He stands up and pulls out every piece of weaponry
          the suit has.

                          IRON MAN
           Make your move, Reindeer Games.
          Loki puts up his hands and surrenders. His armor materializes
          away.

                          IRON MAN
           Good move.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Mr. Stark.

                          IRON MAN
           Captain.

          INT. QUINJET ­ NIGHT

          Natasha watches the skies. THUNDER. Coming out of nowhere. Fury
          speaks over her headset.

           NICK FURY (V.O.)
           Said anything?

                          NATASHA
           Not a word.

           NICK FURY (V.O.)
           Just get him here. We're low on time.
          With Loki tied up and cuffed to his seat, Tony and Steve watch
          from a distance, whispering.

                          STEVE
           I don't like it.

                          TONY
           What? Rock of Ages giving up so easily?

                          STEVE
           I don't remember it being ever that
           easy. This guy packs a wallop.

                          TONY
           Still, you are pretty spry, for an
           older fellow. What's your thing?
           Pilates?

                          STEVE
           What?

                          TONY
           It's like calisthenics. You might have
           missed a couple things, you know, doing
           time as a Capsicle.
          Steve looks at Tony, finally meeting his ego match.

                          STEVE
           Fury didn't tell me he was calling you
           in.

                          TONY
           Yeah, there's a lot of things Fury
           doesn't tell you.
          THUNDER and LIGHTNING nearly hit the jet, making it shake
          violently.

                          NATASHA
           Where's this coming from?
          Thunder RUMBLES overhead. Loki stares out the window intently.

                          STEVE
           What's the matter? Scared of a little
           lightning?

                          LOKI
           I'm not overly fond of what follows.
          What the fuck? OUTSIDE THE JET A BLINDING LIGHT hits the jet.
          Not a light. A King.
          THE MIGHTY THOR. Thor OPENS the ramp and grabs Loki by the
          throat and flies out. Steve and Tony are left dumbstruck. Tony
          puts the IRON MAN helmet on.

                          IRON MAN
           Now there's that guy.

                          NATASHA
           Another Asgardian?

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Think the guy's a friendly?

                          IRON MAN
           Doesn't matter. If he frees Loki or
           kills him, the Tesseract's lost.
          Tony turns and gets ready to jump off the jet to chase after
          Thor.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Stark, we need a plan of attack!

                          IRON MAN
           I have a plan. Attack.
          IRON MAN jumps out of the jet and chases after Thor. Cap grabs a
          parachute to follow.

                          NATASHA
           I'd sit this one out, Cap.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           I don't see how I can.

                          NATASHA
           These guys come from legends, they're
           basically gods.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           There's only one God, ma'am. And I'm
           pretty sure he doesn't dress like that.
          Cap JUMPS OUT of the jet.

          EXT. MOUNTAIN LEDGE ­ NIGHT

          Somewhere out in the European mountains, Thor throws Loki into
          the side of the mountain. He raises the mighty hammer, MJÖLNIR.
          He looks down at his brother, who he thought to be dead and is
          angry to see him alive in this fashion.

                          THOR
           Where is the Tesseract?

                          LOKI

                          (LAUGHS)
           I missed you too.

                          THOR
           Do I look to be in a gaming mood?!

                          LOKI
           Oh, you should thank me. With the
           Bifrost gone how much dark energy did
           the Allfather have to muster to conjure
           you here? Your precious Earth.
          Thor drops MJÖLNIR, causing the mountain to quake. He picks up
          Loki. His brother.
          Although Thor is pissed for what he has done, a family is
          everything to a man or god.

                          THOR
           I thought you dead.

                          LOKI
           Did you mourn?

                          THOR
           We all did. Our father...

                          LOKI
           Your father. He did tell you my true
           parentage, did he not?
          Thor lets go Loki, who walks away from Thor, causing an even
          bigger wedge between them.

                          THOR
           We were raised together, we played
           together, we fought together. Do you
           remember none of that?

                          LOKI

                          (TURNS AROUND)
           I remember a shadow. Living in the
           shade of your greatness. I remember you
           tossing me into an abyss. I was and
           should be king!

                          THOR
           So you take the world I love as
           recompense for your imagined slights.
           No, the Earth is under my protection,
           Loki.

                          LOKI

                          (LAUGHS)
           And you're doing a marvelous job with
           that. The humans slaughter each other
           in droves, while you idly threat. I
           mean to rule them. And why should I
           not?

                          THOR
           You think yourself above them.

                          LOKI
           Well, yes.

                          THOR
           Then you miss the truth of ruling,
           brother. Throne would suit you ill.
          Angrily, Loki shoves his brother to the side. He walks back up
          to the ledge. Turns around.

                          LOKI
           I've seen worlds you've never known
           about! I have grown, Odinson, in my
           exile! I have seen the true power of
           the Tesseract, and when I wield it...

                          THOR
           Who showed you this power? Who controls
           the would-be-king?

                          LOKI
           I am a king!

                          THOR
           Not here! You give up the Tesseract!
           You give up this poisonous dream! You
           come home.

                          LOKI
           I don't have it. You need the cube to
           bring me home, but I've sent it off I
           know not where.
          Mjölnir flies back to his grasp.

                          THOR
           You listen well, brother. I...

          THOR IS KNOCKED OFF THE MOUNTAIN BY IRON MAN WHO TACKLES HIM IN

          MID-FLIGHT.

                          LOKI
           I'm listening.

          EXT. FOREST ­ CONTINUOUS

          THOR and IRON MAN CRASH into the forest. Thor rolls himself up.
          IRON MAN is still standing, but keeps his distance. The helmet
          opens up.

                          THOR
           Do not touch me again!

                          TONY
           Then don't take my stuff.

                          THOR
           You have no idea what you're dealing
           with.

                          TONY
           Shakespeare in the park? Doth mother
           know you weareth her drapes?

                          THOR
           This is beyond you, metal man. Loki
           will face Asgardian justice!

                          TONY
           He gives up the Cube, he's all yours.
           Until then, stay out of my way...
           tourist.
          The IRON MAN helmet clamps up and he walks away. In one quick
          move, Thor pulls Mjölnir, throws it, and KNOCKS IRON MAN clear
          across into a tree.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          TONY
           Okay.
          From the mountain side, Loki watches in amusement. Thor raises
          his hand. Mjölnir flies back to his hand. Thor SWINGS the
          hammer, summoning a ray of energy.
          IRON MAN stands up and from his HAND BOOSTERS, a BLAST of ENERGY
          KNOCKS the MIGHTY AVENGER on his ass. IRON MAN flies back up and
          knocks Thor into a tree. Right back at you, bitch!
          Thor, kneeling on the ground, pulls Mjölnir to his hand, raises
          it to the skies and pulls in LIGHTING and THUNDER! Thor points
          the hammer at IRON MAN and the outpouring of bolts lighting
          increases in intensity. IRON MAN falls back.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          JARVIS
           Power at 400% capacity.

                          TONY
           How about that?
          IRON MAN FIRES AWAY FROM HIS HAND BOOSTERS, pushing Thor to his
          knees. Like two gunslingers ready to draw, both Thor and IRON
          MAN fly towards each other and meet in the middle and ascend up.

          EXT. SKY ­ NIGHT

          The two battle. IRON MAN grasps THOR, elbowing him and SMASHING
          him into the side of a mountain.
          THOR LEAPS off the mountain and takes IRON MAN with him.

          EXT. FOREST ­ CONTINUOUS

          THOR and IRON MAN crash right back down, smashing down every
          tree possible. IRON MAN YANKS Thor right up. Thor grabs both
          HANDS BOOSTERS and begins to CRUSH them. Tony quickly CHARGES as
          much energy as he can and SHOOTS ENERGY in Thor's face.
          Thor FALLS back, losing his stance. IRON MAN HEADBUTTS Thor,
          with his gold-titanium alloy helmet. Thor... HEADBUTTS him with
          his fuckin' head and actually sends IRON MAN across the forest.
          IRON MAN boosters up and flies back at Thor, grabbing him by the
          arm and cape and SWINGS him into another tree. Thor looks up,
          ready. Thor runs with all his patience out the window. IRON MAN
          SWINGS and MISSES, giving Thor the momentum to grab him, lift
          him and SMASH him down hard.
          Thor summons back Mjölnir to his hand. Just as he's about to put
          the hammer down, IRON MAN uses his HAND BOOSTERS to SKID across
          the ground and trip Thor over. Standing up, Thor looks for him,
          but from behind him, IRON MAN CRASHES into his back. Thor stands
          facing IRON MAN. Ready to pounce...
          CAPTAIN AMERICA'S shield RICOCHETS off both Thor and IRON MAN,
          stopping them. They look up and see CAPTAIN AMERICA standing on
          top of a fallen tree with the shield back in hand.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Hey! That's enough!
           (comes down; looks at Thor)
           Now, I don't know what you plan on
           doing here.

                          THOR
           I've come here to put an end to Loki's
           schemes!

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Then prove it! Put the hammer down.

                          IRON MAN
           Um, yeah, no! Bad call! He loves his
           hammer!

          THOR BACKHANDS IRON MAN LIKE A PIMP WITH MJÖLNIR.
          Thor, losing all tolerance with this SENTENTIAL OF LIBERTY,
          raises the hammer.

                          THOR

                          (TO CAP)
           You want me to put the hammer down?

          THOR LEAPS HIGH INTO THE AIR, RAISING THAT FUCKING HAMMER.
          CAPTAIN AMERICA CROUCHES DOWN and HOLDS UP HIS SHIELD. THOR
          brings that hammer down onto the shield and a MASSIVE IMPLOSION
          OF LIGHT reacts to the vibranium shield creating a MASSIVE

          SHOCKWAVE THAT BLOWS UP ANYTHING STANDING WITHIN A MILE.
          IRON MAN stands up, looking around like `holy shit.' Lying right
          next to him is Cap, who never takes his eye off Thor. Thor looks
          at both men.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Are we done here?

          THOR, CAPTAIN AMERICA AND IRON MAN STAND THERE.

          INT. HELICARRIER HALLWAY ­ NIGHT

          DOZENS of SHIELD POLICE escort Loki, who is in handcuffs,
          smiling. As they pass the HELICARRIER LAB, Banner stops working
          on the CHITAURI SCEPTER and looks up. Loki eyes him as he walks,
          nodding and smiling. BANNER rubs his head.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION ­ NIGHT

          Loki is now free from his cuffs and is contained in a LARGE
          GLASS CELL held by HYDRAULIC RIGS. Fury walks up the control
          panel of the cell.

                          NICK FURY
           In case it's unclear. You try to
           escape. You so much as scratch that
           glass.
          Fury presses a button which OPENS UP a HATCH underneath Loki's
          cell. Loki peers as much as he can from the glass.
          Without seeing, the sounds of GUSTING WIND would make man shit
          his pants. Not a god, though.

                          NICK FURY
           Thirty thousand feet, straight down in
           a steel trap. You get how that works?!
          Fury closes the hatch. Points at Loki.

                          NICK FURY
           Ant.
          Then points at the button which would drop Loki into the steel

           Boot.

                          LOKI

                          (SMIRKING)
           It's an impressive cage. Not built, I
           think, for me.

                          NICK FURY
           Built for something a lot stronger than
           you.

                          LOKI
           Oh, I've heard.
          Loki looks into the camera.

          INT. BRIEFING ROOM ­ CONTINUOUS

          The others watch on the monitor Loki getting interrogated.
          Banner looks at the monitor, intently.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION ­ CONTINUOUS


                          LOKI
           The mindless beast, makes play he's
           still a man. How desperate are you,
           that you call upon such lost creatures
           to defend you?

                          NICK FURY
           How desperate am I? You threaten my
           world with war. You steal a force you
           can't hope to control.

                          (MORE)

           NICK FURY (CONT'D)
           You talk about peace and you kill
           `cause it's fun. You have made me very
           desperate. You might not be glad that
           you did.

                          LOKI
           Ooh. It burns you to come so close. To
           have the Tesseract, to have power,
           unlimited power. And for what? A warm
           light for all mankind to share, and
           then to be reminded what real power is.

                          NICK FURY

                          (SMILING)
           Well, you let me know if Real Power
           wants a magazine or something.
          Fury walks off leaving Loki in his glass cell. Loki looks back
          at the camera, smirking.

          INT. BRIEFING ROOM ­ CONTINUOUS

          Steve watches until the monitor goes black. Thor, who didn't
          even look, just listened, stands there, torn apart. They all
          just stand there in stunned SILENCE. Finally --

                          BANNER
           He really grows on you, doesn't he?

                          STEVE
           Loki's gonna drag this out. So, Thor,
           what's his play?

                          THOR

                          (COMING TOO)
           He has an army called the Chitauri.
           They're not of Asgard or any world
           known. He means to lead them against
           your people. They will win him the
           earth. In return, I suspect, for the
           Tesseract.

                          STEVE

                          (SERIOUSLY)
           An army? From outer space?

                          BANNER
          So he's building another portal. That's
          what he needs Erik Selvig for.

                          THOR
          Selvig?

                          BANNER
          He's an astrophysicist.

                          THOR
          He's a friend.

                          NATASHA
          Loki has him under some kind of spell,
          along with one of ours.

                          STEVE
          I wanna know why Loki let us take him.
          He's not leading an army from here.

                          BANNER
          I don't think we should be focusing on
          Loki. That guy's brain is a bag full of
          cats, you could smell crazy on him.

                          THOR
          Have care how you speak. Loki is beyond
          reason, but he is of Asgard, and he's
          my brother.

                          NATASHA
          He killed eighty people in two days.

                          THOR
          He's adopted.

                          BANNER
          Iridium, what did they need the Iridium
          for?

                          TONY
          It's a stabilizing agent.
           (walks in with Coulson; to

                          COULSON)
          I'll fly you there. Keep the love
          alive. Means the portal won't collapse
          on itself, like it did at SHIELD.

                          TONY (CONT'D)

                          (TO THOR)
           No hard feelings, Point Break. You've
           got a mean swing.
           (referring to the Iridium)
           Also, it means the portal can open as
           wide, and stay open as long, as Loki
           wants.

                          (TO CREW)
           Uh, raise the mid-mast, ship the top
           sails. That man is playing GALAGA!
           Thought we wouldn't notice. But we did.
           (covering his eye, looks

                          AROUND)
           How does Fury do this?

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           He turns.
          Tony looks around the monitors and places a BUTTON SIZE HACKING
          IMPLANT under Fury's desk, without anyone noticing.

                          TONY
           Well, that sounds exhausting. The rest
           of the raw materials, Agent Barton can
           get his hands on pretty easily. Only
           major component he still needs is a
           power source. A high energy density,
           something to kick start the cube.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           When did you become an expert in
           thermonuclear astrophysics?

                          TONY
           Last night. The packet, Selvig's notes,
           the Extraction Theory papers. Am I the
           only one who did the reading?

                          STEVE
           Does Loki need any particular kind of
           power source?

                          BANNER
           He's got to heat the cube to a
           hundredand twenty million Kelvin just
           to break through the Coulomb barrier.

                          TONY
           Unless, Selvig has figured out how to
           stabilize the quantum tunneling effect.

                          BANNER
           Well, if he could do that he could
           achieve Heavy Ion Fusion at any reactor
           on the planet.

                          TONY
           Finally, someone who speaks English.

                          STEVE
           Is that what just happened?
          Tony and Banner shake hands. A glimmer in their eyes shines as
          the mutual respect for each other shows.

                          TONY
           It's good to meet you, Dr. Banner.
           You're work on anti-electron collisions
           is unparalleled. And I'm a huge fan of
           the way you lose control and turn into
           an enormous green rage monster.

                          BANNER

                          (LOOKS DOWN)
           Thanks.

                          NICK FURY

                          (WALKING IN)
           Dr. Banner is only here to track the
           cube. I was hoping you might join him.

                          STEVE
           Let's start with that stick of his. It
           may be magical, but it works an awful
           lot like a HYDRA weapon.

                          NICK FURY
           I don't know about that, but it is
           powered by the cube. And I'd like to
           know how Loki used it to turn two of
           the sharpest men I know into his
           personal flying monkeys.

                          THOR
           Monkeys? I do not understand.

                          STEVE
           I do! I understood that reference.
          Tony rolls his eyes, while Cap looks proud of himself.

                          TONY
           Shall we play, doctor?

                          BANNER
           Let's play some.
          As Banner and Tony walk out, the GALAGA PLAYER turns ever so
          discreetly, watches as everyone else disperses and goes back to
          playing.

          INT. BANNER'S LAB - NIGHT (LATER)

          Banner continuously scans with a gamma ray detection scanner on
          the scepter for radiation.
          Tony looks at his monitors, shifting and solving as many
          algorithms and equations.

                          BANNER
           The gamma readings are definitely
           consistent with Selvig's reports on the
           Tesseract. But it's gonna take weeks to
           process.

                          TONY
           If we bypass their mainframe and direct
           a reroute to the Homer cluster, we can
           clock this around six hundred
           teraflops.

                          BANNER
           All I packed was a tooth brush.

                          TONY

                          (SMILES)
           You know, you should come by STARK
           TOWERS sometime. Top ten floors, all
           R&D. You'd love it, it's candy land.

                          BANNER
           Thanks, but the last time I was in New
           York I kind of broke...Harlem.

                          TONY
           Well, I promise a stress free
           environment. No tension. No surprises.
          Suddenly, Tony pokes Banner with a MINIATURE ELECTRICAL PROD.
          Steve walks in on them, pissed at Tony.

                          BANNER

           OW!
          Tony looks at Banner closely.

                          TONY
           Nothing?

                          STEVE

                          (TO BANNER)
           Hey! Are you nuts?

                          TONY
           You really have got a lid on it,
           haven't you? What's your secret? Mellow
           jazz? Bongo drums? Huge bag of weed?

                          STEVE
           Is everything a joke to you?

                          TONY
           Funny things are.

                          STEVE
           Threatening the safety of everyone on
           this ship isn't funny. No offense,
           doctor.

                          BANNER
           No, it's alright. I wouldn't have come
           aboard if I couldn't handle pointy
           things.

                          TONY
           You're tiptoeing, big man. You need to
           strut.

                          STEVE
           And you need to focus on the problem,
           Mr. Stark.

                          TONY
           You think I'm not? Why did Fury call us
           and why now? Why not before? What isn't
           he telling us? I can't do the equation
           unless I have all the variables.

                          STEVE
           You think Fury's hiding something?

                          TONY
           He's a spy. Captain, he's the spy. His
           secrets have secrets.
           (points to Banner)
           It's bugging him too, isn't it?

                          BANNER
           (bobbling the words)
           Uh...I just wanna finish my work here
           and...

                          STEVE
           Doctor?
          A beat.

                          BANNER
           'A warm light for all mankind, Loki's
           jab at Fury about the cube.

                          STEVE
           I heard it.

                          BANNER
           (pointing at Tony)
           Well, I think that was meant for you.
           Even if Barton didn't post that all
           over the news.

                          STEVE
           The Stark Tower? That big ugly
           (Tony gives him a look)
           ...building in New York?

                          BANNER
          It's powered by Stark Reactors, self-
          sustaining energy source. That building
          will run itself for what, a year?

                          TONY
          That's just the prototype. I'm kind of
          the only name in clean energy right
          now.

                          BANNER
           (referring to Tony)
          So, why didn't SHIELD bring him in on
          the Tesseract project? I mean, what are
          they doing in the energy business in
          the first place?

                          TONY
          I should probably look into that once
          my decryption programmer finishes
          breaking into all of SHIELD's secure
          files.

                          STEVE
           (taken by that)
          I'm sorry, did you say...?

                          TONY
          Jarvis has been running it since I hit
          the bridge. In a few hours we'll know
          every dirty secret SHIELD has ever
          tried to hide.
           (holds out a bag of blueberries)
          Blueberry?

                          STEVE
          Yet you're confused about why they
          didn't want you around?

                          TONY
          An intelligence organization that fears
          intelligence? Historically, not
          possible.

                          STEVE
           I think Loki's trying to wind us up.
           This is a man who means to start a war,
           and if don't stay focused, he'll
           succeed. We have orders, we should
           follow them.

                          TONY
           Following is not really my style.

                          STEVE

                          (SMILING)
           And you're all about style, aren't you?

                          TONY
           (a nerve hit)
           Of the people in this room, which one
           is; A. wearing a spangly outfit, and B.
           not of use?

                          BANNER
           Steve, tell me none of this smells a
           little funky to you?
          Steve takes in the possibility, but as an obedient soldier,
          shakes it off.

                          STEVE
           Just find the cube.
          Steve walks out of the lab. Still torn apart by the possibility,
          he walks away, towards the HULL of the ship.

          BACK IN THE LAB

                          TONY
           That's the guy my dad never shut up
           about? Wondering if they shouldn't have
           kept him on ice.

                          BANNER
           The guy's not wrong about Loki. He does
           have the jump on us.

                          TONY
           What he's got is an ACME dynamite kit.

                          TONY (CONT'D)
           It's gonna blow up in his face, and I'm
           gonna be there when it does.

                          BANNER
           And I'll read all about it.

                          TONY
           Uh-huh. Or you'll be suiting up like
           the rest of us.

                          BANNER
           Ah, see. I don't get a suit of armor.
           I'm exposed, like a nerve. It's a
           nightmare.

                          TONY
           You know, I've got a cluster of
           shrapnel, trying every second to crawl
           its way into my heart.
           (points at the MINI-ARC
           REACTOR in his chest)
           This stops it. This little circle of
           light. It's part of me now, not just
           armor. It's a... terrible privilege.

                          BANNER
           But you can control it.

                          TONY
           Because I learned how.

                          BANNER
           It's different.
          Banner tries to read the computer screen, but Tony slides the
          data aside with his finger so the two can see face-to-face.

                          TONY
           Hey, I've read all about your accident.
           That much gamma exposure should have
           killed you.

                          BANNER
           So you're saying that the Hulk... the
           other guy... saved my life?

                          (MORE)

                          BANNER (CONT'D)
           That's nice. It's a nice sentiment.
           Saved it for what?

                          TONY

                          (A BEAT)
           I guess we'll find out.
          Banner and Stark get back to work at their respective computers.

                          BANNER
           You might not like that.

                          TONY
           You just might.

          INT. HULL HANGAR, SECURE STORAGE 10-C ­ NIGHT

          Steve, with all his MIGHT, slides the HEAVY IRON door and
          STEALTHILY walks in. SECURE STORAGE 10-C is a large warehouse,
          filled with METAL CRATES stacked.
          Steve looks up, seeing another level. He LEAPS up high and holds
          onto the catwalk railing. Steve continues to move forward.

          INT. VAN ­ NIGHT

          Inside this particular van, Selvig and a few other SOLDIERS are
          driving inside a long tunnel. With the CMS device inside, Selvig
          carefully picks up the small cylinder shape IRIDIUM with metal
          prongs and lightly places it a SLOT within the CMS. THE CMS
          ACCEPTS IT. Selvig looks at it, devilishly smiling.

          INT. BRIEFING ROOM ­ NIGHT

          On a SHIELD monitor is a photo and record of JANE FOSTER. Thor
          looks at her, remembering. With him is Agent Coulson.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           As soon as Loki took the doctor we
           moved Jane Foster. We've got an
           excellent observatory in Traunsee. She
           was asked to consult there very
           suddenly yesterday. Handsome fee,
           private plane, very remote. She'll be
           safe.

                          THOR
           Thank you. It's no accident Loki taking
           Erik Selvig. I dread what he plans for
           him once he's done. Erik is a good man.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           He talks about you a lot. You changed
           his life. You changed everything around
           here.

                          THOR
           They were better as they were. We
           pretend on Asgard that we're more
           advanced, but we...we come here
           battling like BILCHSTEIM.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Like what?

                          THOR
           BILCHSTEIM? You know; huge, scaly, big
           antlers. You don't have those?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Don't think so.

                          THOR
           They are repulsive, and they trample
           everything in their path.
          Thor walks over to the side of the ship and looks out the
          window, lamenting about what has happened and what may come.

                          THOR
           When I first came to earth, Loki's rage
           followed me here and your people paid
           the price. And now again. In my youth I
           courted war.

           NICK FURY (O.S.)
           War hasn't started yet.

                          (WALKING IN)
           You think you can make Loki tell us
           what the Tesseract is?

                          THOR
           I do not know. Loki's mind is far
           afield, it's not just power he craves,
           it's vengeance upon me. There's no pain
           that would prize his need from him.

                          NICK FURY
           A lot of guys think that, until the
           pain stops.

                          THOR
           What are you asking me to do?

                          NICK FURY
           I'm asking. What are you prepared to
           do?

                          THOR
           Loki is a prisoner.

                          NICK FURY
           Then why do I feel like he's the only
           person on this boat that wants to be
           here?
          Thor doesn't answer.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION ­ NIGHT

          Loki walks back and forth inside his glass cell. Suddenly, he
          stops.

                          LOKI
           There's not many people that can sneak
           up on me.
           (turns to see NATASHA

                          STANDING THERE)

                          NATASHA
           But you figured I'd come.

                          LOKI
           After. After whatever tortures Fury can
           concoct, you would appear as a friend,
           as a balm. And I would cooperate.

                          NATASHA
          I wanna know what you've done to Agent
          Barton.

                          LOKI
          I'd say I've expanded his mind.

                          NATASHA
          And once you've won. Once you're king
          of the mountain. What happens to his
          mind?

                          LOKI
          Is this love, Agent Romanoff?

                          NATASHA
          Love is for children. I owe him a debt.

                          LOKI

                          (SITTING DOWN)
          Tell me.

                          NATASHA
           (she pulls up a chair as

                          WELL)
          Before I worked for SHIELD, I
          uh...well, I made a name for myself. I
          have a very specific skillset. I didn't
          care who I used it for, or on. I got on
          SHIELD's radar in a bad way. Agent
          Barton was sent to kill me, he made a
          different call.

                          LOKI
          And what will you do if I vow to spare
          him?

                          NATASHA
          Not let you out.

                          LOKI

                          (LAUGHS)
          Ah, no. But I like this. Your world in
          the balance, and you bargain for one
          man?

                          NATASHA
           Regimes fall every day. I tend not to
           weep over that, I'm Russian... or was.

                          LOKI
           What is it you want?

                          NATASHA
           It's really not that complicated. I've
           got red in my ledger, I'd like to wipe
           it out.

                          LOKI
           Can you? Can you wipe out that much
           red? DRAKOV'S daughter? SÃO PAULO? THE
           HOSPITAL FIRE? Barton told me
           everything. Your ledger is dripping,
           it's gushing red, and you think saving
           a man no more virtuous than yourself
           will change anything?

                          (STANDING; ANGRY)
           This is the basest sentimentality. This
           is a child at prayer... PATHETIC!

                         INTERCUTS
          - Tony and Banner continuously work at their monitors.

           LOKI (V.O.)
           You lie and kill in the service of
           liars and killers.
          - Agent Hill checks every VIEWSCREEN in the bridge. Fury
          oversees.

           LOKI (V.O.)
           You pretend to be separate, to have
           your own code, something that makes up
           for the horrors. But they are a part of
           you, and they will never go away!
          - Steve opens a STEEL crate. Angry, he looks behind him and
          looks back into the crate. THE CRATE IS FILLED WITH AN ARRAY OF

          HYDRA WEAPONS.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION ­ NIGHT

          Loki SLAMS his cell, making Natasha FLINCH.

                          LOKI
           I won't touch Barton. Not until I make
           him kill you! Slowly. Intimately. In
           every way he knows you fear! And when
           he'll wake just long enough to see his
           good work, and when he screams, I'll
           split his skull! This is my bargain,
           you mewling quim!
          NATASHA turns around, walks away from Loki, disgusted.

                          NATASHA

                          (QUIETLY; DISTRAUGHT)
           You're a monster.

                          LOKI

                          (LAUGHS)
           No, you brought the monster.

                          NATASHA
           (turns back around; poised)
           So, Banner... that's your play.

                          LOKI

                          (STAGGERED)
           What?

                          NATASHA

                          (ON EARPIECE)
           Loki means to unleash the Hulk. Keep
           Banner in the lab, I'm on my way. Send
           Thor as well.

                          (TO LOKI)
           Thank you for your cooperation.
          Natasha quickly walks out, leaving Loki frozen.

          INT. BANNER'S LAB ­ MORNING

          Fury walks in SURPRISED to see Tony and Banner stop working on
          the scepter.

                          NICK FURY

                          (ANGRY)
           What are you doing, Mr. Stark?

                          TONY
           Uh...kind of been wondering the same
           thing about you.

                          NICK FURY
           You're supposed to be locating the
           Tesseract.

                          BANNER
           We are. The model's locked and we're
           sweeping for the signature now. When we
           get a hit, we'll have the location
           within half a mile.

                          TONY
           And you'll get your cube back, no muss,
           no fuss.
           (suddenly his monitor show a
           collection of SECRET FILES)
           What is PHASE 2?
          Suddenly, Steve drops a HYDRA ASSAULT RIFLE on the table causing
          Fury, Banner and Tony to turn around. Cap looks pissed.

                          STEVE
           PHASE 2 is SHIELD uses the cube to make
           weapons.

                          (TO TONY)
           Sorry, the computer was moving a little
           slow.

                          NICK FURY
           (trying to explain)
           Rogers, we gathered everything related
           to the Tesseract. This does not mean
           that we're...

                          TONY
           I'm sorry, Nick.
          Tony moves the computer screen towards Fury which shows plans of

          THE WEAPONS.

                          TONY
           What were you lying?

                          STEVE
           I was wrong, director. The world hasn't
           changed a bit.
          At that moment, Thor and Natasha walk into the lab. Natasha
          keeps her eyes right on Banner. Banner looks at her, PISSED.

                          BANNER
           Did you know about this?

                          NATASHA
           You wanna think about removing yourself
           from this environment, doctor?

                          BANNER
           I was in Calcutta, I was pretty well
           removed.

                          NATASHA
           Loki's manipulating you.

                          BANNER
           And you've been doing what exactly?

                          NATASHA
           You didn't come here because I bat my
           eyelashes at you.

                          BANNER
           Yes, and I'm not leaving because
           suddenly you get a little twitchy. I'd
           like to know why SHIELD is using the
           Tesseract to build weapons of mass
           destruction.

                          NICK FURY
           Because of him.
           (pointing at Thor)

                          THOR

                          (STUNNED)
           Me?

                          NICK FURY
          Last year earth had a visitor from
          another planet who had a grudge match
          that leveled a small town. We learned
          that not only are we not alone, but we
          are hopelessly, hilariously, outgunned.

                          THOR
          My people want nothing but peace with
          your planet.

                          NICK FURY
          But you're not the only people out
          there, are you? And, you're not the
          only threat. The world's filling up
          with people who can't be matched, they
          can't be controlled.

                          STEVE
          Like you controlled the cube?

                          THOR
          You're work with the Tesseract is what
          drew Loki to it, and his allies. It is
          the signal to all the realms that the
          earth is ready for a higher form of
          war.

                          STEVE
          A higher form?

                          NICK FURY
          You forced our hand. We had to come up
          with something.

                          TONY
          Nuclear deterrent. `Cause that always
          calms everything right down.

                          NICK FURY
          Remind me again how you made your
          fortune, Stark?

                          STEVE TONY
          I'm sure if he still made Wait! Wait! Hold on! How is
          weapons, Stark would be neck this now about me?
          deep... I'm sorry, isn't THOR
          everything?
           I thought humans were more
           evolved than this.

                          NICK FURY
           Excuse me, did WE come to YOUR planet
           and blow stuff up?

                          THOR
           Did you always give your champions such
           mistrust?

                          NATASHA BANNER
          Are you all really that Captain America is on
          naive? S.H.I.E.L.D monitors potential threat potential
          threats? watch list?

                          TONY STEVE
           (to Steve) I swear to God, Stark, one
          You're on that list? Are you more crack...
          above or below angry bees?
          Threatening! I feel
          threatened!
          As the "team" argues, they don't realize the BLUE GEM on Loki's
          scepter is glowing brightly.

          INT. AIRCRAFT CARRIER ­ DAY

          Outside the HELICARRIER, a lone carrier slowly hovers over the
          ship.

           SHIELD BASE VOICE
           661 Bravo, please relay your pass code.
           What is your hull, over?

                          BARTON
           Arms to ammunition, over.
          Inside, BARTON and his crew suit up and arm themselves. Barton
          pulls out his hi-tech bow and arrows.

          INT. BANNER'S LAB ­ MORNING

          Back in the lab, the egos of these people keeping rubbing off
          each other and at any moment, the shit will hit the fan.

                          THOR
           You speak of control, yet you court
           chaos.

                          BANNER
           It's his M.O., isn't it? I mean, what
           are we, a team? No, no, no. We're a
           chemical mixture that makes chaos.
           We're... we're a time-bomb.

                          NICK FURY
           You need to step away.

                          TONY
           (puts his arm around Steve)
           Why shouldn't the guy let off a little
           steam?

                          STEVE
           (pushes Tony off)
           You know damn well why! Back off!

                          TONY
           (comes face-to-face with Cap)
           Oh, I'm starting to want you to make
           me.

                          STEVE
           Big man in a suit of armor. Take that
           off, what are you?

                          TONY
           Genius, billionaire, playboy,
           philanthropist.

                          STEVE
           I know guys with none of that worth ten
           of you. Yeah, I've seen the footage.

                          (MORE)

                          STEVE (CONT'D)
           The only thing you really fight for is
           yourself. You're not the guy to make
           the sacrifice play, to lay down on a
           wire and let the other guy crawl over
           you.

                          TONY
           I think I would just cut the wire.

                          STEVE

                          (SMILING)
           Always a way out... You know, you may
           not be a threat, but you better stop
           pretending to be a hero.

                          TONY
           (that did it)
           A hero? Like you? You're a lab rat,
           Rogers. Everything special about you
           came out of a bottle!

          OUTSIDE THE HELICARRIER
          The ramp of the carrier opens. The carrier maneuvers next to one
          of the large turbine engines. Barton stands at the base, holding
          out his bow. He pulls out a GRENADE TIPPED ARROW. He points
          right at the engine.
          Then...Barton moves his AIM and points the arrow about a hundred
          feet from the engine. He releases. The arrow flies out,but then
          SHARPLY heads for the engine. The arrow is punctured onto the
          engine. It has a visible timer which is COUNTING DOWN.

          INT. BANNER'S LAB ­ MORNING

          Back in the lab, Steve puffs up his chest at Tony, who just
          stands there, unmoving.

                          STEVE
           Put on the suit, let's go a few rounds.
          Thor laughs at them.

                          THOR
           You people are so petty... and tiny.
          Tony rubs his head. Moves away from Cap.

                          BANNER
           Yeah, this is a tee...

                          NICK FURY
           Agent Romanoff, would you escort
           Dr.Banner back to his...

                          BANNER
           Where? You rented my room.

                          NICK FURY
           The cell was just in case...

                          BANNER
           In case you needed to kill me, but you
           can't! I know! I tried!

                          (A BEAT)
           I got low. I didn't see an end, so I
           put a bullet in my mouth and the other
           guy spit it out! So I moved on. I
           focused on helping other people. I was
           good, until you dragged me back into
           this freak show and put everyone here
           at risk!
          Banner slowly gets upset as he looks at Romanoff, who gets
          unnerved.

                          BANNER
           You wanna know my secret, Agent
           Romanoff? You wanna know how I stay
           calm?
          BLACK WIDOW and Fury have their hands down to grab their guns.

                          STEVE
           Doctor Banner... put down the scepter.

          BANNER LOOKS DOWN AND IS SHOCKED TO SEE HE'S HOLDING LOKI'S
          SCEPTER. The computer beeps. They all turn to it.

                          TONY
           Got it.
          Banner puts down the scepter and walks over to the computer.

                          BANNER
           Sorry, kids. You don't get to see my
           little party trick after all.

                          THOR
           Located the Tesseract?

                          TONY
           I can get there faster.

                          STEVE
           Look, all of us...

                          THOR
           The Tesseract belongs on Asgard, no
           human is a match for it.
          Tony turns to leave, but Steve stops him.

                          STEVE
           You're not going alone!

                          TONY
           You gonna stop me?

                          STEVE
           Put on the suit, let's find out.

                          TONY
           I'm not afraid to hit an old man.

                          STEVE
           Put on the suit.
          At that moment Banner who's looking at the monitor notices
          something about the Tesseract.

                          BANNER
           Oh, my God!

          OUTSIDE THE HELICARRIER
          Barton PULLS THE TRIGGER ON HIS BOW. The arrow then EXPLODES THE

          ENGINE RIGHT OFF THE HELICARRIER!

          INT. BANNER'S LAB ­ MORNING

          Everyone is thrown in every direction. Steve, Fury, Thor and
          Tony are thrown across while Natasha and Banner is down in the
          lower equipment room. Steve looks up at Tony.

                          STEVE
           Put on the suit!

                          TONY
           Yep!
          Steve helps Tony up and out of the lab. Fury sits up, clutching
          his ribs. He puts on his EARPIECE.

                          NICK FURY
           Hill?!

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY

          PANDEMONIUM ERUPTS. Emergency alarms set off, fire extinguishers
          activate near surrounding fires and every agent is in a spinning
          scramble for their positions and armaments. Agent Hill keeps the
          bridge as calm as possible.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           Turn up that engine! Number 3 engine is
           down! Can we get a run in?
           (runs over to GALAGA PLAYER)
           Talk to me.

                          GALAGA PLAYER
           (points to monitor)
           Turbine's loose. Mostly intact, but
           it's impossible to get out there and
           make repairs while we're in the air.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           We lose one more engine, we won't be.
           Somebody's got to get inside and patch
           that engine.

          INT. BANNER'S LAB ­ MORNING


                          NICK FURY
           Stark! You copy that?!

           TONY (V.O.)
           I'm on it!

                          NICK FURY
           Coulson! Initiate official lock down in
           the detention section then get to the
           armory! Move out!

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY

          Agent Coulson runs out of the bridge.

          INT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER ­ MORNING

          Natasha looks over to Banner, who is breathing heavy, having
          landed hard. He is gripping the grated floor to maintain
          control, but his eyes are green, his face intense.

                          NATASHA (CONT'D)
           (quietly, to herself)
           I'm okay. We're okay, right?

          EXT. HELICARRIER DECK ­ DAY

          Barton leads his men into the air ducts of the ship. They rappel
          down into a corridor.

                          BARTON
           Get that engine down! Detention! Get
           him through the dark! Come with me.
          Two of his men follow him. They head towards the bridge.

          EXT. ND HALLWAY, CARRIER ­ MORNING

          Tony and Cap run through a dim, debris filled hall.

                          TONY
           Find engine three. I'll meet you there.
          Cap peels off as Tony approaches a tech room. Inside, Tony's
          IRON MAN suit stands waiting, lit above in all its glory.

          INT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER ­ CONTINUOUS

          ON BANNER'S FACE in the dim light as he struggles to suppress
          the rage, but his face is growing, changing slowly.
          Natasha is pulling herself painfully free, talking to Banner...

                          NATASHA
           Doctor... Bruce, you gotta fight it.
           This is just what Loki wants. We're
           gonna be okay. Listen to me.
          Two approaching SHIELD soldiers arrive to check on her. She
          furiously WAVES them away. They bolt out of there.

                          NATASHA
           We're gonna be okay. Right? I swear on
           my life I will get you out of this, you
           will walk away, and never...

                          BANNER
           Your life?
          His voice has the change in it -- the bitter amusement is
          morphing to a growled threat. Another explosion rocks the
          carrier -- and he turns to look at her, transforming just as the
          lights go out.

                          NATASHA

                          (PLEADING)
           Bruce.
          Banner suddenly starts transforming into the HULK and gives
          Natasha one last knowing look. Natasha STRUGGLES FREE of the
          rubble. She stops.
          The HULK, sensing her, turns his head and puts on a face of a
          disturb monster. Natasha JOLTS up the stairs with the HULK
          chasing after her. Natasha maneuvers like a black widow should.
          She rolls under a turbine, starts to crawl within the maze of
          pipes. The HULK pulls them out from above the catwalk.
          Natasha falls through under the catwalks and quickly and
          stealthily escapes. The HULK lets out a ROAR OF RAGE unlike
          anything. PRIMAL. Not human.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION ­ DAY

          Loki looks up, smiling mischievously.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY

          Fury RUNS in and sees the chaos has increased even more than
          before. The HELMSMAN is in complete disarray.

                          NICK FURY
           Bring the carrier inwards and head
           south. Take us to the water.

                          HELMSMAN
           Why water? Navigations recalibrated
           after the engine failure.

                          NICK FURY
           Is the sun coming up?!

                          HELMSMAN
           Yes, sir.

                          NICK FURY
           Then put it on the left! Get us over
           water! One more turbine goes down and
           we drop.

          EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE ­ DAY

          CAPTAIN AMERICA, pushing with all his strength the door to
          portside, sees SHIELD tech in full oxygen masks shoot fire
          extinguishers and cover from sparks -- largely unable to do
          anything.
          Engine 3 is totally dead. A LARGE CHUNK of the port side in TORN

          OFF.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Stark, I'm here!

                          TONY
           Good. See what we got.
          Tony flies in his IRON MAN suit and gets close to the damaged
          engine.

          INSIDE THE SUIT
          Tony observes within his viewscreen at the damaged engine and
          its layouts.

                          TONY
           I gotta get this super conducting
           cooling system back online before I can
           access the rotors and work on
           dislodging the debris.

          EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE ­ DAY

          IRON MAN begins PULLING on the stuck rotors. Looks over atSteve.

                          IRON MAN
           I need you to get to that engine
           control panel and tell me which relays
           are in overload position.
          IRON MAN flies into giant cooling conductors. CAPTAIN AMERICA
          JUMPS over to the other side of the broken railing. CAPTAIN
          AMERICA gets himself to the control panel and opens it up. For a
          man who grew up as a YANK, what the fuck is this!

                          IRON MAN
           What's it look like in there?

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           It seems to run on some form of
           electricity.

                          IRON MAN
           Well, you're not wrong.

          INT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER ­ DAY

          Natasha continuously crawls under the catwalk. She stops.
          Then...BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. The room vibrates. Rhythmically.
          Natasha pulls out her gun and slowly walks out onto the catwalk
          and spins.
          ...and then a ROAR. THE HULK. Natasha FIRES a shot into a liquid
          nitrogen pipe that hits the hulk in face. The HULK SMASHES THE
          SHIT OUT OF IT. Natasha begins to run through the maze of
          corridors. The sound the monster is coming.
          Finally, she reaches and a long corridor. As she runs, behind
          her, the HULK TEARS up the hallway, coming at her.
          Natasha turns to see, but the HULK SLAPS her into the wall,

          SMASHING INTO THE GROUND.
          The HULK marks his territory. Natasha looks up. A fear she has
          never felt begins to seep out. The HULK raises his hand and IS
          KNOCKED OFF HIS FEET BY THOR WHO TACKLES HIM INTO the next room.

          INT. HELICARRIER AIRCRAFT PORT ­ CONTINUOUS

          Both Thor and HULK roll across the floor. Every person runs the
          hell out. Thor looks up at this magnificent beast. The HULK
          stands up and moving like a boxer, wants Thor to make his move.
          The HULK makes his move.
          SWING AND A MISS. Thor swings his massive hand and almost knocks
          HULK off his feet. HULK keeps swinging and missing, pissing him
          off. Finally, he brings down his arm, but Thor grabs it and
          wraps around it.

                          THOR
           We are not your enemies, Banner! Try to
           think!
          HULK lifts his arm up, to Thor's surprise, and he SENDS HIM

          FLYING AS HE PUNCHES THOR'S FACE WITH HIS FIST.

          EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE ­ DAY

          IRON MAN continuously BLASTS broken debris off the turbine
          engine. It's bad, but still fixable.

           CAPTAIN AMERICA (V.O.)
           The relays are intact. What's our next
           move?

                          TONY
           Even if I clear the rotors, this thing
           won't re-engage without a jump. I'm
           gonna have to get in there and push.

          EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE ­ DAY


                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Well if that thing gets up to speed,
           you'll get shredded!

                          TONY
           Then stay in the control unit and
           reverse polarity long enough to
           disengage mag...

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Speak English!

                          TONY
           See that red lever? It'll slow the
           rotors down long enough for me to get
           out. Stand by it, wait for my word.
          CAPTAIN AMERICA looks over at the other side where he was. He
          sees the red lever and JUMPS towards it.

          INT. HELICARRIER AIRCRAFT PORT ­ DAY

          Thor CRASHES into another stack of crates. As he raises his
          head, he feels something on his lips. BLOOD. As he swipes it
          off, the ROAR of the HULK is not too far. Thor extends his hand
          out.
          The ROAR gets LOUDER and CLOSER. Thor focuses. His hand strains
          toward mid-air. His eyes tight in concentration. The HULK runs
          right at him. At the last second, MJÖLNIR flies into his hand
          and Thor UPPERCUTS HULK, WHO CRASHES INTO A FIGHTER JET.
          HULK stands up, shaking his head like `what the fuck just
          happened.' He SHAKES it off and ANGRILY rips off the TAIL of the
          jet, TORQUES HIS BODY LIKE A GREEK DISCUS THROWER AND... HURLS

          THE MASSIVE PLATE AT THOR.
          Thor SLIDES and DUCKS under the tail. Jumping up, he throws
          Mjölnir with all his strength, knocking the HULK head over
          heels. HULK falls down, hammer in hand. HE tries to lift it, but
          can't. Mjölnir rests atop his hand.
          Struggle as he may, HULK wraps his hand around the hammer. The
          hammer doesn't move. To no avail -- he strains with all his
          might, SCREAMS from the effort, BELLOWING.
          Thor jumps up again, KNEEING HULK in the face. Thor grabs his
          hammer, jumps on him, using the hammer as a lock for his
          CHOKEHOLD. Hulk tries to pull him off.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY

          Fury and Agent Hill look over their monitors.

                          NICK FURY
           We need a full evac on the lower hangar
           bay.
          Agent Hill nods. She leaves to exit out, but a SLIDING GRENADE
          appears.

           AGENT MARIA HILL

           GRENADE!
          The grenade goes off, sending her down the steps. Fury FIRES a
          shot at the open entrance. He moves over behind the side of the
          entrance. A handful of Barton's men enter. Watchful, ready,
          waiting... Fury steps out, his GUN drawn.
          A SHOOT OUT and HAND-TO-HAND ensues, but Fury is unable to stop
          one of them, which is why he is shot in the head by Agent Hill,
          who looks hot and sexy holding her gun.

          INT. HELICARRIER ARMORY SECTION ­ DAY

          Agent Coulson walks up the armory door. He places his head into
          a FACIAL RECOGNITION SCANNER. Walks into the room.

           AGENT JASPER SITWELL (V.O.)
           We got perimeter breach! Hostiles are
           in SHIELD gear. Hold on to every
           junction.

          INT. HELICARRIER AIRCRAFT PORT ­ DAY

          HULK CRASHES from under the floor, sending Thor on his ass. HULK
          grabs him by the neck.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY

          A gunfight opens up. AGENTS exchange fire with brutally
          efficient tactical soldiers.

           AGENT JASPER SITWELL (V.O.)
           Sir, the HULK and Thor are in shuttle
           levels 2, 3 and 4!

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           Sir, the Hulk will tear this place
           apart!

                          NICK FURY
           Get his attention.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           (on her EARPIECE)
           Escort 606, proceed to 270 MAIN
           SHUTTLE! Don't get too close.

          ESCORT 606 PILOT slowly makes his way in. sees the action going
          between Thor and the HULK.

           Target acquired. Target engaged.
           (pulls the trigger; fires
           guns at HULK)
          A SHOWER OF BULLETS SPRAYS THE HULK EVERYWHERE. Thor ducks for
          cover. The HULK turns around, letting out his PRIMAL ROAR. He
          jumps up, TAKES A RUNNING START AND LEAPS...

          ESCORT 606 PILOT LOOKS LIKE HE TOOK A SHIT.

                          ESCORT 606 PILOT

           TARGET ANGRY! TARGET ANGRY!
          HULK LANDS ON THE JET'S NOSE. THE JET SPINS WILDLY. As the HULK
          tears it apart, ESCORT 606 PILOT pulls his ejection seat, but

          HOLD THE FUCKIN' DOOR!

          THE HULK CATCHES HIM, WAVES HIM AROUND AND THEN THROWS HIM AWAY.
          ESCORT 606 PILOT pulls his parachute. THE JET EXPLODES. THE HULK

          PLUMMETS TO EARTH, ROARING HIS SWAN SONG.

          EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE ­ DAY

          IRON MAN laser cuts a big piece of broken metal. He then JUMPS
          on it, relieving the rotors.
          On the other side, BARTON'S men enter the port side. CAPTAIN
          AMERICA looks down, pondering if they are help. Evidently not as
          they begin SHOOTING at him and throwing grenades.
          CAPTAIN AMERICA jumps to the other railing and down with
          Barton's men. He begins to TAKE THEM DOWN, even goes as far as
          throwing one off. A few more enter, FIRING.
          CAPTAIN AMERICA grabs a NOVESKE RIFLEWORKS DIPLOMAT (big word
          for big fuckin' gun) and jumps back up to his position, firing
          down at them.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY

          The gunfight has gone down, but more of Barton's men enter and
          are taken by Fury, who is confused as to why they keep coming.

                          NICK FURY
           They are not getting through here, so
           what the hell...
          Suddenly, Barton LOOSES an arrow down to the bridge and EXPLODES
          critical spots. Barton releases a multi-tipped arrow towards
          Fury, but instead hits his command desk, right above a USB

          OUTLETS.
          Fury FIRES at Barton, but is already gone. The arrow then self-
          activates and inserts itself into the outlets, hacking every
          single monitor and main frame. The hacking causes Engine 1 to
          shut off. Suddenly, the HELICARRIER begins to DANGEROUSLY TILT
          to one side.

           AGENT JASPER SITWELL (O.S.)
           Sir, we've lost all power in Engine 1.

                          NICK FURY
           It's Barton. He took out our systems.
           He's headed for the detention level.
           Does anybody copy?

          INT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER- DAY

          Still shaken by the HULK ordeal, Natasha sits there, rocking
          back and forth, after crying for a while. Summoning back all her
          coolness, she touches her EARPIECE.

                          NATASHA
           This is Agent Romanoff. I copy.
          Natasha SPRINGS up and runs for Barton.

          EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE ­ DAY

          IRON MAN begins to push the rotor using BOOSTERS from his boots.

           NICK FURY (V.O.)
           Stark, we're losing altitude.

                          IRON MAN
           Yeah. Noticed.
          The rotors start propelling faster and faster as IRON MAN'S
          BOOSTERS get more and more bright.
          On the other side, CAPTAIN AMERICA continuously shoots at
          Barton's men. Blinking at the wrong moment, CAPTAIN AMERICA
          loses the upper hand and SLIDES off the railing, but grabs onto
          a LOOSE CABLE.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION ­ DAY

          Thor runs into the detention section where he finds Loki,
          escaping.

                          THOR

           NO!
          Thor CHARGES at his brother. Loki walks up to him and CROUCHES
          down to attack. THOR ONLY GOES THROUGH HIM. The false Loki
          dissipates into nothingness. THE REAL LOKI comes out from behind
          the cell door, which closes on THOR, locking him up. Loki
          smiles.

                          LOKI
           Are you ever not going to fall for
           that?

          INT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER ­ DAY

          Barton walks alone down the catwalk. In a lightning fast move,
          Barton nocks an arrow, and points it at NATASHA. A hand-to-hand
          fight ensues. Natasha CRAWLS her way around Barton, making
          Barton to drop his bow, but pulls out a KNIFE on her.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION ­ DAY

          Thor, in a fit of anger, SLAMS MJÖLNIR onto the glass cell. To
          his surprise, the cell door only CRACKS, but violently SHAKES
          the ship. Loki stands there in caution, as does his GUARDING

          SOLDIER.

                          LOKI
           (smiles; walks over to the

                          CONTROL PANEL)
           The humans think us immortal. Should we
           test that?
          Suddenly, GUARDING SOLDIER falls down like a tree. AGENT COULSON
          stands there, holding PHASE 2 WEAPON PROTOTYPE.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Move away, please.
          Loki moves away from the switch.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           You like this? We started working on
           the prototype after you sent THE
           DESTROYER. Even I don't know what it
           does. Do you wanna find out?

          A LOUD GASP. AGENT COULSON IS IMPALED THROUGH THE HEART. THE

          REAL LOKI STANDS BEHIND COULSON.

                          THOR
           Nooo!
          Loki sends Agent Coulson against the wall. Agent Coulson slumps
          down, breathing fast. Loki makes his way to the control switch.
          He gives his brother one last look. Thor looks at him, hopeful.
          Loki opens the HATCH. Thor still hopes. LOKI HITS THE BUTTON AND

          DROPS THOR OUT OF THE SHIP.

          INT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER ­ DAY

          Barton and Natasha continue attacking each other. Natasha
          KICKBOXES Barton's face. Feeling that, Barton takes a SWING at
          her, but she grabs his arm, TWISTING it. BARTON WRITHES IN PAIN.
          Using his other arm, he tosses the knife over and begins to
          SLASH at Natasha. She dodges every move, but finds herself in a
          LOCK HOLD with him. As he forces the knife down, she BITES his
          wrist. Barton lets go of the knife.
          Natasha WRAPS her legs around his neck, FLIPS him over and arm
          LOCKS him. She SLAMS his head into a pipes rail. Barton goes
          down, hard. He looks up her, almost coming to his real senses.

                          BARTON
           Natasha...
          Natasha COLDCOCKS him. Barton is out.

          EXT. SKY

          Thor, trapped in the glass cage, BOUNCES off the JUMBLING cell
          pod. As it draws closer to land, Thor tries to swing at glass,
          but misses. Land draws closer.
          In a final attempt before crashing, Thor positions himself onto
          the glass door and LEAPFROGS just as the cage is about to hit
          the ground. The cell CRASHES into the shore as Thor crashes out
          into the meadow.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION ­ DAY

          Loki has no remorse as he looks down. He closes the hatch and
          proceeds to leave. A WEAK VOICE.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           You're gonna lose.

                          LOKI

                          (TURNING)
           Am I?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           It's in your nature.

                          LOKI
           Your heroes are scattered, your
           floating fortress falls from the
           sky...where is my disadvantage?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           You lack conviction.

                          LOKI
           I don't think I...

          AGENT COULSON SHOOTS LOKI WITH HIS PHASE 2 WEAPON PROTOTYPE,

          CAUSING LOKI TO BE BLOWN THROUGH THE WALL BEHIND HIM.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           So that's what it does.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY

          Back in the bridge, Fury sees on his VIEWSCREEN that the hatch
          has been open. Knowing Agent Coulson was sent there, he goes to.

          EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE ­ DAY

          IRON MAN continuously SPINS Engine 3, giving it all he has. THE
          ROTORS ARE PROPELLING PROPERLY AND FAST. The HELICARRIER LEVELS
          itself.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

           Cap, I need the lever!

           STEVE (V.O.)
           I need a minute here!

                          TONY
           Lever. Now!
          Tony lets go of the rotors. They spin by themselves. Tony is
          then caught in one. He is now fucked. IRON MAN slips into the
          rotors, getting chewed up.

          EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE ­ DAY

          CAPTAIN AMERICA CLIMBS up the loose cable and reaches the
          railing.
          BARTON'S MAN opens fire once more. CAPTAIN AMERICA pulls himself
          up and finally PULLS the lever.
          A VENT opens up from Engine 3. IRON MAN falls out, but the suit
          heavily damaged, hardly keeping him up. IRON MAN heads for Cap.
          BARTON'S MAN turns his AIM to IRON MAN, who TACKLES him into the
          wall. IRON MAN rolls over, tired. Cap lets out a sigh of relief.

          OUTSIDE THE HELICARRIER
          The carrier that brought Barton and his team now leaves, taking
          Loki and his scepter. The carrier flies into the distance.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION ­ DAY

          Fury runs in finding Agent Coulson still alive, barely.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Sorry, boss. They got rabbited.

           Just stay awake. EYES ON ME!

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           No. I'm clocked out here.

                          NICK FURY
           Not an option.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           It's okay, boss. This was never going
           to work... if they didn't have
           something... to...
          Agent Coulson looks away. Sighs his last breath. Nick Fury looks
          on grimly at Coulson. The medical team arrives.

           NICK FURY (V.O.)
           Agent Coulson is down.
          Agent Hill is being treated for a gash on her head, listens on
          her headset, standing up.

           SHIELD AGENT (V.O.)
           Paramedics are on their way.

           NICK FURY (V.O.)
           They're here.

          Steve and Tony listen in as well.

           They called it.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ LATER

          Fury gathers Tony and Steve back into the briefing room everyone
          there has a look as if in a daze. A look of numb shock is shown
          on their devastated faces.

                          NICK FURY
           These were in Phil Coulson's jacket.
           Guess he never did get you to sign
           them.
          Fury throws Coulson's CAPTAIN AMERICA TRADING CARDS on the table
          towards Steve. Steve picks them up, STAINED WITH BLOOD.

                          NICK FURY
           We're dead in the air up here. Our
           communications, location of the cube,
           Banner, Thor. I got nothing for you.
           Lost my one good eye. Maybe I had that
           coming.

                          (A BEAT)
           Yes, we were going to build an arsenal
           with the Tesseract. I never put all my
           chips on that number though, because I
           was playing something even riskier.
           There was an idea, Stark knows this,
           called THE AVENGERS INITIATIVE. The
           idea was to bring together a group of
           remarkable people, see if they could
           become something more. See if they
           could work together when we needed them
           to, to fight the battles that we never
           could. Phil Coulson died still
           believing in that idea, in heroes.
          Tony gets up and walks off, not wanting to hear it anymore.

                          NICK FURY
           Well, it's an old fashioned notion.

          EXT. MEADOW ­ DAY

          INT. ABANDONED BUILDING ­ DAY

          Banner wakes up, in human form. He looks around and sees he is
          IN A PILE OF RUBBLE and looks up at the OPEN CEILING HE CRASHED
          IN. AND IS COMPLETELY NAKED. A SECURITY GUARD stands there,
          amazed.

                          SECURITY GUARD
           You fell out of the sky.

                          (COMING TO)
           Did I hurt anybody?

                          SECURITY GUARD
           There's nobody around here to get hurt.
           You did scare the hell out of some

           Lucky.

                          SECURITY GUARD

           you fell.

                          BANNER
           You saw?

                          SECURITY GUARD
           The whole thing, right through the
           ceiling. Big and green and buck ass
           nude. Here...
          He throws Banner a pair of big pants. Banner pulls on his pants.

                          SECURITY GUARD
           I didn't think those would fit you
           until you shrunk down to a regular size
           fella.

                          BANNER
           Thank you.

                          NATASHA
           Clint, you're gonna be alright.

                          CLINT BARTON
           You know that? Is that what you know? I
           got...I gotta go in though. I gotta
           flush him out.

                          NATASHA
           We don't have that long, it's gonna
           take time.

                          CLINT BARTON
           I don't understand. Have you ever had
           someone take your brain and play? Pull
           you out and send something else in? Do
           you know what it's like to be unmade?

                          NATASHA
          You know that I do.

                          CLINT BARTON
          Why am I back? How did you get him out?

                          NATASHA
          Cognitive recalibration. I hit you
          really hard in the head.

                          CLINT BARTON
          Thanks.
           (Natasha unfastens the

                          RESTRAINTS)
          Tasha, how many agents?

                          NATASHA
          Don't. Don't do that to yourself,
          Clint. This is Loki. This is monsters
          and magic and nothing we were ever
          trained for.

                          CLINT BARTON
          Loki, he got away?

                          NATASHA
          Yeah. I don't suppose you know where?

                          CLINT BARTON
          I didn't need to know. I didn't ask.
          He's gonna make his play soon though.
          Today.

                          NATASHA
          We gotta stop him.

                          CLINT BARTON
          Yeah? Who's we?

                          NATASHA
          I don't know. Whoever's left.

                          CLINT BARTON
          Well, if I put an arrow in Loki's
          eyesocket, I'd sleep better I suppose.

                          NATASHA
          Now you sound like you.
          Natasha sits next to her partner and friend.

                          CLINT BARTON
           But you don't. You're a spy, not a
           soldier. Now you want to wade into a
           war. Why? What did Loki do to you?

                          NATASHA
           He didn't, I just...

                          (SHE PAUSES)

                          CLINT BARTON
           Natasha.

                          NATASHA
           I've been compromised. I got red in my
           ledger. I'd like to wipe it out.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION ­ DAY

          Tony look at the empty cell container. He stands not saying a
          word. Steve walks in.

                          STEVE
           Was he married?

                          TONY
           No. There was a uh...cellist, I think.

                          STEVE
           I'm sorry. He seemed like a good man.

                          TONY
           He was an idiot.

                          STEVE
           Why? For believing?

                          TONY
           For taking on Loki alone.

                          STEVE
           He was doing his job.

                          TONY
           He was out of his league. He should
           have waited. He should have...

                          STEVE
          Sometimes there isn't a way out, Tony.

                          TONY

                          (WALKS AWAY)
          Right. How did that work for him?

                          STEVE
          Is this the first time you've lost a
          soldier?

                          TONY
           (turns around sharply)
          WE ARE NOT SOLDIERS! I am not marching
          to Fury's fife!

                          STEVE
          Neither am I! He's got the same blood
          on his hands as Loki does. Right now
          we've got to put that aside and get
          this done. Now Loki needs a power
          source, if we can put together a
          list...

                          TONY
           (looking at the blood stained

                          WALL)
          He made it personal.

                          STEVE
          That's not the point.

                          TONY
          That is the point. That's Loki's point.
          He hit us all right where we live. Why?

                          STEVE
          To tear us apart.

                          TONY
          He had to conquer his greed, but he
          knows he has to take us out to win,
          right? That's what he wants. He wants
          to beat us and he wants to be seen
          doing it. He wants an audience.

                          STEVE
           Right, I caught his act at Stuttengard.

                          TONY
           Yeah. That's just a preview, this is
           opening night. Loki's a full-tilt diva.
           He wants flowers, he wants parades, he
           wants a monument built in the skies
           with his name plastered...

                          (PAUSE)
           Sonofabitch!

          EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY

          Selvig works around the CMS device that has already been set-
          upon the rooftop of Tony's tower.

          INT. HELICARRIER MEDICAL ROOM ­ DAY

          Steve walks in full uniform. Natasha looks at him, unprepared.

                          STEVE
           Time to go.

                          NATASHA
           Go where?

                          STEVE
           I'll tell you on the way. Can you fly
           one of those jets?
          Barton walks out of the restroom. Looks at Cap.

                          CLINT BARTON
           I can.
          Steve looks at Natasha and she nods her head to confirm Barton's
          on their side.

                          STEVE
           You got a suit?

                          CLINT BARTON
           Yeah.

                          STEVE
           Then suit up.

                         MONTAGE
          - KRAKAKABOOM! A blinding BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes down from
          above, colliding on MJÖLNIR. The explosion is massive. THE

          MIGHTY THOR.
          - CAPTAIN AMERICA pulls on his HELMET and SHIELD.
          - Tony WELDS his IRON MAN helmet. LIGHT slips down over IRON
          MAN's eye holes.
          - BLACK WIDOW attaches a GLOVE GAUNTLET with her rounds on her
          wrist. A BLUE LIGHT CHARGES.
          - HAWKEYE slips on his QUIVER of arrows.

          EXT/INT. QUINJET ­ DAY

          Cap, Widow and Hawkeye walk towards and into the QUINJET. A
          YOUNG SHIELD PILOT looks and stands in their way.

           YOUNG SHIELD PILOT
           You are not authorized to be here...

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Son... just don't.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY

          Fury looks the window of the ship, contemplating. Agent Hill
          walks up to him, knowing.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           Sir.

                          NICK FURY
           Agent Hill?

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           Those cards, they were in Coulson's
           locker, not in his jacket.

                          NICK FURY
           They needed the push.
           (holding Coulson's cards)
          A LOUD NOISE SCREECHES. Fury looks out to see IRON MAN flying
          off as well as the QUINJET.

                          NICK FURY
           They found it. Get our communications
           back up, whatever you have to do. I
           want eyes on everything.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           Yes, sir.

          EXT. NEW YORK CITY SKYLINE - STARK TOWER ­ DAY

          IRON MAN arrives at STARK TOWER where Selvig, ACTIVATES the CMS
          device, holding the Tesseract.

                          JARVIS
           Sir, I took off the arc reactor. The
           device is already self-sustained.

                          TONY
           Shut it down, Dr. Selvig.

                          SELVIG
           It's too late! It can't stop now. He
           wants to show us something! A new
           universe.

                          IRON MAN
           Okay.
          IRON MAN aims his hands toward the CMS and FIRES. The energy
          from his boosters SHATTERS with a deafening CRACK! Selvig falls
          backwards. DOWN BELOW, CITIZENS OF NEW YORK look up at STARK
          TOWER. IRON MAN stares in disbelief at the CMS ... unharmed.

                          JARVIS
           The barrier is pure energy. It's
           unbreachable. The Mark VII is not ready
           to be deployed.

                          TONY
           Skip the spinning rims. We're on the
           clock.
          TONY lands his SUIT and goes through the gauntlet and unsuits
          him. LOKI looks up at him, smiling. They proceed to walk into
          the penthouse.

          INT. STARK PENTHOUSE ­ DAY

          Loki walks in, holding the scepter. Tony casually walks down the
          steps, towards the bar.

                          LOKI
           Please tell me you're going to appeal
           to my humanity.

                          TONY
           Uh...actually, I'm planning to threaten
           you.

                          LOKI
           You should have left your armor on for
           that.

                          TONY
           Yeah, it's seen a bit of mileage.
           You've got the blue stick of destiny.
           Would you like a drink?

                          LOKI
           Stalling me won't change anything.

                          TONY
           No, no, no! Threatening. No drink? You
           sure? I'm having one.

                          LOKI
           The CHITAURI are coming, nothing will
           change that. What have I to fear?

                          TONY

           THE AVENGERS.
           (Loki looks at him, confused)
           It's what we call ourselves, sort of
           like a team. `EARTH'S MIGHTIEST HEROES'
           type of thing.

                          LOKI
           Yes, I've met them.

                          TONY

                          (SMILING)
           Yeah, takes us a while to get any
           traction, I'll give you that one.

                          TONY (CONT'D)
           But, let's do a head count here. Your
           brother, the demi-God; a super soldier,
           a living legend who kind of lives up to
           the legend; a man with breath-taking
           anger management issues; a couple of
           master assassins, and you, big fella,
           you've managed to piss off every single
           one of them.

                          LOKI
           That was the plan.

                          TONY
           Not a great plan. When they come, and
           they will, they'll come for you.
          From underneath the bar table, Tony pulls on COLANTOTTE
          BRACELETS, a honing device.

                          LOKI
           I have an army.

                          TONY
           We have a HULK.

                          LOKI
           I thought the beast had wandered off.

                          TONY
           You're missing the point. There's no
           throne, there is no version of this,
           where you come out on top. Maybe your
           army comes and maybe it's too much for
           us, but it's all on you. Because if we
           can't protect the Earth, you can be
           damned well sure we'll avenge it.

                          LOKI
           (slowly walks up to him;
           raising the scepter)
           How will your friends have time for
           me,when they're so busy fighting you?
          Loki TAPS Tony on the chest with his scepter. PING! Nothing.
          Confused, Loki tires again. PING! NOTHING.

                          LOKI
           It should work.

                          TONY
           Well, performance issues. You know?
          In anger, Loki GRABS Tony by the throat and FLINGS him across
          the room.

                          TONY
           Jarvis. Anytime now.
          Loki grabs Tony by the throat again.

                          LOKI
           You will all fall before me.
          LOKI THROWS TONY OUT THE WINDOW. Tony FREEFALLS down the tower.
          From behind Loki, an elevator opens and a RED POD SHOOTS out.
          The pod LASER SIGNALS the COLANTOTTE BRACELETS on Tony. The POD
          begins to TRANSFORM into the MARK VII suit.
          It LATCHES onto Tony. IRON MAN. The suit FLIES up before he hits
          the ground or the gazing people. Loki looks up, angry.

                          IRON MAN
           And there's one other person you pissed
           off! His name was Phil.
          Loki raises the scepter. IRON MAN FIRES at Loki, sending him on
          his ass.

          EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY

          Selvig looks up at the sky. The Tesseract's energy BEAMS into
          the sky. The beam then forms a VORTEX, which then opens up

          ANOTHER PORTAL.

          EXT. VASTNESS OF SPACE

          A hole in space rips open, and from it, the CHITAURI ARMY SPILLS
          out in FLYING CHARIOTS, carrying ENERGY RIFLES with a bayonet on
          the end.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          TONY
           Right. Army.
          IRON MAN flies up towards the portal. From his shoulders, a
          miniature multiple rocket launcher, pops out and FIRES. Like the
          JERICHO MISSILE, several targets are taken down unlike no
          missile. It's useless. THOUSANDS OF CHITAURI FLY OUT. IRON MAN
          flies towards the city.

          EXT. MANHATTAN ­ DAY

          The CHITAURI UNLEASH. New Yorkers fill the streets, staring at
          the fire fight in the distance. BOOM!!! The CHITAURI unleashes
          BLASTS as it goes, blowing up cars, setting storefronts aflame.

          AN EXPLOSION RIPS OUT THE WINDOWS OF THE TOP CORNER OF

          BUILDINGS. FLAME AND STONE RAIN DOWN. A DOMINO-EFFECT OF

          EXPLOSIONS RIPPLING ACROSS THE BRIDGE.

          EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY

          Loki walks onto the balcony as the SOUNDS of the CHITAURI rings
          out. He admires his soon to be kingdom. THOR LANDS ON THE TOWER.
          Loki turns to his ENEMY.

                          THOR
           Loki! Turn off the Tesseract or I'll
           destroy it!

                          LOKI
           You can't. There is no stopping it.
           There is only the war!

                          THOR
           So be it.
          Loki and Thor rush at each other. They and their weapons
          collide. The two battle -- Loki unleashing another pent-up rage
          and jealousy, Thor having no choice but to defend himself.

          EXT. MANHATTAN ­ DAY

          SOLDIERS AND COPS have taken positions covering the streets.
          They see from the sky, IRON MAN leading a trail of CHITAURI
          towards his tower.

          EXT. SKY ­ DAY

          The QUINJET BOOMS into the city.

           BLACK WIDOW (V.O.)
           Stark, we're heading north east.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          IRON MAN
           What, did you stop for drive-thru?
           Swing up PARK, I'm gonna lay 'em out
           for you.

          EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY

          IRON MAN BANKS around his tower. Sees Thor and Loki still going
          at it. IRON MAN SWOOPS down the street, causing a CHITAURI to
          crash.
          Flying up, IRON MAN puts the following CHITAURI in view of the
          QUINJET. BLACK WIDOW takes out machine gun and FIRES at the

          CHITAURI.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          JARVIS
           Sir, we have more incoming.

                          TONY
           Fine. Let's keep them occupied.
          IRON MAN heads back to the portal.

          EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY

          Thor and Loki battle savagely. Loki fires ENERGY from the
          scepter, sending Thor sliding across the floor.

          INT. QUINJET ­ DAY

          HAWKEYE looks out to his left window, finding a target.

                          HAWKEYE
           Yeah.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           See them.
          HAWKEYE BANKS the jet towards STARK TOWER. Aims the MINIGUN at
          Loki. Loki AIMS the scepter at the QUINJET and FIRES A BLAST OF
          ENERGY. Thor gets to his feet, TACKLING Loki down hard.
          THE QUINJET is soon caught on fire. HAWKEYE maneuvers one wing
          of the jet. They SPIN and SLOW. DROPPING OUT OF THE AIR AS IT
          PASSES OVER SKYSCRAPERS. Then... they SLAM into the street.

          INT. QUINJET ­ DAY

          With everyone okay, HAWKEYE and BLACK WIDOW unfasten their
          seatbelts and open the ramp. CAPTAIN AMERICA runs down, followed
          by HAWKEYE and BLACK WIDOW. Each one has their respected weapons
          in hand.

          EXT. FOUR WAY STREET ­ DAY

          The TRIO arrives in the middle of a four-way street. Suddenly,
          the city LURCHES to a stop. A DEEP, PRIMAL RAGE BELLOWS OUT.
          With that roar, a SHADOW comes over them.

          EXT. VASTNESS OF SPACE

          From the portal, a FUCKING CHITAURI LEVIATHAN FLIES OUT!
          Carrying hundreds of SOLDIERS, the CHITAURI LEVIATHAN PASSES
          OVER the TRIO.

          EXT. BRIDGE STREET ­ DAY

          They look up, out of their element. From both sides, CHITAURI
          SOLDIERS CLING OFF and attach themselves to the sides of the
          buildings, sliding down. Some CRASH into these buildings and
          begin FIRING from their ENERGY RIFLES at innocent people.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Stark, are you seeing this?

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          TONY
           I'm seeing, still working on believing.
           Where's Banner? Has he shown up yet?

           CAPTAIN AMERICA (V.O.)
           Banner?

                          TONY
           Just keep me posted. Jarvis, find me a
           soft spot.
          IRON MAN quietly flies behind and parallel with the CHITAURI

          LEVIATHAN.

          EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY

          Thor holds down Loki's face straight ahead, forcing him to watch
          the city falling to ash.

                          THOR
           Look at this! Look around you! You
           think this madness will end with your
           rule?

                          LOKI
           (tries to look away)
           It's too late. It's too late to stopit.

                          THOR
           No. We can. Together.
          Loki looks at his brother, showing a sign of hope. Then... Loki
          stabs Thor with a small knife. Thor keels over.

                          LOKI
           Sentiment.
          Thor gets up, KICKS Loki and lifts him into the air. Thor then
          SLAMS him down, hard. Loki, bleeding, rolls over the edge. Thor
          looks down. LOKI IS RIDING ON A FLYING CHARIOT. DOZENS of
          CHITAURI follow his lead.

          EXT. BRIDGE STREET ­ DAY

          The TRIO runs behind upside taxis. They look up and see Loki
          taking his band down the street and FIRES at the street IN A

          CHAIN OF EXPLOSIONS. SMASHING CARS AND HURLING PEOPLE AS IT GOES

          IT GOES OFF IN ONE FINAL CONFLAGRATION.
          TERRIFIED PEOPLE running from Loki, looking over their
          shoulders, coming straight at us. CAPTAIN AMERICA looks down the
          bridge.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Those people need assistance down
           there.
          CHITAURI SOLDIERS that have landed near them and begin FIRING at
          them. BLACK WIDOW pulls both pistols and FIRES. Turns to Cap.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           We got this. It's good. Go!

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

                          (AT HAWKEYE)
           You think you can hold them off?

                          HAWKEYE
           Captain.
           (pulls a trigger on his bow;
           a narrow is mechanically

                          CHOSEN)
           It would be my genuine pleasure.
          HAWKEYE shoots an ARROW into the creature's head, gaining a few
          seconds for CAPTAIN AMERICA as he falls down the bridge,
          followed by an EXPLOSION.
          Cap races over to the plaza, jumping over dozens of EXPLODING
          cars. THE FIRST AVENGER RUNS LIKE A FUCKING CHEETAH.
          HAWKEYE runs over a bus full of people. From the windows, SMALL
          CHILDREN are held by their parents for HAWKEYE to pull them out
          to safety. He runs over to the jammed door and JERKILY opens it.
          People begin to run out.
          BLACK WIDOW empties out her CLIPS. HAWKEYE fires ARROWS into the
          ranks of the CHITAURI, hitting his mark each time he shoots.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           Just like BUDAPEST all over again!

                          HAWKEYE
           You and I remember Budapest
           verydifferently.

          EXT. MANHATTAN ­ DAY

          The COPS continuously fire at the flying chariots. It's pretty
          pointless. A YOUNG COP runs over to his POLICE SERGEANT.

                          YOUNG COP
           We need to get out! They gotta bring
           the National Guard!

                          POLICE SERGEANT
           National Guard? Does the army know
           what's happening here?

                          YOUNG COP
           Do we?
          CAPTAIN AMERICA jumps in front of them. They look up at this
          ridiculous looking man.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           I need men in these buildings. There
           are people inside that can run into the
           line of fire. You take them through the
           basement or through the subway. You
           keep them off the streets. I need a
           perimeter as far back as 39th.

                          POLICE SERGEANT
           Why the hell should I take orders from
           you?
          Suddenly, an EXPLOSION comes up from behind Cap. An ENERGY BLAST
          is blocked by his SHIELD. TWO CHITAURI SOLDIERS attack. The cops
          watch in shock as CAPTAIN AMERICA FIGHTS them off with ease. The
          Sergeant turns to his officer.

                          POLICE SERGEANT
           I need men in those buildings, lead the
           people down and away from the streets.
           I need a perimeter as far back as 39th.

          EXT. SKY LINE ­ DAY

          IRON MAN swerves around a building and faces the CHITAURI
          LEVIATHAN. He pulls out his miniature multiple rocket launcher
          and FIRES. The CHITAURI LEVIATHAN ROARS in annoyance. The
          CHITAURI LEVIATHAN turns to him.

                          IRON MAN

                          (TO JARVIS)
           We got his attention. What the hell is
           step two?!
          IRON MAN flies away.

          EXT. BRIDGE STREET ­ DAY

          HAWKEYE TRIPS a CHITAURI SOLDIER and RAMS an arrow down its
          throat. BLACK WIDOW gets her hands on an ENERGY RIFLE and
          STICKFIGHTS the hell out of them.
          CAPTAIN AMERICA joins back in and using his SHIELD, SWAPS and
          WHACKS oncoming CHITAURI SOLDIERS. It's all too much on them,
          until...
          Lightning strikes down from the sky, channeling the blast,
          firing the electricity out at the CHITAURI SOLDIERS around them.
          They're blasted back in a massive shockwave. The CHITAURI
          SOLDIERS convulse, drop dead to the ground. THOR TOUCHES DOWN.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           What's the story upstairs?

                          THOR
           The powers surrounding the cube is
           impenetrable.

           IRON MAN (V.O.)
           Thor is right. We gotta deal with these
           guys.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           How do we do this?

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           As a team.

                          THOR
           I have unfinished business with Loki.

                          HAWKEYE
           Yeah, get in line.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Save it. Loki's gonna keep this fight
           focused on us and that's what we need.
           Without him these things could run
           wild. We got Stark up top, he's gonna
           need us...
          Just then, BANNER ARRIVES ON A SMALL MOTORBIKE. Getting off, he
          looks around the city.

                          BANNER
           So, this all seems horrible.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           I've seen worse.

                          BANNER
           Sorry.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           No. We could use a little worse.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Stark? We got him.

           IRON MAN (V.O.)
           Banner?

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Just like you said.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          TONY
           Then tell him to suit up. I'm bringing
           the party to you.
          IRON MAN comes out from behind a building. The CHITAURI
          LEVIATHAN follows, impatiently.

          EXT. BRIDGE STREET ­ DAY

          The rest of the AVENGERS look up, getting ready and standing
          still.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           I... I don't see how that's a party...
          IRON MAN SWOOPS down the street. The CHITAURI LEVIATHAN also
          swoops down, BARRELING down the street like a FREIGHT TRAIN that
          keeps building and building its intensity.Banner looks behind.
          Cap looks at him. Banner begins to walk towards the monster.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Dr. Banner. Now might be a really good
           time for you to get angry.

                          BANNER
           That's my secret, Captain. I'm always
           angry.
          Banner's body starts to swell and stretch and harden. GREEN

          SHOOTS THROUGH HIS BODY. THE HULK.
          Aaaannndddd.........SSSMMMAAASSSHHH!!!! HULK POPS the CHITAURI

          LEVIATHAN IN THE NOSE. THE CREATURE FLIPS OVER A 360.
          IRON MAN, in mid-flight, extends his arm out and a ROCKET, ready
          to shoot. IRON MAN FIRES -- the rocket hits a SOFT SPOT ­ LARGE
          CHITAURI LEVIATHAN are BLOWN COMPLETELY AWAY. Real pain from the
          CHITAURI LEVIATHAN. Other pieces of meat CATCH FIRE and
          withdraw... SIZZLE as they hit the pavement. CAPTAIN AMERICA
          raises his SHIELD to block them.
          From above and on the buildings, the CHITAURI ARMY watches in
          horror as a group of EARTH'S MIGHTIEST HEROES FIND THEMSELVES

          UNITED AGAINST A COMMON THREAT. TO FIGHT THE FOES NO SINGLE

          SUPER HERO COULD WITHSTAND! THE AVENGERS ASSEMBLE!

          EXT. SKY ­ DAY

          Loki watches below, motionless.

                          LOKI
           Send the rest.

          EXT. VASTNESS OF SPACE

          From the portal, THOUSANDS MORE OF CHITAURI SOLDIERS AND EVEN

          MORE CHITAURI LEVIATHANS FLY OUT!

          EXT. BRIDGE STREET ­ DAY

          THE AVENGERS look up. Way out of their fucking element.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           Guys.

                          IRON MAN
           Call it, Cap.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Alright, listen up. Until we can close
           that portal up there, we're gonna use
           containment. Barton, I want you on that
           roof, eyes on everything. Call out
           patterns and strays. Stark, you got the
           perimeter. Anything gets more than
           three blocks out, you turn it back or
           your turn it to ash.

                          HAWKEYE
           Wanna give me a lift?

                          IRON MAN
           Right. Better clench up, LEGOLAS.
          IRON MAN lifts HAWKEYE up to the building.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Thor, you've gotta try and bottleneck
           that portal. Slow them down. You've got
           the lightning. Light the bastards up.
           (Thor flies up; to Natasha)
           You and me, we stay here on the ground,
           keep the fighting here. And Hulk.SMASH.

          THE HULK SMILES A MOST MAGNIFICENT GRIN AND LEAPS, SOARING HIGH

          UP INTO THE NEAREST BUILDING, HULK RUNS UP THE WALL HITS SEVERAL

          CHITAURI SOLDIERS, SNAPPING IN HALF.

          HE DIVES TOWARDS A BUILDING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET,
          THROWING THE DEAD CHITAURI SOLDIERS TOWARDS OTHER SOLDIERS. The
          CHITAURI SOLDIERS fire at him. THE HULK BACKHANDS THEM, SEIZES

          THEM AND WITH RAW POWER, THROWS THEM DOWN.

          IN HIS MOST POWERFUL LEAP YET, THE HULK FLIES UP AND IS IN THE

          MIDDLE OF A FLYING CHARIOT TRAFFIC JAM, TO WHICH HE SMACKS THEM

          OUT OF ALTITUDE.

          EXT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING ­ DAY

          Thor grabs onto the tower. Raises MJÖLNIR and KRAKAKABOOM! A
          BLINDING BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes down from above, colliding on

          MJÖLNIR. THOR AIMS THIS MASSIVE SHOCKWAVE TOWARDS THE PORTAL.

          THOR CHANNELS THE BLAST AND FIRES THE ELECTRICITY OUT AT THE

          CHITAURI SOLDIERS FLYING OUT OF THE PORTAL. THEY'RE BLASTED BACK

          IN A MASSIVE SHOCKWAVE. THE CHITAURI SOLDIERS CONVULSE, DROP

          DEAD TO THE GROUND. HE EVEN RIPS THE SHIT OUT OF A CHITAURI

          LEVIATHAN, WHICH THEN FUCKING EXPLODES.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY

          Back in the bridge, Fury sees on his VIEWSCREEN the destruction
          going on in NEW YORK. Agent Hill walks up to him.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           Sir. The council is on.
          OH SHIT. Fury presses his screen.

          EXT. ROOFTOP BUILDING ­ DAY

          Atop the rooftop, HAWKEYE fires ARROWS into the streaming flow
          of the CHITAURI RIDERS, hitting his mark each time. Hell, heeven
          AIMS his bow behind him, WITHOUT LOOKING and releases the arrow,
          EXPLODING a RIDER.

                          HAWKEYE
           Stark. You got a lot of strings
           sticking to your tail.

                          IRON MAN
           Just try and keep them off the streets.

                          HAWKEYE
           Well, they can't bank worth a damn.
           Find a tight corner.

                          IRON MAN
           I will roger that.
          IRON MAN does so and leads towards TIGHT CORNERS and in
          HAWKEYE'S view, who fires arrow upon and arrow, EXPLODING the
          CHITAURI RIDERS. IRON MAN keeps leading CHITAURI RIDERS UNDER
          TUNNELS, THROUGH OPEN PARKING GARAGES. He looks back. None left.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          TONY
           Nice call. What else you got?

           HAWKEYE (V.O.)
           Well, Thor's taking on a squadron down
           on 6th.

                          TONY
           And he didn't invite me?

          EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - CONFERENCE ROOM ­ DAY

          We are looking INTO a conference room where office workers sit
          around a table. But the NOISE has caught one worker's eye, then
          another, and soon they are all rising, stepping to the window,
          mesmerized by what lies beyond.
          WORKERS' POVA CHITAURI LEVIATHAN SWIMS right in front of them.

          EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - CONFERENCE ROOM ­ DAY

          Suddenly, another NOISE catches the worker's attention. THE HULK

          CRASHES THROUGH THEIR FLOOR. SLASHES HIS THROUGH THE ROOM,

          POUNDING AWAY AND JUMPS OUT ONTO THE JAW OF THE CHITAURI

          LEVIATHAN. THE CHITAURI LEVIATHAN BEGINS TO HEAD DOWN, TRYING TO

          WAVE OFF THE HULK.

          EXT. BRIDGE STREET ­ DAY

          BLACK WIDOW, using the ENERGY RIFLE, is taken off her feet by a
          CHITAURI SOLDIER. She TIRESOMELY takes it down by cutting its
          throat. She grabs the ENERGY RIFLE, turns to attack. Cap stands
          there, holding his SHIELD. She slumps back, tired.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           Captain, none of this is gonna mean a
           damn thing if we don't close that
           portal.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Our biggest guns couldn't touch it.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           Well, maybe it's not about guns.
           (gestures the flying

                          CHARIOTS)

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           You wanna get up there, you're gonna
           need a ride.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           I got a ride. I could use a lift
           though.
          BLACK WIDOW backs up giving herself a running start. Cap lifts
          and angles his SHIELD.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Are you sure about this?

                          BLACK WIDOW
           Yeah. It's gonna be fun.

          BLACK WIDOW RUNS AT CAPTAIN AMERICA. BLACK WIDOW DOES A PARKOUR

          MOVE, USING HER FEET TO RUN UP THE CAR AND JUMPS UP ON CAP'S

          SHIELD, WHO GIVES HER A BOOST WITH THE SHIELD. SHE GRABS ONTO A

          FLYING CHARIOT.
          [Note: The following sequence will take us through the action in
          one extended shot.]
          - BLACK WIDOW climbs onto the chariot and CUTS the turret
          shooter's linkage to it. She then JUMPS on the rider and STICKS
          her knives into his nervous system. She gets him to BANK over a
          building.
          - IRON MAN arrives and SHOOTS any other CHITAURI RIDERS
          following her. He makes his way down to CAPTAIN AMERICA, who
          fights off more CHITAURI SOLDIERS. IRON MAN points his HAND
          BOOSTERS at his SHIELD. The energy comes off and Cap uses it as
          a REFLECTION BEAM and takes down nearby CHITAURI.
          - From above them, HAWKEYE sends down remaining arrows. He sends
          one across the street, taking down a CHITAURI RIDER following

          IRON MAN.
          - Finally, we have THOR and HULK fight on top the back of the
          CHITAURI LEVIATHAN, tearing apart and fighting SOLDIERS. HULK

          BREAKS OFF A MASSIVE PIECE OF ARMOR AND SLAMS IT DOWN ONTO THE
          SPINE OF THE CHITAURI LEVIATHAN. Summoning all his strength he,

          THOR RAISES, DRAWING LIGHTNING TO IT FROM ALL SIDES, AND BRINGS

          IT DOWN WITH A FINAL, TERRIBLE BLOW--

          INT. HISTORY MUSEUM ­ DAY

          The CHITAURI LEVIATHAN CRASHES into a history museum. DEAD. THOR
          and HULK stand on the BACK of the CHITAURI LEVIATHAN after
          bringing it down. They stand still, admiring. HULK PUNCHES THOR

          WITH HIS ENORMOUS HAND. THOR GOES FLYING. HULK SMIRKS.

          EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY

          SELVIG WAKES UP FROM LOKI MIND CONTROL. He looks around,
          confused where he is. He looks up at the sky, amazed.

          EXT. BRIDGE STREET ­ DAY

          Several HUMVEES aim their MOUNTED .50 Cal guns into the sky,
          FIRING and HITTING CHITAURI RIDERS. CAPTAIN AMERICA fights off a
          SOLDIER who is pinning him down with its energy rifle. Cap
          BREAKS ITS LEG. He stands up, pickingup his SHILED.

                          HAWKEYE
           Captain, the bank on 42ndpast MADISON,
           they caught a lot of civilians there.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           I'm on it.

          INT. 42NDBANK ­ DAY

          Dozens of civilians are gathered in bank. Tension and
          uncertainty surround them. THREE CHITAURI SOLDIERS oversee them,
          pointing their weapons at them. One of them charges a BOMB. It

          BEEPS.
          CAPTAIN AMERICA jumps through the window and throws his SHIELD
          at the CHITAURI BOMBER. The TWO CHITAURI SOLDIERS aim their
          rifles, but Cap heads for cover under a desk, which he KICKS at
          them.
          CAPTAIN AMERICA jumps over the desk, HEADLOCKS A SOLDIER, while
          BACKHANDING another one over the railing. The crowd moves away.
          A CHITAURI SOLDIER attacks him from behind and RIPS OFF HIS
          HELMET. The bomb is beeping faster.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Everyone! Clear out!
          CAPTAIN AMERICA flips over the SOLDIER, grabs his SHIELD and
          just as the BOMB is about to GO OFF, CHITAURI BOMBER dives for,
          trying to stop it, but it GOES OFF, sending CAPTAIN AMERICA
          through the window, landing very hard on a car. The civilians
          look up from below. They're okay.

          EXT. OUTSIDE THE BANK ­ CONTINUOUS

          Cap gets off the car, looks around the city. Destroyed. The
          police and firemen arrive, pulling out those civilians he saved.
          A WAITRESS looks back, thankful.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY

          Back in the bridge, Fury sees on his VIEWSCREEN the WORLD

          SECURITY COUNCIL.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #2
           Director Fury, the council has made a
           decision.

                          NICK FURY
           I recognize the council has made a
           decision, but given that it's a stupid
           ass decision, I've elected to ignore
           it.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           Director, you're closer than any of
           oursubs, you scramble that jet...

                          NICK FURY
           That is the island of Manhattan,
           Councilman. Until I'm certain my team
           can't hold it, I will not order a
           nuclear strike against a civilian
           population.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           If we don't hold them in the air, we
           lose everything.

                          NICK FURY
           I send that bird out, we already have.
          Fury shuts off his viewscreen.

          EXT. MANHATTAN ­ DAY

          BLACK WIDOW, still driving the chariot with the RIDER, is hit at
          her side. She looks about, wondering whose ENERGY FIRE it was
          she looks behind.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           Oh. You.
          LOKI FOLLOWS IN HOT PURSUIT. They RACE DOWNWARD, trailing
          between buildings. They RACE MADLY, driving and dodging.

          EXT. ROOFTOP BUILDING ­ DAY

          HAWKEYE looks at BLACK WIDOW, astonished.

                          HAWKEYE
           Nat, what are you doing?

           BLACK WIDOW (V.O.)
           Uh... a little help!
          HAWKEYE pulls the trigger twice, nocks an arrow, and points it
          at Loki, smiling.

                          HAWKEYE
           I've got him.

          FIRES. THE ARROW STREAKS DOWN THE CITY, STRAIGHT AT THE LOKI'S

          HEAD...

          SNATCH! LIKE A CAT, LOKI GRABS THE ARROW STRAIGHT OUT OF THE

          AIR...LOOKS STRAIGHT AT HAWKEYE, SMILING...

          BBOOOOMMM!!! THE ARROW EXPLODES IN LOKI'S FACE, CRASHING INTO

          THE STARK PENTHOUSE PAD.
          BLACK WIDOW looks down and building her momentum, she JUMPS of
          the chariot, lands on top of STARK TOWER, rolling herself to the
          edge.

          EXT/INT. STARK PENTHOUSE ­ DAY

          As Loki looks up, shocked at what just happened, THE HULK IS
          LEAPING UP AND KICKS LOKI, HURTLING TOWARDS THE GLASS WINDOW. He
          COLLAPSES as he hits the wall. THE HULK jumps in, ready to
          attack. Loki ROLLS himself up in a flurry of broken glass,

          STANDING UP TO THE HULK.

                          LOKI

           ENOUGH! YOU ARE, ALL OF YOU ARE BENEATH

           ME! I AM A GOD, YOU DULL CREATURE, AND

           I WILL NOT BE BULLIED...

          HULK GRABS LOKI BY THE LEGS AND SMASHES HIM AGAINST THE FLOOR

          REPEATEDLY AND FINALLY THROWS HIM ASIDE TO THE GROUND,

          FLATTENING LOKI.

                          HULK

           PUNY GOD.

          LOKI WHIMPERS IN PAIN.

          EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY

          BLACK WIDOW walks up the CMS machine. Selvig, slumped down,
          weakened, looks at her desperately. The Tesseract's energy is
          firing towards the portal, gaining in strength, at the surge of
          energy moving through the sky.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           Doctor.

                          SELVIG
           Loki's scepter, the energy...the
           Tesseract can't fight. You can't
           protect against yourself.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           It's not your fault. You didn't know
           what you were doing.

                          SELVIG
           Well, actually I think I did. I built
           in a safety to cut the power source.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           Loki's scepter.

                          SELVIG
           It might be able to close the portal.
           (Selvig looks down. He sees a

                          GOLD GLEAM)
           And I'm looking right at it.

          EXT. MANHATTAN ­ DAY

          THOR rides on top of chariot, SMACKING SEVERAL RIDERS with the
          hammer. As Thor takes the reins, a CHITAURI LEVIATHAN crashes
          through a building, knocking him down to where Cap is, fighting
          off SOLDIERS.
          IRON MAN flies right next to the CHITAURI LEVIATHAN and aims his
          LASER BOOSTER at it. Nothing.

                          JARVIS
           Sir, we will lose power before you cut
           through that shell.
          IRON MAN flies up ahead, facing the oncoming monster.

                          IRON MAN
           JARVIS. You ever hear the tale of
           Jonah?

                          JARVIS
           I wouldn't consider him a role model.

          IRON MAN FLIES TOWARDS THE CHITAURI LEVIATHAN, UNLEASHING EVERY
          ARSENAL ON THE SUIT. The CHITAURI LEVIATHAN opens its mouth.
          IRON MAN flies in and BURSTS out the other end, making the
          CHITAURI LEVIATHAN collapse. IRON MAN rolls down the street. The
          wind is knocked out of him. He looks up with an overwhelming
          sigh as a SMALL BAND of CHITAURI SOLDIERS rush towards him,
          holding out their rifles.

          EXT. ROOFTOP BUILDING ­ DAY

          HAWKEYE turns to fire HIS LAST ARROW. Using his bow as a staff,
          he knocks some CHITAURI SOLDIERS, before yanking his last arrow
          off the dead body a CHITAURI SOLDIERS.
          HAWKEYE nocks his arrow, DIVES DOWN THE BUILDING and FIRES his
          GRAPPLING ARROW up into the side of building. Falling down,
          HAWKEYE finds the MOMENTUM and SWINGS himself into a building
          and CANNONBALLS in.

          EXT. MANHATTAN ­ DAY

          The HULK holds CHITAURI SOLDIERS by the face and SLAMS them
          down. More keep coming. HULK looks up. HUNDREDS OF RIDERS HOVER
          OVER HIM. Then... they begin to fire ENERGY BLASTS. HULK TAKES

          THEM LIKE HE'S RUNNING THROUGH A LIGHT RAIN. BLOCKING THE STREAM

          OF STREAKING BLASTS, AS THOUGH SWATTING AT BEES.

          EXT. HELICARRIER DECK ­ DAY

          A lone pilot sits in his cockpit, listening.

          Back in the bridge, Agent Hill sees on her SCREEN 7 ALPHA 11
          preparing to leave.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           Sir, we have a bird in motion! Anyone
           on the deck, we have a rogue bird! We
           need to shut it down! Repeat! Take off
           is not authorized!

          EXT. HELICARRIER DECK ­ DAY


          NICK FURY RUNS OUT TO THE DECK, HOLDING A FUCKING AIRTRONIC RPG-
          7. He takes AIM and FIRES, HITTING the TAIL END of the jet. The
          jet SKIDS OFF towards the edge. PILOT UNHARMED.
          Suddenly, another 7 ALPHA 11 JET FLIES off. Fury stands there,
          knowing he can't do anything about it.

                          NICK FURY
           Stark, you hearing me? We have a
           missile headed straight for the city.

           IRON MAN (V.O.)
           How long?

                          NICK FURY
           Three minutes, at best. Stay low and
           wipe out the missile.

          EXT. MANHATTAN ­ DAY

          IRON MAN fights off as many CHITAURI SOLDIERS as he sustain.

                          IRON MAN
           Jarvis, put everything we got into the
           thrusters!

                          JARVIS
           I just did.
          IRON MAN leaves the streets and flies up into the sky.

          EXT. SKY ­ DAY

          7 ALPHA 11 arrives outside the city. He flips the switch to
          press the button. He presses it. THE MISSILE IS FLYING OUT TO

          EXT. MANHATTAN ­ DAY

          CAPTAIN AMERICA AND THOR BATTLE, SIDE TO SIDE. Cap and Thor both
          throw their respected weapons. Thor catches MJÖLNIR, but as Cap
          turns, an ENERGY BLAST strikes him down hard. Thor runs over to
          a broken car, swings the hammer and flips the car over and over
          on its side, crushing a few CHITAURI SOLDIERS.
          Cap tries to get up. Thor helps him back to his feet. Cap raises
          his SHIELD back up.

                          THOR
           You ready for another bout?

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

          EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY

          Selvig, back in scientist mode, CLACKS away at his laptop.
          Henods. BLACK WIDOW grabs Loki's scepter, slowly breaks into the
          FORCE FIELD, almost touching the Tesseract.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           I can close it! Can anybody hear me? I
           can shut the portal down!

          EXT. MANHATTAN ­ DAY


                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Do it!

           No, wait!

           where to put it.

          EXT. SKY ­ DAY

          IRON MAN catches up, now comes at the missile from behind. The
          missile speeds on. IRON MAN grabs it from behind, gripping it
          tightly.
          With a mighty effort, he wrenches the rocket off its course.
          Steering it from behind, he accelerates quickly, flying straight
          up into sky, towards the portal.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

           CAPTAIN AMERICA (V.O.)
           Stark, you know that's a one-way trip?

          PEPPER, along with her crew, watches on T.V., in horror, the
          destruction in NEW YORK. On the table, her cell is VIBRATING,
          with Tony's picture on it.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY

          Back in the bridge, every single agent holds their breath as
          they too watch IRON MAN fly up into the portal.

          EXT. SKY ­ DAY

          IRON MAN climbs higher and higher over the city, gaining speed,
          suddenly flings himself through the portal. Communications die.
          The suit begins to freeze. Tony looks in horror.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY

          Every single agent CHEERS. Fury smiles. He tries to communicate
          with Tony. NOTHING.

          EXT. SPACE

          We then see Tony's horror. AN ARMADA. The black sky is filled
          with what must be ninety ships in a vague cluster. Most of them
          hang still in the air. Some move swimmingly about.
          IRON MAN lets go of the missile. It whistles off into the
          blackness as IRON MAN IDLY falls back down the portal's opening.
          The missile reaches the MAIN SHIP. The MAIN SHIP IMPLODES,
          causing the entire ARMADA to burst into a supernova, creating a
          spectacular heavenly display.

          EXT. MANHATTAN ­ DAY

          Suddenly, all of the CHITAURI SOLDIERS and CHITAURI LEVIATHANS
          KEEL OVER and begin to SHAKE, then stop. They all fall over. THE
          AVENGERS look up at their CONSULTANT, not sure if he'll make it
          through.

          EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY

          Still holding the scepter in hand, BLACK WIDOW shifts around,
          waiting.

           Come on, Stark...

          EXT. MANHATTAN ­ DAY

          Thor and Cap see the supernova coming towards them. Thor nods to
          Cap.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           (to BLACK WIDOW)
           Close it.

          EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY

          Without hesitating, BLACK WIDOW pulls the scepter out, the
          TESSERACT turns off its energy beam. The PORTAL QUICKLY CLOSES.
          A SMALL FIGURE is hurled backwards into the open now closed
          portal. IRON MAN. Plummeting to the earth.

          EXT. MANHATTAN ­ DAY


                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

                          (SMILING)
           Son of a gun!
          TIGHT ON IRON MAN: He keeps falling. And falling. And falling.

          EXT. MANHATTAN ­ DAY


                          THOR
           He's not slowing down.
          Thor swings Mjölnir around. Just as Thor flies up, THE HULK

          SNAGS IRON MAN OUT OF THE AIR, BOTH CRASHING AND SLIDING DOWN A

          BUILDING.

          EXT. BRIDGE STREET ­ DAY

          HULK throws IRON MAN off him. Thor and Cap run over to him. Thor
          RIPS off Tony's helmet. He appears to be dead. They stand around
          not sure. Then... THE HULK YELLS IN FURY. THE NOISE STARTLES

          TONY AWAKE.

                          TONY
           What the hell? What just happened?
           Please tell me nobody kissed me?

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

                          (A BEAT)
           We won.

                          TONY
           Alright. Hey. Alright. Good job, guys.
           Let's just not come in tomorrow. Let's
           just take a day. Have you ever tried
           shawarma? There's a shawarma joint
           about two blocks from here. I don't
           know what it is, but I wanna try it.

                          THOR
           (looking up at Stark Tower)
           We're not finished yet.
          A beat.

                          TONY
           And then shawarma after.

          INT. STARK PENTHOUSE ­ DAY

          Loki crawls onto the stair, looking like a piece of shit rag
          doll. He takes a few breathers, senses someone is behind him. He
          turns TO FIND THE AVENGERS STARING AT HIM, PISSED.

                          LOKI
           If it's all the same to you. I'll have
           that drink.

          THE HULK SNORTS AT HIM.

          WEEKS LATER.

          INT. SHIELD ANALYTICAL ROOM ­ DAY

          In TV news montage about THE AVENGERS, we see various reports of
          what happened. Some people agree that the avengers did good,
          protecting the city. Others believe it was their cause.

           OLD MAN (STAN LEE)
           Superheroes? In New York? Give me a
           break!

                          SENATOR BOYNTON
           These so called heroes have to be held
           responsible for the destruction done to
           the city. This was their fight. Where
           are they now?

                          WAITRESS
           What? That this was somehow their
           fault? Captain America saved my life.
           Wherever he is, wherever any of them
           are, I just wanna say thank you.

          EXT. CENTRAL PARK ­ DAY

          The Avengers take Thor and Loki, who is handcuffed and muzzled,
          to a blocked area. Thor shakes hands with his team and gives
          Selvig a hug. Tony opens the Tesseract's case.
          Banner takes it out and places inside a glass tube, held by
          Thor. Thor gives Loki the other end, who reluctantly takes it.
          The Asgardians leap into the energy beam. GONE.
          Then, one-by-one, the group splinters off, strolling into
          different directions. Banner climbs in with Tony in his
          sportscar. Steve rides away in his Harley. Natasha and Clint
          climb back into SHIELD cars. They all part. For now.

          INT. SHIELD ANALYTICAL ROOM ­ DAY

          Fury is facing once more members of the WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #3
           Where are the Avengers?

                          NICK FURY
           I'm not currently tracking their
           whereabouts. I'd say they've earned a
           leave of absence.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #2
           And the Tesseract?

                          NICK FURY
           The Tesseract is where it belongs: out
           of our reach.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           That's not your call.

                          NICK FURY
           I didn't make it. I just didn't argue
           with the god that did.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           So you let him take it and the war
           criminal, Loki, who should be answering
           for his crimes?

                          NICK FURY
           Oh, I think he will be.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           I don't think you understand what
           you've started. Letting the Avengers
           loose on this world. They're dangerous.

                          NICK FURY
           They surely are. And the whole world
           knows it. Every world knows it.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           Was that the point of all this? A
           statement?

                          NICK FURY
           A promise.

          Fury walks out, towards the bridge.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY

          Fury and Agent Hill walk together, toward the window looking out
          into the world.

                         AGENT MARIA HILL
           Sir, how does it work now? They've gone
           their separate ways, some pretty
           extremely far. We get into a situation
           like this again, what happens then?

                          NICK FURY
           They'll come back.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           You really sure about that?

                          NICK FURY
           I am.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           Why?

                          NICK FURY
           Because we'll need them to.

          Agent Hill turns around. Fury looks out, smiling.

          INT. STARK PENTHOUSE ­ DAY


          TONY AND PEPPER UNVEIL A NEW DESIGN FOR STARK TOWER. CAMERA

          away, and all that remains is a giant A.
