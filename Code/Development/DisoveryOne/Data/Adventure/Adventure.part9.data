15   OVER BLACKNESS, we HEAR a BACH HARPSICHORD CONCERTO. And then a 15
     WOMAN -- breathing hard -- straining, harder and harder -- until
     finally we HEAR a NEWBORN BABY CRYING -- and we...

     FADE IN:

     EXT. VULCAN FAMILY HOME - DUSK

     The image is spectacular, aglow in DUSK LIGHT: a beautiful BABY,
     just born, held in a WOMAN'S HANDS. It is being cleaned; warm
     water runs down its face and body.

     TIGHT ON the MIDWIFE (female, 60's) who holds and cleans the
     baby as it CRIES. Another, younger, Midwife can be seen behind
     her, assisting with the pitchers of water. As she cleans the
     baby, she says to someone OFF-CAMERA:

                                 MIDWIFE
                He is strong.

     The baby, now calm, gets SWADDLED.    He is then gently held out
     to the new MOTHER:

     AMANDA GRAYSON, late 20's. An original beauty. She lies on a
     divan, spent but eager to hold her first child. She tenderly
     takes the infant into her arms, tears in her eyes, mesmerized.
     She holds the wrapped baby tight and whispers sweetly:

                                 AMANDA
                ... hello.

     CLOSE ON the YOUNGER MIDWIFE, standing at the rear of the room.
     She raises an eyebrow as she quietly speaks:

                              YOUNGER MIDWIFE
                The baby is healthy. Why does she cry?

                              MIDWIFE
                        (a beat; then)
                She is human.

     A distant, quiet BUZZ -- and the elder Midwife stands, looking
     into the distance. And this is when we see, for the first time,
     that the Midwife has POINTED EARS.

                                 MIDWIFE (CONT'D)
                Sarek arrives.

     The Midwife moves away -- we PUSH IN on Amanda, who looks up for
     a moment, clearly disquieted.




15A   OMIT                                                              15A

15B   EXT. VULCAN LANDSCAPE - DUSK [FORMER SC. 14]                      15B

      A planet of massive, tortured ROCK FORMS, distant cities
      constructed atop and underneath them. A HOVER-SPEEDER in the
      mid-ground kicks up dust, backlit by the sun, as it traces the
      horizon. We PAN WITH IT, revealing a FAMILY HOME, built
      seamlessly into a rocky mountainside.

      A SUPER READS: STARDATE 2230.06.

      The speeder parks outside the home --

15C   EXT. VULCAN HOME - DUSK                                           15C

      SAREK (late 40's, a Vulcan) comes out to the balcony through the
      rear doors of the home. He moves to Amanda and kneels. He
      looks at the child -- his child -- and says:

                                  SAREK
                 Well done.

      She looks at him for a beat, then says, flatly -- with just
      enough rancor:

                                  AMANDA
                 Thanks.

      He regards her.   Knows he's in TROUBLE --

                               SAREK
                 Your tone suggests disappointment. The
                 Science Council required my presence for
                 a session regarding--

                                  AMANDA
                 Don't do that.     You knew I wanted you
                 here.

      The Vulcan Midwives share a look. Sarek glances at them. Nods.
      The two women excuse themselves. Sarek reaches over, touches a
      small touchpad -- the HARPSICHORD MUSIC STOPS. He says,
      clinically:

                               SAREK
                 As you are aware, the Vulcan male is
                 traditionally not present at the moment
                 of delivery.

                                AMANDA
                 Well traditionally, I'm not the one
                 giving birth.
                         (then)
                                (MORE)

                                               3
15C   CONTINUED:                                                        15C
                                 AMANDA (CONT'D)
                   I moved here -- to another planet -- to
                   be with you. I needed you to be with me
                   today. Holding my hand and telling me
                   I'm doing great, even when I'm just...
                   breathing the best I can.

      Sad that she has to tell him this at all, she just looks back at
      the baby -- finding comfort in his innocence. Sarek considers
      this. He moves closer to her. Whispers intimately:

                                 SAREK
                   You are correct. I should have been
                   here. I am sorry.

      And with her free hand, she pulls Sarek closer -- and kisses
      him. And the two look at the baby.

                                 SAREK (CONT'D)
                   I had a thought. That we might name the
                   child after one of our respected early
                   society-builders. His name was "Spock".

      She looks at the baby, not immediately taken by the name.

                                 SAREK (CONT'D)
                   Your silence does not suggest enormous
                   enthusiasm.

                                  AMANDA
                   No... Spock.
                           (smiles, touches his
                            face)
                   ... Spock.

      She looks at Sarek: Spock it is.

                                 SAREK
                   The child has your eyes.

      She pulls back the baby's swaddling, revealing his ears.    She
      gently rubs the top of his right ear -- AND IT UNFURLS,
      revealing a small, soft pointed VULCAN EAR.

                                 AMANDA
                   ... and your ears.

      And off the image of this TINY BABY, half-human, half-Vulcan,
      we... FADE OUT. And over BLACKNESS, we BEGIN TO HEAR an ALARM
      SOUNDING -- GROWING -- and the SUPER "THREE YEARS LATER" APPEARS
      -- and finally the BLACKNESS IS SPLIT BY TURBO-LIFT DOORS
      OPENING and we REVEAL THAT WE'RE ON:

                                                4


15D   INT. U.S.S. KELVIN [FORMER SC. 15A]                               15D

      With URGENCY, we MOVE DOWN a corridor with CAPTAIN ROBAU and
      OFFICER PITTS:


               CAPTAIN ROBAU                      OFFICER PITTS
      -- our sensors haven't made        -- no sir, it looked like a
      sense of the anomaly?              lightning storm in the middle
      -- how far are we from the         of space --
      Klingon Neutral Zone?              -- 150,000 kilometers, but the
                                         vessel is not Klingon, Sir,
                                         its registry doesn't match any
                                         recorded profile --

      SHWISH! The doors part and we enter THE BRIDGE OF THE SHIP -- a
      flurry of activity -- the MASSIVE SHIP they are approaching on
      the VIEWSCREEN. Robau moves to the center -- then he asks:

                                 CAPTAIN ROBAU
                 Report.

      -- turning to the ship's FIRST OFFICER: 32, all-American face,
      swiveling in a console chair to FACE US:

                               FIRST OFFICER
                 Sir, new contact bearing zero-three-four.

               CAPTAIN ROBAU                      FIRST OFFICER
      Are they transmitting on any       Negative, Captain -- all
      frequency?                         communications appear to be
                                         shut down.

               CAPTAIN ROBAU                      FIRST OFFICER
      Hail the ship. What's the          Nothing even close, Sir.
      closest match on registry?

      Robau moves to Pitts:

                                 CAPTAIN ROBAU
                 Any response?

                               OFFICER PITTS
                 No Sir -- hails met with silence.

                               CAPTAIN ROBAU
                 Maybe they're incapable -- any
                 identifiable damage?

                               OFFICER PITTS
                 Negative, Sir -- but our readings seem
                 confused--

                                              5
15D   CONTINUED:                                                        15D

                                 CAPTAIN ROBAU
                   Confused?

                                 OFFICER PITTS
                   -- not only is the ship unregistered --
                   but even its construction materials seem
                   unrecognizable.

      Robau sits in the captain's chair his eyes on the ship as they
      approach -- and we SEE IT on the VIEWSCREEN -- THE NARADA --
      ENORMOUS AND THREATENING. He doesn't even realize that he says:

                                 CAPTAIN ROBAU
                   ... oh my God...
                           (to himself, boggled)
                   A lightning storm... then this...
                           (to deck)
                   Signal all departments: first contact
                   protocols. Looks like we have someone
                   new on the block. All Stop.

19C   EXT. DEEP SPACE - CONTINUOUS                                      19C

      And in the endless vacuum of space, and in TOTAL SILENCE, the
      Kelvin appears as a dot, coming to a stop in front of the
      gigantic BLACK CLAW that is the Narada --

19D   INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - BRIDGE                                       19D

      Crew members are glued to their telemetry, working consoles:

                                 FIRST OFFICER
                   Sir, should we initiate an invasive scan?

                                 CAPTAIN ROBAU
                   That could be seen as an act of
                   provocation -- all readings passive--

      Suddenly, a WARNING BEEP --


               OFFICER PITTS                     CAPTAIN ROBAU
      Sir, I have a reading --
      they've locked weapons on us!     -- Red alert!   Arm weapons!

      SEPARATES, fracturing into a multi-hit projectile --

24    INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                         24

      Captain Robau helps a fallen CREW MEMBER up from the floor --
      then, on his chair com.:

                                  CAPTAIN ROBAU
                 Damage report!

      INTERCUT with:

      Moving with the Kelvin's CHIEF ENGINEER:

                 Our shields did nothing, Sir! Never seen
                 anything like it! Weapons off-line!
                 Main power at 38 percent!

      As the crew regains their footing, the First Officer pulls
      himself to his console, true fear in his eyes as he places an
      inter-ship call -- it's RINGING -- his fear grows with every
      passing RING -- then, we INTERCUT WITH:

24B   INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - MEDICAL BAY - CONTINUOUS [FORMER SC. 26B]   24B

      A WOMAN, 25, answers her communicator -- she lies on an exam
      table, afraid -- and pregnant. This is WINONA.

                   -- what was that-- what's happening?!

      But the First Officer is just relieved that she's still alive:

                                 FIRST OFFICER
                   -- you're okay-- thank God-- where are

                                 WINONA
                   Medical bay-- I had a few close
                   contractions-- I'm fine-- what was that?

                                 FIRST OFFICER
                   Just sit tight-- stay there-- we'll be
                   fine--

      Or maybe not:

                                 OFFICER PITTS
                   They're firing another, Captain!

25    EXT. SPACE - CONTINUOUS                                           25

      ANOTHER NARADA TORPEDO -- it SEPARATES, pieces HIT the Kelvin.

      A FEMALE CREW MEMBER running down the hall suddenly HOLDS ON as
      a HOLE IS RIPPED IN THE HALL -- and she's YANKED OUT OF THE
      CORRIDOR -- the CAMERA finally getting sucked out too!

               FIRST OFFICER                      TACTICAL OFFICER
      -- shields at eleven percent         -- were our shields even up?
      and dropping! Ten percent --         That was like nothing I've
      we're at nine! Eight percent!        ever seen -- this ship can not
      Seven! We're dropping here!          take another hit like that!
      Six!

                                 CAPTAIN ROBAU
                   All remaining power to forward shields!
                   Prepare the shuttles f--

      And he STOPS. They all do. A fucking FACE is now on their
      VIEWSCREEN. A ROMULAN FACE -- the FIRST OFFICER of the Narada,
      whom we'll come to know as AYEL:

                                 AYEL
                   My commander requests the presence of
                   your captain in order to negotiate a
                   cease-fire. You will come aboard our
                   ship via shuttlecraft. Your refusal
                   would be unwise.

      Screen goes DEAD. All eyes on Robau... and he feels them.      A
      tense, horrible moment. Finally, to the First Officer:

                                   CAPTAIN ROBAU
                   Walk with me.

      The First Officer follows Robau OFF THE BRIDGE AND INTO:

26A   INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - CORRIDORS - CONTINUOUS                        26A

      As they walk, briskly:

                                 CAPTAIN ROBAU
                   If I don't report within fifteen minutes,
                   execute general order 13.

                                 FIRST OFFICER
                   Sir, we could issue a mayday call to--

                                 CAPTAIN ROBAU
                           (frightened, but firm)
                   There is no help for us out here. If
                   we're going down, we're taking them with
                   us -- you save as many as you can.

                                             8A
26A   CONTINUED:                                                       26A

                                 FIRST OFFICER
                   ... aye, Captain.

      Robau heads into a waiting TURBOLIFT, turns -- they lock eyes,
      knowing what this means. Finally:

                                 CAPTAIN ROBAU
                   You're Captain now. Mr. Kirk.

      He's gone.   And we realize this is GEORGE KIRK, Jim's father.

26B-C OMIT                                                         26B-C

26D   INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                        26D

      All eyes on Kirk as he enters -- moves to the captain's chair.
      Sits. Not a small moment. Speaking his first words as Captain:

                               GEORGE KIRK
                 Lieutenant Pitts. Transfer Robau's vital
                 signs to the main view screen.

                                OFFICER PITTS
                 Yessir.

      In a moment, Robau's VITAL SIGNS appear on various monitors --
      his HEART RATE, OXYGEN LEVELS, BLOOD PRESSURE, all of it. A LOW-
      PITCHED BEEPBEEP of his HEARTBEAT is now HEARD --

                               SCIENCE OFFICER
                 Vitals on line.

                               GEORGE KIRK
                         (slightly awkward)
                 -- thank you.

26DA INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS                    26DA

      TILT DOWN as the TURBO-LIFT DESCENDS -- we PUSH IN as the doors
      open and Captain Robau gets out -- moves quickly -- hurries down
      a SHUTTLE BAY catwalk --

26DB INT. SHUTTLE - CONTINUOUS [FORMER SC. 26C]                       26DB

      Robau enters a shuttle -- LIGHTS BLINK to life.   He moves to the
      cockpit -- starts the vehicle up --

                               CAPTAIN ROBAU
                 Computer, initiate departure sequence.

      A LOUD HISS and the craft SHUDDERS as it disembarks --

26DC INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                         26DC

      Sparks dripping from the ceiling, everyone is motionless -- eyes
      on the monitors -- and we're TIGHT ON GEORGE KIRK -- the BEEPS
      of Robau's heart might as well be representing his own. He
      realizes he's sweating -- wipes his forehead as:

                               OFFICER PITTS
                 The shuttle's pulling out of main bay,
                 Sir.

                               GEORGE KIRK
                 I want to see him -- floodlights please.

                                            10


26E   EXT. U.S.S. KELVIN - SPACE                                     26E

      Two MASSIVE FLOODLIGHTS on the Kelvin's dish GO HOT -- and turn,
      FLARING out the lens -- landing on the SHUTTLE as it leaves the
      KELVIN, heading toward the imposing Narada.

26EA INT. SHUTTLE - CONTINUOUS                                       26EA

      Backlit by the distant floodlights, Robau remains steely-eyed as
      he moves for the darkened ship -- nerves --

26F   INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - BRIDGE                                    26F

      And Robau's HEARTBEAT QUICKENS -- the tension they all feel:

                               OFFICER PITTS
                 His heart rate's elevated--

                                   HELMSMAN
                 He's scared.

                                 GEORGE KIRK
                 He's brave.    That's what he is.

26FA INT. SHUTTLE - CONTINUOUS                                       26FA

      Robau watches as he gets closer, the BEEPBEEPING HEARD over the
      SOUNDS of the shuttle -- but then --

26FB EXT. NARADA - SPACE - CONTINUOUS                                26FB

      ALL WE HEAR IS THE LOW-PITCHED BEEPBEEP as the small shuttle
      seems to get swallowed up by the massive forward-facing spires
      of the Narada -- the distant floodlights creating EERIE SHADOWS
      everywhere. A gigantic IRIS DOOR TURNS, SLOWLY OPENS -- and the
      shuttle enters the Narada's main HANGAR -- the door CLOSES --

26FC INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                        26FC

      And everyone is just motionless and silent. Only Robau's VITAL
      SIGNS can be HEARD, BEEPING away. George's eyes glued ahead --

26G   INT. SHUTTLE/NARADA HANGAR - CONTINUOUS                        26G

      TIGHT ON ROBAU as he faces the shuttle door, considering his
      fate. Finally the SHUTTLE DOOR OPENS -- standing there are
      eight ROMULAN GUARDS, brandishing WEAPONS. He steps down. They
      grab him, hard -- he's SCANNED -- FRISKED -- PULLED ALONG -- and
      we REVEAL the absolutely MASSIVE HANGAR, the insane architecture
      of the interior of this dark, wet, dripping ship --

                                               11


26H   INT. NARADA BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                                     26H

      Robau is led into the enormous, dark bridge. A dozen Romulans
      at controls. Robau does his level best to portray confidence as
      he is led up a walkway to AYEL. Behind him, sitting silhouetted
      and motionless, turned away and looking off, is his captain. A
      presence always felt in this scene. This is NERO.

      Ayel touches a panel, then THROWS AN IMAGE into the air before
      Robau. A ROTATING HOLOGRAM OF A UNIQUE-LOOKING SPACECRAFT (we
      will refer to it as the JELLYFISH).

                               AYEL
                 Are you familiar with this craft?

      Robau regards it.   Then:

                               CAPTAIN ROBAU
                 Who is your commander?
                         (silence, then re: Nero)
                 Is it him?

                               AYEL
                 You will speak only to me.

                               CAPTAIN ROBAU
                 Then ask your commander what right he has
                 to attack a Federation vessel.

                               AYEL
                 That was hardly an attack. My commander
                 will easily destroy your ship. If you do
                 not respond to the question.

      Robau considers the hologram again.     And what his answer might
      mean for the fate of his crew.

                               CAPTAIN ROBAU
                 I've never seen it. Or any ship like it.

                               AYEL
                 Are you familiar with -- or better, know
                 the location of -- Ambassador Spock?

      Ayel has thrown another HOLOGRAM -- A FLOATING, ROTATING IMAGE
      OF SPOCK, who appears to be 75 earth-years old. The baby, born
      just three years earlier. Robau is as confused as we are...

                               CAPTAIN ROBAU
                 I am unfamiliar with Ambassador Spock.

                               AYEL
                 A final question. What is the current
                 stardate?

                                                12
26H   CONTINUED:                                                         26H

                                 CAPTAIN ROBAU
                           (the fuck?)
                   ... Stardate? ... it's 2233.04.
                           (finally)
                   ... hey, where are you from--?

      Suddenly: TSCHING! Nero's activated his STAFF -- FOUR LARGE,
      HORRIFYING BLADES APPEAR AT THE TIP AND NERO SPRINGS TO LIFE,
      CHARGING ROBAU WITH A ROAR AND ROBAU'S EYES POP HOLY SHIT AND--

26HA INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - BRIDGE                                         26HA

      BLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE... Robau's vitals go dead.      PUSH IN ON
      KIRK as a SCREAMING ALARM IS HEARD --

      TIGHT ON GEORGE as this lands.      More honorable than terrified:

                   -- then I'll do it myself -- get to the

                           (no one moves until:)
                   THAT'S AN ORDER! GO!

      Agony in the faces as they reluctantly hurry off -- Kirk takes
      the Captain's chair, hits the COMLINK:

                   All decks, this is the Captain speaking --

                   I have medical shuttle 37 standing by,

                   Yes -- where are you?

      HOLD ON GEORGE for a moment as he hesitates -- his eyes glued to

                                 WINONA
                   Good-- and George, it's coming-- our
                   baby, it's coming now.

      PUSH IN on him, his heart shattering -- having to out-maneuver
      incoming torpedoes, piloting the ship to its doom -- still, he
      forces optimism:

                   I'll see you in a minute, sweetheart.

      He disconnects -- another ALARM -- he TURNS the ship, FIRES --

                   -- Agh!   That was-- that was a big one!

      Another screen that shows stats of DEPARTING SHUTTLES -- more
      leaving as we glance at the screen -- but SHUTTLE 34 REMAINS
      DOCKED --

      The NARADA is GROWING in the viewscreen -- he hits the comlink:

      Winona PUSHING -- giving birth to their baby -- and we're BACK
      AND FORTH between a husband and wife that will never see each
      other again, MUSIC SWELLING as the Kelvin TURNS HARD, avoiding
      TORPEDOES -- the shuttle BANKING as the Doctor and Nurse help
      Winona -- and we're ON GEORGE as he HEARS A BABY CRYING -- and
      TEARS COME TO HIS EYES -- as he says--

                                GEORGE KIRK
                 Hey!   Hey, so what is it?

                                  WINONA'S VOICE
                 -- it's a boy.

                                GEORGE KIRK
                 It's a boy?   Yeah?

      And now we see Winona, handed this beautiful little boy.   And
      she cries, just looking at him --

                               GEORGE KIRK (CONT'D)
                 Tell me... tell me about him-- please--

                 He's-- he's beautiful, he looks like you.

      Heartsick, George laughs -- glances at the MONITORS -- SELF-
      DESTRUCT COUNTDOWN IS AT T-MINUS 20 SECONDS -- oh God...

                               WINONA (CONT'D)
                 George, you should be here --

                               GEORGE KIRK
                 I know-- so what should we call him, huh?

                               WINONA
                 We could name him after your father.

                               GEORGE KIRK
                 Tiberius? Are you kidding me? No,
                 that's the worst-- we'll name him after
                 your dad-- let's call him Jim.

                                WINONA
                 ... Jim.   Jim it is.

      Through the VIEWSCREEN -- he's ABOUT TO HIT -- the ship ANGLES
      within the enormous Narada blades -- George scared now --

      George's voice goes STATIC -- confusion washes over her face --
      suddenly LIT BY A BRIGHT GLOW -- she looks over, with wet
      devastated eyes --

      -- what she sees is the MASSIVE EXPLOSION -- quickly SUCKED AWAY
      in the vacuum of space -- and she's CRYING -- holding her new
      baby who just lost a father -- his life altered forever...

      ROMULAN DIALOG TO BE WRITTEN) -- we arrive at Nero, who, with
      small specks of HUMAN BLOOD on his face, just STARES at the
      fucking HOLOGRAM OF SPOCK -- he's OBSESSED.

      Ayel works a monitor, yelling out something (in Romulan) to one
      of their men -- and as a result:

      Gargantuan "BLADES" EXTEND from the ship like otherworldly SAILS
      -- and the ship begins to STEADY -- but then ANOTHER SHIP
      APPEARS -- DECLOAKING FROM NOTHINGNESS: a fucking KLINGON VESSEL
      -- then ANOTHER -- AND ANOTHER --

43    INT. NARADA - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                                   43

      And we're on Ayel as he witnesses, on his monitor, ships,
      popping up ALL AROUND THEM -- which is when they HEAR a VOICE --
      speaking KLINGON -- and we SUBTITLE:

                                              19

                                KLINGON VOICE (P.A.)
                  Trespassing vessel: you have entered the
                  jurisdiction of the Klingon Empire.
                  Power down and prepare to be boarded or
                  you will be destroyed.

     Eyes wide, Ayel turns to Nero, still staring at Spock's image:

     And we PUSH IN ON NERO as our MUSIC BUILDS, then we CUT TO:

     CLOSE ON a young VULCAN BOY. 11 years old. SPOCK. He's
     standing in an abstract space -- IMAGES PROJECTED and HOVERING --
     questions -- that he's answering as they appear, then disappear:

             COMPUTER VOICE                           SPOCK
     What is the square root of
     2,396,304?                          -- one-thousand-five-hundered-
                                         forty-eight --
     -- Correct. What is the
     central assumption of Quantum       -- everything that can happen
     Cosmology?                          does happen, in equal and
                                         parallel universes --
     -- Correct. Identify the 20th
     century earth composers of the
     following musical progression:      -- Paul McCartney and John
                                         Lennon.
     -- Correct

     And we find ANOTHER VULCAN CHILD -- then ANOTHER -- all in these
     odd spaces -- until we PULL BACK WIDE to reveal a large Vulcan
     LEARNING CENTER -- white "bowls", sunk into the dark ground,
     where PROFESSORS walk, hands behind their backs, surveying this
     mass "mental martial arts" test.

     We're on ANOTHER VULCAN CHILD as she gets an answer wrong -- AND
     THE LIGHT OVER HER BOWL GOES OUT. Then ANOTHER CHILD -- who
     gets an answer wrong -- and HIS LIGHT GOES OUT. An EXTREMELY
     WIDE OVERHEAD SHOT reveals BOWL AFTER BOWL as the LIGHTS GO OUT.

                                               20
45   CONTINUED:                                                         45

     Until only one bowl remains. Spock's. He finishes his last
     question. Gets it right. PUSH IN ON HIM as the COMPUTER SAYS:

                                COMPUTER VOICE
                  Your score is one-hundred percent.
                  Congratulations. Spock.

     Off his face, we CUT TO MOMENTS LATER, as Spock collects his
     things. As he does, three young VULCAN BULLIES walk up behind
     him. Spock glances at them, then back to his things.

                                YOUNG SPOCK
                  I presume you've prepared new insults for
                  today.

                                VULCAN BULLY #1
                  Your mother lies with many men.

     Spock just NODS.   Tries to ignore the fact that IT STINGS.

                                YOUNG SPOCK
                  I have no such information.

                                VULCAN BULLY #2
                  You are neither human, nor Vulcan -- and
                  therefore, have no place in the universe.

                                YOUNG SPOCK
                          (swallowing that too)
                  This is your thirty-fifth attempt to
                  elicit an emotional response from me.
                  Logic dictates you would cease by now.

                               VULCAN BULLY #1
                  Look. He has human eyes. They look sad,
                  don't they?

                                VULCAN BULLY #2
                  Perhaps an emotional response requires
                  physical stimuli.

     And Bully #2 PUSHES Spock -- who stumbles back, almost falling
     into one of the bowls. He looks up as:

                                VULCAN BULLY #2 (CONT'D)
                  He's a traitor, you know. Your father.
                  For marrying her.

     Spock stares -- we see him fighting the urge, but he's unable --
     AND HE CHARGES THE BULLY AND TACKLES HIM INTO THE BOWL! They
     land inside -- Spock cries, flailing as he punches Bully #2!
     The other two stand atop the bowl, stunned -- shocked -- unsure
     what the hell to do -- and we CUT TO:

                                              21


46   INT. LEARNING CENTER - CORRIDOR - LATER                             46

     TIGHT ON Spock, chastened, sitting glumly on a bench. A massive
     VULCAN CITY seen through the window behind him. His parents
     ARGUE at a distance down the hall:

                 AMANDA                                SAREK
     -- where I'm from, when
     someone hits you, you hit back-
     - how is that not logical?         -- Spock had no reasonable
     -- They pick on him -- they        expectation of being
     tease him -- every day.            physically injured --
                                        -- Which is precisely when
                                        reason must guide his actions
     -- I want him to embrace           above all.
     Vulcan, you know that... but
     he has to be himself-- which
     means, occasionally, being         -- His "humanity" is very the
     human.                             source of his ostracism.
     -- When Vulcans get disgusted
     with each other, they never
     just walk away, do they?           -- No.
     -- Well humans do.

     And Amanda walks away, leaving Sarek standing there. He turns --
     sees his son down the corridor. Approaches. And we're PUSHING
     IN on Spock, studying the fear in his eyes. His father stops in
     front of him, looming there, looking down stoically:

                              YOUNG SPOCK
                I did not mean to create conflict between
                you and mother.

     After a beat, Sarek seems to soften a little.     No anger in his
     face. Takes a seat beside his son...

                              SAREK
                In marriage... conflict is...

                                YOUNG SPOCK
                ... constant?

                              SAREK
                Natural.
                        (a beat)
                Emotions run deep within our race. In
                many ways, more deeply than in humans.
                Long ago, they nearly destroyed us...
                that is why we followed the teachings of
                Surak. Now you must choose.

                              YOUNG SPOCK
                ... between you and mother?

                                SAREK
                  Never, my son. But you may choose the
                  ethic of logic. Logic offers a serenity
                  humans seldom experience. The control of
                  feelings... so that they do not control
                  you.

                                 YOUNG SPOCK
                  They called you a traitor.
                          (then)
                  You suggest that I should be completely
                  Vulcan... and yet you married a human...
                  why?

     Sarek is clearly conflicted by this.      But he holds steady:

                                SAREK
                  As Ambassador to Earth, my duty is to
                  observe and understand human behavior.
                  Marrying your mother... was logical.
                          (Spock seems disquieted)
                  Spock. You are fully capable of choosing
                  your own destiny. The question you are
                  faced with... is which path you will
                  take. This is something only you can
                  decide.

47   EXT. IOWA FARMHOUSE - DAY                                             47

     BAM -- a door opens: 14 year-old GEORGE KIRK, JR. angrily exits
     the house, carrying a duffel. His angrier, redneckier UNCLE
     FRANK following. 11 year-old JIM KIRK nervously pursues them:

                                UNCLE FRANK
                  Go ahead: go-- run away! You know I
                  could give a damn!

                                  YOUNG KIRK
                  -- wait-- no!    Where are you going?

                                GEORGE JR.
                  Anywhere but here, far as I can get!

                                UNCLE FRANK
                  Which won't be far enough -- know what
                  your problem is?!
                          (big luggie spit)
                  No one ever taught you respect! How to
                  follow orders! Do as you're told!
                          (to Jim)
                  -- what the hell are you doing?

                                YOUNG KIRK
                  I-- I just don't want my brother to go.

                                            23
47    CONTINUED:                                                      47

                                 UNCLE FRANK
                   Well I do-- and I asked you to wash the
                   car! How many damn times do I need to
                   repeat myself?! How many damn times?
                   How many?

      A glare to George and Frank walks off. Jim nervously follows
      his brother, pulling out a small, FLOATING DISC --

                                 YOUNG KIRK
                   Please stay-- you can have my Flo-Yo!

      George hits it away:

                                  GEORGE JR.
                   This isn't about toys, it's Uncle Frank.
                   I can't take him anymore -- Mom has no
                   idea what he's like when she's not here--
                   d'you hear him talking like he's our
                   dad?! And that's not even his car you're
                   washing! That was Dad's car! You know
                   why you're washing it? Because he's
                   gonna sell it!

                                 JIM
                   Don't leave -- okay? We can tell Mom
                   when she gets back from Africa.

                                  GEORGE JR.
                   She's gone for five more months, by then
                   I'll be in a different system.
                           (sees fear in Kirk)
                   You're gonna be okay. You always are.
                   Always doing everything right -- good
                   grades and obeying every stupid order...
                           (then)
                   I can't be a Kirk in this house. Show me
                   how to do that and I'll stay.

      But Jim can offer nothing. George gives him a quick hug and
      walks off. Jim sadly watches his brother go.

47A   EXT. IOWA FARMHOUSE - DAY                                       47A

      Kirk washes a VINTAGE CORVETTE. Red, white top. Dumping the
      sponge in bucket, he's sadly cleaning, his mind spinning over
      his brother's departure. Devastated.

      And he's wiping the soapy passenger window (SQEEEEEEAK!) with
      the sponge, when he STOPS -- seeing the KEYS in the ignition.
      PUSH IN ON HIS FACE as a devilish idea comes to his mind. PRE-
      LAP A LOUD SCREECH and we CUT TO:

48-49 OMIT                                                          48-49

50    EXT. IOWA FARMHOUSE - DAY - LATER                                 50

      THE CORVETTE BLASTS ONTO SCREEN, FISHTAILING ONTO THE ROAD,
      young Jim Kirk behind the wheel (NOTE: The SOUND of the engine
      is a metallic WHIR -- not a gas engine). TIGHT ON JIM'S FACE as
      he drives -- having never done this before, he's as nervous as
      he is determined --

50A   EXT. IOWA ROAD - DAY - LATER                                     50A

      The CORVETTE SPEEDS -- while inside the car, Jim turns on the
      updated, modified RADIO -- scans stations, momentarily losing
      control of the car -- but he's back on track as he finds a HARD
      ROCK SONG -- and HE'S STARTING TO FUCKING LOVE IT -- PILOTING
      SOMETHING THIS FAST FEELS GOOD.

      He reaches for a CONVERTIBLE ROOF latch -- then the other -- but
      with the speed he's driving, THE ROOF RIPS RIGHT OFF THE FUCKING
      CAR -- Jim glances back, wide-eyed -- and the roof TUMBLES
      through the air, landing on the road -- and we PUSH AND ARC
      AROUND, as a POLICE OFFICER runs out from taking a roadside PISS
      -- he races back, jumps on his HOVERCRUISER and TAKES OFF --
      SPEEDING AFTER HIM, SIREN BLARING!

      BACK IN THE CORVETTE -- BLOOPBLOOP!!! -- Jim's eyes dart to the
      REARVIEW as the cruiser WEAVES behind him -- then PULLS UP
      BESIDE HIM -- the COP sees a CHILD driving and is AMAZED -- he
      calls through his PA:

                               COP
                 Son, you pull over that car!

      But Jim just BLASTS the RADIO LOUDER:

                               JIM
                 I CAN'T HEAR YOU!

51    EXT. IOWA ROAD - CONTINUOUS                                       51

      George, bag over shoulder, thumb out. He turns at the SOUND of
      the SIREN -- sees what's approaching... that car... looks...
      familiar... and the THE CORVETTE SHOOTS PAST HIM, JIM AT THE
      WHEEL -- then the POLICE HOVERCRUISER! George runs into the
      middle of the road, mouth agape --

                                 GEORGE JR.
                 -- no... way.

      Back at the Corvette, Jim YANKS the steering wheel TOWARD THE
      COP -- who RISES to avoid the Corvette, which SCREECHES onto a
      perpendicular DIRT ROAD, kicking up wild dust as the Cop ARCS
      QUICKLY to follow --

                                           25
51   CONTINUED:                                                       51

     Jim is now officially LOVING THIS -- and he DRIVES THROUGH a
     FENCE -- CRASH! The Cop RACES through it, in the Corvette's
     DUST -- and we PUSH IN on a SIGN that reads "DANGER - QUARRY
     AHEAD -- IOWA MINING CO." In fact --

52   EXT. QUARRY - CONTINUOUS                                          52

     We see the MASSIVE QUARRY -- hundreds of feet deep -- and TILT
     UP to the Corvette and Cop speeding toward it --

53   INT. CORVETTE - MOVING - CONTINUOUS                               53

     KIRK, EYES INTENSE, ALMOST SUICIDAL -- this is where he's been
     headed all along -- and for a moment we think holy shit -- this
     is how James Kirk dies. He speeds toward the edge -- CLOSER --
     CLOSER -- but at the last second, Kirk SLAMS the brake -- the
     car SKIDS -- PIVOTS -- and he LEAPS FROM THE CAR, WHICH SAILS
     SIDEWAYS OFF THE CLIFF EDGE -- FALLING... falling... the COP
     comes to QUICK a STOP in CLOUDS of DUST as the Corvette EXPLODES
     ON THE QUARRY FLOOR --

     The angry Cop hops off his hovercruiser, hand on weapon, as Jim
     Kirk, out of breath, exhilarated, gets to his knees.

                                COP
                  What's your name, son?

     And as he stands, we PUSH IN on him -- LOW and WIDE -- damn if
     that kid doesn't have a swagger. It's like the first time he's
     ever stood in his life.

                                JIM
                  My name's Kirk. James Tiberius Kirk.

     And as our MUSIC BUILDS we CUT TO:

54   EXT. RURA PENTHE- MINING QUARRY - NIGHT [FORMER OMIT]             54

     CONSTANT SHOCKS OF LIGHT as an ALIEN PRISONER -- intelligent, bi-
     pedal, but with FOUR TERRIFIED EYES -- is SLAMMED DOWN onto the
     wet pavement -- a CHOKE STICK SHOVED under his chin -- then:
     VOICES. Brutal, guttural KLINGON --

                                KLINGON GUARD (O.S.)
                          (SUBTITLED)
                  You say they are not yours...

     WHIP PAN TO SEE the scary KLINGON GUARDS -- four of them --
     standing above the Alien -- chilling MASKS hide their hideous
     faces -- and one holds a FLUORESCENT SET OF PAGES --

                                KLINGON GUARD (CONT'D)
                  ... these Federation maps we found in
                  your pockets.

      And the ALIEN SPEAKS -- an UNKNOWN LANGUAGE -- all eyes wild:

                                 ALIEN
                           (SUBTITLED)
                   I speak the truth. I do.

                                 KLINGON GUARD
                   Then who are they for?

      But the Alien just SHAKES HIS HEAD, afraid -- he will not talk.
      So they GRAB HIM AND YANK HIM UPWARD --

                                 KLINGON GUARD (CONT'D)
                   You would rather die then tell us?

      PUSH IN TIGHT as the Alien finally WHISPERS, terrified:

                                 ALIEN
                   ... NERO!!!

      And the Guards look at each other... seemingly with concern...

      MOMENTS LATER EIGHT GUARDS WALK TOGETHER -- and we PAN WITH THEM
      to reveal the HORRIFYING EXPANSE THAT IS THE KLINGON PRISON
      YARD. We realize that the constant shocks of light was
      LIGHTNING, that apparently never stops here. A SUPER READS:
      "RURA PENTHE - KLINGON PRISON ASTEROID". And we see they're
      heading for a MUSCULAR FIGURE, using a SLEDGE HAMMER, SPLITTING
      ROCKS, lit brilliantly by the lightning strikes. BOOM UP to
      find that it's NERO. And he stops, SENSING the coming Guards.
      And he manages a small smile. And he QUICKLY TURNS to them --
      THEY ALL STOP, SUDDENLY. Afraid of him. One of them tosses
      Nero a set of MANACLES. Nero picks them up. Puts them on. And
      offers his cuffed hands, willingly.

54A   INT. RURA PENTHE - HOLDING BLOCK - NIGHT [FORMER SC. 64B]        54A

      Guards drag Nero through the massive pyramidal structure...

54B   INT. RURA PENTHE - INTERROGATION CELL - NIGHT [FORMER SC. 64C]   54B

      Nero's ARMS AND LEGS get STRAPPED IN TIGHT. Go WIDE to reveal
      he's pinned to an interrogation table -- three GUARDS. A
      KLINGON INTERROGATOR approaches; looms over Nero, studying the
      Romulan's face with clinical detachment...

                                  KLINGON INTERROGATOR
                           (SUBTITLED KLINGON)
                   I have come far to meet you. "The One

                   time to maintain silence.
                           (beat)
                   Perhaps you simply do not speak Klingon,
                   just as I do not speak Romulan.

                   But I assume we both speak the language
                   of our common enemy.

      (NOTE: FROM NOW ON, OUR NON-ENGLISH SPEAKERS WILL SPEAK ENGLISH,
      UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.) He reveals a worn LEATHER JOURNAL.
      Opens it, flips through it almost casually... we see SKETCHES of
      the JELLYFISH SHIP, PAGES OF COMPLICATED MATH EQUATIONS...

                                 KLINGON INTERROGATOR (CONT'D)
                   We found this book in your cell.
                   Cartography, mathematics-- what do these
                   mean? This date here -- eleven years
                   from now-- what happens then?
                           (holds up the
                            FLUORESCENT MAPS)
                   And why attempt to smuggle in maps of
                   Federation space?

      Nero's face betrays nothing; no fear, no doubt. Cold as fucking
      ice.   The Interrogator happens to stare at a page in the book:
      A DRAWING OF SPOCK. He closes the book.

                                 KLINGON INTERROGATOR (CONT'D)
                   When you were captured we assumed you
                   were a spy, sent from Romulus to surveil
                   the Empire. But because the Romulans
                   deny your existence, I believe you are
                   much more than that.

      Interrogator looks over to the Guards, nods. A Guard approaches
      with some kind of GLASS CONTAINER; we HEAR something wet FLIP-
      FLOPPING around inside, but we can't SEE what it is.

                                 KLINGON INTERROGATOR (CONT'D)
                   Your ship remains in orbit above us now.
                   We've been asking for its secrets for too
                   long. That is why I am here. We want to
                   know how it works and I believe now,
                   finally... you will tell us.

      A Guard uses TONGS to pull out the most DISGUSTING creature
      you've seen from the container: a SLUG with SUCKERS and spikes,
      covered in a grimy muck -- it FLIP FLOPS.

      Another Guard SHOVES THE THING INTO NERO'S MOUTH -- Nero keeps
      his eyes open -- furiously determined not to be broken -- as
      they FORCE HIM TO SWALLOW IT -- he DOESN'T SCREAM as the
      wretched thing makes its way down his esophagus and into his
      stomach --

                 They try to claw and bite their way out
                 of any dark space they're in.

      Nero stares at the ceiling in HORRIFYING INTERNAL PAIN -- but
      straining to block it out. PUSH DOWN on Nero's wide, crazed
      eyes -- TIGHTER as we SLOWLY DISSOLVE TO SEE WHAT HE'S SEEING --
      WHAT'S KEEPING HIM FROM LOSING HIS MIND -- DREAMLIKE, ETHEREAL
      IMAGES OF A WOMAN -- HER BEAUTIFUL, SMILING FACE -- SHE'S
      ROMULAN -- LOOKING AT US, EYES FULL OF LOVE -- AND SHE TURNS AND
      WE SEE SHE'S PREGNANT -- AND AS OUR MUSIC BUILDS, WE CUT TO:

57    INT. VULCAN SCIENCE ACADEMY - COUNCIL ANTE-CHAMBER - DAY           57

      Quiet. A waiting area. AMANDA, Spock's mother, stands alone in
      a passageway. She looks off-camera to her son:

                               AMANDA
                 Spock, come here, let me see you.

                                   SPOCK (O.S.)
                          (beat)
                 No.

                                   AMANDA
                 Spock.

      Reluctantly, Spock walks into frame. She begins adjusting his
      collar. This is our ADULT SPOCK. Gripped by anxiety but trying
      like hell to look impassive.

                               AMANDA (CONT'D)
                 There is no need to be so anxious.
                 You'll do fine.

                               SPOCK
                 I am hardly "anxious", mother.
                         (beat, then, anxiously)
                 And "fine" has variable definitions.
                 "Fine" is unacceptable.

      She just smiles as she works his collar. He sees this and    it
      annoys him. He tries to move her hands away, to stop with    his
      collar -- his annoyance, her love for him, all sweet-- but   he
      doesn't let go of her hands. A meaningful silence between    them.

                                                 29

                                SPOCK (CONT'D)
                  May I ask a personal query?

                                  AMANDA
                  ... anything.

                                SPOCK
                  Should I choose to complete the Vulcan
                  discipline of Kolinahr... and purge all
                  emotion... I trust you will not feel it
                  reflects judgement upon you.

     She stares at him, moved.      Touches his face.

                                AMANDA
                  As always... whoever you choose to be...
                  you will have a proud mother.

     HOLD on mother and son, worlds apart but forever bonded:

58   INT. VULCAN SCIENCE ACADEMY - COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY                  58

     An imposing yet BEAUTIFUL INDOOR ATRIUM. Spock stands before
     the VULCAN HIGH COUNCIL. Among faces on the dais: his FATHER,
     seated beside the SCIENCE MINISTER and other VULCAN LEADERS.

                                SCIENCE MINISTER
                  You have surpassed the expectations of
                  your instructors. Your final record is
                  flawless. With one exception. I see you
                  have applied to Starfleet as well.

                                SPOCK
                  It was logical to cultivate multiple
                  options.

                                SCIENCE MINISTER
                  Logical but unnecessary. You are hereby
                  accepted to the Vulcan Science Academy.
                  A distinction all the more significant
                  given that you will be its first half-
                  human pupil. It is truly remarkable,
                  Spock. That you have achieved so much
                  despite your disadvantage. Welcome to
                  the Academy.

     They all start to rise.      But Spock is suddenly unsettled:

                                SPOCK
                  If you would clarify, Minister-- what
                  "disadvantage" are you referring to?

                                SCIENCE MINISTER
                  ... your human mother.

                                               30
58   CONTINUED:                                                         58

     As the council disperses, we PUSH IN on Spock's face -- the same
     look he had when he took punches as a kid. He glances at his
     father to say something, but Sarek's the consummate diplomat.
     His eyes command: remain calm. Spock STRUGGLES... then makes
     the first spontaneous -- human -- decision of his life --

                                SPOCK
                  Council -- ministers.    I must decline.

     Everyone STOPS.   A solid BEAT.   Confused looks turn cold:

                                SCIENCE MINISTER
                  No Vulcan has ever declined admission to
                  this academy.

                                SPOCK
                  Then as I am half-human, your record
                  remains untarnished.

                  SAREK                               SPOCK
     Spock. You have made a
     commitment to honor the Vulcan       At the moment, Father, I can
     way--                                think of no greater way to
                                          honor our race than to attend
                                          Starfleet as its first Vulcan.

                                 SCIENCE MINISTER
                  Why did you come before this council
                  today? Was it to satisfy your emotional
                  need to rebel?

                                SPOCK
                  I came with the intention of enrolling,
                  as my father wished. However, your
                  "insight" has convinced me otherwise.
                  Therefore, the only emotion I wish to
                  convey is gratitude. Thank you,
                  Ministers, for your consideration.
                          (a contained "fuck you")
                  Live long and prosper.

     He looks to his father, whose disappointment is evident --
     still, God bless him, Spock walks out --

59   EXT. "THE WARP TRAIL" BAR - IOWA - NIGHT                              59

     -- PUSH DOWN A HALLWAY -- MUSIC HEARD -- what seems like a PARTY
     is going on through windows in the double-doors ahead -- and a
     WOMAN SWOOPS INTO VIEW in front of us -- we PUSH BEHIND HER in
     the short skirt and high boots as she ENTERS the place -- a
     local, busy BAR -- the woman makes her way to the BAR, and we
     see her GORGEOUS, DIGNIFIED FACE. THIS IS UHURA. She leans
     into the bartender warmly, her smile glorious:

59   CONTINUED:                                                    59

                                UHURA
                  Hi. I'd like a Klabnian Fire Tea, two
                  Cardassian Sunrises and three Earth
                  beers, no slim-shots, anything on draft.

                                VOICE (O.S.)
                  That's a lot of drinks for one woman.
                  Wearing those boots.

     JAMES KIRK'S FACE leans in: at 22, he's charming, witty,
     dangerous, rebellious. He grins at her, flirty. Uhura gives
     him a look, then back to the bartender:

                                UHURA
                  And a shot of Jack, straight up.

                                KIRK
                          (to the bartender)
                  Make it two -- her shot's on me.

                                UHURA
                  Her shot's on her. Thanks but no thanks.

                                KIRK
                  Don't you want my name before you
                  completely reject me?

                                UHURA
                  I'm good without it.

     Damn, he likes her already.

                                KIRK
                  You are good without it. It's Jim. Jim
                  Kirk.
                          (long beat)
                  If you don't tell me your name, I'm gonna
                  have to make one up.

                                    UHURA
                           (beat)
                  Uhura.

                                KIRK
                  Uhura? No way -- that's the name I was
                  gonna make up for you. Uhura what?

                                    UHURA
                  Just Uhura.

                                KIRK
                  They don't have last names in your world?

                              UHURA
                Uhura is my last name.

                              KIRK
                They don't have first names in your
                world? Wait, let me guess. Is it "Jim"?

     That makes her smile.    So he moves closer to her:

                              KIRK (CONT'D)
                Okay, so you're a cadet. Studying.
                What's your focus?

                              UHURA
                Xenolinguistics. Lemme guess: you don't
                know what that means.

                              KIRK
                Let me guess: study of Alien languages:
                phonology, morphology, syntax-- it means
                you've got a talented tongue.

                              UHURA
                And for a moment I thought you were just
                a dumb hick who only has sex with farm
                animals.

                                KIRK
                Well.    Not only.

                              UHURA
                You think you're smart.

                              KIRK
                Oh, baby, I'm the smartest.

     Something sad in that.    A BURLY STARFLEET CADET appears.

                              BURLY CADET
                This guy bothering you?

                              UHURA
                Beyond belief, but nothing I can't
                handle.

                              KIRK
                You could handle me.    That's an
                invitation.

     The Burly Cadet spins Kirk around:

                                BURLY CADET
                Hey.    You mind your manners.

                At ease, Cup Cake, it was a joke.     Like
                your hairline.

     Uhura turns back.    The other cadets, seeing trouble, approach.

                              UHURA
                Hey -- Jim: enough.

                                   BURLY CADET
                What was that?

                              KIRK
                You heard me, Moon Beam.

                              BURLY CADET
                You know how to count farm boy?    There's
                five of us... and one of you.

                              KIRK
                Okay, so go get some more guys, come back
                and it'll be an even fight.

     The cadet swings his fist but Kirk HEADBUTTS HIS HAND, BREAKING
     IT -- another Cadet PUNCHES KIRK, then THROWS HIM into a table,
     which Kirk FLIES OVER, landing hard -- another Cadet GRABS HIM,
     pulls him up -- Kirk SLAMS FIVE FAST PUNCHES that send the Cadet
     back -- when ANOTHER CADET PUNCHES HIM -- yet another HOLDS KIRK
     -- and that last punch is repeated THREE-- then FOUR times --

                                   UHURA
                Enough!    STOP!

     Another punch and Kirk FLIES TO THE FLOOR - he's out of it, but
     won't give up. The Cadets UNLEASH on him and really PUMMEL HIM -
     - and Kirk's spirited, but LOSING -- about to LOSE BAD -- when
     an EAR-SPLITTING WHISTLE makes everything STOP -- they turn --
     standing in the doorway is a tall, rugged Starfleet officer --
     CAPTAIN CHRISTOPHER PIKE.

                              PIKE
                Outside, all of you!       NOW!

     The cadets file out, in for it. Pike moves to a dazed, semi-
     conscious Kirk, now upside down on a table.

                              PIKE (CONT'D)
                Y'alright, Son?

                              KIRK
                You can... whistle really loud, y'know
                that?

     -- and Kirk PASSES OUT.

     HIGH WIDE OVERHEAD SHOT of the almost-closed bar. Only Kirk and
     Pike sit here at a table. Kirk's bloodied, tissue in his nose.

                              PIKE
                I couldn't believe when the bartender
                told me who you are.

                              KIRK
                ... and who am I, Captain Pike?

                              PIKE
                Your father's son.
                        (then, smiles)
                For my dissertation, I was assigned the
                U.S.S. Kelvin. Something I admired about
                your dad... he didn't believe in no-win
                scenarios.

                              KIRK
                He sure learned his lesson.

                               PIKE
                Depends on how you define winning.
                You're here, aren't you?
                        (off Kirk's look)
                That instinct to leap without looking--
                that was his nature, too. And in my
                opinion it's something Starfleet has
                lost. We're admirable, respectable. But
                overly-disciplined.
                        (beat)
                Those cadets you took on, they'll make
                competent officers -- but you can bet
                your ass they'll run home to momma the
                minute they're looking down the barrel of
                a Klingon phaser cannon.

                              KIRK
                -- why are you talking to me?

                              PIKE
                I looked up your file while you were
                drooling on the floor. Your aptitude
                tests were off the charts-- what is it,
                d'you like being the only Genius Level
                repeat-offender in the midwest?

                              KIRK
                Maybe I love it.

                                 PIKE
                  So your daddy dies... you can settle for
                  a less-than-ordinary life.
                          (beat)
                  Or do you feel like you're meant for
                  something better? Something special?

     And that just hangs there for a beat. Because Pike just hit a
     nerve. Kirk does his best not to show it -- still absent-
     mindedly fiddling with STARFLEET SHIP SALT AND PEPPER SHAKERS.

                                KIRK
                  Come to think of it, I do want to feel
                  special. You know what? I'm gonna go
                  start a book club--

                                PIKE
                  Enlist in Starfleet.

                                KIRK
                  Enlist. You must be way down on your
                  recruiting quota for the month--

                                PIKE
                  If you're half the man your father was,
                  Jim, Starfleet could use you. You could
                  be an officer in four years, have your
                  own ship in eight.

     He's getting under Kirk's skin -- but Kirk keeps up the 'tude,
     grabs his jacket, stands --

                                KIRK
                  We're even, right?   I can go.

                  Riverside shipyard. Shuttle for new
                  recruits leaves tomorrow, 0800.
                          (Kirk turns, Pike grabs
                           him)
                  Your father was Captain of a Starship.
                  For twelve minutes. I dare you to do
                  better.

     Eyes lock... and it's now Pike who stands and walks off.   And
     that's where it hangs. Off Kirk, brooding...

62   EXT. IOWA PLAINS - SUNRISE                                        62

     CORN STALKS whipping by -- Kirk on his SPOKELESS MOTORCYCLE
     rocketing across the plains -- his soul's been stirred and he's
     fighting it -- he cranks it, ELECTRIC ENGINE SCREAMING --

63   EXT. STARFLEET CONSTRUCTION YARD - SUNRISE                       63

     Kirk pulls up to us, kills the bike. Camera starts to MOVE
     AROUND HIM -- he's dramatically BACKLIT and we COME AROUND for
     an INCREDIBLE REVEAL of a SHIPYARD -- at its center, the
     skeletal frame of a NEW SHIP under arclights. UNMISTAKABLY, THE
     U.S.S. ENTERPRISE. Unformed, raw, like its future captain. Our
     MUSIC SWELLS, we PUSH IN ON HIM, considering Pike's offer, his
     future, his fate.

64   EXT. STARFLEET SHIPYARD - MORNING                                64

     The shipyard is abuzz with activity -- cadets loading into a
     shuttle -- and Pike, staring off, waiting. The PILOT
     approaches:

                              SHUTTLE PILOT
                Waiting for something, Cap?

                               PIKE
                ... No.   Guess not.

     He climbs in. The pilot rapidly flips through switches, running
     a pre-flight sequence. Pike straps in. Glances through the
     viewshield... SEES SOMETHING... and he smiles. From his POV:
     KIRK on his MOTORCYCLE, driving into the shipyard --

                              PIKE (CONT'D)
                Hold her a second...

     Kirk rides past a WATERFALL of cooling tanks -- stops the bike
     near the shuttle -- steps off, has nothing -- no bags -- just
     the clothes on his back.

                              SHIPYARD WORKER
                Nice ride, man.

     Kirk kicks the stand, tosses the guy the startcard --

                               KIRK
                Live it up.

     Kirk walks past the startled worker and approaches Pike.

                               KIRK (CONT'D)
                Four years?   I'm gonna do it in three.

     Pike grins as Kirk passes him.

     Inside the shuttle, Kirk moves down rows of new recruits, some
     of them ALIEN. Passes UHURA and the BARFIGHT CADETS, who PERK
     UP when they see him -- one has a BANDAGED HAND.

                  At ease, Gentlemen.
                          (then, to Uhura)
                  Never did get that first name.

                                UHURA
                          (can't help it: a grin)
                  And you never will.

     He smiles as he takes a seat at the back of the shuttle.   Straps
     in as it RISES...

                                MAN'S VOICE
                  Are you people deaf? I told you I don't
                  need a doctor, damnit! I AM A DOCTOR!

     Kirk turns to see a MAN being forced OUT of the BATHROOM by a
     FEMALE FLIGHT OFFICER -- at 34, he has a Southern lilt and looks
     like a prisoner waiting for the guillotine to fall:

             FLIGHT OFFICER                          MAN
     -- you need to find a seat --     -- I had one, in the bathroom,
                                       Darlin', with no windows --
     -- Sir, for your own safety,      -- I suffer from Aviaphobia,
     siddown, or I will MAKE you       case you don't understand big
     sit down... do you hear me?       words, it means 'fear of dying
     RIGHT NOW.                        in something that flies.'

     They GLARE at each other, then the man drops into the seat
     beside Kirk. The ship TORQUES to one side and the man GRIPS his
     armrests, pale, sweating -- glances at Kirk:

                                MAN
                  I might throw up on you.

                                KIRK
                  I think these things're pretty safe--

                                MAN
                  Don't pander to me, kid: one tiny crack
                  in the hull and our blood boils in
                  thirteen seconds -- solar flare might
                  crop up, cook us in our seats -- Hell,
                  some of the damn passengers are blue.
                  And wait'll you're sitting pretty with a
                  case of Andorian shingles, see if you're
                  still so relaxed when your eyeballs are
                  bleeding-- space is disease and danger,
                  wrapped in darkness and silence.

                                KIRK
                  I hate to break this to you, but
                  Starfleet operates in space.

64F   INT. NERO'S CELL - NIGHT                                         64F

      Nero lies on the floor of his cell, semi-conscious, looking like
      death. Behind him the DOOR OPENS. Two KLINGON GUARDS enter,
      backlit.

                               KLINGON GUARD #1
                 The day you've been waiting for is upon
                 us, Silent One. And look. No sign of
                 salvation. No sign of change. Just more
                 pain.

      And they both lift his limp body up -- as something miraculous
      happens -- NERO SNAPS TO LIFE AND SINGLE-HANDEDLY BEATS THE SHIT
      OUT OF THE GUARDS -- TAKING THEM BOTH DOWN IN TEN SECONDS -- in
      what seems like an instant, he's the only one standing here --
      holding both of the Guards' rifles -- which he TWIRLS, badass.

64G   INT. AYEL'S CELL - NIGHT                                         64G

      PUSH IN ON THE DOOR as it opens -- Ayel, chained, looks up,
      intensely -- and sees that it's NERO who has arrived -- we PUSH
      IN TIGHT ON HIM as he SPEAKS FOR THE FIRST TIME:

                               NERO
                 The wait is over.

      TILT DOWN from a GLIMMERING BUILDING TO REVEAL a sea of RED
      CADET UNIFORMS: HUNDREDS OF CADETS head across campus, McCoy and
      Kirk among them. A miraculous view of San Francisco beneath a
      blue sky, Golden Gate Bridge piercing the air. Kirk struts:

                               KIRK
                 So you'll do it for me, right?

                               MCCOY
                 I have no interest.

                               KIRK
                 I didn't ask if you have interest, I
                 asked if you'd do it.

                               MCCOY
                 I'm about to ask you an obvious question:
                 why bother?

                               KIRK
                 Because I've failed the test twice.

                               MCCOY
                 And you're determined to make it three.
                 We've all failed it-- everyone has, and
                 that's the point! No one goes back for
                 seconds, let alone thirds -- it's not
                 like you need to pass it to graduate.

                               KIRK
                 So Bones: why do they make us take it?

                               MCCOY
                 I told you to stop calling me that.
                 You're very annoying.

                               KIRK
                 And you're the greatest -- thank you.

                               MCCOY
                 You'd better study for it this time.

                   be-- no idea.

      And with a smile, Kirk heads off -- McCoy watches him go,
      calling after him:

      In MOONLIGHT, a beautiful WOMAN lies on her back, in some kind

      Gaila reaches over, turns on the light and we realize: SHE'S

                   I say "I love you", and you say "I sent

     Kirk falls, lands hard on the floor, SCRAMBLES under the bed as
     Gaila's roommate enters -- UHURA. Dropping her backpack:

                  just catching up on some rest. Tired.
                          (fake yawn)
                  That's all.

     Uhura watches her.   Her eyes narrow.

                                UHURA
                  Were you running simulations with the
                  mouth-breather hiding under the bed?

     Gaila freezes, caught.   Uhura looks down, Kirk PEERS OUT.

                                KIRK
                  Your hearing is scary-- you sure both
                  your parents are human?

                                UHURA
                  The hell are you doing with him in here?

                  GAILA                              JIM
     I can't help it! I love him!      Gaila loves me--

                                UHURA (CONT'D)
                  Get outta here -- it's my ass too if
                  administration catches you in this dorm.

                                KIRK

                        (pushing him out)
                You're gonna fail.

                              KIRK
                If I pass, will you tell me your first
                name?

                               UHURA
                No.   Good night.

                              KIRK
                        (quiet, tries to charm)
                I think the fact that you picked up a
                transmission of a Klingon prison escape
                is very interesting.

     SHE CLOSES THE DOOR ON HIM and we CUT TO:

     Dead silence on the bridge... all eyes on the VIEWSCREENS: empty

     Ayel studies his console, hope in his eyes.     Quietly:

                Captain... long range scans of Beta

      Ayel hides his disappointment behind his eyes as suddenly -- A
      LIGHTNING STORM -- impossibly, from nowhere -- LOTS OF IT -- and
      through the lightning erupts THE JELLYFISH -- THE SHIP NERO HAS
      BEEN LOOKING FOR DECADES.

                                   NERO (CONT'D)
                   Welcome back.    Spock.

      And we won't know where we are as MUSIC BUILDS and we CUT TO:

81A   INT. U.S.S. TRAINER - BRIDGE - SPACE     [FORMER SC. 65]            81A

      Uhura TURNS TO US, at her comm station -- PUSH IN on her.     She
      seems wildly BORED and almost RESENTFUL:

                                 UHURA
                   -- we are receiving a distress signal
                   from the U.S.S. Kobayashi Maru. The ship
                   has lost power and is stranded.
                   Starfleet Command has ordered us to
                   rescue them.

      WHIP TO THE COMMAND CHAIR, where KIRK captains the battered
      bridge. Confident -- cocky:

                                 KIRK
                   "Starfleet Command has ordered us to
                   rescue them... Captain."

      She glares, turns away.      Then McCoy, at a console, reports:

                                 MCCOY
                   Klingon vessels have entered the Neutral
                   Zone. And they are firing upon us.

                                   KIRK
                   That's okay.

      McCoy and Uhura -- and the others -- look at him, confused.

                                   MCCOY
                   It's okay?

                                 KIRK
                   Yeah, don't worry about it.

      McCoy and Uhura share a look -- that's when we CUT TO:

81B   INT. TESTING CONTROL BOOTH - CONTINUOUS [FORMER SC. 66]             81B

      Looking at the bridge from above, we PULL BACK to reveal an
      observation room above the faux-ship. This is the test Kirk was
      referring to. CONSOLE TECHNICIANS monitor the proceedings. A
      TEST ADMINISTRATOR turns to another and asks:

                   Did he say "don't worry about it"?

                                 TEST ADMINISTRATOR #2
                   -- what's he doing?

      And we CONTINUE TO PULL BACK TO REVEAL that, sitting among the
      technicians, is Gaila. Our resident GREEN GIRL. She checks her
      watch -- PUSH IN ON IT: 2:59 PM. On her MONITOR awaits a 23rd
      century e-mail -- a MESSAGE FROM KIRK --

      Annoyed, she does as:

                   Our ship is being hit -- shields at sixty
                   percent.

                                    KIRK
                   I understand.

                                 MCCOY
                   Should we at least, I dunno, fire back?

                                    KIRK
                   Mmmm... no.

                   Of course not.

                 stopped firing.

                 Arm photons. Prepare to fire on the

                   James T. Kirk.     Step forward.

      It's a huge Starfleet chamber. Golden Gate Bridge visible
      through huge windows. 500 cadets, a nervous KIRK among them.
      He stands, moves to one of two PODIUMS.

                                 ACADEMY PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
                   An incident has occurred today that
                   concerns the entire student body.
                   Academic immorality by one is an assault
                   on us all. It will. Not. Stand. Cadet
                   Kirk, evidence has been submitted to this
                   council suggesting you violated the
                   ethical code of conduct pursuant to
                   regulation 17.43 of the Starfleet code.
                   Is there anything you care to say before
                   we begin?

                                 KIRK
                           (uncomfortable beat)
                   Yessir. I believe I have the right to
                   face my accuser directly.

     President nods toward the assembly. SPOCK RISES. He and Kirk
     MEET EYES for the first time. It's clock-stopping.

                                ACADEMY PRESIDENT
                  Step forward please. This is Commander
                  Spock, one of our most distinguished
                  graduates. He's programmed the Kobayashi
                  Maru test for the last four years.

     Spock steps up to the OTHER PODIUM.      President nods.

                                SPOCK
                  Cadet Kirk. It is obvious you somehow
                  managed to install and activate a sub-
                  routine in the programming code, thereby
                  changing the conditions of the test.

     We happen to find GAILA, in the crowd, fucking pissed.

                                KIRK
                  Your point being?

                                ACADEMY PRESIDENT
                  In academic vernacular, you cheated.

                                  KIRK
                  Respectfully.    Define "cheating".

                                SPOCK
                  To deceive by trickery.

                                 KIRK
                  Now let me ask you something I think we
                  all know the answer to: the test is
                  rigged, isn't it? You programmed it to
                  be unwinnable.

                                ACADEMY PRESIDENT
                  Mr. Kirk, I don't see how the intent of
                  the exam is relevant to these
                  proceedings.

                                KIRK
                  Because if I'm right, Sir, then the test
                  itself is a cheat.

                                SPOCK
                  Your argument precludes the possibility
                  of a no-win scenario --

                                KIRK
                  I don't believe in no-win scenarios --

     on Kirk. This is his boy. His recruit. And he's INVESTED.

                               SPOCK
                 Then not only have you violated the
                 rules, you've failed to understand the
                 principle lesson.

                               KIRK
                 Please, enlighten me.

                               SPOCK
                 You, of all people should know, Cadet
                 Kirk -- A captain cannot cheat death.

     ON KIRK. The first punch by Spock that landed.      The cockiness
     slips away as he senses where this is going --

                               KIRK
                 "I of all people?"

                               SPOCK
                 Your father, Lieutenant George Kirk, had
                 assumed command of his vessel before
                 killed in action, did he not?

     Shit.   The DADDY card.   Kirk, a mix of ANGER and EMBARRASSMENT --

                               KIRK
                 How long did it take you to look that up?

                               SPOCK
                 How long did it take you to program the
                 virus that allowed you to cheat?

     The President smirks; considers ending this now but doesn't,
     it's just too damn entertaining...

                               KIRK
                 Maybe you just don't like that I beat
                 your test.

                               SPOCK
                 I am Vulcan. "Like" is not a verb in our
                 vernacular. I've simply made the logical
                 deduction that you're a liar.

                               KIRK
                 What an idiot I am for taking that
                 personally --

                               SPOCK
                 Agreed. Furthermore, you have failed to
                 divine the purpose of the test.

                              KIRK
                Enlighten me again.

                              SPOCK
                The purpose is to experience fear. Fear
                in the face of certain death. To accept
                that fear and maintain command of one's
                self and one's crew. This is a quality
                expected in every Starfleet captain.

     Kirk absorbs that.   Then --

                              KIRK
                So you're telling me the point.      Of the
                whole thing. Is to be afraid?

                              SPOCK
                Fear is necessary, yes.

                              KIRK
                Have you taken the test, Commander Spork?

                              SPOCK
                Spock. As a Vulcan, I require no
                additional training to control my
                narcissism when making command decisions.

     No he DIN'T!   Kirk's hit guys for a lot less -- The crowd all
     but "OOOOOOHs." But Kirk ain't fucking done yet.

                              KIRK
                You keep reminding me that you're Vulcan.
                And I'm sure you're really proud of that,
                who wouldn't be-- but isn't it true you
                people don't experience fear at all?

     ON SPOCK. He raises that eyebrow. And Kirk sees... no matter
     how subtly... that he has fucking made CONTACT. Smelling blood -
     -

                              KIRK (CONT'D)
                And if that's the case -- What's that say
                about your ability to make command
                decisions?

     Well. Looks like Kirk just hit him in HIS fucking weak spot.
     And before this lovefest can continue --

                                             49

     A REDSHIRT bursts into the HALL -- Kirk turns to look -- they
     all do -- now we're SPEEDING IN behind the REDSHIRT, who runs to
     the President, hands him a DATAPAD. President reads it.
     Everyone watches, on edge -- finally, quietly:

                              ACADEMY PRESIDENT
                        (to all)
                We've received a distress call from
                Vulcan.
                        (Spock reacts concerned)
                Cadet Kirk -- you are on academic
                probation pending the result of your
                hearing. Cadets, report to Shuttle
                Hangar One immediately -- this hearing is
                at recess until further notice --
                dismissed.

     Everyone's on their feet, MOVING QUICKLY, Kirk suddenly
     irrelevant. PIKE passes by him, all fucking business, but
     before he goes --

                              PIKE
                Cheating isn't winning.

     And as that settles on Kirk, McCoy now joins him. The two
     exiting with the rest of the cadets as Kirk eyes SPOCK --

                              KIRK
                Who was that pointy-eared bastard?

                              MCCOY
                I don't know, but I like him.

84   INT. STARFLEET ACADEMY - HANGAR - CONTINUOUS                      84

     DOLLY THROUGH HUNDREDS OF CADETS, racing to their shuttles --
     BARRACKS LEADERS stand on platforms, calling out SHIP
     ASSIGNMENTS -- cadets HURRYING OFF as they're called --

          MALE BARRACKS LEADER             FEMALE BARRACKS OFFICER

     As the last of the cadets head off, Kirk stands there without a
     home -- he moves to his exiting Barracks Leader --

                              KIRK
                Excuse me, you didn't call my name.
                Kirk, James T..

                          (checks his tablet)
                  You're on academic probation. That means
                  you're grounded until the Academy Board
                  rules.

     Kirk is POLEAXED as Leader heads off -- McCoy, needing to run:

                                MCCOY
                  ... Jim, the Board'll rule in your favor.
                  Most likely.
                          (Kirk is just rocked)
                  Look, Jim -- I gotta go --

                                KIRK
                  ... yeah-- yeah, you go... I'm good.

     Kirk forces a half-smile. Torn, McCoy hurries off. PULL AWAY
     from Kirk, alone as the mass of newly-minted cadets criss-
     crosses around him. At the hangar entrance, McCoy suddenly
     STOPS: a lightbulb. He quickly returns to Kirk, pulls him off:

                  MCCOY                              KIRK
     Come with me --                    -- what're you doing --?

     TRACK with them as they hurry through the throng of cadets --
     and suddenly we're moving in the OTHER DIRECTION as a pissed-off
     Uhura serpentines through the group to SPOCK --

                                UHURA
                  Commander, a word?

     Spock moves away from the officers, a private moment with her:

                                SPOCK
                  Yes, Lieutenant?

                                UHURA
                  Was I not one of your top students?

                                SPOCK
                  Indeed you were --

                  Did I not receive a Gold rating for
                  Exolinguistic skills, giving Starfleet
                  first place over Kyoto and MIT at the
                  Oxford Invitational?

     A LOUD nearby SHUTTLE LEAVES BEHIND THEM -- it gets WINDY --

                and, I quote, "unparalleled ability to

                And while you were well aware that my
                unqualified desire was to serve on the
                U.S.S. Enterprise, I was assigned to the
                Farragut.

     Spock reacts unusually; he seems almost embarrassed.   Quiet.

                               SPOCK
                It was an attempt to avoid the appearance
                of favoritism.

     She gets closer, voice low, all pride and defiance:

                            UHURA
                No. No. I am assigned to the
                Enterprise.

     Their eyes hold.    He checks his tablet, makes an change:

                                 SPOCK
                Oh.     Yes, I believe you are.

     a med in a hypospray SYRINGE.

                What are you doing?

                against viral infection from Melvaran mud

                   "Kirk, James T." -- he's not cleared for

                           (re: scanner)
                   You can see he's suffering, he needs me
                   as his doctor, so since I'm assigned to
                   this ship, so's he, or would you like to
                   explain to Captain Pike why the
                   Enterprise warped into a crisis without

     Kirk looks up -- SPOCK moves towards them, not seeing them --
     Kirk yanks McCoy out of the way -- Spock passes and enters a
     TURBOLIFT -- Kirk looks back as the doors close.

     Then we go INTO THE TURBOLIFT -- for just a moment -- as the
     doors open and we enter with Spock:

                                 SULU
                   Moorings retracted, Captain. Dock
                   Control reports ready -- thrusters fired,
                   separating from space dock --

90A   EXT. SPACE DOCK - SPACE [FORMER SC. 92]                             90A

      The Enterprise moves away from the dock -- smaller SATELLITE
      crafts floating around it. The other FIVE STARFLEET SHIPS
      already ahead -- moving into position.

91    INT. MEDICAL BAY - CONTINUOUS                                       91

      MEDICAL STAFF preps. McCoy enters with Kirk, in amusing agony --
      McCoy helps him onto a bed, prepares another hypospray.

                   KIRK                                   MCCOY
      -- oh, this wasn't worth it --
      I wish I didn't know you-- I'm
      itching in my mouth, this is         Here's a short-lasting
      horrible--                           sedative -- those symptoms
                                           won't last long, don't be an
                                           infant.

      And he SHOOTS KIRK with another hypospray --

                   The fleet's cleared space dock, Captain.

      The six ships -- ONE, then TWO, then THREE, then FOUR, then FIVE
      SNAP INTO WARP. The Enterprise, however... just sits there.

      Pike -- and the others -- look at Sulu, who is confused --
      concerned -- searching the controls. Finally:

                               PIKE
                 Lieutenant, where's Helmsman McKenna?

                                SULU
                 Uh, he has lungworms, Sir? He'll be fine
                 but couldn't report to his post-- I'm
                 Hikaru Sulu --

                               PIKE
                         (fucking with him)
                 -- and you are a pilot, right?

                               SULU
                 Very much so, Sir-- I'm not sure
                 what's... wrong here...

                               PIKE
                 Is the parking brake on?

                               SULU
                         (half-laughs)
                 -- no, I'll figure it out, just--

                               SPOCK
                 Have you disengaged the External Inertial
                 Dampener?

      Sulu does -- and realizes Spock is right.     He makes it work.

                               SULU
                 Ready for warp, Sir.

                               PIKE
                 The external inertial dampener.
                 That's... the parking brake.

                               SULU
                         (essentially)
                 ... yessir.

                               PIKE

                 Let's punch it!

      And now alone, the Enterprise SNAPS INTO WARP -- and is gone.

      home, out to the balcony -- and in the distance, a mile away, is
      a massive COLUMN OF LIGHT -- like a ray from God, which creates
      NUKE-LIKE CONCENTRIC CLOUDS and massive DIRT AND DUST, slamming
      into the ground. Amanda's eyes go wide with terror --

      source. Ayel observes TWO ROMULANS EXTRACTING some of this Red

                  their planet was experiencing seismic

                  two minutes. Thank you for your time.

     And as Chekov's message ends, Kirk suddenly SITS UP IN FRAME --
     his mind SPINNING, through the pain and sedative -- he tries to
     get off the bed, to his feet, as McCoy hurries over --

                   Vulcan isn't experiencing a natural
                   disaster, it's being attacked -- by
                   Romulans.

      ON THE CREW as that lands.     But most specifically, SPOCK.

                                 PIKE
                   Cadet Kirk, I think you've had enough
                   attention for one day -- Dr. McCoy,
                   return to medical, we'll have words
                   later.

                                   MCCOY
                   Yessir.

      Rebuked, McCoy exits as:

                   SPOCK                                 KIRK
      As you know, Mr. Kirk is not
      cleared to be aboard this
      vessel. By Starfleet                  Yeah, I get it, you're a
      regulations, that makes him a        great arguer, I'd love to do
      stowaway...                          it again with you, too.

      I can remove the cadet from          -- Try it! This cadet is
      the bridge, Sir --                   trying to save the bridge!
      -- By recommending a full stop
      in trans-warp in the midst of
      a rescue mission?                    -- It's not a rescue mission--
                                           listen to me! It's an attack!
      -- Based on what facts?

      ON KIRK.   Enough.     And cadet or not, the bridge is HIS.

                                 KIRK
                   Fact: the same anomaly -- a lighting
                   storm in space -- that we saw today also
                   occurred on the day of my birth, before a
                   Romulan ship attacked the U.S.S. Kelvin.

                 Fact: This ship -- which had formidable
                 and advanced weaponry -- was never seen
                 or heard from again -- fact: the Kelvin
                 attack took place on the edge of Klingon
                 space and at 11-hundred hours last night
                 there was an escape from a Klingon prison
                 planet -- Rura Penthe -- fact: the
                 escaped prisoners were Romulans, Sir, and
                 it was reported that they stole a ship
                 from the prison dock.

                               PIKE
                 And you know of this prison escape how?

      Kirk just points to Uhura.

                               UHURA
                 Sir, I-- I intercepted and translated the
                 message myself. Kirk's report is
                 accurate.

                               KIRK
                 We're warping into a trap-- there are
                 Romulans waiting for us, I promise you
                 that.

      All eyes on Pike.   He looks to Spock, who could screw Kirk
      here... But--

                                SPOCK
                 The cadet's logic is sound.
                         (then)
                 And Lieutenant Uhura is unmatched in
                 xenolinguistics, we would be wise to
                 accept her conclusion.

                 Sir, I'm-- not sure I could distinguish
                 the Romulan language from Vulcan.

                   transmissions -- or transmissions of any
                   kind in the area. There seems to be
                   something jamming all communication
                   around Vulcan.

                                 KIRK
                   It's because they're being attacked.

                 Let's go.

      Bridge doors WHOOSH open -- they EXIT.

117   INT. ENTERPRISE - CORRIDORS - CONTINUOUS                       117

      WE TRACK FAST with Pike, Kirk, Spock and Sulu as they HURRY
      through the Enterprise toward the shuttle bay:

                               PIKE
                 Without transporters, we can't beam off
                 the ship, can't assist Vulcan, can't do
                 our job. I'm creating an opportunity:
                 Mr. Kirk, Mr. Sulu and Mr. Olson will
                 space-jump from the shuttle. You'll have
                 chutes -- you'll land on that machine
                 they've lowered into the atmosphere
                 that's scrambling our gear-- you'll get
                 inside, disable that thing then beam back
                 to the ship.

      Kirk and Sulu share a HOLY FUCKING SHIT look --

                                KIRK
                 ... okay.

                               PIKE
                 Mr. Spock, I'm leaving you in command of
                 the ship. Once we have transport
                 capability and communications back up,
                 you'll contact Starfleet and report what
                 the hell's happening here.

                   Something you've got only precious few
                   minutes to figure out. If all else
                   fails, fall back and rendezvous with the
                   fleet in the Laurentian System.
                           (Spock is freaked, then)
                   Kirk. I'm promoting you to First
                   Officer.


                    KIRK                               SPOCK
      What!?!                           -- Captain?

                                 PIKE (CONT'D)
                   While I'm gone we need to keep the chain
                   of command. And you two make a swell
                   team.

                                 SPOCK
                   Captain. Please. I apologize, but the
                   complexities of human pranks escape me.

                                 PIKE
                   It's not a prank, Spock.   And I'm not the
                   Captain. You are.

      And with that, he's DONE. Strides off.     Kirk finally shakes off
      the shock of his PROMOTION --

                                 KIRK
                   Once we knock out that machine... Sir,
                   what happens to you?

                                 PIKE
                   I guess you'll have to come get me.
                           (turns; to Spock)
                   Careful with the ship. She's brand new.

      They appreciate the pure BALLS of that. BRAVERY washes over
      them -- they'd fucking DIE for their Captain, who now turns to
      Kirk and Sulu --

                                 PIKE (CONT'D)
                   Suit up, Gentlemen.

      Sarek's hovercraft speeds along the desert floor, arriving at a

     Bridge doors WHOOSH open -- all eyes on Spock as he enters --
     their new captain. With cold certainty, he takes the command
     chair, hits the intercom:

                 Dr. Puri, report --

118B INT. MEDICAL BAY - CONTINUOUS                                      118B

     CHAOS, UTTER AND COMPLETE. WOUNDED MEN AND WOMEN, it's bad,
     bloody -- a HAND hits an intercom: McCoy, badly shaken --

                               MCCOY
                 It's McCoy-- Dr. Puri was on Deck 6, he's
                 dead.

                                SPOCK
                         (beat)
                 Then you have just inherited his
                 responsibility as Chief Medical Officer.

                               MCCOY

119   INT. ENTERPRISE - SHUTTLE BAY - CONTINUOUS                        119

      QUICK CUTS: Kirk, Sulu, and the ship's LEAD ENGINEER OLSON are
      suiting up for the drop, strapping on sleek AIRDROP ARMOR. WEB
      BELTS. CHUTE PACKS. HARNESSES. HELMETS. COM-SETS.

119A INT. SHUTTLE - CONTINUOUS                                          119A

      They race into the shuttle and take seats facing each other
      across a narrow aisle -- Red Shirt Engineer GRINS like he's
      going on a ski trip:

                               RED SHIRT ENGINEER
                 I am pumped to kick some Romulan ass!   No
                 joke. BRING IT ON!

      Kirk nods at him -- subtext: "What a fucking sack."     He looks to
      Sulu.

                               KIRK
                 So what kinda combat training d'you have?

                               SULU

                 ... fencing.

      In the COCKPIT, Pike works the controls -- MOTORS WHINE and the
      craft LURCHES --

119B INT. ENTERPRISE SHUTTLE HANGAR - NIGHT                             119B

      We see the shuttle LEAVE THE DOCK --

120   EXT. IN ORBIT ABOVE VULCAN - CONTINUOUS                           120

      The shuttle soars from the Enterprise bay, the planet Vulcan a
      red orb below... THRUSTERS FLARE as it descends and now we
      REVEAL AN INCREDIBLE SIGHT:

      THE NARADA: FROM ITS BELLY, TENTACLE CABLES DESCEND TOWARD THE
      PLANET'S OUTER ATMOSPHERE, WHERE THE PLASMA DRILL SUB-STATION IS
      TETHERED: THE SOURCE OF THE DRILL BEAM SHOOTING INTO THE PLANET.
      The shuttle GLIDES to a hover, 60,000 FEET ABOVE THE DRILL --

                                            70


121   INT. SHUTTLE - CONTINUOUS                                        121

      A KLAXON SOUNDS, signalling depressurization of the cargo lock --
      the guys ready their equipment, snatching for handstraps,
      standing on the lip of THE AIRLOCK -- Kirk and Sulu meet eyes
      through their helmet faceplates, the point of no return --
      PIKE'S VOICE over their headsets:

                               PIKE (V.O.)
                 Pre-jump on one: Three, two, one.

      KIRK, SULU, AND RED SHIRT ARE SLAMMED HARD INTO THE ROOF OF THE
      CARGO HOLD AS GRAVITY DIES.

                                  PIKE (CONT'D)
                 Good luck.

      Pike hits another control -- as the shuttle BOMB BAY DOORS OPEN -
      - and KIRK, SULU, AND RED SHIRT ARE INSTANTLY PULLED OUT, INTO:

122   EXT. ABOVE VULCAN - CONTINUOUS                                   122

      THE THREE MEN IN VIOLENT FREEFALL TOWARD THE PLANET -- IN WILD
      SPIN -- THE SENSE OF SPEED'S BEYOND EXHILARATING --

      ROCKETING THROUGH THE VOID AT 150 MPH AS THEY BREAK THROUGH THE
      PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE -- SHAKING VIOLENTLY AT TERMINAL VELOCITY --

123   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                            123

      The falling trio TRACKED ON SCREEN, everyone watches, agape:

                               CHEKOV
                 Away team's entering the atmosphere --

      SPOCK and UHURA meet eyes -- this is fucking insane -- and a
      MAN'S ENTHUSIASTIC YELLING takes us to:

124   EXT. VULCAN'S ATMOSPHERE -- CONTINUOUS                           124

                 WHOOOAAAHYYYEAAAAH!

      ONE BY ONE THEY STABILIZE -- FALLING FACE DOWN -- STRAIGHT PAST
      THE CABLE TENTACLES TETHERING THE DRILL TO THE NARADA WHICH GIVE
      US A SENSE OF INCREDIBLE RELATIVE SPEED AND SCALE -- THESE
      MASSIVE CABLES AT DIZZYING SPEED --

      THEY ANGLE THEIR HANDS AND FEET FOR CONTROL, GUIDING THEMSELVES
      TOWARD THE PLASMA DRILL -- SULU PULLS HIS CHUTE FIRST, THEN KIRK
      -- their chutes SNAP OPEN -- JERKING THEM HARD UPWARD AS THE RED
      SHIRT BLOWS PAST KIRK AND SULU --

                                 KIRK
                   OLSON, PULL NOW, NOW!!!

      HE DEPLOYS HIS CHUTE LAST -- 50 FT -- 40 -- 30 AND HIS CHUTE
      BILLOWS OUT, OPENED TOO LATE -- OLSEN'S FUCKING BODY SLAMS INTO
      THE EDGE OF THE CIRCULAR DRILL, BOUNCING OFF HARD STEEL AND
      RIGHT INTO ITS CENTER WHERE THE SWIRLING VORTEX SPINS -- HE'S
      INSTANTLY EVISCERATED IN THE PLASMA LIGHT!

      Kirk approaches -- more terrified than ever -- he comes in hard,
      too -- SLAMS against the drill edge, bounces but quickly gets
      his footing -- hits a button on his chute and SLITS appear in
      the fabric, suddenly there's no more drag and THE CHUTE AUTO-
      RETRACTS into Kirk's pack -- A REUSABLE PARACHUTE.

      BUT SULU ISN'T SO LUCKY: 20 yards from the drill surface his
      chute gets SNARED IN THE CABLES, JERKING him upside down -- the
      WIND is so intense Sulu is BLOWN SIDEWAYS -- his CHUTE LINES
      begin RUBBING on the sharp metal of the suspension rig! Kirk
      holds on to one of the chute's cables -- yells up:

                                 KIRK (CONT'D)
                   I'M COMING FOR YOU!

      As Kirk tries to climb up, Sulu's cables begin to SNAP! ONE BY
      ONE -- and Sulu tries to CLIMB BACK using his chute cables,
      toward the rig -- otherwise he's gonna fly off.

      As Kirk makes his way up the rig, suddenly:

                                  SULU
                   BEHIND YOU!!

      Kirk SPINS just as a Romulan appears -- tackling Kirk to the
      drill platform! The two FIGHT PRECARIOUSLY ON THE EDGE OF THE
      SWIRLING PLASMA DRILL, WIND ROARING -- and suddenly there's
      ANOTHER ROMULAN from an OPEN HATCH! SULU SLIDES DOWN THE CABLE -
      - JUMPING and tackling the second guard and the shit is ON: our
      Starfleet heroes battling these Romulans to the death -- and
      Sulu KICKS OFF AN ANTENNA PIECE and uses it as a SABER --
      fucking swashbuckling at 10,000 feet! It's a frenzied assault
      even the bigger Romulan isn't ready for, and Sulu manages to
      KICK him into the vortex, where he's VAPORIZED as --

      KIRK draws his PHASER and point-blank SHOOTS the Romulan,
      knocking him clear OFF the cylinder and into the sky, falling to
      his death, DISINTEGRATING as he falls --

      Against pummeling wind, Kirk and Sulu move toward the HATCH --
      OPEN IT -- as:

125   OMIT                                                             125

      Pike's SHUTTLE DOOR OPENS. Pike steps out. Surrounded by a
      dozen of Nero's men. Ayel steps forward. Pike stands firm,
      knowing this is the end for him:

                 I'm Captain Christopher Pi--

      WHACK! He's cut off by a PUNCH to the face. Drops to his
      knees. Looks up at Ayel with blazing eyes, wipes a trickle of
      blood from his lip:

                 So much for diplomacy.

                 None of this is familiar-- the interface,

      And for an instant... nothing. What looks like a puff of smoke
      billowing up from the planet's core... THEN A SHOCKWAVE BLASTS
      UPWARD, ALL THE WAY UP TO THE DRILL AT 10,000 FEET -- KIRK AND

                   scale -- if my calculations are correct,
                   that pod they launched is creating a
                   singularity... that will consume the
                   planet.

      SPOCK'S STOIC FACE. WE GET ONLY A HINT OF THE WILD EMOTIONS
      STIRRING INSIDE HIM -- Uhura watches Spock, heartsick for him:

                                 SPOCK
                   They're creating a black hole... at the
                   center of Vulcan?

                                  CHEKOV
                   ... yessir.

                                 SPOCK
                   How long does the planet have?

                                 CHEKOV
                   ... minutes, Sir. I'd say minutes.

                                 SPOCK
                           (beat, to Uhura)
                   Alert Vulcan Command Center to signal a
                   planetwide evacuation-- all channels, all
                   frequencies -- maintain standard orbit --

                                  UHURA
                   What?   Spock, wait --

      She goes after him as he moves to the TURBOLIFT --

                                 UHURA (CONT'D)
                   -- where are you going?

                                 SPOCK
                   To evacuate the Vulcan High Council--
                   they're tasked with protecting our
                   cultural history. My parents will be
                   among them--

                                 UHURA
                   -- you can't beam them out?

                                 SPOCK
                   It's not possible -- they'll be in the
                   Katrik Arc, I must get them myself--

      TURBOLIFT DOORS CLOSE AS --

136   EXT. PLASMA DRILL CYLINDER - CONTINUOUS                          136

      The platform BANKS -- Sulu FALLS BACK, OFF THE PLATFORM --
      WITHOUT A CHUTE! Kirk, holding on, watching this wide-eyed --
      and knowing what he must do, he RUNS AND JUMPS --

      KIRK FALLS FAST, he's only gonna have one shot at this, presses
      his arms to his sides and ROCKETS downward, building speed, four
      hundred feet below is Sulu, FREEFALLING --

      KIRK moves his feet and hands, angling toward him -- slashing
      downward at 160 mph, closing like a missile -- the gap between
      them narrows -- Sulu's 30 feet below him... 5000 feet to the
      planet surface. 40 ft -- 20 -- 10 -- WHAM! Kirk slams into
      Sulu in a mid-air tackle -- they TUMBLE TOGETHER -- Kirk's made
      the grab and locked his arms around Sulu in an iron grip,
      screams in his face:

                                  KIRK
                   I GOTCHA!   NOW PULL MY CHUTE!

      Sulu DOES -- it opens -- but HOLY FUCK, the double weight RIPS
      IT -- IT SNAPS AWAY FROM THEM -- NOW THEY'RE BOTH FREE-FALLING
      WITH NO CHUTE, THE GROUND COMING AT THEM FAST!

                                 KIRK (CONT'D)
                   ENTERPRISE, WE'RE FALLING WITHOUT A

      The TRANSPORTER CHIEF works his controls, sweating -- trying to
      LOCK ON TO THEIR MOVING TARGET --

                                  TRANSPORTER CHIEF
                   I'm trying!   I can't lock on your signal!

                   -- you're moving too fast!

                                 CHEVOK
                   -- no-- I can do that-- I CAN DO THAT!!!

      Chekov suddenly BOLTS -- Uhura watches him race off -- a CREW
      MEMBER steps into frame:

                                 CREW MEMBER
                   The black hole's expanding, we won't

      Chekov SPRINTS through CORRIDORS -- ENGINE ROOM -- YELLING:

                   MOVE!   I CAN DO THAT!   I CAN DO THAT!!!

                                    CHEKOV
                   I CAN LOCK ON!     GIMME MANUAL CONTROL!

141   INT. ENTERPRISE - TRANSPORTER BAY - CONTINUOUS                    141

      AND REMATERIALIZE, SLAMMING DOWN ON THE TRANSPORTER PADS, HARD
      AND PAINFUL, BUT SAFE! Transporter engineers GAPE in utter
      amazement and relief -- Chekov, sweating, laughs. Kirk and Sulu
      get their bearings, peeling themselves up, at stunned whispers:

                                 SULU
                   ... thanks.

                                 KIRK
                   ... yeah, not a problem.

      And Kirk looks up as SPOCK hurries in --

                                 SPOCK
                   Step aside -- I'm going to the surface.

      As the console ENGINEER works the display --

                                 KIRK
                   The surface of what? YOU'RE GOING DOWN
                   THERE? Are you nuts?!

                                 SPOCK
                   Energize --

      And Spock DEMATERIALIZES --

      PUSH IN as Spock MATERIALIZES -- the distant landscape around
      him COLLAPSING, IMPLODING, EXPLODING -- he sprints for the
      MOUNTAIN -- the entrance to the ARK -- a scared, small CREATURE
      runs past Spock as he heads up the mountain -- rocks falling --

143   INT. KATRIC ARK CHAMBER - DAY                                   143

      Spock RACES through the tunnels as the world SHAKES around him --
      he enters the massive ARK CHAMBER -- sees, atop the enormous
      stairs, FIVE VULCAN ELDERS, Sarek among them, hands placed on
      the sarcophagus-like ark. Mind melding with it. Amanda is here
      too, kneeling beside Sarek -- and she sees her son, who is now
      RUNNING toward them -- she stands:

                                   AMANDA
                 Spock--!

      Spock rushes up the stairs --

                               SPOCK
                 The planet's not safe, it has only
                 seconds left -- we must evacuate now --

      And as they run out, ENORMOUS ROCKS COLLAPSE AROUND THEM -- and
      they run through the tunnels, the STONE COLLAPSING AROUND THEM --

144   EXT. TUNNEL ENTRANCE - DAY                                      144

      Spock and the group finally emerge from the tunnels to see --
      THE PLANET IS COLLAPSING, COMING TOWARD THEM -- Spock whips
      open a tri-corder, TREMBLING LIKE CRAZY --

                               SPOCK
                 Spock to Enterprise: take us back now!

146   EXT. KATRIC ARK CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS                            146

      HORROR AS THE WORLD LITERALLY STARTS TO FALL APART AROUND SPOCK,
      HIS PARENTS AND THE FIVE ELDERS -- MASSIVE SINKHOLES APPEARING,
      LIKE THE GRAND CANYON RACING FOR THEM -- AND WE SEE IN ALL THEIR
      FACES -- THE BELIEF THAT THEIR PLANET -- THAT THEY -- ARE GOING
      TO DIE -- and Spock, trying to hold it together -- even though
      their transport hasn't yet begun -- looks at Amanda -- their
      eyes lock -- THE COLLAPSING GROUND RACING TOWARD THEM -- and in
      a surreal, intimate moment, Amanda says to Spock, quietly:

                                AMANDA
                 It's okay.   To be scared.

      PUSH IN ON SPOCK, looking at her -- as the LIGHT DARTS start
      TRACING THEM -- and they begin to EVAPORATE AS THE GROUND DROPS
      FROM UNDER AMANDA -- AND SHE'S SUCKED DOWN -- AWAY -- as Spock
      REACHES FOR HER, CALLING OUT --

                                   SPOCK

      Chekov in a panic at the controls --

                   NO!!!   I'M LOSING HER!!!

      -- as the Vulcans MATERIALIZE on the pad, Spock still REACHING
      for his mother -- but all he gets it the GHOSTLY IMAGE OF HER --
      BEAUTIFUL, HOLDING, FROZEN IN SPACE -- AN IMAGE HE'LL BE HAUNTED
      BY FOREVER -- AS IT FADES AWAY, EVANESCING LIKE MIST -- ON SPOCK
      as it lands -- Sarek too... a mother... a wife... has been lost.
      And Kirk stands nearby, having observed all of this, without
      anything to do or say... there's no cheating death.

148   EXT. SPACE - ETERNAL NIGHT                                       148

      And the Enterprise BLASTS AWAY -- in the distance, THE ENTIRE
      PLANET OF VULCAN SWALLOWS INTO ITSELF -- A TERRIFYING,
      UNIMAGINABLE IMPLOSION -- UNTIL NOTHING IS THERE BUT DARKNESS.
      And over this we HEAR:

                                 SPOCK (V.O.)
                   Acting Captain's log. Stardate 2256.42:

151   INT. ENTERPRISE - SICK BAY - CONTINUOUS                          151

      SHOCK. The kind that crashes after the world's changed. In
      triage, the bay's filled with wounded Enterprise Officers. The
      Vulcan Elders and Sarek being examined as well. Kirk sits here,
      getting his hand bandaged from the fight. During this, he looks
      up, seeing one of the Elders being treated for a slight wound --
      her GREEN BLOOD seen through the bandage...

                                 SPOCK (V.O.)
                   We've heard no word from Captain Pike. I
                   have therefore classified him a hostage
                   of the war criminal known as Nero.

151A INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE                                          151A

      Spock sits in the captain's chair, reporting. He's glassy-eyed,
      staring at nothing as he speaks. Behind him, Uhura sits,
      watching, concerned.

                                SPOCK
                 Nero, who has destroyed my home planet.
                 And most of its six billion inhabitants.
                 I estimate no more than ten thousand
                 survived.
                         (beat)
                 While the essence of our culture has been
                 saved, in the elders who now reside upon
                 this ship... I am now a member of an
                 endangered species.

      Spock considers this. Clicks off the log recorder.     Spock moves
      off, into the turbolift -- Uhura follows him --

152   INT. TURBOLIFT - CONTINUOUS                                      152

      Spock and Uhura. Silence hangs. She glances over, wanting to
      say so much, but not to invade what must be the worst moment of
      his life. He looks at her, with kind eyes. And Uhura does
      something odd -- she STOPS the lift. Spock looks over as she
      wordlessly reaches out and puts her arms around him. Just
      holding him. Kissing his face with utter tenderness and
      comfort, which he lets her do... and we realize, this is why the
      intimacy before -- this is their secret...

                                  UHURA
                 I'm so sorry.

      Spock looks off, taking comfort, bewildered and lost...

                                  UHURA (CONT'D)
                 What can I do?     Tell me what you need.

                                  SPOCK
                 ... I need...

      He's on the verge of some emotional release... but self-
      consciousness returns and he clamps up, starting the lift again:

                               SPOCK (CONT'D)
                 I need for us all to continue performing
                 admirably.

      He looks at her again -- gives her another kiss. The door opens
      and he exits. She watches him go -- and the door closes on her.

                                             81


152A INT. ENTERPRISE - CORRIDOR                                        152A

      Kirk comes down the hall, stretching his hand bandage -- when he
      stops. Standing at the other end of the corridor, operating a
      DATAPAD is a familiar-looking GREEN GIRL. Guilt overcomes him.
      After a beat he moves to her. Awkward.

                                   KIRK
                 Hey.
                         (she turns to him)
                 Listen, about what happened at Starfleet.
                 The test and everything-- I know it looks
                 like I was... using you, or whatever.

                   tunnel through space time.

                 You're assuming Nero knows how events are
                 predicted to unfold. The contrary:
                 Nero's very presence has altered the flow
                 of history, beginning with the attack on
                 the U.S.S. Kelvin, culminating in the

      Our POV is BLURRY. We come into FOCUS on a blinking instrument
      panel. KIRK is stirring awake, his shoulder kills. He sits up:
      inside a ONE-MAN POD CRAFT. He WIPES THE GLASS -- looks up --
      like a TUNNEL OF SNOW, 30 feet long, to the sky. THE PODCRAFT'S
      EMBEDDED ON THE SURFACE OF A VAST, ICE PLANET. Kirk's been
      MAROONED. He closes his eyes, his face falls...

      The CANOPY RISES -- a blast of cold air hits Kirk -- with some
      agony, out he goes -- he CLIMBS UP THE TUBE OF SNOW -- and gets
      to the surface -- looks out. HE'S IN THE MIDDLE OF FUCKING
      NOWHERE. Finally:

      HUGE, SLITHERING UNDERWATER beneath the ice --

      Kirk FREEZES at a nearby GROWL. He looks -- sees nothing --
      then ANOTHER GROWL -- he turns -- some thirty feet away, an
      eleven foot-tall cross between a polar bear and a gorilla (it's
      a POLARILLA) steps out from behind a mass of ice. Sees Kirk.
      It's horrifying. Kirk takes a SLOW, SMALL STEP BACKWARD -- and
      the fucking thing CHARGES HIM -- KIRK RUNS, TERRIFIED -- and the
      POLARILLA PURSUES -- gaining -- it's gonna EAT HIM ALIVE WHEN
      SUDDENLY --

      WHATEVER WAS BENEATH THE ICE EARLIER EXPLODES UP THROUGH IT --
      IT'S NEARLY 30 FEET TALL, RED, HUNDREDS OF EYES -- IT SMACKS THE
      POLARILLA AWAY LIKE NOTHING AS KIRK FALLS TO THE ICE AND TURNS
      BACK -- HOLY SHIT! THIS THING IS SO MUCH WORSE! IT ROARS AS
      KIRK GETS TO HIS FEET AND RUNS, SCREAMING --

      KIRK HAULS ASS AS THE THING COMES AFTER HIM -- THEN SUDDENLY HE
      FALLS -- DROPS -- and we see that Kirk is FALLING DOWN A MASSIVE
      SNOW MOUNTAIN! The huge red creature stops at the edge and
      ROARS LOUDLY -- until the ice shelf BREAKS AWAY! The creature
      starts to FALL AS WELL! Now Kirk is TUMBLING, the immense
      creature TUMBLING not far behind!

      And Kirk LANDS ON THE ICE, HARD -- sees a distant CAVE. Looks
      up at the FLAILING CREATURE that is about to CRUSH HIM -- Kirk
      tries to run, but the ice is TOO SLIPPERY -- FINALLY he gets
      footing and runs off toward the cave -- as the red creature
      LANDS HARD -- its sharp SPEAR LIMBS STAB into the ice as it
      pursues Kirk --

      Kirk races through the darkened cave -- the creature comes
      after him -- Kirk goes as fast as he can -- the creature reaches
      out and fucking GRABS HIM -- pulls him toward the disgusting,
      wet, TEETHY MOUTH -- Kirk tries to hold on to anything he can --
      but he's fucking LUNCH -- and just as you're SCREAMING, there's
      LIGHT -- FIRE LIGHT -- and a FIGURE APPEARS, WAVING A TORCH --

      And the red creature's eyes ALL GO WILD -- and it DROPS KIRK and
      BACKS OFF, AFRAID -- the figure CHASES IT until it's gone.
      Kirk, on the ground, is freaked out, out of breath, and can't
      take his eyes off this man... who says:

      And the Figure turns... we may have recognized the voice.
      IT'S SPOCK. As in NIMOY. HERE. Lit in the darkness by the
      fire. We'll refer to him as SPOCK PRIME. He looks at Kirk --
      moves closer to him -- finally seeing him. And is amazed...

                                 KIRK
                   Hey... thank you...

                   How did you find me--? Does Starfleet
                   know of my presence?

                                 KIRK
                   HOW DO YOU KNOW MY NAME?

      Spock looks deep into the eyes of the freaked out young man,
      feeling the full effect of fate playing its hand, but realizing
      he doesn't recognize him...

                                 SPOCK PRIME
                   I have been... and always shall be...
                   your friend.

                                 KIRK
                   -- no, I don't know you -- the only
                   Vulcan I know isn't exactly a buddy.

      Of all the things Spock predicted Kirk might say, it wasn't
      that. He's analyzing a thousand steps ahead, calculating:

                                 SPOCK PRIME
                   You are James T. Kirk. Your father is

                   Stop.   Please.     I don't understand.

      As Spock nods, we PRE-LAP:

      Spock's eyes SNAP SHUT, Kirk JOLTS as if by an electric charge --
      and the SCREEN OVEREXPOSES TO WHITE as we CUT TO our MIND MELD

                                SPOCK PRIME (V.O.)
                  A star in Beta Quadrant will go supernova
                  -- and like a cancer left untreated... it
                  will grow... and destroy everything.

162A INT. VULCAN SCIENCE ACADEMY                                     162A

      Now we're seeing VULCAN SCIENCE ACADEMY -- where SIX VULCAN
      SCIENTISTS study a HOLOGRAM of this event -- the star's ORIGIN,
      its PATH OF DESTRUCTION -- and SPOCK PRIME is among them --

                                SPOCK PRIME (V.O.)
                  I saw the beginning of it myself. Vulcan
                  Science Academy devised a plan to stop
                  it.

                                SPOCK PRIME (V.O.)
                  We built a ship containing a material
                  capable of generating the only thing
                  powerful enough to consume a supernova.
                  A black hole.

163   INT. JELLYFISH - CONTAINMENT HOLD - NIGHT                        163

      Now we're INSIDE the ship -- the CONTAINMENT HOLD -- being
      ASSEMBLED by Vulcan Scientists --

                                SPOCK PRIME (V.O.)
                  I agreed to pilot the ship. Knowing I
                  would not return.

164   Now we see Spock Prime, in a ritual ceremony of a Vulcan         164
      Kamikaze pilot. Tea, sipped inside the Ark --

                                SPOCK PRIME (V.O.)
                  My sacrifice, in service of all races,
                  seemed only logical.

      Now Spock Prime sits in the Jellyfish COCKPIT --

                  Unfortunately... before I could begin the
                  mission... the supernova destroyed

166   -- and suddenly we're OUT OF THE MIND MELD as KIRK GRABS SPOCK   166
      PRIME'S HAND AGAIN:

                                KIRK
                  Nero's planet was destroyed--

                                SPOCK PRIME
                  Yes. He of course blamed us. Believed
                  Vulcan allowed his planet to die. Which
                  was hardly the case. Let me continue.

                   KIRK                           SPOCK PRIME
      This annoys me, I don't like      -- I know, I know, I'm not
      it-- do we have to do it like     surprised to hear you complain
      this--?                           -- allow me to finish.

      Spock Prime touches Kirk again and we go:

      -- the JELLYFISH SWOOPS PAST US -- and we PAN -- and see the
      MASSIVE SUPERNOVA in the infinite distance -- no sense of scale
      here -- but then -- THE NARADA APPEARS -- FIRES TORPEDOES at the
      Jellyfish.

                                 SPOCK PRIME (V.O.)
                   Nero came after me. Determined to thwart
                   my mission. If Romulus was allowed to
                   die, he said... all planets should share
                   its fate.

167A SPOCK PRIME IN THE COCKPIT, ROCKED AS TORPEDOES EXPLODE         167A
     CLOSELY. TIGHT ON SPOCK PRIME AS HIS MIND RACES --

                                 SPOCK PRIME (V.O.)
                   I needed an exit. I knew if this mission
                   failed... everyone, everywhere... would
                   lose everything.

      Spock Prime LEAVES the cockpit --

167B INT. JELLYFISH - CONTAINMENT HOLD                               167B

      Prime ENTERS AN AIRLOCK -- TUMBLES IN WEIGHTLESSNESS and enters
      THE CONTAINMENT ROOM. QUICK CUTS as he REMOVES RED MATTER FROM
      THE HOLD --

                                 SPOCK PRIME (V.O.)
                   I realized: a large black hole could
                   destroy the supernova. A smaller one...
                   could be my escape. Could send me back
                   in time, allowing me to complete my
                   mission. So I created a black hole...

      Spock loads the CANNISTER with a small amount of RED MATTER into
      a JETTISON TUBE --

                  Nero must have understood what I was
                  trying to do. Because he began racing
                  for it.

                  Nero simply got to it first. How long I
                  was travelling... I couldn't tell you.
                  It was timeless. But when I arrived...

      LIGHT on Spock Prime's face goes away -- he and the Jellyfish

      KIRK INHALES, SHARPLY, having been there with Spock Prime.    Back
      to the two men, in a cave:

      Kirk stares at him... his mind spinning because now he
      believes him. The result is overwhelmingly emotional.

                                SPOCK PRIME
                  Forgive me... emotional transference is
                  an effect of the mind meld.

                           (sympathy, surprise)
                   ... so you do feel...

                                 SPOCK PRIME
                   "Cthia" is the stricture that binds our
                   emotions... but few of us are that
                   perfectly Vulcan.

      Kirk gathers himself, wipes his eyes on his sleeve...

                                 KIRK
                   Going back in time... you changed all our
                   lives.

                                 SPOCK PRIME
                   Yet remarkably, events within our
                   timelines, characteristics, people...
                   seem to overlap significantly. Tell me
                   about the rest of the crew? Chekov--
                   Uhura --?

                                 SPOCK PRIME
                   Dr. McCoy would assert our meeting here
                   is not a matter of coincidence... but
                   rather, indication of a higher purpose.

                                 KIRK
                   ... he'd call it a damn miracle.

                                 SPOCK PRIME
                   Yes he would. Perhaps the time stream's
                   way of attempting to mend itself. In
                   both our histories, the same crew found
                   its way onto the same ship in a time of
                   ultimate crisis -- therein lies our
                   advantage.
                           (rises)
                   We must go-- there's a Starfleet outpost
                   not far from here.

      But Kirk stands -- stops him:

                               SPOCK PRIME
                 ... yes. You often spoke of him as your
                 inspiration for joining starfleet.

      This is amazing for Kirk -- he looks off, trying to imagine that
      life. Spock intuits what this means.

                               SPOCK PRIME (CONT'D)
                 You should know. He proudly lived to see
                 you become captain of the Enterprise.

                 Yes, Doctor. I'm aware that James Kirk
                 is a friend of yours. Supporting me, as
                 you did, must have been difficult.

                               MCCOY

                               SPOCK
                 I'm simply acknowledging your
                 difficulties.

      We're not sure how McCoy is taking this...

                  Permission to speak freely, Sir.

                                  SPOCK
                  I welcome it.

                                MCCOY
                  Do you. Okay then: are you out of your
                  Vulcan mind? Were you doing the logical
                  thing? Maybe. The right one?
                  Debatable. But one thing's for damn sure
                  -- that kid doesn't know how to lose.
                  Just isn't in his DNA. Back home we have
                  a saying: "If you're gonna ride in the
                  Kentucky Derby, don't leave your prize
                  stallion in the stable."

                                SPOCK
                  ... a curious metaphor, Doctor. As a
                  stallion must first be broken before it
                  can reach its potential.

                                MCCOY
                  My God, Man... you could at least act
                  like it was a hard decision.

                                SPOCK
                  I intended to assist in the effort to re-
                  establish communication with Starfleet.
                  However, if crew morale would be better
                  served by my roaming the halls weeping,
                  I'll gladly defer to your medical
                  expertise.

      A strong look and Spock turns away as Sarek enters the bridge.
      Spock moves to meet him. Off McCoy, fuming --

      A fucking BLIZZARD.   Kirk and Spock Prime move through the
      maddening whiteout.   Kirk yells through it:

                  I AM SO PISSED OFF AT THE OTHER YOU RIGHT

      Echo. Nothing. They head down. After a beat, a SMALL, DARK,
      ODDLY ALIEN CREATURE STEPS OUT. Eyes them curiously. This is
      KEENSER.

                                 KEENSER
                   ... can I help you?

                                 SPOCK PRIME

      Keenser looks them over.    Then:

                   ... no.   This way.

      And they follow Keenser into a MASSIVE WAREHOUSE, filled mostly
      with junked space parts. A large, tarped SHUTTLE in the
      background. In the middle of the huge, depressing space is a
      table. And a STARFLEET OFFICER who is ASLEEP, legs kicked up,
      leaning back in a chair, a hat covering his face. Keenser taps
      the Officer's boot.

                                  STARFLEET OFFICER

      A beat -- and the Officer peers from under his hat.     A cool,
      slow burn.

                                 STARFLEET OFFICER
                   You realize how unacceptable this is.

                 You eat nothing. A bean and you're done
                 for a week, I need food. And now you're
                 here -- so. Thank you. Where is it.

                               SPOCK PRIME
                 You are in fact the Mr. Scott who
                 postulated the theory of trans-warp
                 beaming.

                               SCOTTY
                 Yes! That's exactly what I'm talking
                 about! How d'ya think I ended up here?
                 I got into a debate with my instructor on
                 the issue of Relativistic Physics as they
                 pertain to subspace travel... He seemed
                 to think that the range of transporting
                 say, a roast turkey, was limited to a few
                 hundred miles -- so I told my instructor
                 I could not only beam a bird from one
                 planet to an adjacent planet in the same
                 system -- which is no big deal anyway --
                 but if I were so inclined I could
                 actually do it with a lifeform! So I
                 tested it on Admiral Archer's prize
                 beagle. Which... was a mistake.

                 Feel guilty.

                               SPOCK PRIME
                 What if I told you your trans-warp theory
                 was correct? That it is indeed possible
                 to beam onto a ship that is travelling at
                 warp speed. And that you only required
                 the correct field equation to
                 recrystallize dilithium?

                 The reason you haven't heard of it, Mr.
                 Scott... is because you haven't
                 discovered it yet.

      Kirk reacts. Scotty reacts -- is almost spooked -- sobers up a
      bit... really regards Spock Prime. Skeptical. Amused.

                               SCOTTY
                 Y'from the future, are ya? Brilliant.
                 D'they still have sandwiches where you're
                 from? Piece and jam? Mince 'n tatties?
                 Cockaleekie soup?

                               KIRK
                 What is he talking about?

                                KEENSER
                 Food.

                               SPOCK PRIME
                 Allow us access to your shuttle... and I
                 will show you what a genius you actually
                 are.

      Off Scotty, who can't help but be intrigued --

      Scotty PULLS A TARP over much of the out-of-service shuttle.

                               SCOTTY
                 She's a wee bit dodgy: shield emitters
                 are totally banjaxed, along wi' a few
                 other things.

      Spock finishes speed-typing the FIELD EQUATIONS on the
      TRANSPORTER CONTROL PANEL -- amazingly fast.

                                  SCOTTY (CONT'D)
                   ... rapid.   That's impressive.

      Spock Prime steps aside:

                                 SPOCK PRIME
                   Your equation for achieving trans-warp
                   beaming.

      Scotty looks at the equations -- we watch his expression run the
      gamut: from confused, to dumbfounded, to quiet awe and delight:

                                 SCOTTY
                   Imagine that! Never occurred to me to
                   think of space as the part that's moving.

                                 SPOCK PRIME
                   Point of fact: it did occur to you.
                           (he works the console)
                   Extrapolating Enterprise's course --

                                 SCOTTY
                   -- Enterprise? Had its maiden voyage
                   already, has it? Well, you must've done
                   something right to be assigned to that
                   ship, Kiddo. She's a well endowed lady --
                   love to get my hands on her ample
                   nacelles, if you'll pardon the
                   engineering parlance.

                                 SPOCK PRIME
                   Now's your chance, Mr. Scott.

                                 SCOTTY
                   Look, even if I believed you -- where
                   you're from, what I've done-- which I
                   don't -- we're still talkin' bout
                   slingshotting aboard while she's going
                   faster than light. Without a proper
                   receiving pad, that's like tryin'a hit a
                   bullet with a smaller bullet, wearing a
                   blindfold. On a horse.

                                 SPOCK
                   I calculate no more than a four meter
                   margin of error.

                                 SCOTTY
                   That's all well and good unless you
                   rematerialize four meters outside the
                   ship.

      As Spock works the keyboard, an ENTERPRISE SCHEMATIC rotates:

                               SPOCK PRIME
                 Agreed: the aft engineering bay is your
                 best option: a large space and no
                 unpredictable airlocks --

                               KIRK
                 -- you're coming with us, right?

                               SPOCK PRIME
                 No, Jim. My destiny lies along a
                 different path.

                   KIRK                          SPOCK PRIME
      Your destiny can wait -- he         (simply, strong)
      won't believe me, only you can   Under no circumstances can he
      explain w--                      be made aware of my existence.
                                       You must promise me this.

                               KIRK
                 You're telling me I can't tell you I'm
                 following your own orders? Why not?
                 What happens?

                               SPOCK PRIME
                 Trust me. Above all. Jim, this is the
                 one rule you cannot break. To stop Nero,
                 you alone must take command of your ship.

                               KIRK
                 How, over your dead body?

                               SPOCK PRIME
                 Preferably not. There is, however,
                 Starfleet Regulation 619.
                         (off Kirk's confusion)
                 Yes. I forget what little regard you had
                 for such things. 619 states that any
                 commanding officer who is emotionally
                 compromised by the mission at hand...
                 must resign said command.

                               KIRK
                 So I need to emotionally compromise you?

                                SPOCK PRIME
                 Jim.  I just lost my planet. I can tell
                 you.  I am emotionally compromised.
                         (then)
                 What you must do... is get me to show it.

      PUSHING IN ON KIRK as this lands for him --

                 Hm.

                               SCOTTY
                 Aye, then. Live or die, Laddie, let's
                 get this over with. he Enterprise has a
                 decent cafeteria I'm guessing.

      Scotty's on the pad.   Kirk follows, looks at Spock:

                               KIRK
                 You know... coming back in time...
                 changing history... that's cheating.

                               SPOCK PRIME
                 A trick I learned from an old friend.

      Something strikes Kirk -- his eyes GLINT with revelation. Spock
      responds enigmatically: a silent acknowledgment of what Kirk
      must do to get the ship. He raises his hand in the legendary
      Vulcan salute:

                               SPOCK PRIME (CONT'D)
                 Live long, and prosper.

      And Spock activates the transporter and they DEMATERIALIZE --
      the light plays off his face as he watches them vanish --

      down at his legs, his chest, his arms to make sure he's still in
      one piece, glances over to share his relief with Scotty... BUT
      SCOTTY ISN'T THERE. A strange BANGING -- Kirk turns: the
      BANGING is coming from a large metal TANK -- then Scotty appears
      in a TRANSLUCENT PIPE -- FREAKING OUT -- BANGING ON THE CLEAR
      METAL -- Kirk's mind races -- he looks around for a way to save
      his new friend -- just then a STRONG CURRENT IS FELT inside the
      tube -- AND SCOTTY IS YANKED AWAY, DOWN THE TUBE!

      TWISTING and TURNING tubes -- SCOTTY SEEN every time he enters a
      CLEAR TUBE AREA -- then DISAPPEARING again into the ORANGE tubes
      -- and Scotty gets sucked UPWARDS -- and Kirk turns and looks --
      FOLLOWS THE LENGTH OF TUBE -- SEEING WHERE IT'S HEADING -- TO A
      GIANT WATER TURBINE -- essentially? A MASSIVE FUCKING BLENDER.

                   manage to get aboard this ship?

      Kirk stares at the young Spock -- a different experience now --

                   As Captain of this vessel I order you to
                   answer the question.

                                  KIRK
                   Well I'm not telling.

                   Does that frustrate you? My lack of

                   You will answer me.

                   I'd rather not take sides.

      Spock nods back to the SECURITY GUARDS, over this --

                                 SPOCK
                   Escort them to the Brig.

      But before the guards can do so --

                 interfere with my abilities to command
                 this ship is inaccurate--

                               KIRK
                 HA! And yet you said fear was necessary
                 for command. I mean -- did you see that
                 bastard's ship? Did you see what he did?

                               SPOCK
                         (tense)
                 Yes, of course I--

                               KIRK
                 So are you afraid or aren't you?!?

                               SPOCK
                         (tenser)
                 I will not... allow you to lecture me
                 about the merits of emotion.

      Kirk gets close to Spock --

                               KIRK
                 Then why don't you stop me.

      Sarek watches, tense.   McCoy, too.   Spock blinks --

                               SPOCK
                 Step away from me, Mr. Kirk.

                               KIRK
                 What is it like? Not to feel? Anger.
                 Or heartbreak. Or the need to stop at
                 nothing to avenge the death of the woman
                 who gave birth to you?!

                               SPOCK
                         (volcanic)
                 -- back away --

                               KIRK
                         (closer still)
                 You must not feel anything! It must not
                 even compute for you! You must not have
                 loved her at all--!

      -- WHAM! SPOCK HAS JUST HIT KIRK -- and Kirk goes to hit back,
      but Spock fucking DELIVERS A SERIES OF POWERFUL BLOWS --
      Security stand back as the Captain attacks...

      And Spock is now fucking CHOKING Kirk -- HE SLAMS KIRK AGAINST
      THE WALL -- SPOCK'S CHOKING THE LIFE OUT OF HIM --

                  Spock!

      And everything -- everything -- STOPS. Spock, red-faced,
      releases his grip. Kirk GULPS air and tumbles to the ground.
      Spock staggers back. Kirk's hardly able to speak, close to
      collapsing. But despite his brutalized face, his expression
      isn't about spite, or hatred... but compassion.

      Spock sees the faces of the STUNNED CREW staring at him. But
      worst of all? Sarek. His father. Spock levels his chin.
      Quickly wipes his eyes. Trying to regain some semblance of
      dignity... looks to McCoy. Softly --

                                SPOCK
                  Doctor. I am no longer fit for duty. I
                  hereby relinquish my command on the
                  grounds that I have been... emotionally
                  compromised. Please note the time and
                  date in the ship's log.

      JESUS. Spock just... QUIT. And after a beat, he leaves the
      room. Sarek follows a moment later.

      The crew just stands there in stunned SILENCE.   Finally --

                                SCOTTY
                  I like this ship. It's exciting.

      McCoy turns to Kirk, exasperated --

                                MCCOY
                  Congratulations, Jim. Now we've got no
                  Captain and no first officer to goddamn
                  replace him.

      ON KIRK.   The moment is upon him.

                                 KIRK
                  Yeah we do.

      ON MCCOY. The CREW -- confused. Sulu just fucking POINTS at
      Kirk and they all realize HOLY SHIT -- Pike made KIRK the First
      Officer before he left!

                    Mr. Spock has resigned commission and
                    advanced me to acting Captain. I know
                    you were all expecting to regroup with
                    the fleet, but I've ordered a pursuit

                    I want all departments at battle stations
                    and ready in ten minutes. Either we're

      Clicks off.    PUSH IN ON KIRK, staring off --

                                  UHURA
                    I want some answers.

      He looks up.    Uhura is there.   Pissed off:

                   I'm a PhD in astrophysics, I think I can
                   handle it -- how'd you get back?

                   You vant us to trust you but you von't

                   No. No, I won't-- hey, I'm the Captain
                   now! I don't have to tell you anything!
                   Now listen: we need to figure out a way
                   to catch up and get to Nero's ship.

                                 SULU
                   There's not a chance. They're gonna be
                   in geosynchronous orbit around Earth in
                   ten minutes. We'll never make it.

                                 MCCOY
                   Even if we could, you can't go in guns
                   blazing, not with their technology,
                   that's suicide.

                                 KIRK
                   Then we find a way to get on that ship
                   and steal the black hole device away from

                   Speak your mind, Spock.

                                 SPOCK
                   That would be unwise.

                                 SAREK
                   What is necessary is always wise.

      Watch Spock's face.   Struggling with what's pent-up inside...

                                 SPOCK
                   I feel as conflicted as I once was. As a
                   child. Have I made so little progress?

                                 SAREK

                   You will always be a child of two worlds.
                   I am grateful for that. And for you.
                           (painfully)
                   And not only because you are all I have
                   left of her.

      Spock looks at Sarek.   This is as close to emotion as he'll get.

                                 SPOCK
                   I feel anger. For the one who took her
                   life. An anger I cannot stop.

                                  SAREK
                   I believe she would say... do not try to.
                           (then)
                   You asked me once. Why I married your
                   mother.
                           (beat, simply)
                   I married her because I loved her.

      Their look HOLDS -- and for Spock, a revelation...

                   Yes, Chekov-- you don't need to ask
                   permission to--

                                 CHEKOV
                   Based on the Narada's course from Vulcan,
                   I've projected that Nero will travel past
                   Saturn. If we could drop out of warp
                   behind one of Saturn's moons, say, Titan,
                   the magnetic distortion from the planet's
                   rings will make us invisible to Nero's
                   sensors. We could follow him to Earth by
                   staying in his blind spot.

                                 KIRK
                   What blind spot?

                                 CHEKOV
                   Its exhaust wake. If we adjust our
                   shield frequencies, they shouldn't detect
                   us.

                                 MCCOY
                   Wait a minute-- anyone understand this
                   kid? How old are you?

                                 CHEKOV
                   I am seventeen, Sir, how old are you?

                                 MCCOY
                   We're all old enough to shave here.

                                 SPOCK (O.S.)
                   Doctor... Mr. Chekov is correct.

      Everyone turns, surprised: SPOCK has entered the bay --
      galvanized, full of purpose --

                   I have reviewed his telemetry. If Mr.
                   Sulu can maneuver us into position, I can
                   beam aboard Nero's ship.

                                 KIRK
                   I won't order you to do that, Mr. Spock.

                   Romulans and Vulcans share a common

      BEAUTIFUL HOLOGRAM before him. He doesn't notice behind him, as
      those BLADES from his STAFF APPEAR BEHIND HIS NECK. Nero
      tenses, only now sensing this unforeseen danger: AYEL HOLDS THE
      WEAPON. Strong. Tough. But under it all... terrified.

                                AYEL
                 The men and I have discussed this. What
                 we are about to do.
                         (beat)
                 We have to turn the ship around. We can
                 save our home.

      Nero turns slowly and deliberately -- Ayel tenses:

                               AYEL (CONT'D)
                 Stop.

      Nero now faces Ayel, blades at his throat -- Ayel growing more
      nervous as he faces his master. The surrounding crew stare on,
      frozen in the moment, only slightly confirming their makeshift
      mutiny with scared looks.

                                                  113
191   CONTINUED:                                                            191

                                 AYEL (CONT'D)
                   We can go back. That's what we want. We
                   have taken our vengeance on Vulcan. No
                   more. We want to go home now.

      Nero considers this... nods gently.

                                  NERO
                   There is no need, Ayel.   To threaten me.
                           (beat)
                   I understand.

      Ayel is massively relieved.     Nero gently reaches out, holds the
      staff (still aimed at him).     He deactivates it -- the blades
      instantly RETRACT.

                                   NERO (CONT'D)
                   I understand.    But you are wrong.

      And just as Ayel realizes he's fucked, Nero somehow activates
      the staff in a way we have not seen -- AND THE BLADES APPEAR ON
      THE OTHER END -- THE END NOW FACING AYEL -- AND JUST AS AYEL'S
      EYES GO WIDE -- NERO THRUSTS THE BLADES INTO AYEL -- WHO FALLS
      TO THE FLOOR, DEAD! Nero's hard face turns to the rest of his
      crew.

                                 NERO (CONT'D)
                   We will return to Romulus when the
                   Federation lies in ruins and not a moment
                   before. When those who watched our
                   people burn at last understand our pain,
                   our loss. I refuse to return as a slave!
                   We will return as conquerors!

      ON THE FACES OF THE MEN, SUBMITTING TO HIS WILL, our MUSIC
      BUILDING -- and then, his eyes on Earth like a fucking LION eyes
      a gazelle--

                                 NERO (CONT'D)
                   Deploy the drill.

      Sulu makes rapid-fire thruster combinations to stay on track --
      a stealthy ballet of incredible dexterity. THE NARADA appears
      over the horizon in geosynchronous orbit, passing underneath the
      Enterprise as they arc in behind it.

                   Whatever happens Mr. Sulu, if you feel
                   you have a tactical advantage fire on
                   that ship. Even if we're still aboard.
                   It's an order.

                                  SULU
                   Yessir.   Good luck.

      Spock turns to Uhura, who hands him a small TRANSLATOR DEVICE:

                                 UHURA
                   We'll be monitoring your frequency...

      Uhura gives the translator to Spock -- AND HE KISSES UHURA.

                                 SPOCK
                   Thank you, Nyota.

      They part, revealing KIRK'S SHOCKED FACE. Uhura walks off,
      leaving the two men -- Kirk looking stunned at Spock.

                                 KIRK
                   Her first name is...

                                 SPOCK
                   I have no comment on the matter.

      Kirk still stunned as Scotty moves to transporter control.

                                 SCOTTY
                   If there's any common sense to their ship
                   design, I'll be puttin' ya in a cargo
                   bay, shouldn't be a soul in sight.

      KIRK AND SPOCK STAND ON THE TRANSPORTER PAD, SIDE-BY-SIDE AND
      FACING THE SAME DIRECTION FOR THE FIRST TIME -- AN ICONIC IMAGE -
      - The moment of truth.

                                  KIRK
                   Energize.

      Scotty hits the transport and Kirk and Spock DISAPPEAR --

199   INT. NARADA - CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS                               199

      Kirk and Spock MATERIALIZE in the cargo bay... to find
      themselves suddenly smack-dab in the middle of SIX ROMULAN
      GUARDS working at cargo consoles!!

      For a split second they're as shocked as Kirk and Spock, until
      they ATTACK -- Kirk immediately engages the closest Romulan,
      struggles -- but Spock's a machine: his palm snaps up CRACKING a
      nose -- SLAMS a head against the wall -- as battle-ready as the
      Romulans are, it's like trying to catch a GHOST, Kirk finally
      knocks his one opponent unconscious, and turns to see it's ALL
      OVER --

                                 KIRK
                           (a touch insecure)

                   I am trained in the Vulcan martial art of
                   Suus Mahna.

      Kirk and Spock move to a still conscious Romulan as he struggles
      to get up. Spock reaches for the fallen Romulan's temples.

                                 SPOCK (CONT'D)
                   I am unable to meld with these Romulans --
                   there are subtle differences in their
                   physiology I did not anticipate --

                   KIRK                                SPOCK
      -- punch him in the face --
      make him talk! Suus Mahna his       -- Suss Mahna is only intended
      ass!                                for self-defense, he's no
                                          longer a threat --
      -- then pretend it's a threat -
      - I'm your captain, that's an
      order!

      Spock PUNCHES the Romulan HARD -- and via Uhura's comlink
      translator, speaks in SUBTITLED ROMULAN:

      Kirk hits a console, a familiar voice comes to life:

                 Voice print and face recognition analysis

                 Spock, you'll be piloting the ship alone.

                               SPOCK
                 Which may be problematic, as I am
                 unfamiliar with this ship's design.

      THE LASER GRID RESPONDS TO SPOCK'S VOICE, scans his features for
      ID -- THE HOLOGRAPHIC DISPLAY MATERIALIZES:

                 Wow.   That's weird.

      He looks to Kirk in surprise -- Spock's eyes fix with sudden
      understanding. Ambassador Spock... of course... suddenly all
      the pieces start coming together...

      Spock looks at Kirk, a touch upset:

                               SPOCK
                 It appears you've been keeping rather
                 important information from me.

                 Just trust me.      Can ya do that?

      Spock weigh his options.     Trust.   Finally:

                   Father...?

      Sarek turns -- but IT ISN'T SAREK.   IT'S SPOCK PRIME.     Who says:

                                 SPOCK PRIME
                   I am not... our father.

      An incredible beat, our two Spocks in eye lock... both minds
      processing conversational possibilities at an incredible rate...
      surreal extensions of each other, separate but connected...

                                 SPOCK
                   ... Fascinating.

                                 SPOCK PRIME
                   There are so few Vulcans left.    We cannot
                   afford to ignore each other.

      Young Spock's eyes flicker in puzzlement...

                                 SPOCK
                   Then why did you send Kirk aboard when
                   you alone could've explained the truth?

                                 SPOCK PRIME
                           (beat, simply)
                   Because you needed each other. Opposing
                   yet complimentary opposites. It was that
                   balance between us -- I should say
                   you and Kirk -- that often made the
                   impossible, possible.

                                 SPOCK
                   ... it was a test?

                                 SPOCK PRIME
                           (no: his heart heavy)
                   I'm in no position to pass judgment...
                   my actions have robbed you of much. I
                   could not also deprive you the revelation
                   of all you can accomplish together... of
                   a friendship that will define you both in
                   ways you cannot yet realize.

      There is, to young Spock's surprise, vulnerability in that.

                                 SPOCK
                   How did you persuade him to keep your
                   secret?

                                 SPOCK PRIME
                   I inferred universe-ending paradoxes
                   would ensue should he break his promise.

                                  SPOCK
                   You lied.

                                  SPOCK PRIME
                   I implied.

                                  SPOCK
                   A gamble...

                                 SPOCK PRIME
                   An act of faith. One I hope you'll
                   repeat in the future.

      Young Spock considers an enduring friendship between him and
      Kirk... for the first time, understanding it. But --

                                 SPOCK
                   The future's not what it used to be... in
                   the face of extinction, it's only logical
                   I resign my Starfleet commission and help
                   rebuild our race.

                 you can be in two places at once.

                         (beat)
                 I urge you to remain in Starfleet: I've
                 already located a suitable planet on
                 which to establish a Vulcan colony, and
                 assist in the foundation of a new science
                 academy.

      Young Spock takes that in, resolute...

                               SPOCK
                 My future cannot be determined by your
                 past. We are one, but not the same.

                               SPOCK PRIME
                 Then I ask that you do yourself a favor.
                 Put away logic. Do what feels right.
                 The world you've inherited lives in the
                 shadow of incalculable devastation... but
                 there's no reason you must face it alone.

      Spock Prime moves to the door, stops.    Offers the VULCAN SALUTE:

                               SPOCK PRIME (CONT'D)
                 As my customary farewell would appear
                 oddly self serving, I will simply say...
                 good luck.

      Their eyes hold. Spock turns, disappearing into the corridor.
      Young Spock stares at the empty doorway a beat, his mind a
      jumble of thoughts... and our MUSIC BUILDS...

242   INT. STARFLEET CORRIDOR - HANGAR - CONTINUOUS                     242

      As Spock Prime walks off down the corridor, he passes right by a
      man conferring with a nurse -- the man pauses, turns... it's
      SAREK. Suddenly overcome by a feeling that the stranger who's
      just passed him is... oddly familiar.

243   INT. STARFLEET ACADEMY - COUNCIL CHAMBERS - DAY                   243

      MUSIC STILL BUILDING -- glass walls reveal THE ENTERPRISE at
      dock, UTILITY CRAFTS floating around it, repairing. Standing at
      attention in rows, THE ENTERPRISE CREW -- over four hundred of
      them wearing DRESS UNIFORMS -- TRACK DOWN the faces, all proud --
      and we STOP ON YOUNG KIRK. Composed, focused, a man. The
      ACADEMY PRESIDENT stands at a podium:

      Kirk breaks from formation, pivots, marches down the hangar --
      past UHURA... SULU... CHEKOV... SCOTTY. All Beaming. Notably
      absent, is Spock. Kirk ascends the stairs, snaps to attention:

                                 ACADEMY PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
                   Your inspirational valor and supreme

                   service and reflect utmost credit to
                   yourself, your crew, and the Federation.
                   For your... unique solution to the
                   Kobayashi Maru, it's my honor to award
                   you with a commendation for original
                   thinking.

      He opens a BOX -- glorious in repose, a MEDAL:

                                 ACADEMY PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
                   By Starfleet Order 28455, you are hereby
                   directed to report to Commanding Officer,
                   USS Enterprise, for duty as his relief.

      Kirk turns. Walks to... PIKE. In a wheelchair now, wearing an
      ADMIRAL'S UNIFORM. Overnight, his hair's turned totally grey --
      but despite his trauma, his pride's overwhelming. They SALUTE:

                                 KIRK
                   I relieve you, Sir.

                                 PIKE
                   I am relieved. Congratulations, Captain.

      Pike containing a smirk, pins the medal to Kirk's chest.

                                 KIRK
                   Thank you, Sir.

      Kirk turns to the crowd. Eyes shining. WILD APPLAUSE. As Kirk
      rejoins his crew for hugs and congratulations, we go to the BACK
      of the hangar... SPOCK PRIME. Watching. Moved beyond words.
      He turns and leaves them to it... and our MUSIC SWELLS as --

      The turbolift WHOOSHES open and in walks Kirk -- to every fan's
      delight, wearing his iconic GOLD SHIRT. All around him, our
      crew -- young and fresh-faced but no longer children -- in
      charge of the greatest starship ever built:

                   Same ship, different day.

      And Kirk pauses. His eyes go over to the empty science console
      with a sense of incompleteness. In fact, everyone on the bridge
      feels it. A bitter truth they'll have to accept.

                                 KIRK
                   Mr. Sulu, prepare to engage thrus--

                   ... Permission granted.

                                 SPOCK
                   As you have yet to select a first
                   officer, respectfully, I would like to
                   submit my candidacy. Should you desire,
                   I can provide character references.

      Kirk nearly laughs. Spock's eyebrow goes up. Something passes
      between them... it carries acceptance, and trust...

                                 KIRK
                   It would be my honor, Commander.

           Then I ask that you do yourself a
           favor... put away logic, and do what
           feels right. The world you've inherited
           lives in the shadow of incalculable
           devastation... but there's no reason you
           must face it alone.

And from around his neck, he removes the PENDANT that until now,
we've only caught glimpses of. Places it on the table beside
his younger self. The feeling in his eyes is profound...

                         SPOCK PRIME (CONT'D)
           This was a gift to me.   Representing...
           a dream. One we were unable to fulfill.
                   (softly)
           The way you can now.

And moves to the door.    Stops.   Offers the VULCAN SALUTE:

                         SPOCK PRIME (CONT'D)
           As my customary farewell would appear
           oddly self serving, I will simply say...
           good luck.

Their eyes hold. Spock turns, disappearing into the corridor.
Young Spock stares at the empty doorway a beat, his mind a
jumble of thoughts. Looks to the pendant... and realizes it's a
HOLO-EMITTER. After considering a beat, he hits an activation
button and a MOVING HOLOGRAPHIC MESSAGE materializes before him:

CAPTAIN JAMES T. KIRK. WILLIAM SHATNER.      As always, brash, wry,
confident -- and SINGING:

                         KIRK/ SHATNER
           Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to
           you...
                   (stops, grins)
           I know I know, it's illogical to
           celebrate something you had nothing to do
           with, but I haven't had the chance to
           congratulate you on your appointment to
           the ambassadorship so I thought I'd seize
           the occasion... Bravo, Spock -- they tell
           me your first mission may take you away
           for awhile, so I'll be the first to wish
           you luck... and to say...
                   (beat, emotional)
           I miss you, old friend.

                                      136

... and we're PUSHING IN on Young Spock, taking in the image of
Kirk's future self, the message, but above all -- the clear,
unquestionable friendship these two men had...

INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

As Spock Prime walks off down the corridor, he passes right by a
man conferring with a nurse -- the man pauses, turns... it's
SAREK. Suddenly overcome by a feeling that the stranger who's
just passed him is... oddly familiar.

                         KIRK/SHATNER (V.O.)
           I suppose I'd always imagined us...
           outgrowing Starfleet together. Watching
           life swing us into our Emeritus years...

INT. STARBASE ONE - HANGAR - ETERNAL NIGHT

MUSIC BUILDING -- glass walls reveal THE ENTERPRISE at dock,
UTILITY CRAFTS floating around it, repairing. Standing at
attention in rows, THE ENTERPRISE CREW -- over four hundred of
them wearing DRESS UNIFORMS -- TRACK DOWN the faces, all proud:

                         KIRK/SHATNER (V.O.)
           I look around at the new cadets now and
           can't help thinking... has it really been
           so long? Wasn't it only yesterday we
           stepped onto the Enterprise as boys?
           That I had to prove to the crew I
           deserved command... and their respect?

And we STOP ON YOUNG KIRK. Composed, focused, proud. A man.
And to every fan's delight, finally wearing his YELLOW SHIRT.
The FEDERATION COMMANDANT stands at a podium:

                         COMMANDANT
           This assembly calls Captain James
           Tiberius Kirk...

Kirk breaks from formation, pivots, marches down the hangar --
past UHURA... SULU... CHEKOV... SCOTTY. All Beaming. Notably
absent, is Spock. Kirk ascends the stairs, snaps to attention:

                         COMMANDANT (CONT'D)
           Your inspirational valor and supreme
           dedication to your comrades are in
           keeping with the highest traditions of
           service and reflect utmost credit to
           yourself, your crew, and the Federation.
           By Starfleet Order 28455, you are hereby
           directed to report to Commanding Officer,
           USS Enterprise, for duty as his relief.

                                         137
CONTINUED:

Kirk turns. Walks to... PIKE. In a wheelchair now, wearing an
ADMIRAL'S UNIFORM. Overnight, his hair's turned totally grey --
but despite his trauma, his pride's overwhelming. They SALUTE
each other:

                           KIRK
             I relieve you, Sir.

                           PIKE
             ... I am relieved.

He opens a BOX in his lap -- glorious in repose, a MEDAL:

                           PIKE (CONT'D)
             And as Fleet Admiral, for your... unique
             solution to the Kobayashi Maru, it's my
             honor to award you with a commendation
             for original thinking.

Pike containing a smirk, pins the medal to Kirk's chest...

                           PIKE (CONT'D)
                     (a touch choked)
             Congratulations, Captain.

                           KIRK
             Thank you, Sir.

Kirk turns to the crowd. Eyes shining. WILD APPLAUSE.    OUR
MUSIC SOARS. Bones leans in to Sulu, rolling his eyes:

                           BONES
             ... Same ship, different day.

As Kirk rejoins his crew for hugs and congratulations, we go to
the BACK of the hangar... SPOCK PRIME. Watching. Moved beyond
words. He turns and leaves them to it... as he goes...

                           KIRK/SHATNER (V.O.)
             I know what you'd say -- `It's their turn
             now, Jim...' And of course you're
             right... but it got me thinking:

INT. STARFLEET HOSPITAL - EARTH - DAY

Our montage comes full circle as we END on Kirk's transmission:

                            KIRK/SHATNER
             Who's to say we can't go one more round?
             By the last tally, only twenty five
             percent of the galaxy's been chartered...
             I'd call that negligent. Criminal even --
             an invitation.
                            (MORE)

                                       138
CONTINUED:
                           KIRK/SHATNER (CONT'D)
             You once said being a starship captain
             was my first, best destiny... if that's
             true, then yours is to be by my side. If
             there's any true logic to the universe...
             we'll end up on that bridge again
             someday.

Stops, grins.   Because this is the part he needs to say most...

                           KIRK
             Admit it, Spock. For people like us, the
             journey itself... is home.

Young Spock's face.   Lost in feelings that flood through him.

                             Neutral Zone, all systems

 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 
                   As the ANGLE WIDENS, we see the crew at stations;
                   (screens and visual displays are in use): COMMANDER
                   SULU at the helm, COMMANDER UHURA at the Comm Con-
                   sole, DR. BONES McCOY and SPOCK at his post. The
                   Captain is new -- and unexpected. LT. SAAVIK is young
                   and beautiful. She is half Vulcan and half Romulan.
                   In appearance she is Vulcan with pointed ears, but her
                   skin is fair and she has none of the expressionless
                   facial immobility of a Vulcan.

 SULU                              Leaving Section Fourteen for
                             Section Fifteen.

 SAAVIK                              Project parabolic course to
                             avoid entering Neutral Zone.

 SULU                              Aye, Captain.

 UHURA                                      (suddenly)
                             Captain... I'm getting something
                             on the distress channel. Minimal
                             signal... But something...

 SAAVIK                              Can you amplify?

 UHURA                              I'm trying...

 SULU                              Course change projected.

 UHURA                              It's an emergency distress call!

 SAAVIK                              On speakers!

 SULU                              May I remind the Captain that if a
                             Starship enters the zone --

                   On screen we see the approach  of the Klingon vessels,
                   they are dark and sinister.

 SAAVIK                                      (continuing)
                             Battle stations! Activate shields!

                   The ALARM SOUNDS.

 COMPUTER VOICE                              Klingons on attack course and closing.

                   Screen verifies this. Saavik makes an agonized choice.

 SAAVIK                              We're over our heads. Mr. Sulu,
                             get us out of here.

 SULU                              I'll try, Captain.

 COMPUTER VOICE                              Klingon cruisers approaching,
                             bearing 090, mark 20.

 SAAVIK                              Visual!

                   The image flops: more Klingons approach. They FIRE
                   photon torpedoes.

 SAAVIK                                      (continuing)
                             Evasive action!

                   Sulu does his best, but Enterprise is hit; Sulu is
                   hurled from his station, and Bones hurries to him.

 SAAVIK                                      (continuing)
                             Engineering! damage report!

                             to return fire!

                   The bridge takes another hit -- a big one. In its wake
                   there is a second electrical EXPLOSION along the communi-
                   cations panel. Uhura falls from her station. Bones
                   rushes to her side amid the smoke and alarms.

 A CADET                              Shields collapsing, Captain!

 SCOTTY'S VOICE (FILTERED)                              Captain, we're losing auxiliary
                             power!

 SAAVIK                              Fire all phasers...!

 SPOCK                              No power to the weapons system,
                             sir.

                   Another hit: reverberating flashes of spark and flame
                   on the bridge. Spock dies. Bones comes to him, but
                   even as he coughs his way through the smoke, a final
                   hit and Bones falls. The room is smoke filled and a
                   shambles. Saavik looks about in shock.

 SCOTTY'S VOICE (FILTERED)                              Captain, it's no use. We're
                             dead in space.

                   Saavik digests this for a painful moment. Then, touch-
                   ing a comm button:

 SAAVIK                              Activate escape pods. Send out the

 KIRK'S VOICE (FILTERED)                              All right, open her up.

                   There is a loud CLANGING and  --

 4 FULL SHOT - ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 4 
                   The side walls of the "bridge" slide apart, revealing
                   a lighted room beyond. Through the opening strides
                   KIRK. He stops, surveys the shambles, and shakes his
                   head.

 SAAVIK                              Any suggestions, Admiral?

 KIRK                              Prayer, Mr. Saavik. The Klingons
                             do not take prisoners.
                                     (to Spock)
                             Captain.

 SPOCK                              Trainees to the briefing room.

                   Sulu awakens with a grin. Uhura straightens herself
                   demurely. The Trainees head toward the distant room,
                   Spock rises and leaves. Bones remains on the floor,
                   head propped in his hand, whimsically.

 KIRK                              Physician, heal thyself.

 BONES                              That's all you have to say?

 KIRK                              I'm not a drama critic.

                   Bones rolls his eyes and rises. Kirk sees Saavik who
                   has not moved.

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Well, Mr. Saavik, are you going
                             to stay with the sinking ship?

 SAAVIK                              Permission to speak candidly, sir?

 KIRK                              Very well.

 SAAVIK                                      (fights emotion)
                             I don't believe this was a fair
                             test of my command capabilities.

 KIRK                              And why not?

 SAAVIK                              Because... there was no way to win.

 KIRK                              A no-win situation is a possibility
                             every commander may face. Has that
                             never occurred to you?

 SAAVIK                              ... No, sir. It has not.

 KIRK                              How we deal with death is at least
                             as important as how we deal with
                             life, wouldn't you say?

 SAAVIK                                      (falters)
                             As I indicated, Admiral, that
                             thought had not occurred to me.

 KIRK                              Then you have something new to think
                             about. Carry on.

                   She stays at attention.

 BONES                              Wouldn't it be easier to put
                             an experienced crew back on the
                             ship?

 KIRK                              They'll learn. Galloping about the
                             cosmos is a game for the young,
                             doctor.

                   He leaves. They look at each other.

 UHURA                                      (offended)
                             What is that supposed to mean?

                   HOLD ON Saavik.

 5 INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE SIMULATOR ROOM - DAY 5 
                   Kirk rounds the corner and sees Spock, leaning against
                   the wall.

 KIRK                                      (dry)
                             Aren't you dead?

                   Spock almost smiles.

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             I assume you are loitering here
                             to learn what efficiency rating
                             I plan to give your cadets.

 SPOCK                              I am understandably curious.

                   They walk together.

 KIRK                              They destroyed the simulator room
                             and you with it.

 SPOCK                              The Kobayshi Maru scenario 
                             frequently wreaks havoc with
                             students and equipment.
                                     (dry)
                             As I recall you took the test
                             three times yourself. Your final
                             solution was, shall we say, unique?

 KIRK                                      (solemn)
                             It had the virtue of never having
                             been tried.                             

 SPOCK                              Yours was not a solution which
                             would have occurred to a Vulcan
                             mentality.

 KIRK                              So you said at the time. Speaking
                             of which, your protg's first
                             rare -- a trifle emotional --

 SPOCK                              She's half Romulan, Jim. The
                             admixture makes her more volatile
                             than -- me, for example.

 KIRK                              Than you. Yes, I see that. By
                             the way, thank you for this.

                   He lifts the book.

 SPOCK                              I know of your fondness for antiques.

 KIRK                                      (reads)
                             'It was the best of times, it was
                             the worst of times...' Message,
                             Spock?

 SPOCK                              None of which I am consciously
                             aware -- except, of course, happy
                             birthday -- surely the best of times.

                   Kirk looks around uncomfortably, overlaps:

 KIRK                              Hrummm... and where are you off
                             to, now?

 SPOCK                              The Enterprise. I must check in
                             before your inspection. And you?

 KIRK                                      (shortly)
                             Home.

                   Spock studies him --

 SPOCK                              Something oppresses you.

                   They are old friends --

 KIRK                              Something.

                   He steps into a turbo elevator. The doors close as
                   Spock watches, wiping the scene.

                   In f.g. is the U.S.S. RELIANT, an older, somewhat
                   battered starship of the ENTERPRISE class, with a
                   slightly different configuration. Reliant approaches
                   an inhospitable-looking yellow planet: CETI ALPHA V

                             This report classified MOST SECRET.
                             Log Entry by Commander Pavel Chekov,
                             Duty Officer. Starship USS Reliant
                             on orbital approach with Ceti Alpha

                             our search for a lifeless planet
                             which will serve as a suitable test

                             This is the 16th planet we have
                             visited, so far, no success.
 7 INT. BRIDGE OF RELIANT 7 
                   Well-aged and distinctive. The usual compliment of
                   officers and crew. CAPTAIN CLARK TERRELL, about 45,
                   soft spoken and in good shape, but somewhat laconic.

                   Behind Terrell, surveying the data screen is COMMANDER
                   CHEKOV, aged some, but still boyish.

 TERRELL                              Standard orbit, Mr. Beach.

 BEACH                              Standard orbit, sir.

 TERRELL                              Any change in surface scan?

 BEACH                              Negative. Limited atmosphere,
                             dominated by craylon gas, sand and
                             high velocity winds. Incapable
                             of supporting life forms.

                   Forward screen: Ceti Alpha.

 CHEKOV                              Does it have to be completely
                             lifeless?

                   Terrell rises and crosses to Chekov.

 TERRELL                              Don't tell me you've got something.

 CHEKOV                                      (points)
                             We've picked up a minor energy flux
                             reading on one dyno scanner.

 TERRELL                              Damn! Are you sure? Maybe the
                             scanner's out of adjustment --

 CHEKOV                              I suppose it could be a particle
                             of preanimate matter caught in the
                             matrix...

 TERRELL                              All right, let's get on the Comm-pic to
                             Doctor Marcus. Maybe it's something
                             we can transplant.

 CHEKOV                              You know what she'll say...

 8 EXT. DEEP SPACE - REGULA I SPACE STATION 8 
                   A functional cluster of modules serve as a scientific
                   complex, a futuristic White Sands, orbiting a small
                   barren plantoid in b.g.: Regula.

 CAROL MARCUS'S VOICE (FILTERED)                              Something you can transplant? I
                             don't know --

 9 INT. SPACE STATION - CAROL'S LAB 9 
                   Big but deserted except for Carol, in contact with
                   Reliant. Surrounded by equipment clearly meant for
                   many workers, CAROL MARCUS is in her early forties,
                   attractive and intelligent. Static mars the trans-
                   missions.

                   On the monitor: Terrell and Chekov, looking hopeful.

 TERRELL                              It might only be a particle of
                             preanimate matter...

 CAROL                              Then again it might not. You
                             boys have to be clear on this:
                             there can't be so much as a
                             microbe or the show's off.
                                     (she thinks)
                             Why don't you have a look? If it
                             IS something that can be moved...

 TERRELL                                      (eager)
                             You bet, doctor. We're on our way!

                   Carol sighs as the image fades, not happy.

 10 INT. CORRIDOR, SPACE STATION REGULA I 10 
                   Carol walks through the labyrinthine complex with
                   DAVID, her son, a bright young scientist of twenty.
                   He is good looking and humorous.

 DAVID                              How can you let them pull that
                             stuff on you? They're just lazy.

 CAROL                              And bored. I know. But maybe it
                             IS something they can...

 DAVID                              Come on, Mother, that's just the
                             military mentality. Never put off
                             tomorrow what you can put off today.
                             If there's one atom of life...

 CAROL                              I know, I know...

                   Silence.

 DAVID                              Well, don't have kittens.
                             Genesis is going to work. They'll
                             remember  you in a wreath with
                             Newton, Einstein, Surak...

 CAROL                                      (mock outrage)
                             Thanks a lot. No respect from my
                             offspring --

 DAVID                              Par for the course... you teaming
                             up with me for bridge after dinner?

 CAROL                              Maybe...

 DAVID                              Every time we have dealings with
                             Starfleet, I get nervous.
                                     (shrugs)
                             We're dealing with something
                             that COULD be perverted into
                             a dreadful weapon. Remember that
                             overgrown boy scout you used to
                             hang out with? That's exactly
                             the --

                   They walk past the CAMERA, their VOICES FADING.

 CAROL                              Listen, kiddo, Jim Kirk was many
                             things, but he was never a Boy
                             Scout...

                   HOLD ON the empty corridor.

 11 INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT, TERRA - NIGHT 11 
                   Kirk reads the novel, trying to focus. His flat befits
                   an Admiral and a loner with few possessions, except
                   a collection of antiques.

 WE HEAR A SOFT BONG. 
                   Startled, Kirk lowers the book and pushes a button.

 KIRK                              Come.

                   The door slides open and Bones enters. He carries two
                   packages, one of them wrapped in brown paper.

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Bless me, doctor; and what beams
                             you into this neck of the woods?

 BONES                              'Beware Romulans bearing gifts.'
                             Happy Birthday...

                   With a flourish, he pulls out a bottle of blue
                   liquid.

 KIRK                              Romulan Ale! Bones, you know
                             this stuff is illegal --

 BONES                                      (broad)
                             I only use it for medicinal
                             purposes. Don't be a pring...

 KIRK                                      (reading the label
                                       with difficulty)
                             Twenty-two, eighty-three...

 BONES                              Takes the stuff a while to
                             ferment. Gimme.

                   He takes the bottle and pours; continues talking.

 BONES                                      (continuing)
                             Now open the other one.

                   Kirk starts to obey.

 KIRK                              I'm almost afraid to. What did
                             you bring me, contraband Klingon --

 BONES                              More antiques for your collection
                             -- Cheers!

                   They drink. The package is opened: a pair of gold
                   "Ben Franklin" half-glasses. (N.B.: Romulan Ale is
                   an INSTANT DRUNK: both men react.)

 KIRK                              Cheers. Bones, these are... charming.

 BONES                              Four hundred years old. You don't
                             find many with the lens still
                             intact.

 KIRK                              Uh -- what are they?

 BONES                              For your eyes. For most patients
                             of your age, I generally administer
                             Retlax Five to restore flexibility
                             of the lens.

 KIRK                              But I'm allergic to Retlax.

 BONES                              Exactly. Happy birthday.

                   He toasts. Kirk is unsure how they work.

 BONES                                      (continuing)
                             Slide them down your nose. Now look
                             at me over the top. And you read
                             printed matter through the bottom.

 KIRK                                      (reacts)
                             Amazing! I don't know what to say --

 BONES                              Say thank you.

 KIRK                              Thank you.

                   An awkward silence.

 BONES                              Damn it, Jim, what the hell's the
                             matter? Other people have birthdays.
                             Why're we treating yours like a funeral?

 KIRK                              Bones, I don't want to be lectured.

 BONES                              What DO you want? Damn it, why
                             isn't there a girl here? You know
                             this has nothing to do with age.
                             This is about you flying a goddamn
                             computer console when you wanna be
                             out hopping Galaxies.

 KIRK                              Spare me your notions of poetry,
                             please. We all have our assigned
                             duties and...

 BONES                              Bull. You're hiding -- hiding
                             behind the rules and regulations --

 KIRK                              And who am I hiding from?

 BONES                              From yourself, Admiral.

                   Pause. Kirk pours another drink.

 KIRK                              Don't mince words, Bones; tell
                             me what you really think.

 BONES                                      (mild take)
                             I'm your doctor and I'm your friend, 
                             Jim. Get back your command. Get it
                             back before you really do grow old.
                             Before you turn into part of this
                             collection.

                   They look at each other.

 12 EXT. RELIANT - DEEP SPACE 12 
                   orbiting Ceti Alpha V.

                   VOICES OVER indicate the transporter room is ready.

 13 OMITTED 13 
 14 EXT. SURFACE CETI ALPHA V 14 
                   A YELLOW PLANET, in constant SWIRLING HURRICANE WINDS
                   OF SAND. Terrell and Chekov materialize. Their VOICES,
                   filtered, are hard to make out.

                   With the TRICORDER to guide them, they set out...

 TERRELL                              Are you sure these are the
                             coordinates?

 CHEKOV                              Captain, this is the garden spot
                             of Ceti Alpha VI --

 TERRELL                              I can hardly see --

 15 SEVERAL ANGLES 15 
                   The difficult search, the men leaning into the wind --

 16 TERRELL 16 
                   is ahead of Chekov on a slight rise --

 CHEKOV                              There's nothing, let's go --

 17 ANGLE 17 
                   Terrell waves him frantically forward. As Chekov
                   moves up, we rise with him to the top of the ridge and
                   look down.

 18 ANGLE - THEIR POV 18 
                   A RUINED SERIES OF MAN-MADE STRUCTURES, half buried in
                   sand. They look at each other in consternation. Chekov
                   is worried; something about all this is familiar.

                   They descend towards the structures, now seen to be the
                   wreckage of some sort of space craft.

                   They pass but do not notice the FEDERATION LOGO, half
                   buried next to their feet.

 TERRELL                              They look like cargo carriers...

                   As Chekov looks at the porthole, a face suddenly looks
                   back! It is the face of a CHILD! The Apparition
                   scares the daylights out of Chekov -- and us. He
                   screams.

 TERRELL                                      (continuing)
                             What is it?

                   He comes clumsily over --

 CHEKOV                              A face! I saw -- it was like a
                             child --

                   He points. The porthole is empty.

 TERRELL                              You're crazy -- !

 CHEKOV                              I saw it -- !

 TERRELL                              There's an air-lock.

                   He points and they go into the airlock.

 19 INT. CARGO HOLD 19 
                   Terrell and Chekov enter, dumbfounded. THEIR POV.
                   Someone lives here -- there are beds, food, all jury-
                   rigged -- but no people. Terrell checks a monitor.

 TERRELL                              There's breathable atmosphere in here.

                   He takes off his helmet; Chekov likewise.

 TERRELL                                      (continuing)
                             What the hell is this? Did they
                             crash? Where's the rest of the
                             ship?

                   They wander as they talk, picking up objects that be-
                   speak a fairly sophisticated ad hoc environment: a
                   laboratory in one hold; a kitchen; A LARGE SAND TANK
                   filled with disgusting CETI EELS.

                   ABRUPTLY A SOUND -- They start: CHILD'S GURGLE.

 CHEKOV                                      (terrified)
                             I told you! I told you I saw a --

 TERRELL                              Ssssh!

                   They start looking. They enter a new chamber --

 20 KHAN'S QUARTERS 20 
                   On its side in the sand: the walls are now the floor,
                   etc. All in crookedness -- like its owner. On the
                   floor, smiling at them (i.e., the wall) is a BABY.

                   Tentatively they come over to it, looking around --

 21 ANGLE - CHEKOV'S POV 21 
                   Lethal-looking odd swords on one wall, a bookshelf;
                   CAMERA PANS by 20th Century volumes; MOBY DICK, KING
                   LEAR, THE HOLY BIBLE -- and a seat belt dangling with
                   the name on it -- Botany Bay.

                   Chekov mouths the words, softly at first, then aloud --

 CHEKOV                              Botany Bay -- oh no!

 TERRELL                                      (examines the child)
                             What's the matter -- ?

                   Chekov runs, tries to get his helmet on, tries to drag
                   Terrell --

 CHEKOV                              Captain, we've got to get out of
                             here -- now! Damn! Hurry!

                   Terrell catches his urgency --

 TERRELL                              But the child --

 CHEKOV                              Never mind! Hurry!

 22 EXT. CARGO HOLD AIRBAY 22 
                   Terrell and Chekov emerge, helmeted, then stop dead.

 23 ANGLE - THEIR POV 23 
                   A RING OF SUITED FIGURES has them surrounded.

 24 INT. RELIANT - THE BRIDGE 24 
                   Mr. Beach, the duty officer, stands looking at Ceti
                   Alpha V on the forward screen.

 BEACH                              Try again.

 KYLE                              Starship Reliant to Captain Terrell
                             ... This is Lieutenant Kyle. Will
                             you please respond, Captain...
                             Captain Terrell, respond please.

                   Nothing.

 BEACH                                      (thinks)
                             Let's give them a little more
                             time.

 25 INT. CARGO HOLD - CETI ALPHA V 25 
                   Terrell and Chekov are held by FOUR STRONG MEN.

                   They seem to be waiting. One of the men is JOACHIM.

                   Out of the airlock steps a tall masked figure. A
                   moment of suspense as Terrell and Chekov watch, terri-
                   fied. The mask is peeled back.

 CHEKOV                                      (aloud despite himself)
                             Khan!

                   KHAN is startled by the recognition; comes over and
                   examines Chekov and Terrell.

 KHAN                                      (finally)
                             I don't know you. But you. I never
                             forget a face. Mister Chekov,
                             isn't it?
                                     (wonderingly)
                             I never thought to see your face
                             again.

 TERRELL                              Chekov, who is this man?

 CHEKOV                              A criminal, Captain -- a product of
                             the late 20th Century genetic
                             engineering --

 TERRELL                              What do you want with us? I demand --

 KHAN                                      (mild)
                             You are in a position to demand
                             nothing, sir. I, on the other hand,
                             am in a position to grant nothing.
                             What you see is all that remains of
                             the ship's company and the crew of the
                             Botany Bay, marooned here fifteen
                             years ago by Captain James T. Kirk.

 TERRELL                              Listen to me -- you men and women --

 KHAN                              Save your strength, Captain, these
                             people have sworn to live and die at
                             my command two hundred years before
                             you were born. Do you mean he...
                                      (i.e. Chekov)
                             ... never told you the tale?
                             To amuse you, Captain? Never told
                             you how the Enterprise picked up the
                             Botany Bay, lost in space from the
                             year 1996, myself and the ship's
                             company in cryogenic freeze?

 TERRELL                              I've never even met Admiral Kirk --

 KHAN                              Admiral? He didn't tell you how
                             Admiral Kirk sent seventy of us into
                             exile on this barren sand heap with
                             only the contents of these cargo bays
                             to sustain us?

 CHEKOV                              You lie! On Ceti Alpha V there was
                             life, a fair chance to --

 KHAN                              This is Ceti Alpha V! Ceti Alpha VI
                             exploded six months after we were
                             left here. The shock shifted the
                             orbit of this planet and everything
                             was laid waste. Admiral Kirk never
                             bothered to check on our progress.
                             It was only the fact of my genetically
                             engineered intellect that enabled us
                             to survive! On earth, two hundred
                             years ago, I was a prince, with power
                             over millions -- now, like Prometheus
                             I have been left by Admiral Kirk to
                             digest my own entrails.

 CHEKOV                              Captain Kirk was your host! You repaid
                             his hospitality by trying to steal his
                             ship and murder him.

 KHAN                                      (moves closer)
                             And I'll wager he never told you
                             about his shipmate, the beautiful
                             and courageous Lieutenant McGiver,
                             who gave up everything to join me
                             in exile. OUT OF LOVE. And see how
                             Admiral Kirk requited her devotion --
                             She's dead as earth!

                   The wind howls in the silence. When Khan turns, his
                   eyes are filled with tears.

 KHAN                                      (continuing)
                             A plague upon you all.

                   He recovers his poise and returns to them --

 KHAN                                      (continuing)
                             You didn't expect to find me.
                             You thought this was Ceti Alpha VI.
                             Why are you here?

                   They don't answer. Khan goes over to Terrell and, WITH
 ONE HAND, LIFTS HIM INTO THE AIR -- 
 KHAN                                      (continuing)
                             Why?

                   Terrell gasps, stays silent --

 KHAN                                      (continuing)
                             No matter.

                   He lets go; Terrell falls with a thud --

 KHAN                                      (continuing)
                             You will soon tell me willingly
                             enough.

                   He goes over to the tank and dips a kind of strainer in,
                   pulling out TWO CETI EELS -- wriggling items --

 KHAN                                      (continuing)
                             Let me introduce you to Ceti Alpha V's
                             only remaining indigenous life form;
                             what do you think? They've killed
                             twenty of my people, including my
                             beloved wife. Oh, not all at once
                             and not instantly, to be sure. Their
                             young enter through the ears and wrap
                             themselves around the cerebral cortex.
                             This has the effect of rendering the
                             victim extremely susceptible to
                             suggestion. Later, as they grow,
                             follows madness, paralysis -- and
                             death. These are pets, of course --
                             not quite domesticated.

                   As he speaks, Khan dumps an eel in each of their helmets;
                   he swirls the helmets around as though he were mixing
                   martinis --

 CHEKOV                              Khan, listen to me! Captain Kirk
                             was only doing his duty! You --

 26 CLOSE UP - KHAN - CAMERA IN 26 KHAN                              There is some pain at first, I am
                             told, and then the effects are quite
                             benign -- until the end. That was
                             what I learned from watching my wife.

                   At a sign, the helmets are slammed down. As the muffled
                   shrieks are heard from within, the eels crawl across
                   the faces of Chekov and Terrell; with unerring in-
                   stincts they head for the ears of the two hapless men.
                   There is some atrocious pain as they enter -- then
                   dazed calm.

 KHAN                                      (continuing)
                             That's better! Now: tell me why
                             you are here -- and tell me where I
                             may find James Kirk.

                   A new composite. Bones, Sulu, Uhura and Kirk -- who
                   sits, reading. Through the windows we can see the
                   approach to the starship ENTERPRISE. Kirk looks up,
                   nods. Sulu activates a comm button.

 SULU                              Enterprise, this is Admiral Kirk's
                             party on final approach.

 ENTERPRISE VOICE                                      (filtered)
                             Enterprise welcomes you. Prepare 
                             for docking.

                   Kirk looks up from his book as Sulu sits next to him.

 KIRK                              I really must thank you.

 SULU                                      (embarrassed)
                             I am delighted; any chance to go
                             aboard Enterprise, however briefly,
                             is always an excuse for nostalgia.

 KIRK                              I cut your new orders personally. By
                             the end of the month, you'll have your
                             first command: USS EXCELSIOR.

 SULU                              Thank you, sir. I've looked
                             forward to this for a long time.

 KIRK                              You've earned it. But I'm still
                             grateful to have you at the helm
                             for three weeks. I don't believe
                             these kids can steer.

                   Sulu laughs.

 30 EXT. SPOCE DOCK - TERRA (FEATURE STOCK) 30 
                   The shuttle approaches the mammoth airstrip. As we
                   near the ship, a few WORK CREWS IN SPACE flit about
                   her hull, working.

 31 EXT. ENTERPRISE (FEATURE STOCK) 31 
                   The shuttle makes its way to the Docking Lock of the
                   mother ship and settles in place.

 32 INT. ENTERPRISE DOCKING BAY 32 
                   A reception group awaits, led by Captain Spock. Saavik
                   stands at his side, in company of the Trainee crew.
                   Also present: CHIEF ENGINEER MR. SCOTT and members of
                   his staff in their distinctive uniforms.

 INTERCOM VOICE                              Docking procedure complete.

 SPOCK                              Prepare for Admiral's inspection.

                   The group comes to attention.

 SPOCK                                      (continuing)
                             Open the Air Lock.

                   The doors open. Kirk and his staff are piped aboard
                   by an electronic version of the boatswain's tradi-
                   tional whistle. Kirk salutes the Federation symbol
                   and steps forward to exchange salutes with Spock.

 KIRK                              Permission to come aboard, Captain?

 SPOCK                              Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe
                             you know my trainee crew. Certainly
                             they have come to know you.

 KIRK                                      (dryly to Saavik)
                             Yes, we've been through death and
                             life together.

                   Saavik stiffens slightly -- humor is not her forte.

 KIRK                                      (continuing to Scotty)
                             Mr. Scott, you old space dog. You're
                             well?

 SCOTTY                              I had me a wee bout -- but Dr. McCoy
                             pulled me through.

 KIRK                              Oh? A wee bout of what, Mr. Scott?

                   Uncomfortable, Scotty exchanges a glance with Bones --

 BONES                              Shore leave, Admiral.

 KIRK                              Ah.

                   He stops before a BRIGHT-FACED FOURTEEN-YEAR OLD, stand-
                   ing so stiff he looks like he'll break -- in an
                   engineer's uniform.

 KIRK                                     (continuing)
                             And who is this?

 PRESTON                                      (breathless)
                             Midshipman First Class Peter Preston,
                             engineers mate, SIR.

                   A big salute. Kirk is amused, returns the salute.

 KIRK                              Your first training voyage, Mr.
                             Preston?

 PRESTON                              Yes, SIR.

 KIRK                              I see. Well, shall we start with
                             the engine room?

                   He moves, followed by his staff.

 SCOTTY                                      (eyeing his protg)
                             I believe you'll find all in order --

 SPOCK                              We'll see you on the bridge, Admiral.

 KIRK                              Very good, Mr. Spock.

                   Kirk and party leave. CAMERA PUSHES IN ON SPOCK AND
 SAAVIK. 
 SAAVIK                              He's not what I expected, Sir.

 SPOCK                              What did you expect, Lieutenant?

 SAAVIK                                      (uncertain)
                             He's very human.

 SPOCK                              We can't all be perfect, Saavik.
                             You must control your prejudices
                             and remember that as a Vulcan as
                             well as a Romulan you are forever
                             a stranger in an alien land.
                             Around you are humans, and as a
                             member of the Starfleet you are
                             unlikely ever to escape their
                             presence or their influence.
                             You must learn to tolerance in addition
                             to all else I have taught you.
                             Tolerance is logical.

                   Saavik is humbled.

 SAAVIK                              As always, my mentor. Company dismiss.

 33 INT. ENTERPRISE ENGINE ROOM - LOOKING DOWN 33 
                   The inspection party dwarfed by the size. Silence as
                   Kirk looks around, runs a finger for dust, etc.
                   Scotty, his team and Preston, stand at attention.

 34 ANGLE - FLOOR OF ENGINE ROOM 34 
                   FEATURING power room separated by glass from the rest
                   of the facilities. Bones, Sulu, Uhura, and some train-
                   ees watch as Kirk inspects one console, clearly the
                   responsibility of the bursting Midshipman Preston.

 PRESTON                                       (blurting)
                             I believe you'll find everything
                             shipshape, Admiral.

 KIRK                                      (sternly puts
                                      him on)
                             Oh do you? Have you any idea,
                             Midshipman Preston, how many times
                             I've had to listen to Mr. Scott on
                             the Comm, telling me his troubles?
                             Have you any idea the ribbing I've
                             had to endure in the officers' mess
                             to the effect that the Enterprise
                             is a flying death trap?

 PRESTON                                      (scandalized)
                             Oh, no, sir! This is the finest
                             engine room in the whole Star --

                   The repressed grins of the others, and a smile on Scotty's
                   face tell Preston he's being had. He stops, confused.

 PRESTON                                      (continuing)
                             If the Admiral can't see the facts
                             for himself, then, with all due
                             respect, he's as blind as a Tiberion
                             bat. SIR.

                   Approving laughter. Kirk looks amused.

 KIRK                              Midshipman, you're a tiger.

 SCOTTY                              My sister's youngest, Admiral.
                             Crazy to get to space.

 KIRK                              Every young boy's fancy. I seem
                             to remember it myself.
                                     (brisk)
                             Very well. Mr. Scott, are your
                             engines capable of handling a minor
                             training cruise?

 SCOTTY                              Give the word, Admiral.

 KIRK                              Mr. Scott, the word is given.

 SCOTTY                              Aye, sir.

                   He moves off, followed by Preston, who gives one last
                   salute as Kirk leaves, followed by Bones.

 BONES                                      (dry)
                             What about the rest of the
                             inspection, Admiral?

 KIRK                              The inspection will continue once
                             we're underway, Doctor.

                   They step into the Turbo Lifts.

 35 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 35 
                   The real one, no doubt! CAMERA REVEALS the maze detail:
                   winking and blinking displays, all HANDS at station,
                   a hum of activity, Uhura and Sulu in familiar chairs,
                   Spock is in the Captain's chair, Saavik in the First
                   Officer's position. Kirk and Bones stand towards the
                   rear.

 INTERCOM VOICE                              This is Starfleet operations.
                             Enterprise is cleared for departure.

 SULU                              Admiral on the bridge!

 SPOCK                              Very well, Mr. Saavik, clear all
                             moorings.

 SAAVIK                              Aye, sir.

                   Saavik punches data into her console.

 37 INT. BRIDGE, ENTERPRISE 37 
                   Saavik watches instruments, punches data in response.

 SAAVIK                              All moorings are clear, Captain.

 SPOCK                              Thank you, Mr. Saavik.

                   Spock casts a glance at Kirk, then, to Saavik:

 SPOCK                                      (continuing)
                             Lieutenant, how many times have you
                             piloted a Starship out of Spacedock?

 SAAVIK                              Never, sir.

                   Kirk tries to conceal his reaction. Spock enjoys it.

 SPOCK                              Take her out, Mr. Saavik.

 SAAVIK                              Aye, sir.

                   Saavik settles herself in the chair, looks again at
                   the console -- Spock looks at Kirk.

 SPOCK                              There's a first time for everything,
                             Admiral.

 KIRK                                      (casual)
                             To be sure, Captain.

                   They all stifle their responses. Kirk is like a father
                   watching his kid drive the family car for the first time.

 SAAVIK                              Aft thrusters, Mr. Sulu.

 SULU                              Aft thrusters, sir.

                   Kirk starts to say something, but doesn't. Bones looks
                   at him.

 BONES                                      (sotto voice)
                             Would you like a tranquilizer?

                   Kirk shakes his head, takes a breath --

 SULU                              We are clear and free to navigate.

 SAAVIK                              Course heading, Captain?

                   Spock turns inquiringly to Kirk.

 KIRK                              Captain's discretion.

                   Spock digests this with a slight smile.

 SPOCK                              Mr. Sulu, you may follow your nose.

 45 INT. RELIANT BRIDGE 45 
                   Khan occupies the Captain's chair. We PULL BACK: the
                   crew of the RELIANT has been replaced by Khan's fol-
                   lowers in their odd-looking clothes.

                   At the helm is Joachim, Khan's lieutenant. He is in the
                   largest and brightest of Khan's group. Terrell sits in
                   the First Officer's chair, Chekov at the Comm Console.
                   Their behavior is normal, save for subtle hesitation,
                   symptoms of their mind-controlled state.

 JOACHIM                              Steady on course. All systems normal.

 KHAN                              It's not much different from
                             Enterprise.

                             years ago, Captain Kirk kindly allowed
                             me to memorize her technical manuals.
                             And now, Mr. Chekov, let us review:
                             You say you have no details of
                             Project 'Genesis' ?

 CHEKOV                              Beyond what I told you, sir, it is
                             classified information.

 KHAN                              Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have
                             access to such information?

 CHEKOV                              I would think so, sir. He's on the
                             Fleet General Staff.

 KHAN                              Then to whom do you report directly
                             regarding Genesis?

 CHEKOV                              To Doctor Marcus, the civilian
                             director of the experiments on Space
                             Laboratory Regula I.

 KHAN                                      (thinks)
                             I see. Helmsman?

 HELMSMAN                              Aye, sir.

 JOACHIM                              May I speak? We're all with you,
                             sir, but consider: we are free,
                             we have a ship and the means to
                             go where we will. We have
                             escaped permanent exile on Ceti
                             Alpha V. You have proved your
                             superior intellect and defeated
                             the plans of Admiral Kirk.
                             You do not need to defeat him
                             again.

 KHAN                              He tasks me -- and I'll have him. I'll
                             chase him round the moons of Nibia
                             and round the Antares maelstrom and
                             round perdition's flames before I give
                             him up.
                                     (as no one speaks)
                             Prepare to alter course -- for Space

 47 INT. CAROL'S LAB 47 
                   Huge and busy. Among the scientists going about their
                   tasks are JEDDA, a Deltan; MARCH, thin intense;
                   MADISON, black, easy going. They are all young and
                   earnest. Carol and David huddle over a computer
                   console.

 DAVID                              Does that about do it?

 CAROL                              I don't think there's another piece
                             of information we could squeeze
                             into the memory banks. Next
                             time, we'll design a bigger
                             one.

 DAVID                              Who --

                   Jedda at the Comm Console overlaps.

 JEDDA                              Comm-Pic coming in on hyperchannel
                             ... It's Reliant.

                   Carol moves forward as the others close in.

 CAROL                              On the screen, please, Jedda.

                   Buttons punched; the screen ebbs, flows and crackles
                   on. ON SCREEN is CHEKOV.

 CHEKOV                              ... come in, please. This is Reliant
                             calling Regula I. Repeat. This is
                             USS Reliant --

 CAROL                              Commander, we are receiving. This
                             is Regula I. Go ahead.

 CHEKOV                              Dr. Marcus... good. We're en route
                             to you and should be there in three
                             days.

 CAROL                              En route? Why? We weren't expecting
                             you for another three months. Has
                             something happened?
                                     (pause)
                             Has something happened? Do you read 
                             us?

 CHEKOV                                      (fractional pause)
                             All went well. Nothing has happened.
                             Ceti Alpha VI has checked out.

                   Pleased reaction from the scientists.

 CAROL                              I still don't under --

 CHEKOV                              We have received new orders. Upon our
                             arrival at Regula I, all materials of
                             Project Genesis will be transferred to
                             this ship for immediate testing at
                             Ceti Alpha VI.

                   Consternation in the lab. David is livid -- the words
                   "Bullshit" are overlapped  by his mother.

 CAROL                              Will you please be quiet!
                                     (back to console)
                             Commander Chekov, this is completely
                             irregular. Who gave the order you
                             are quoting? Who gave the order?

 CHEKOV                                      (still smiling)
                             The order comes from Starfleet
                             command, Dr. Marcus, direct from
                             the General Staff.

 CAROL                              But Genesis is a civilian project,
                             under my control --

 CHEKOV                              I have my orders.

 DAVID                              Pin him down, mother! Who gave the
                             orders!?

                   Chekov hesitates, seems to be listening to someone off
                   the monitor.

 CHEKOV                              The orders come from Admiral James
                             T. Kirk.

                   Sensation in the lab.

 DAVID                              I knew it! I knew it! All along
                             the military has wanted to get their
                             hands on this --

                   He starts to press a button; Carol pushes his hand
                   away and communicates herself.

 CAROL                              This is completely improper,
                             Commander Chekov. I have no
                             intention of allowing Reliant or
                             any other unauthorized personnel
                             access to our work or materials.

 CHEKOV                                      (pauses; listens)
                             I'm sorry you feel that way, Doctor.
                             Admiral Kirk's orders are confirmed.
                             Please prepare to deliver Genesis to
                             us upon our arrival. Reliant out.

                   The image fades.

 CAROL                              Commander Chekov -- !

                   Chekov, in a matched cut, turns away as CAMERA WIDENS
                   TO REVEAL KHAN by his side. He is charming.

 KHAN                              Well done, Commander.

 CHEKOV                              You realize, sir, that they will
                             attempt to contact Admiral Kirk and
                             confirm the order.

                   Khan smiles, more charming than ever as we move in.

 49 INT. REGULA I LAB 49 
                   Everyone is talking at once.

 CAROL                              Will you please be quiet! We must
                             have order here.
                                     (as they subside)
                             This has to be some sort of mistake.

 DAVID                              Mistake? We're all alone here.
                             They waited until everyone was on
                             shift-leave to do this. Reliant is
                             supposed to be at our disposal, not
                             vice-versa.

 MADISON                              It seems clear that Starfleet never
                             intended that --

 CAROL                              I know, but --

 DAVID                              I've tried to warn you. Scientists
                             are always pawns of the military --

 CAROL                                      (angry)
                             Starfleet has kept the peace for
                             a hundred years, I cannot and
                             will not subscribe to your 
                             interpretation of this event.

                   Silence.

 JEDDA                                      (Deltan cool)
                             You may be right, Doctor, but what
                             about Reliant? She's on her way.

                   Carol reacts: this is certainly true.

 CAROL                              Get your gear together where it's
                             handy.

 MARCH                              Where are we going? 

 CAROL                              That's for us to know and Reliant
                             to find out. We have only three
                             days. Let's not waste time.

                   They split off in different directions as ordered.

 52 INT. ENTERPRISE CORRIDOR 52 
                   Kirk waits for the Turbo Lift, which opens at last. As
                   he gets in --

 SAAVIK'S VOICE                              Hold please -- !

                   Kirk holds and Saavik dashes in. She is surprised to
                   see him.

 SAAVIK                                      (continuing)
                             Thank you, sir.

                   Kirk nods, the doors close. There is an uneasy forced
                   intimacy between them.

 KIRK                              Lieutenant, are you wearing your
                             hair differently?

 SAAVIK                              It is still regulation, Admiral.

                   She reaches out and touches a button. The lift stops.

 SAAVIK                                      (continuing)
                             May I speak, sir?

 KIRK                              Lieutenant, self-expression does not
                             seem to be one of your problems.

 SAAVIK                              I wish to thank you for the high 
                             efficiency rating.

 KIRK                              You earned it.

 SAAVIK                              I did not think so.

 KIRK                              You're bothered by your performance
                             on the Kobayashi Maru.

 SAAVIK                              I failed to resolve the situation.

 KIRK                              There is no correct resolution.
                             It is a test of character.

 SAAVIK                              May I ask how you dealt with the
                             test?

 KIRK                                      (amused)
                             You may ask, Lieutenant.

                   She stares.

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             That was a little joke.

 SAAVIK                              Humor... that is a difficult concept
                             ... it is not logical...

 KIRK                              We learn by doing, Lieutenant.

                   She's a laugh a minute. Kirk pushes the button; the
                   elevator starts.

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             You want my advice?

                   She studies him, considering. No doubt about it, the
                   attraction is mutual and she has no idea how to handle
                   it.

 SAAVIK                              Yes.

 KIRK                              Take the test again.

                   The lift stops and the doors open.

 BONES                              Who's been holding up the damn
                             elevator?

                   He reacts to them. Saavik exits demurely.

 SAAVIK                              Thank you, sir.

                   Bones enters and the doors close. Kirk studies the
                   ceiling.

 BONES                              Has she changed her hairstyle?

                   Kirk says nothing.

 KIRK                              In my quarters, Uhura.

 UHURA'S VOICE                              Yes, sir.

                   Awkward silence.

 BONES                              It never rains but when it pours --

 KIRK                              As a physician you of all people
                             should appreciate the danger of
                             re-opening old wounds.

                   The elevator stops. Kirk leaves. The doors close.

                   Featuring VIEW SCREEN: A scramble of interference and
                   noise. A piece of Carol's VOICE breaks through now
                   and again as we PULL BACK revealing a frustrated Kirk.

 KIRK                              Uhura. Can't you augment?

 UHURA                              I'm trying, sir. Stand by...

                   Carol's face appears. The image will never be stable
                   for long; sometimes the sound will be covered.

 CAROL                              Jim... read me? Can you read me?

 KIRK                              Message breaking up, Carol. What's
                             wrong? What's wrong?

 CAROL                              ... Can't read you... repeat...

 KIRK                              Repeat... what's wrong? What's
                             wrong?

 CAROL                              ... taking Genesis away from us...

 KIRK                              Taking Genesis? Who? Who is taking
                             Genesis?

 CAROL                              ... see you but can't hear. Did
                             you... order...?

 KIRK                              What order? Who's taking Genesis?

 CAROL                              ... Please help us, Jim... won't
                             let them have... without proper...

 CAROL                              Jim please --

                   But the picture is irrevocably scrambled now. Kirk
                   pounds the Comm in frustration.

 KIRK                              Uhura! What's happening? Damn
                             it...

 UHURA'S VOICE                              Transmission jammed at the source,
                             sir.

 KIRK                              Damn. Alert Starfleet Headquarters.

                   The activity is normal. The Turbo-Lift opens and Kirk
                   strides in. Bones and Saavik react to the following:

 KIRK                              Stop engines.

 SULU                              Stop engines.

                   They look wonderingly. Kirk takes a breath --

 KIRK                              An emergency situation has arisen.
                             By order of Starfleet Command, as

 KIRK                              Mr. Sulu, go to Warp 5.

                   Sulu does, and with a great thrust of energy --

                   The ship accelerates, and then, with an eye-filled
                   burst, whips ahead to warp speed, disappearing.

 57A INT. SPOCK'S QUARTERS 57A 
                   Spock is at meditation as Kirk enters quietly. Spock
                   looks up.

 KIRK                              We've got a problem.

                   Spock raises an eyebrow --

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Something may be wrong at Regula
                             I. We've been ordered to investigate.

 SPOCK                              Regula I is a scientific research
                             laboratory, if memory serves...

 KIRK                              I told Starfleet all we had was a
                             boatload of children but we're the
                             only ship in the quadrant. Spock:
                             those cadets of yours -- how good
                             are they? How will they respond
                             under real pressure?

 SPOCK                              Like all living beings, Admiral
                             each according to his gifts. The
                             ship is yours.

 KIRK                              That won't be necessary: just take
                             me to Regula I.

 SPOCK                              Excuse my presumption, but I do not
                             agree. As a teacher on a training
                             mission, I am content to command a
                             Starship. If we are to go on actual
                             duty, it is clear that the senior
                             officer aboard must assume command.

 KIRK                              But it may be nothing; garbled
                             communications. Why don't you...

 SPOCK                              You proceed from a false assumption.
                             I am a Vulcan. I have no ego to bruise.

                   Kirk smiles in bemused wonderment.

 KIRK                              You are going to remind me that
                             logic alone dictates your actions.

 SPOCK                              I was going to remind you of nothing,
                             least of all that which you know well.
                                     (pause)
                             Your mistake, if I may be so bold,
                             was promotion. Commanding a Starship
                             is your first best destiny. Anything
                             else is a waste of material.

 KIRK                              I would not presume to debate you.

 SPOCK                              That is wise. In any case, were I
                             to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates
                             that the needs of the many outweigh
                             the needs of the few.

 KIRK                              Or the one.

                   Spock inclines his head.

 SPOCK                              You are my superior officer. You
                             are also my friend. I have been
                             and always shall be yours.

                   Kirk is moved. He starts to speak, can't -- finally:

 KIRK                              Will you accompany me to the bridge?

 SPOCK                              I'd best talk with Mr. Scott, first
                             so that he may, in his own words,
                             explain the situation to his cadets.

                   Kirk's face tells us the wisdom of Spock's choice.

                             Space Lab Regula I. Come in, please.
                             Dr. Marcus. Please respond, please
                             -- it's no use; no response from
                             Regula I.

 SPOCK                              But no longer jammed?

 UHURA                              No, sir. No nothing.

                   Spock considers, moves to Kirk.

 SPOCK                              There are two possibilities, sir
                             they are unwilling to respond, they
                             are unable to respond.

 KIRK                              How far?

 SPOCK                              Twelve hours and forty-three
                             minutes, present speed.

 KIRK                              Give up Genesis, she said. What in
                             God's name does that mean? Give it
                             up to whom?

 SPOCK                              It might help my analysis if I knew
                             what Genesis was.

                   Kirk looks at him, nods; rising now.

 KIRK                              Uhura, ask Dr. McCoy to join us in
                             my quarters. Mr. Saavik, take the

                             reorganized and electrified --
                             with life introduced results.
                             Instead of a dead moon, a living
                             breathing planet, capable of sus-
                             taining whatever life forms we
                             see fit to deposit on it... The

                             the merest fraction of the Genesis
                             potential, should the Federation
                             wish to pursue these experiments to
                             their logical conclusion.

 67A BACK TO CAROL IN LAB 67A 
 CAROL                              When we consider the problems of
                             population and food supply, the
                             usefulness of this process begins
                             to become clear.
                             This concludes this demonstration
                             tape. Thank you for your attention.
                             The Genesis team eagerly awaits the
                             decision of the Federation regarding
                             the next phase of our work.

                   The tape becomes snowy and blinks off.

                   Kirk looks at Bones and Spock -- they are stunned.

 SPOCK                              It literally is Genesis...

 KIRK                              The power of creation --

 SPOCK                              Have they proceeded with their
                             experiments?

 KIRK                              The tape was made a year ago. I
                             can only assume they've reached
                             Phase Two by now --

 BONES                              But dear Lord, are we intelligent
                             enough to -- Suppose, this
                             thing were used where life already
                             exists?

 SPOCK                              It would destroy such life in favor
                             of its new matrix --

 BONES                              It's new -- have you any idea what
                             you're saying?

 SPOCK                              I was not attempting to evaluate
                             its moral implications, Doctor.
                             As a matter of cosmic history, it
                             has always been easier to destroy
                             than to create --

 BONES                              Not anymore! Now you can do both
                             at the same time! According to myth,
                             the earth was created in six days.
                             Watch out: here comes Genesis;
                             we'll do it for you in six minutes --

 SPOCK                              I don't dispute that in the wrong
                             hands --

 BONES                              Would you like to tell me whose
                             are the right hands, my cold-blooded
                             friend? Are you in favor of these
                             experiments?

 KIRK                              Gentlemen, this isn't --

 SPOCK                              Really, Dr. McCoy; you cannot ban
                             the acquisition of knowledge
                             because you distrust the moral
                             implications of what you learn.
                             Logic suggests --

 BONES                              Logic?? We're talking about
                             universal Armageddon, you inhuman
                             bloodless...

                             Admiral, sensors indicate a vessel
                             in our area, closing fast.

 KIRK                              What do you make of her?

 SAAVIK'S VOICE                              It's one of ours, Admiral... It's
                             Reliant.

 SPOCK                              What's she doing here?

 KIRK                              Chekov's on Reliant, isn't he?

 68 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 68 
                   The whoosh of the turbo doors and Kirk, Bones and
                   Spock assume their posts. Saavik stands next to Kirk's
                   chair.

 UHURA                              She's not responding...

 KIRK                              Try the emergency channels...

 UHURA                              Enterprise to Reliant. Come in,
                             Reliant.

 UHURA                              Yes, sir.

 KIRK                              Is it possible their COMM system
                             has failed -- ?

 SPOCK                              It would explain a great many things --

 KHAN                              Let them eat static.

 JOACHIM                              They're still running with shields down.

 KHAN                              Of course. We're one big happy fleet.
                             Ah, Kirk, my old friend, do you know
                             the Klingon proverb that tells us
                             revenge is a dish that is best

                   Visual of Reliant appears.

 SAAVIK                              Sir, may I quote General Order 12:
                             'On the approach of any vessel, when

 SAAVIK                              Aye, sir.

 UHURA                              I'm getting a voice message... wait

                   He steps to his station.

                   Khan is half out of his seat, sweating with anticipation.

 KHAN                              Careful: Not all at once. The

 77 INT. ENTERPRISE ENGINE ROOM 77 
                   An explosion rips through the facility, sending yellow-

                   And he puts his own respirator on, as do some of the

 KIRK                              Who the hell are they?

 UHURA                              Admiral... Commander Reliant is
                             signaling.
                                     (a pause)
                             He wishes to discuss terms of our
                             surrender.

                   There is a moment. Kirk looks around the battered
                   bridge, and his eyes meet Spock's, and Saavik's.

 KIRK                              On screen.

 UHURA                                      (hesitating)
                             Admiral --

 KIRK                              Do it, while we have time.

                   All eyes go to the SCREEN. After momentary visual
                   confusion, Khan's face appears, smiling --

 KIRK                                      (continuing; dumbfounded)
                             Khan!

 SAAVIK                              Who?

 KHAN                              You still remember, Admiral. I
                             cannot help but be touched. Of
                             course, I remember you.

 KIRK                              What is the meaning of this attack?
                             Where is the crew of the Reliant?

 KHAN                              Surely I have made my meaning plain.
                             I mean to avenge myself upon you,
                             Admiral. I've deprived your ship of
                             power and when I swing round I mean
                             to deprive you of your life --

 88 EXT. SPACE 88 
                   We can see Reliant making a large arc as she prepares to
                   come back for another round.

 KHAN                                      (on screen)
                             -- But I wanted you to know first
                             who it was who had beaten you: I,
                             Khan Noonian Singh, the eagle you
                             attempted to cage forever.

 KIRK                              Khan, listen to me -- if its me you
                             want, I'll have myself beamed aboard.
                             All I ask is that you spare my crew.

 KHAN                              That is a most intriguing offer.
                             Typical, I must say of your sterling
                             character. Let me think.

 KHAN                                      (on screen)
                             I make you a counter-proposal, I will
                             agree to your terms, if in addition
                             to yourself, you turn over to me all
                             data and material regarding the
                             project called Genesis.

                   Reactions from Spock and Kirk.

 KIRK                              Genesis, what's that?

 KHAN                              Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is
                             on the phaser control --

 KIRK                              Give me some time to recall the data
                             on our computers --

 KHAN                              I give you sixty seconds, Admiral.

                   Kirk turns from the screen --

 SPOCK                              Admiral, you can't give him Genesis...

 KIRK                              At least we know he hasn't got it.
                             Just keep nodding as though I'm
                             giving orders. Saavik, punch up the
                             data charts of Reliant's command
                             console -- hurry...

 SAAVIK                              Reliant's command...

 KIRK HURRY. 
 SPOCK                              The prefix code?

 KIRK                              It's all we've got.

 SAAVIK                              On screen...

 KIRK                                      (to Khan)
                             We're finding it.
                                     (urging)
                             Please, please -- you've got to
                             give us time -- the bridge is
                             smashed, computers inoperative...

 KHAN                              Time is a luxury you do not have,
                             Admiral: forty-five seconds...

 92 EXT. SPACE 92 
                   Reliant, her arc completed, is coming back.

 93 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 93 
 SAAVIK                              I don't understand --

                   Kirk puts on his spectacles --

 KIRK                              You've got to learn WHY things
                             work on a Starship.
                                     (to Khan)
                             It's coming through now, Khan...

 SPOCK                                      (descends)
                             The prefix code is 16309. All
                             commands from each Starship bridge
                             are relayed electronically; each
                             ship has its own prefix combination
                             code...

 KHAN                              Thirty seconds...

 KIRK                              ... to prevent an enemy from doing
                             just what we're attempting; using
                             our console to tap in a message,
                             an order to lower Reliant's damn
                             shields...

 SPOCK                                      (at the weapons console)
                             Let's hope he hasn't changed the
                             combination. He's quite intelligent...

 KIRK                                      (grim)
                             Wait for my signal, Spock -- too
                             soon and he'll have time to figure
                             it out and raise them again.

                   Spock nods; Kirk turns to the screen --

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Khan, how do I know you'll keep
                             your word?

 KHAN                                      (on screen)
                             I've given you no word to keep,
                             Admiral. In my judgment, you simply
                             have no alternative.

 KIRK                              I take your point. Stand by to
                             receive our transmission.

                   He turns from the screen again, softly:

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Mr. Sulu, lock phasers on target
                             and await my command...

 SULU                                      (quietly)
                             Phasers locked...

                   They're all sweating.

 KHAN                              Time's up, Admiral...

 KIRK                                      (dry)
                             Here it comes. Now, Spock.

 KHAN                              Raise them --

 KHAN                              Where's the over-ride??

                   All monitors are haywire now that Enterprise is tapped

                   A shambles -- debris flying; Khan knocked to the deck.
                   He struggles to his feet through wiring --

 KHAN                                      (enraged)
                             At them! At them! FIRE! FIRE!
                             Why can't you?

 JOACHIM                              We can't fire, sir; they've damaged
                             the photon controls and the warp
                             drive. We must withdraw!

 KHAN                              No!

 JOACHIM                              Sir, we must!
                                     (desperate urging)
                             We must repair the damage. Enterprise
                             will wait; she's not going anywhere.

                   Khan calms as the other holds him; he breathes deeper.

                             Sir, you did it.

 KIRK                                      (enraged)
                             I did nothing -- except get caught
                             with my britches down. I must be
                             senile. Mr. Saavik, you just keep
                             right on quoting regulations.
                             Meantime, let's find out what the

                             we've been --

                   The turbo doors whoosh open as Kirk reaches them.
                   Scotty stands there, tears streaming down his face;
                   he holds the body of Midshipman Preston. Both of them
                   are covered in blood. He sways into Kirk's arms as

                   then yanks off his respirator; wipes his brow.

 106 INT. SICK BAY 106 
                   MANY CASUALTIES IN EVIDENCE. Kirk enters and LEADS
                   CAMERA THROUGH them; he has a word or two for men he
                   doesn't know by name. Kirk leads us to the operating
                   theatre, where Bones works over Preston. Scotty stands
                   by, his lips trembling. Preston opens his eyes, sees
                   Scotty and Kirk.

 PRESTON                                      (faint)
                             Is the word given?

 KIRK                                      (soft)
                             The word is given: warp speed.

 PRESTON                                      (almost smiles)
                             Aye...

                   He dies. Pause. Scotty looks across the body at Kirk.

 SCOTTY WHY? 
 KIRK                                      (looks at Preston)
                             He wants to kill me for passing
                             sentence on him 14 years ago -- and
                             he doesn't care who stands between
                             him and his vengeance.

 BONES                              Scotty, I'm sorry...

 SCOTTY                              He stayed at his post. When the
                             trainees ran, he stayed.

 KIRK                              If he hadn't, we'd be space by now.

 SPOCK'S VOICE                              Admiral, this is Spock.

 KIRK                              Yes, Spock.

                             the line?

 SCOTTY                              I dinna think so, sir, but you'll
                             have my best --

                   With an effort, he gets to his feet --

 SCOTTY                                      (continuing)
                             Thanks -- I know you tried, Doctor...

                   Squeezes his shoulder and limps off -- We NOW HEAR
                   the sound of impulse power taking effect.

 KIRK                              Are you all right?

                   Bones shrugs unhappily, looks at Preston.

 BONES                              Doctors lose patients sometimes.
                             Damn. I'm still in the dark: How'd
                             he know about Genesis?

 KIRK                              At the moment that question takes
                             a back seat to preventing him from
                             laying his hands on it. You said it
                             yourself; we're talking about a bang
                             that would re-arrange the universe...

 BONES                              There may still be time... you gave
                             as good as you got.

 KIRK                                      (looks him in the eye)
                             I got beat. We're only alive because
                             I knew something about these ships
                             that he didn't.

                   He turns and leaves as Bones watches, looks again at
                   Preston.

                   Regula, the dead planet beyond.

 108 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE 108 
                   Approaching. As she moves slowly PAST CAMERA, WE PAN
                   WITH her TO SEE that she is approaching the space lab.

 109 INT. BRIDGE - ENTERPRISE 109 
                   Battle damage, some repaired, some not. The bridge is
                   filled with tension, all hands at station.

 SULU (V.O.)                              Approaching Regula and Space Lab
                             Regula I.

 KIRK                              Try again.

 UHURA                              Space Station Regular I, this is
                             Starship Enterprise. Come in, please...

 110 INT. SPACE STATION REGULAR I - CAROL'S LAB - ON SCREEN 110 
                   As before, Uhura's image, imploring a response.

 UHURA                              I say again. Space Station Regular.
                             This is Starship Enterprise. Please
                             respond. Please respond.

                   During this, CAMERA HAS PANNED CLOSE AMONG the techni-
                   cal clutter. Then suddenly. SOUND -- eerie, frightening.
                   Our ears cannot place it... and before we can, it is gone
                   a warning.

 111 BACK TO BRIDGE 111 
 UHURA                              ... No response, sir.

 KIRK                              Sensors, Captain?

 SPOCK                              Scanners and sensors still inoperative.
                             There's no way to tell what's  inside
                             the station.

 KIRK                              And no way of knowing if Reliant
                             is still in the area...

 SPOCK                              Affirmative, Admiral.

 KIRK                                      (with irony)
                             ... Blind as a Tiberian Bat.
                             What do you make of the plantoid
                             beyond?

 SPOCK                              Regula is class "D'. It consists of
                             various remarkable ores. Essentially,
                             a great rock in space.

 KIRK                              Reliant could be hiding behind that rock.

 SPOCK                              A distinct possibility.

 KIRK                              Engine room... Scotty, do we have
                             enough power for the transporters?

 SCOTTY'S VOICE                              Just barely, sir.

 KIRK                                      (the decision)
                             I'm going down to the station.

                   He starts out. Bones stops him.

 BONES                              Khan could be down there!

 KIRK                              He's BEEN there and hasn't found
                             what he wants. Can you spare
                             someone? There may be people
                             hurt.

 BONES                              I can spare me...

 SAAVIK                              Begging the Admiral's pardon:
                             General Order 15: 'No  flag officer
                             shall beam into a hazardous area
                             without armed escort.'

 KIRK                              There is no such regulation.

                   Saavik's gaze falters --

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             All right, join the party.
                             Mr. Spock, the ship is yours.

 SPOCK                              Aye sir --

 KIRK                              Establish a parking orbit around
                             the station and send me a complete
                             damage report when you've talked
                             with Mr. Scott.

 SPOCK                              Be careful, Jim...

                   Kirk, Bones and Saavik head for the turbo doors.

 112 EXT. SPACE - SPACE STATION REGULAR I 112 
                   CLOSER ANGLE now. The silence is ominous.

 113 INT. SPACE STATION REGULAR I - CAROL'S LAB 113 
                   empty, except for the hums and crackles of abandoned
                   equipment. With a FAMILIAR SOUND, BONES, KIRK and
                   SAAVIK MATERIALIZE. All have phasers, communicators
                   and tricorders.

                   For a moment they look around, seeing emptiness. Like
                   being in a haunted house.

 KIRK                              Hello...! Anybody here?

                   A WEIRD ECHO reverberates his cries.

 SAAVIK                                      (raises tricorder)
                             Indeterminate life signs.

 KIRK                              Phasers on stun. Move out.

                   They separate. Each begins to search.

 114 ANGLE WITH SAAVIK 114 
                   She moves to the electronic and data area, examines the
                   consoles, the equipment, then settles for the data bank.
                   She starts keying sequences with the computer.

 115 INT. SPACE STATION - BONES 115 
                   He shows signs of fear as he walks through the deserted
                   place, like a scuba diver exploring a cave. We want
                   him to go back.

                   A NOISE. Bones reacts with brave apprehension.

                   Rounding a corner, he starts: A RAT scuttles right in
                   front of him.

                   Bones sighs with relief and moves forward. We think
                   he's safe.

                   SUDDENLY SOMETHING FALLS RIGHT ON HIS FACE: an upside
                   down human ARM.

 116 SAME LOCALE - LATER 116 
                   Kirk helps Bones cut down the last of the five BODIES
                   from where they were hanged, upside down.

                   Having recovered his composure, Bones examines the
                   corpses. We RECOGNIZE Madison, March, among others.

                   One is clearly the COOK.

 KIRK                                      (stunned)
                             They even killed the galley chief.

 BONES                              This one looks like a Steward.
                             They're not warm, but rigor hasn't
                             set in. This didn't happen all that
                             long ago, Jim.

                   Kirk looks around, despairingly --

 KIRK                              Carol...

 117 INT. SPACE LAB DATA BANK 117 
                   WITH SAAVIK working with console. Something puzzles
                   her. She frowns, but a NEW SOUND distracts her. She
                   looks up and moves off.

 118 FULL SHOT - IN THE LAB 118 
                   A moan is heard. All three now converge on the area.
                   As they near it, Saavik's tricorder hums furiously. Be
                   this a room, a locker of some other place, this time
                   they -- "open the door." The limp bodies of Chekov and
                   Terrell fall out.

 UHURA'S VOICE                                      (on screen)
                             Admiral Kirk, Enterprise. Come in,
                             please. Come in please.

                   She will continue sporadically.

 KIRK                              My God!

                   Chekov emits a live, reassuring moan.

 BONES                              That's Clark Terrell, Jim, I've
                             served with him.

                   Bones is passing his medical tricorder over Chekov.

 BONES                                      (continuing)
                             Brain disturbance. Appears to be
                             drug induced.

                   He reaches into his kit. He shoots Chekov moves off
                   to Terrell. Uhura, voice continues in the b.g.

 KIRK                              Saavik, for God's sake, tell her
                             we're all right.

 119 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE - FAVORING UHURA 119 
 UHURA                              I say again. This is Enterprise.
                             Please acknowledge signal. Please --

                   Saavik's face appears on her screen.

 SAAVIK                                      (on screen, hurried)
                             Commander Uhura, this is Lt. Saavik.
                             We're all right. Please stand by.
                             Out.

 UHURA                                      (baffled)
                             Aye, aye.

 120 INT. SPACE STATION - TIGHT GROUP 120 
                   Chekov opens his eyes, and stares into Kirk's.

 CHEKOV                              Oh, God, Admiral...!

                   He weeps like a child, and Kirk holds him. Meanwhile,
                   Terrell opens his eyes and stares at Bones.

 BONES                              It's Dr. McCoy, Captain. Do you
                             remember me?

 TERRELL                              McCoy? Yes. Oh, yes.

 121 ANGLE FAVORING CHEKOV AND KIRK 121 
                   Chekov breaks the embrace in high relief and anxiety.

 CHEKOV                              Oh, sir. It was Khan! We found him
                             on Ceti Alpha V.

 KIRK                              Easy, Pavel... Tell me what you
                             can...

 CHEKOV                              No life signs -- but he was there.
                             Captured us. He -- he put creatures
                             in our bodies. To control our minds.

                   Bones takes over Chekov --

 BONES                              It's all right, you're safe...

 CHEKOV                              ... Made us say -- lies... Do...
                             things... But we beat him... The
                             Captain and me. -- He thought he
                             controlled us, but he didn't ...
                             The Captain was strong.

                   Chekov breaks into tears. Kirk looks at Terrell, who is
                   more composed.

 KIRK                              Captain. Where is Dr. Marcus?
                             Where are the Genesis materials?

 TERRELL                              He couldn't find them. Some of
                             the scientists were still here,
                             but everything else, even the data
                             banks -- were empty.

 SAAVIK                              That's true, Admiral. All the
                             memory cells have been emptied.

 KIRK                                      (ponders)
                             Erased...

 TERRELL                              He tortured those people. None of
                             them would tell him anything. He
                             went wild, strung them up and slit
                             their throats. He wanted to tear
                             the place apart, but he was late:
                             he had to get back to Reliant in
                             time to blow you to bits.

 KIRK                              He came damn close...

 CHEKOV                              He left us.
                                     (with irony)
                             We were no longer of use.
 SAAVIK                              Where is  the Reliant crew? Dead?

 TERRELL                              Marooned on Ceti Alpha V. He's
                             completely mad, Admiral. He blames
                             you for the death of his wife...

 KIRK                              I know what he blames me for.
                                     (thinks)
                             The escape pods are all in place.
                                     (looks around)
                             Where's the transporter room?

 122 INT. SPACE STATION TRANSPORTER ROOM 122 
                   Kirk, wearing his spectacles, studies the transporter
                   consoles. ANGLE WIDENS TO REVEAL the transporter pods,
                   and the others, b.g.

 KIRK                              Did he make it down here?

                   Chekov and Terrell look at each other; they seem a bit
                   stronger.

 CHEKOV                              It was not my impression. He spent
                             most of his time trying to wring the
                             information out of the people.

                   Saavik approaches Kirk:

 SAAVIK                              Anything?

                   Kirk looks at her over the rims of the glasses:

 KIRK                              Somebody left the unit on. If
                             everyone else was dead, it implies
                             that no one remained to turn it off.
                             Those people back there bought escape
                             time for Genesis with their lives.

                   Saavik studies the console.

 SAAVIK                              It doesn't make sense. These
                             coordinates are well within
                             Regula -- a plantoid we know to be
                             lifeless and airless.

 KIRK                                      (wheels turn)
                             If Stage Two was completed, it was
                             underground -- she said it was going
                             to be underground.

 SAAVIK                              Stage Two of what?

                   Kirk gets it.

 KIRK                                      (on communicator)
                             Kirk to Enterprise. Damage report,
                             Spock?

 SPOCK'S VOICE                              Admiral, if we go by the book, like
                             Lieutenant Saavik, hours could seem
                             like days.

 KIRK                                      (beat)
                             I read you, Captain. Let's have it.

                   Fractional pause.

 SPOCK'S VOICE                              The situation is grave, Admiral. We
                             won't have main power for six days
                             at least. Auxiliary power has
                             temporarily failed, but maybe we can
                             restore that in two days. By the
                             book, Admiral.

                   Kirk frowns.

 KIRK                              Meaning you can't even beam us back?

 SPOCK'S VOICE                              Not at present.

                   Kirk looks at Saavik and Bones, decides --

 KIRK                              Captain Spock, if you do not hear
                             from us within one hour your orders
                             are to restore what power you can,
                             take the Enterprise to the nearest
                             Star Base and alert Starfleet
                             command when you are out of jamming
                             range.

 UHURA'S VOICE                              Sir -- we won't leave you behind...!

 KIRK                              Uhura, if you don't hear from us,
                             there won't be anybody behind. Kirk
                             out.
                                     (to Terrell and Chekov)
                             You gentleman can remain here, or...

 TERRELL                              If it's all the same, Admiral, we'd
                             like to share the risk.

 KIRK                                      (hesitates)
                             Very well. Let's go.

 BONES                              Go? Where are we going?

 KIRK                                      (points to console)
                             Where they went. Saavik.

                   Kirk walks onto the pods as Saavik works the console,
                   rolling in electronic coding. The others join Kirk.

 BONES                              But what if they went -- nowhere?

 KIRK                              Then this will be your big chance
                             to get away from it all.

 SAAVIK                              Ready.

                   She presses a button, joins them on the pods. Slowly
                   they VANISH.

 123 EXT. SPACE - THE PLANTOID REGULA 123 
                   CAMERA MOVES TOWARD it as the BEAM SOUND continues,
                   with irregularity. The plantoid is ugly and dead.
                   The sound frightens us, and climaxes with:

 124 INT. ROCKY CAVERN - REGULA 124 
                   The BEAM SOUND screeches, then settles into its comfort-
                   able mode as the FIVE FIGURES FLUCTUATE, FADE, then
                   APPEAR. They look around in wonder and relief.

 SAAVIK                              Admiral --

                   She indicates something O.S. They cross as CAMERA
                   reveals a cave wall stacked with technical materials
                   and crowned by a LARGE PROJECTILE, a giant version
                   of the model we saw earlier. They stare. (N.B. FEATURE
 GENESIS ARMING CONTROL BOX.) 
 BONES                              Genesis, I presume.

                   They walk by a group of crates. It all happens very
                   fast: David leaps out and tackles Kirk, throwing him to
                   the ground and landing atop him, a knife at his throat.

                   At the same time, Bones and Saavik reach for their
                   phasers, but Jedda, already armed, steps out. He has
                   them covered and helpless.

 125 ANGLE FAVORING DAVID 125 
 DAVID                              You're the sonavabitch who
                             committed mass murder up there.

                   He raises the knife --

 KIRK                              I'm Admiral Kirk...

 DAVID                              We were still there, you dumb
                             bastard! We could hear the screams
                             all the way to the transporter room --

                   Again he raises the knife --

 KIRK                              Where's Dr. Marcus --

 DAVID                              I'm Doctor Marcus!

                   Carol reaches the tunnel entrance to the cave --

 CAROL                              David --

 DAVID                              Mother, go back!

                   Carol sees Kirk --

 CAROL                              Jim --

 DAVID                              Go back. I'm going to kill him.

 CAROL                                      (takes a breath)
                             You do that and you'll have murdered
                             your father.

                   All react. David and Kirk, facing each other, are
                   turned to stone. Bones, Jedda and Chekov turn to look
                   at Carol, wondering. Terrell very casually takes the
                   phaser from Jedda.

 126 NEW ANGLE (FORMERLY SCENE 134) 126 
 TERRELL                                      (cool)
                             I'll hold onto this.

                   But Kirk and Carol ignore them and walk towards each
                   other. There are tears in Carol's eyes. She reaches
                   up, trying to smile and touches his hair --

 CAROL                              You've got a little grey --

                   She can't. Kirk takes her and holds her tightly, look-
                   ing at David, over her shoulder. He stands there,
                   stunned, looking back.

 KIRK                              Carol. Is that true?

                   She nods --

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Why didn't you tell me?

 DAVID                              She's making it up! My father was
                             Professor --

 CAROL                              David, you're just making this
                             harder --

 TERRELL                              I'm afraid it's even harder than you
                             think, Doctor.

                   He and Chekov have their phasers trained on them.

 TERRELL                                      (continuing)
                             Please don't move --

 KIRK                              Chekov -- !

 CHEKOV                              I'm sorry, Admiral.

                   Terrell speaks into his wrist recorder.

 TERRELL                              Your excellency, have you been
                             listening?

 KHAN'S VOICE                                      (filtered)
                             I have indeed, Captain. You have
                             done well...

 DAVID                              I knew it -- !

                   David makes a reckless break for Terrell; Saavik
                   instantly throws herself on him bringing him down as
                   Terrell fires, hitting Jedda, who was behind David --
                   a killing ray. Jedda dematerializes. Carol SCREAMS
                   and David reacts with horror and guilt.

                   Most importantly, Chekov begins to tremble. Terrell
                   himself is shaken by his reflexive action. He's in
                   semi-panic.

 TERRELL                              Don't move -- any of you!

 136 INT. RELIANT BRIDGE - FAVORING KHAN 136 
                   Joachim over his shoulder. Others in evidence. Khan
                   speaks into his console.

 KHAN                              Captain... We're waiting. What's
                             the delay?

 137 INT. ROCKY CAVERN (INTERCUT AS DESIRED) 137 
 TERRELL                              All is well, sir. You have the
                             coordinates to beam up Genesis...

 KHAN                              First things first, Captain. Kill
                             Admiral Kirk.

                   Reactions by all -- only Kirk and Bones are unsurprised.
                   David and Saavik, dazed, fight the urge to do something.
                   Chekov is close to a seizure. Terrell fights conflicting
                   mental signals.

 TERRELL                              Excellency... it is difficult.
                             I try to obey, but --

 KHAN'S VOICE                              Kill him.

                   As though tearing off a leach, Terrell grabs at the
                   wrist recorder and flings it to the ground. A shock-
                   wave of pain hits Terrell. He recovers, trembling and
                   tries to obey. Chekov is shaking badly. Terrell aims
                   his phaser at Kirk. Chekov slowly raises his phaser
                   and aims at Terrell, though his hands are like lead.
                   We THINK Chekov is going to do the right thing. Then,
                   shockingly: Terrell turns his phaser on himself.

 KHAN'S VOICE                                      (still emanates from
                                      wrist recorder)
                             Kill him, Terrell. Now.

                   Terrell does, blowing himself into oblivion.

 138 ANGLE - FAVORING CHEKOV 138 
                   He SCREAMS, horribly, drops his phaser, clutching his
                   head.

                   Bones leaps to his side, pulls an injection device from
                   his belt pack, jabs it into Chekov's arm. Chekov,
                   almost with a sigh of relief, drops.

 KHAN'S VOICE                              Terrell? Chekov -- !

 BONES                              Jim -- for God's sake!

                   They rush to his side, as do Carol and David.

 139 ANGLE - FAVORING CHEKOV 139 
                   From the fallen man's ear, something begins to emerge.

 140 VERY CLOSE - CHEKOV'S EAR 140 
                   The Ceti eel crawls out. It has grown quite large.

 141 SCENE 141 
                   Horror from all. Kirk picks up a phaser. As the eel
                   clears Chekov, he fires and destroys it. He shudders,
                   then sees the wrist recorder and grabs it.

 KIRK                              Khan, you bloodsucker, they're
                             finished! You'll have to do your
                             own dirty work now. Do you hear me?
                             Do you?

 142 INT. RELIANT BRIDGE 142 
                   Khan reacts to Kirk's VOICE: electronic shock. He
                   clutches the communicator, his eye-whites rolling.

 KHAN                              Kirk! Kirk, you are still alive --
                             my old friend...

 INTERCUT AS DESIRED WITH 
 143 ROCKY CAVERN - FAVORING KIRK 143 
 KIRK                              Still, 'old friend.' You've
                             managed to kill just about everyone
                             else, but like a poor marksman, you
                             keep missing the target.

 KHAN                                      (ironic)
                             Perhaps I no longer need to try.

                   He punches several buttons.

                   In the Rocky Cavern the transporter beam locks on to the
                   Genesis torpedo and its arming control box.

                   As Kirk and the others watch, horrified, Khan beams up
                   the materials. David tries to reach the torpedo, but
                   Saavik holds him fast --

 DAVID                              Let go -- he can't -- !

 SAAVIK                              Only half of you would get there.

                   The beam disappears and Genesis with it, leaving them
                   alone.

 KIRK                                      (desperate)
                             Khan, you have Genesis, but you
                             don't have me! You were going to
                             kill me, Khan, it was your sole
                             purpose. You'll have to come down
                             here to do it! You'll have to
                             come down!

 KHAN'S VOICE                              I've done far worse than kill you,
                             Admiral. I've hurt you. And I
                             wish to go on hurting you. I
                             shall leave you, as you left me --
                             where no one will ever find you:
                             poetic justice; marooned for
                             eternity in the center of a dead
                             planet -- buried alive.

 KHAN                              Goodbye, Admiral. Oh, and don't
                             count on Enterprise. She can't
                             move. My next act will be to blow
                             her out of the heavens.

                   As before, Saavik is on the communicator.

 SAAVIK                              This is Lt. Saavik, calling Enterprise...

                   She keeps trying. Chekov stirs --

 BONES                              He's alive!

                   Bones goes and tends Chekov who moans, tries to sit up.

 KIRK                              Pavel?

                   Chekov tries to smile; Kirk takes his hand --

 SAAVIK                              No use, Admiral, they're still
                             jamming all channels.

 BONES                                      (looks across Chekov)
                             It wouldn't make any difference.
                             If Enterprise obeyed orders she's
                             long since gone. And if she couldn't
                             obey, she's finished.

 DAVID                              So are we, it looks like.

 CAROL                              I don't understand.
                             Who's responsible for all this?
                             Who is Khan?

 KIRK                              It's a long story.

 DAVID                              We appear to have plenty of time.

 BONES                                      (dry)
                             You and your father can catch up on
                             things.

 DAVID                                      (bitter)
                             My father. I hope you realize
                             another man has just been killed
                             because of...

 BONES                              Because of you, son. You shouldn't
                             have tried to rush someone holding
                             a primed phaser. Anyway it isn't
                             one man dead, it's two, in case
                             you've lost count.

                   David has been effectively spiked. Long silence.

 KIRK                              Do you have anything to eat? I
                             don't know about anyone else, but
                             I'm starved.

 BONES                              How can you think of food at a time
                             like this?

 KIRK                              Our first order of business is survival.

 CAROL                              There's food in the Genesis cave,
                             enough to last a lifetime -- should
                             that be necessary.

 BONES                              We thought this was Genesis.

                   Carol laughs -- there's an edge of hysteria to it.

 CAROL                              This? It took the Starfleet corps
                             of engineers ten months in space
                             suits to tunnel out all this. What
                             we did in there -- we did in a day.
                             David, why don't you show Dr. McCoy
                             and the Lieutenant our idea of food.

 DAVID                              But we can't just sit here -- !

 KIRK                                      (unruffled)
                             Oh, yes we can. Is there really
                             something to eat?

                   David looks at his father, who checks his watch, putting
                   on his spectacles.

 CAROL                              David. Please.

 DAVID                                      (to Kirk)
                             This is just to give us something
                             to do, isn't it?
                                     (he shrugs)
                             Come on.

                   Saavik and Bones make to follow. Saavik turns to Kirk --

 SAAVIK                              Admiral?

 KIRK                              As your teacher Mr. Spock is fond
                             of saying: I like to think there
                             always are possibilities.

                   Carol sits on the ground, Chekov's head in her lap,
                   looking at Kirk.

 CAROL                              David was right, wasn't he? It's
                             just to keep them busy.

 KIRK                              Why? Why didn't you tell me?

 CAROL                              How can you ask me that? Were we
                             together? Where we going to be?
                             You had your world and I had mine.
                             I wanted him in mine, not chasing
                             through the universe with his father.

                   Kirk turns away, overcome. She watches him.

 CAROL                                      (continuing)
                             He's a lot like you in many ways.
                             Nothing I could do about it. He's
                             smarter, of course; that goes without
                             saying. Most of Genesis is really
                             his.

                   Her joke doesn't take effect. He doesn't turn.

 CAROL                                      (continuing)
                             This is it, isn't it? We're never
                             going to get out of here.

                   Kirk says nothing.

 CAROL                                      (continuing)
                             Please. Tell me what you're feeling.

                   Kirk hesitates, comes back and sits next to Chekov; he
                   changes Bones' compress on the ear as he finally speaks.

 KIRK                              There's a man I haven't seen in
                             fifteen years who thinks he's killed
                             me. You show me a son who'd almost be
                             happy to help him. My son. My life
                             that could have been and wasn't. What
                             am I feeling? I'm feeling old --
                             worn out.

                   Carol studies him; gently she sets Chekov's head down
                   on a sweater, then stands.

 CAROL                              Let me show you something that will
                             make you feel young -- young as when
                             the world was new.

                   She offers her hand. Kirk looks at Chekov, who smiles,
                   faint assurance.

 CAROL                                      (continuing)
                             He'll be all right. Come.

                   After a moment's hesitation, Kirk takes her hand and
                   she leads him to the tunnel.

 150B INT. TUNNEL 150B 
                   TRUCKING BEFORE Carol and Kirk. A rising light falls
                   on their faces as they walk, then run with excitement
                   toward the source. Kirk races ahead...

                   where the rock tunnel ends. Kirk comes out of the

 150E FULL SHOT - THE GENESIS CAVE (MATTE AND FX) (FORMERLY 150E SCENE 130) 
                   A huge cavern. Kirk is actually standing at the middle
                   of it. Space extends vastly above and below his point
                   of view. Like Eden, lush growth everywhere, water-
                   falls, and a cobalt blue sky high, high above where a
                   round orb glows sending light and warmth downward.
                   There is a path from where Kirk stands down to the lower
                   level where Bones, and the others are waiting and calling
                   to him. Mist and haze waft gently across the cavern.

                   who watches him.

 DAVID                              What are you looking at?

 SAAVIK                              The Admiral's son.

 DAVID                              Don't you believe it.

 SAAVIK                              Oh, I believe it.

                   She almost smiles. David returns her stare and it
                   throws her.

 SAAVIK                                      (continuing)

 BONES                              It's like the Garden of Eden...

                   Kirk watches Saavik.

 KIRK                              What's on your mind, Lieutenant?

 SAAVIK                              The Kobayashi Maru, sir.

                             defeat.

 KIRK                              Are you asking me if we are playing
                             out that scenario now, Lieutenant?

 SAAVIK                              On the test, sir, will you tell me
                             what you did? I'd really like to
                             know.

                   Kirk looks at Bones, who smiles --

 BONES                              Lieutenant, you are looking at the

                   He looks at his watch again, using his glasses --

 KIRK                              I reprogrammed the simulation so it

                             test. I received a commendation for
                             original thinking.
                                     (pause)
                             I don't like to lose.

 SAAVIK                              Then -- you never faced that
                             situation -- faced death...

 BONES                              Until now.

 KIRK                              We each face death every day we're
                             alive, Saavik.

                   He picks up the communicator.

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Spock, this is Kirk. It's two hours.
                             Are you about ready?

 SPOCK'S VOICE                              Right on schedule, Admiral. Just
                             give us your coordinates and we'll
                             beam you aboard.

                   The others are on their feet, stunned with amazement --

 KIRK                              Right. I don't like to lose.

                   He clicks off.

                   David gapes at his father.

 160 OMITTED 160 
 161 EXT. SPACE DARK SIDE OF REGULA 161 
                   WE CAN SEE NOW where Enterprise is: she has slipped
                   behind the plantoid, clockwise, even as Reliant was
                   rounding into the lighted side.

 162 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM - ENTERPRISE 162 
                   Kirk, David, Saavik, Carol and Bones, holding the semi-
                   conscious Chekov MATERIALIZE. Spock is there to greet
                   them.

 SAAVIK                              But the damage report -- we were
                             immobilized...

 KIRK                              Come, come, Lieutenant, you of all
                             people go by the book. Hello,
                             Spock. You remember Dr. Marcus...

                   They are moving through the room as they talk --

 SPOCK                              Certainly...

 SAAVIK                                      (overlapping)
                             By the book...

 KIRK                              Regulation 46-A: 'If transmissions
                             are being monitored during battle...'

 SAAVIK                              '... no uncoded messages on an open
                             channel...'

                   Saavik steps in front of Spock.

 SAAVIK                                      (continuing)
                             You lied.

 SPOCK                              I exaggerated.

 KIRK                              Hours instead of days, Saavik; now
                             we have minutes instead of hours --

 BONES                                      (behind)
                             I'm taking this bunch to sick bay.

                   CAMERA STAYS WITH THEM, HOLDS ON DAVID, awed.

 163 INT. CORRIDOR ENTERPRISE 163 
                   Saavik and Kirk follow Spock. They stop at a Turbo
                   Lift --

 SPOCK                              They're inoperative below C-deck.

 164 INT. ANOTHER ENTERPRISE CORRIDOR 164 
                   They race down corridors as they speak -- 

 KIRK                              What IS working around here?

 SPOCK                              Not much, Admiral. We have partial
                             main power...

 KIRK                              That's it?

 SPOCK                              Best we could do in two hours.

 165 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 165 
                   Full crew in place as doors whoosh open --

 SULU                                      (overjoyed)
                             Admiral on the bridge --

 KIRK                              Battle stations.

                   ALARMS, SIRENS, ETC. CREW RUSH INTO PLACE AS Kirk,
                   Spock and Saavik approach the big screen.

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Tactical.

                   We see the Enterprise emerging from the dark side of
                   Gamma Regula, where Reliant is now a moving blip.

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Uh oh.

 SPOCK                              She can out-run us and out-gun us.
                             But there is the Mutara Nebula at
                             153 mark four.

 KIRK                                      (studies his console)
                             Scotty, can we make it inside?

 SCOTTY                              The energizer's bypassed like a
                             Christmas tree -- so don't give me
                             too many bumps.

 KIRK                              No promises, Mr. Scott. On your way.

 SAAVIK                              Trouble with the nebula, sir, is all
                             that static discharge and gas clouds 
                             our tactical display. Visuals won't 
                             function and shields will be useless.

                   Kirk looks over the rims of his glasses at Spock; they
                   smile with faint amusement.

 SPOCK                              What's sauce for the goose, Mr.
                             Saavik. The odds will be even.

 166 VARIOUS CORRIDORS, ENTERPRISE 166 
                   As the lights change, the CREW runs to their stations.

 166A EXT. SPACE 166A 
 ENTERPRISE STARTS MOVING. 
 167 INT. HOSPITAL 167 
                   Carol, David and Bones react to the light change and
                   the sirens -- Bones works on Chekov...

 DAVID                              I'm going up there.

 BONES                              You'll be in the way, Dr. Marcus...
                             best stay here.

                   Carol and David are civilians on a battleship.

 168 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 168 
                   Reacting. Saavik approaches Kirk and Spock.

 SAAVIK                              Admiral... what happens if Reliant
                             fails to follow us into the nebula?

                   Kirk and Spock exchange looks --

 SPOCK                              I think we can guarantee she'll
                             follow us, Mr. Saavik. Remind me
                             to explain to you the concept of
                             human ego.

 KIRK                              Best speed, Scotty...

 169 EXT. SPACE 169 
                   The Enterprise whooshes by CAMERA leaving Regula
                   behind. Reliant now appears in far b.g. and CAMERA
                   BEGINS A MOVE to her.

 170 INT. RELIANT BRIDGE 170 
 KHAN                              There! Full impulse power! Not
                             so wounded as we were led to believe
                             -- so much the better...

 171 EXT. SPACE 171 
                   Reliant moves to and past CAMERA in hot pursuit.

 172 EXT. SPACE - SERIES OF SHOTS 172 
                   Call them SPACE-BYS. Enterprise rushes TOWARD US,
                   flashes BY and CONTINUES towards the swirling nebula.

                   THEN Reliant does the same, closer in pursuit. At
                   this moment, half the distance between Regula and
                   the nebula has been covered.

 173 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 173 
 SPOCK                              Estimating nebula penetration
                             in two minutes. Reliant is
                             closing.

 KIRK                              Steady as you go...

 174 EXT. SPACE 174 
                   Orientation, SHOT. Reliant can clearly see where
                   Enterprise is headed --

 175 INT. RELIANT BRIDGE 175 
 JOACHIM                              We'll lose them if they go in there.

 KHAN                              Rake her.

 176 SOMEONE PUNCHES A BUTTON 176 
 177 EXT. SPACE 177 
                   Reliant's shot crosses Enterprise's bow --

 178 INT. ENTERPRISE HOSPITAL 178 
                   The ship reverberates with the near miss. Chekov wakes
                   up, looks wildly about --

 BONES                              Take it easy --

 CHEKOV                              But I must --

 BONES                              Listen to me, Pavel; you haven't
                             the strength or the equilibrium --

 CHEKOV                              But --

                   As they talk, David, unnoticed, leaves the area. The
                   Enterprise is buffeted again --

 CAROL                              Dr. McCoy, I can't just sit here.
                             Tell me what I can do.

 BONES                                      (grim)
                             You can help get my surgery squared
                             away. I'm expecting customers.

                   She whitens in fear. ANOTHER SHOT reverberates.

 179 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 179 
 SAAVIK                              That was close --

 KIRK                                      (unfazed)
                             They just don't want us going in there.

 SPOCK                              One minute to nebula perimeter.

                   The bridge door slides open and David enters. He
                   stares in wonder. Saavik reacts to David.

 SPOCK                                      (continuing)
                             Admiral, they're reducing speed.

 KIRK                              Uhura, patch me in --

 UHURA                              Aye, sir.

 180 INT. RELIANT BRIDGE 180 
 KHAN                              Why are we slowing?

 JOACHIM                              We daren't follow them into the
                             nebula, sir -- our shields will be
                             useless...

 KIRK'S VOICE                              This is Admiral Kirk.

                   Khan's eyes bulge --

 KIRK'S VOICE                                      (continuing)
                             We tried it once your way, Khan.
                             Are you game for a rematch?

                   Khan's eyes bulge --

 KIRK'S VOICE                                      (continuing)
                             Khan -- ! I'm laughing at the
                             "superior" intellect.

 KHAN                              Full impulse power!

 JOACHIM                              No sir! We have Genesis -- Whatever
                             you want --

 KHAN                              Full power damn you!

                   And he reaches across and executes it himself.

 181 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 181 
                   They react to Reliant's speed-up. The nebula approach
                   is ON SCREEN.

 KIRK                                      (dry)
                             I'll say this for him: he's
                             consistent.

 182 EXT. SPACE - THE MUTARA NEBULA 182 
                   WE'RE VERY CLOSE NOW, and SEE CLEARLY the swirling,
                   slowly moving gases, magenta, purple, etc. There are
                   veils of luminescent materials and through all an
                   interlace of unpredictable electrical charges.

                   Like lightning, these intermittent great flashes
                   illumine whole sections of the nebula. OUR VIEW is
                   moving slowly forward...

 183 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 183

 184 EXT. SPACE - THE NEBULA 184 
                   As Enterprise whooshes into the PICTURE headed into the
                   purplish gas -- and disappears into a cloud bank of
                   the stuff.

                   A moment then Reliant APPEARS, pursues Enterprise into
                   the gloom, also disappears.

 185 INT. RELIANT BRIDGE 185 
                   ON SCREEN the picture is squirrelly purple, breaking
                   up. Blindness. Panic.

 KHAN                              Tactical!

 JOACHIM                                      (tries)
                             Inoperative.

 KHAN                              Raise the shields...

                   Electrical forces raging without are also reflected on
                   the circuits within. It's bumpy, on top of everything
                   else. Electronic WHINING.

 JOACHIM                              As I feared, sir. Not functional.
                             I'm reducing speed.

                   Khan does not argue.

 186 EXT. SPACE - PURPLE - SERIES OF SHOTS 186 
                   Cautiously Reliant emerges from a massive "cloudbank."
                   Electrical discharges abound. Barely moving, she feels
                   her way forward. Alone.

 187 AS THE ANGLE WIDENS 187 
                   A treat: Enterprise is above and behind Reliant.

 188 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE - ON SCREEN 188 
                   Reliant's image is breaking up.

 SULU                              Phaser lock inoperative, sir.

 KIRK                              Best guess, Mr. Sulu. Fire when
                             ready.

                   Sulu strains, then fires -- just as an electrical dis-
                   turbance bounces the bridge --

 189 EXT. SPACE NEBULA 189 
                   The bounce causes Sulu's phaser shot to go wide of
                   Reliant, amid CRACKLING discharges --

 190 INT. RELIANT BRIDGE 190 
                   Rolls from the near-miss concussion --

 KHAN                              Aft-torpedoes -- fire -- !

 191 EXT. SPACE NEBULA 191 
                   Reliant is wide of the mark with a Photon torpedo.
                   A BLINDING ELECTRICAL DISCHARGE. When it clears,
                   Enterprise appears to be alone.

                   All peer into the lousy picture. Occasional electrical
                   flashes.

 195 EXT. SPACE NEBULA 195 
                   Still Enterprise moves forward... A LARGE FLASH... a
                   SUDDEN GLIMPSE: Reliant boring in on collision course!

 196 INT. ENTERPRSIE BRIDGE 196 
                   A sudden clearing ON SCREEN: Reliant!

 KIRK                              Evasive starboard!

                   Hard over, but not fast enough. Reliant fires a phaser.

 197 SERIES OF SHOTS 197 
                   Reliant's phaser shot hits the Enterprise torpedo room
                   in Dorsal Fin area of ship.

                   An EXPLOSION rocks the room and...

 199 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 199 
                   The Bridge rattles from the explosion below; Sulu is
                   thrown from his chair. Saavik leaps to her post --

 KIRK                              Phaser bank one, fire!

 200 EXT. SPACE NEBULA 200 
                   The Enterprise fires a phaser and delivers a raking shot
                   -- which rips along the side of Reliant's primary hull.

 200A INT. RELIANT BRIDGE (FORMERLY SCENE 205) 200A 
                   The bridge is damaged; Joachim and others are wounded...

 KHAN                              Joachim!

                   For the first time, his friend wounded, Khan hesitates,
                   holds him --

 JOACHIM                              Yours... is... the superior...

 KHAN                              I shall avenge you --

 201 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 201 
                   Sulu is being helped by David --

 KIRK                              Damage, Scotty?

 202 INT. ENGINE ROOM 202 
                   Bones is there, helping some crewmen. The Reactor Room 
                   flashes a red warning light and glows with a blue 
                   light. The air is heavy with smoke but the doors,
                   damaged earlier, still hold.

 SCOTTY                              Admiral, I've got to take the mains
                             off the line. The energizer's shaken
                             loose and I can't get in there to
                             fix her -- radiation --

 203 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 203 
 KIRK                              All right, we'll do the job with
                             auxiliary power.

                   The bridge door opens and closes; Chekov, faint,
                   stands there.

 CHEKOV                              Could you use another hand, Admiral?

 KIRK                              Man the weapons console, Mr. Chekov.

                   ANGLE FAVORING David as the others react to Chekov
                   taking his place. Quiet.

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Spock?                             

                   Spock is bent over the scanner --

 SPOCK                              Sporadic energy readings port side,
                             aft. Could be an impulse turn.

 KIRK                              He won't break off now. If he
                             followed me this far he'll be back.
                             But from where...?

 SPOCK                              He's intelligent, but not experienced.
                             His pattern indicates two dimensional
                             thinking...

                   Kirk looks at him, smiles.

 KIRK                              Mr. Saavik, all stop.

 SAAVIK                              All stop, sir.

 KIRK                              Descend ten thousand meters. Stand

                   As Reliant emerges from the dark blue mass into a clear
                   almost tranquil place. Reliant, moving slowly, stops,
                   as if looking around.

 207 INT. RELIANT BRIDGE 207 
                   The screens are empty.

 KHAN                              Where is he? Where in God's name
                             is he?

 208 EXT. SPACE NEBULA 208 
                   Reliant motionless in the f.g. amid occasional flashes.
                   Now, behind Reliant and from below, like a great whale
                   rising from the depths, Enterprise rises vertically,
                   slowly passing the unsuspecting enemy. When Enterprise
                   is above, behind and quite close:

 B) INT. RELIANT 
                   C)   EXPLOSIONS rock the interior of Reliant.

 D) EXT. ENTERPRISE 
                   fires two more times. The first causes general
                   damage. The second, close behind blasts Reliant's
                   port engine off into space, debris scattering.

 E) INT. RELIANT BRIDGE 
                   is devastated. Khan is blown from his chair and
                   WE'RE UNCERTAIN of his fate.

 211 EXT. SPACE NEBULA 211 
                   Reliant, now a scarred, battered hulk, her main hull
                   still intact, but dead in space.

 212 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 212 
                   No cheers, just deadly professionalism.

 KIRK                              Cease fire. Look sharp.

 SAAVIK                              Power levels quite low, sir.

 KIRK                                      (to intercom)
                             Mr. Scott, can you get the mains

 SCOTTY'S VOICE                                      (breaking up slightly) 
                             I'll need ten minutes, sir, 'til
                             the radiation dissipates.

 KIRK                              Uhura, send to Commander, Reliant:
                             prepare to be boarded.

 UHURA                              Aye, sir.

 213 INT. RELIANT BRIDGE 213 
                   Amid the smoke and ruins, WE SEE no signs of life.

 UHURA'S VOICE                              Commander, Reliant, this is
                             Enterprise. Surrender and prepare
                             to be boarded. Repeat...

                   In f.g., chillingly, Khan rises INTO SHOT by the main
                   console. He is horribly burned, and it is clear that
                   he is clinging to life by his will.

 KHAN                              No... Kirk. The game's not over.

                   As Uhura's voice continues O.S., Khan pulls himself
                   into a chair at the console, one of his hands useless
                   at his side.

 KHAN                                      (continuing)
                             To the last I will grapple with thee!

                   Painfully, with one good arm, he starts arming the
                   Genesis console.

 213A INT. RELIANT TRANSPORTER ROOM 213A 
                   There sits the Genesis torpedo: lights start blinking
                   in response. As we watch, the CHILD we met on Ceti Alpha
                   walks to the torpedo and smiles at the lights.

 214 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 214 
 UHURA                              Enterprise to Reliant: you are
                             ordered to surrender your vessel.
                             Respond!

                             Nothing, sir.

                             seen.

                   David peers closer over Spock's shoulder, reacts.

 DAVID                              It's the Genesis Wave!

 KIRK                              What?

 DAVID                              He's on a build up to detonation!

 KIRK                              How soon --

 DAVID                              We encoded four minutes --

 KIRK                              We'll beam aboard and stop it --

 DAVID                              You can't!

                   The briefest stunned moment. Kirk hits intercom:

 KIRK                              Scotty, I need warp speed in three
                             minutes or we're all dead!

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Scotty!

                   Spock leaps from his place and disappears through the
                   bridge doors.

 KIRK                                      (continuing)

 SAAVIK                              Aye, sir.

 215 EXT. SPACE NEBULA 215 
                   Enterprise backs away from Reliant. Her speed is pain-

                   Khan smiles triumphantly through his pain. An elec-

 KHAN                              No... You can't get away... From
                             hell's heart I stab at thee...
                                     (amid the pain)

                             breath at thee!

                   Khan topples forward, dead. The WHINE continues to
                   build chillingly.

                   Spock rushes in. Bones ministers to Scotty, b.g.

                   Spock sizes up the situation, starts for the radiation
                   room, Bones intercepts him.

 BONES                              Are you out of your Vulcan mind?
                             No human can tolerate the radiation
                             loose in there!

 SPOCK                              But, as you are so fond of observing,
                             Doctor, I'm not human.

 BONES                              You're not going in there -- !

 SPOCK                              I'm afraid I can't stop to discuss
                             this logically --

                   He gives Bones the Vulcan nerve pinch. Bones goes
                   down.

                   Spock presses the access button and enters the Reactor
                   Room, a separated area behind radiation-proof glass
                   and metal, RED FLASHING LIGHTS and an iridescent blue

                   WE CAN SEE the silent urging of Bones and Scotty.
                   Spock is oblivious. Amid the fire-blue arcs, he moves 
                   to the control panel. Between his hands and the con-
                   trols, power arcs insanely. Spock is in an inferno,
                   a radiation hell, fighting now with all his strength
                   to control it. Slowly, the damping rods move out.
                   Spock moves to a manual control, begins to turn it.

                        which clears the flame and --

 E) RELIANT 
                        The WHINE increases to fever pitch, then: she goes!

 F) EXT. MUTARA NEBULA - MASTER EFFECT 
                        As Reliant goes, so goes the nebula. The "Genesis
                        Effect" WE SAW in its earliest experiments, now 
                        seems familiar on a gigantic, cosmic scale.

                        The blinding flash at first, followed by the same
                        tumbling turbulence of the miniature test. It is
                        awesome.

 231 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 231 
                   The bridge doors open and Carol appears. Instinctively
                   she draws near her son.

                   Finally, Kirk turns, sees Carol --

 KIRK                              Reduce speed. My God, Carl. Look
                             at it.

                   ON SCREEN and INTERCUT -- GENESIS TUMBLES and starts
                   evolving. A moment in history.

 KIRK                                      (continuing, on
                                      intercom)
                             Engine Room. Well done. Scotty?

 BONES' VOICE                                      (after a beat)
                             Jim, you'd better get down here. Hurry.

                   The tone frightens Kirk.

 KIRK                              Saavik, take the con.

                   He moves through the doors quickly, leaving the rest
                   staring at the new world evolving.

 232 INT. STAIRWAY TO ENGINE ROOM 232 
                   It is endless. Kirk runs forever, feet pounding down,
                   down, down --

 233 EXT. SPACE AND ON SCREEN 233 
                   The clouds tumble and move, new things lie beyond --
 234 INT. STAIRS 234 
                   Kirk races --

 235 INT. ENTERPRISE ENGINE ROOM 235 
                   Kirk emerges to encounter Scotty and Bones. Their
                   looks tell him. He sees the flashing light over the
                   Reactor Room. He dashes for the control panel. Bones
                   grabs him.

 SCOTTY                              No, sir! You'll flood the whole
                             compartment...!

 KIRK                              He'll die -- !

 BONES                                      (also holds him)
                             He's dead already, Jim.

                   Kirk's eyes bulge.

 KIRK                              Oh, God.

 236 ANGLE AT REACTOR ROOM GLASS DOOR 236 
                   With stunned understanding, Kirk stumbles to the door,
                   sees Spock on his knees, hands blackened, face cracked
                   with radiation lines and scars.

                   Spock shakes his head. With a feeble hand he reaches
                   the intercom button: filtered communication.

 KIRK                              Spock!

 SPOCK                              The ship -- out of danger?

 KIRK                              Yes --

                   Spock is satisfied; he fights for breath --

 SPOCK                              Don't grieve, Admiral -- it's
                             logical: the good of the many
                             outweighs --

                   He almost keels over. Kirk has tears streaming down
                   his face.

 KIRK                              ... the good of the few...

 SPOCK                              Or the one.

                   He props a hand on the glass to support himself. Kirk's
                   hand reflexively goes to match Spock's on the other side
                   of the glass --

 SPOCK                                      (continuing)
                             I never took the Kobayashi Maru
                             test -- until now. What do you
                             think of my solution?

 KIRK                              Spock...!

 SPOCK                              I have been -- and always will be
                             -- your friend... Live. Long. And. 
                             Prosper.

                   Spock falls. Bones and Scotty react.

 KIRK                              No...!

 SAAVIK'S VOICE                                      (intercom)
                             Admiral, you've got to see this!
                             There's new life -- a whole new
                             world, a Genesis world -- !

                   But Kirk is past hearing or caring. He is huddled up
                   against the glass, destroyed. Bones looks on, helpless.

 DISSOLVE TO: 
 237 EXT. SPACE 237 
                   A spectacular look at Carol's planet being born!

 238 OMITTED 238 
 239 CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL 239 
                   the Ship's Company in full dress uniforms assembled for
                   ship's burial service. Over the PULLBACK, we HEAR:

 KIRK                              In accordance with the traditions
                             of Starfleet and of Article 184
                             Starfleet Regulations, we are
                             assembled here today to pay final
                             respects to our honored dead.

                   Carol and David are PROMINENTLY FEATURED. David watching
                   Kirk attentively. So are Sulu, Uhura, Chekov, and Saavik.
                   Bones stands next to Kirk. Scotty carries his bagpipes.
                   Saavik wears her hair down.

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             And yet, in the midst of our sorrow
                             it should be noted that this death
                             takes place in the shadow of new
                             life, the sunrise of a new world,
                             a world that our beloved comrade
                             gave his own life to protect and
                             nourish. He did not feel that
                             sacrifice a vain or empty one --
                             and we will not debate his profound
                             wisdom, in these proceedings. Of
                             my friend, I can only say this, that
                             of all the souls I have encountered 
                             in my travels, his was the most --
                                     (he falters)
                             -- human.

                   He tries to go on, but catches Bones' face: Bones is
                   streaming tears. Kirk can't go on.

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Lieutenant Saavik.

 241 ANGLE - THE GROUP 241 
                   Saavik steps forward.

 SAAVIK                              We commend the soul of our brother
                             departed. We love we commit his
                             body to the depths of space.

 SULU                              Honors -- hup!

                   All Starfleet personnel salute. Scotty begins to PIPE,
                   an odd blare which mellows into Amazing Grace. Kirk
                   nods a signal.

 242 THE CAPSULE 242 
                   A gleaming black projectile is carried by pallbearers
                   into the launching chamber, which locks behind it. At
                   a hand signal from a TORPEDOMAN, the projectile is fired.
 NOISE. 
 243 EXT. SPACE 243 
                   Spock's remains seen on their way to the new world. 
                   The capsule grows too small to SEE. The bagpipes STOP.

 244 INT. TORPEDO ROOM 244 
 SULU                              Return -- hup!

                   The salute drop.

 KIRK                              Lieutenant.

                   She steps to him and they exchange salutes --

 KIRK                                      (continuing; very 
                                      quietly)
                             After you dismiss the company, you
                             will take the watch. Set course 
                             for Ceti Alpha V and we'll pick up 
                             survivors.

 SAAVIK                              Aye, sir.

 KIRK                              I'll be in my quarters if needed,
                             but I would prefer...

 SAAVIK                              Understood, sir.

 KIRK                                      (aloud)
                             Dismiss the company.

                   They salute. She about-faces as Kirk walks towards
                   the  Turbo Lift. Saavik issues dismissal and posting 
                   orders, but WE TRUCK with Kirk until CAMERA STOPS and
                   he leaves FRAME and WE HOLD on David. He finally
                   understands.

 245 INT. KIRK'S QUARTERS 245 
                   After a long moment, the CAMERA DISCOVERS Kirk. He
                   pours a drink, then decides not to have it.

                   He sits wearily, not knowing how to shake the ghosts.
                   Then he sees the book.

                   Kirk picks up the battered volume, the gift from his
                   friend, and closes his eyes a moment. Almost idly
                   he starts turning pages, looking for a clue. But he
                   can't see the writing -- he rummages through his
                   pockets and pulls out the half-glasses --

                   One of the lenses is broken. It has a deep impact on
                   Kirk. He puts down the book and glasses and covers
                   his eyes.

                   A SOFT BONG. Kirk clears his throat.

 KIRK                              Yes... come.

                   The door whooshes open and closes to admit David. The
                   last person Kirk expected to see.

 DAVID                              I don't mean to intrude.

 KIRK                              Uh, no...
                                     (rises)
                             I should be on the bridge.

 DAVID                              Are you running away from me?

                   David's strength is turning a corner with Kirk --

 KIRK                              I suppose I was.
                                     (pause)
                             I poured a drink. Would you like
                             it?

 DAVID                              No. I -- I guess I'm not what you
                             expected.

 KIRK                                      (rueful)
                             I didn't expect anything.

 DAVID                              That makes two of us.
                                     (he studies his
                                      father)
                             Lieutenant Saavik was right: you
                             never have faced death --

 KIRK                                      (hoarse)
                             Not like this -- no. I haven't faced
                             death, I cheated death. I tricked
                             my way out of death and patted myself
                             on the back for my ingenuity. I
                             know nothing.

 DAVID                              You knew enough to tell Saavik that
                             how we face death is at least as
                             important as how we face life --

 KIRK                              It was just words.

 DAVID                              But good words. That's where ideas
                             begin. Maybe you should listen to
                             them.

 KIRK                              I'm trying, David.

 DAVID                              So am I. My friends were killed,
                             too.

 KIRK                              I am truly sorry.

                   Pause. They study each other.

 DAVID                              I was wrong about you. And I'm
                             sorry.

 KIRK                              Is that what you came here to say?

 DAVID                              Mainly.
                                     (he starts out,
                                      then turns -- )
                             And also that I'm proud -- very
                             proud -- to be your son.

                   A stunned moment, then Kirk lets it all hang out: for
                   David, for Carol and for Spock. He hugs his son, hold-
                   ing onto him as if to life itself.

 247 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 247 
                   The door whooshes. Kirk strides on the bridge, David
                   with him. Carol is there with Bones; they are glad at
                   what they see.

 SAAVIK                              Admiral on the bridge!

 KIRK                              As you were, Mr. Saavik.

 SAAVIK                              Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha.
                             All is well.

 KIRK                              Good, I believe you already know
                             my, uh, son --

                   Saavik comes close to blushing --

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Yes, well, why don't you show him
                             around and...

 SAAVIK                              Aye, sir --

                   She takes him off, deadpan amusement --

 SAAVIK                                      (continuing)
                             So you turn out to be the dumb
                             bastard.

                   They stare at her.

 SAAVIK                                      (continuing)
                             That is a little joke.

                   Kirk has a smile. He joins Bones and Carol facing the
                   screen.

 BONES                              She's changed her hair again.
                                     (pause)
                             Will you look at that? Think
                             they'll name it for you, Doctor?

 CAROL                              Not if I can help it. We'll name
                             it for our friend.

 KIRK                                      (quietly)
                             It is a far far better thing I do
                             than I have ever done before... a
                             far better resting place I go to
                             than I have ever known...

 CAROL                                      (soft)
                             Is that a poem?

 KIRK                              Something Spock was trying to
                             tell me. On my birthday.

                   He shakes his head, remembering --

 BONES                              You okay, Jim? How do you feel?

 KIRK                                      (considers; smiles)
                             Young. I feel young, Doctor.

                   He turns to Saavik and David --

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Lieutenant, new course: 'Second

                   NOISES of Enterprise bridge, clicking of relays,
                   minor electronic effects. We HEAR A FEMALE VOICE.

 SAAVIK'S VOICE                              Captain's log. Stardate 8130.3,
                             Starship Enterprise on training
                             mission to Gamma Hydra. Section 14,
                             coordinates 22/87/4. Approaching
                             Neutral Zone, all systems

 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 
                   As the ANGLE WIDENS, we see the crew at stations;
                   (screens and visual displays are in use): COMMANDER
                   SULU at the helm, COMMANDER UHURA at the Comm Con-
                   sole, DR. BONES McCOY and SPOCK at his post. The
                   Captain is new -- and unexpected. LT. SAAVIK is young
                   and beautiful. She is half Vulcan and half Romulan.
                   In appearance she is Vulcan with pointed ears, but her
                   skin is fair and she has none of the expressionless
                   facial immobility of a Vulcan.

 SULU                              Leaving Section Fourteen for
                             Section Fifteen.

 SAAVIK                              Project parabolic course to
                             avoid entering Neutral Zone.

 SULU                              Aye, Captain.

 UHURA                                      (suddenly)
                             Captain... I'm getting something
                             on the distress channel. Minimal
                             signal... But something...

 SAAVIK                              Can you amplify?

 UHURA                              I'm trying...

 SULU                              Course change projected.

 UHURA                              It's an emergency distress call!

 SAAVIK                              On speakers!

                             the Kobayashi Maru -- nineteen
                             periods out of Altair Six. We
                             have struck a gravitic mine and
                             have lost all power... Our hull

                             us, Enterprise? Can you...

 SAAVIK                              Data on Kobayashi Maru! Tactical!

 SAAVIK                              Damn.
                                     (then)
                             Mr. Sulu, plot an intercept course.

 SULU                              May I remind the Captain that if a
                             Starship enters the zone --

 SAAVIK                              I'm aware of my responsibilities,
                             Mister.

 SULU                                      (with a nod)
                             ... Now entering the Neutral

 COMPUTER VOICE                              Warning. We have entered the

 SULU                              Estimating two minutes to intercept.

                   On screen: Enterprise approaches the stricken vessel.

 SAAVIK                              Stand by transporter room, ready
                             to beam survivors, aboard.

 UHURA                              Captain, I've lost their signal!

 COMPUTER VOICE                              Alert. Sensors indicate three
                             Klingon Cruisers, bearing 316,
                             mark 4, closing fast.

 SAAVIK                              Visual!

                   On screen we see the approach  of the Klingon vessels,
                   they are dark and sinister.

 SAAVIK                                      (continuing)
                             Battle stations! Activate shields!

                   The ALARM SOUNDS.

 SULU                              Shields activated!

 SAAVIK                              Inform the Klingons we are on a
                             rescue mission...

 UHURA                              They're jamming all frequencies,
                             Captain --

 COMPUTER VOICE                              Klingons on attack course and closing.

                   Screen verifies this. Saavik makes an agonized choice.

 SAAVIK                              We're over our heads. Mr. Sulu,
                             get us out of here.

 SULU                              I'll try, Captain.

 COMPUTER VOICE                              Klingon cruisers approaching,
                             bearing 090, mark 20.

 SAAVIK                              Visual!

                   The image flops: more Klingons approach. They FIRE
                   photon torpedoes.

 SAAVIK                                      (continuing)
                             Evasive action!

                   Sulu does his best, but Enterprise is hit; Sulu is
                   hurled from his station, and Bones hurries to him.

 SAAVIK                                      (continuing)
                             Engineering! damage report!

 SCOTTY'S VOICE (INTERCOM)                              Main energizer hit, Captain!

 SAAVIK                              Engage auxiliary power. Prepare
                             to return fire!

                   The bridge takes another hit -- a big one. In its wake
                   there is a second electrical EXPLOSION along the communi-
                   cations panel. Uhura falls from her station. Bones
                   rushes to her side amid the smoke and alarms.

 A CADET                              Shields collapsing, Captain!

 SCOTTY'S VOICE (FILTERED)                              Captain, we're losing auxiliary
                             power!

 SAAVIK                              Fire all phasers...!

 SPOCK                              No power to the weapons system,
                             sir.

                   Another hit: reverberating flashes of spark and flame
                   on the bridge. Spock dies. Bones comes to him, but
                   even as he coughs his way through the smoke, a final
                   hit and Bones falls. The room is smoke filled and a
                   shambles. Saavik looks about in shock.

 SCOTTY'S VOICE (FILTERED)                              Captain, it's no use. We're
                             dead in space.

                   Saavik digests this for a painful moment. Then, touch-
                   ing a comm button:

 SAAVIK                              Activate escape pods. Send out the

                             Repeat -- all hands --

 KIRK'S VOICE (FILTERED)                              All right, open her up.

                   There is a loud CLANGING and  --

 4 FULL SHOT - ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 4 
                   The side walls of the "bridge" slide apart, revealing
                   a lighted room beyond. Through the opening strides
                   KIRK. He stops, surveys the shambles, and shakes his
                   head.

 SAAVIK                              Any suggestions, Admiral?

 KIRK                              Prayer, Mr. Saavik. The Klingons
                             do not take prisoners.
                                     (to Spock)
                             Captain.

 SPOCK                              Trainees to the briefing room.

                   Sulu awakens with a grin. Uhura straightens herself
                   demurely. The Trainees head toward the distant room,
                   Spock rises and leaves. Bones remains on the floor,
                   head propped in his hand, whimsically.

 KIRK                              Physician, heal thyself.

 BONES                              That's all you have to say?

 KIRK                              I'm not a drama critic.

                   Bones rolls his eyes and rises. Kirk sees Saavik who
                   has not moved.

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Well, Mr. Saavik, are you going
                             to stay with the sinking ship?

 SAAVIK                              Permission to speak candidly, sir?

 KIRK                              Very well.

 SAAVIK                                      (fights emotion)
                             I don't believe this was a fair
                             test of my command capabilities.

 KIRK                              And why not?

 SAAVIK                              Because... there was no way to win.

 KIRK                              A no-win situation is a possibility
                             every commander may face. Has that
                             never occurred to you?

 SAAVIK                              ... No, sir. It has not.

 KIRK                              How we deal with death is at least
                             as important as how we deal with
                             life, wouldn't you say?

 SAAVIK                                      (falters)
                             As I indicated, Admiral, that
                             thought had not occurred to me.

 KIRK                              Then you have something new to think
                             about. Carry on.

                   She stays at attention.

 BONES                              Wouldn't it be easier to put
                             an experienced crew back on the
                             ship?

 KIRK                              They'll learn. Galloping about the
                             cosmos is a game for the young,
                             doctor.

                   He leaves. They look at each other.

 UHURA                                      (offended)
                             What is that supposed to mean?

                   HOLD ON Saavik.

 5 INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE SIMULATOR ROOM - DAY 5 
                   Kirk rounds the corner and sees Spock, leaning against
                   the wall.

 KIRK                                      (dry)
                             Aren't you dead?

                   Spock almost smiles.

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             I assume you are loitering here
                             to learn what efficiency rating
                             I plan to give your cadets.

 SPOCK                              I am understandably curious.

                   They walk together.

 KIRK                              They destroyed the simulator room
                             and you with it.

 SPOCK                              The Kobayshi Maru scenario 
                             frequently wreaks havoc with
                             students and equipment.
                                     (dry)
                             As I recall you took the test
                             three times yourself. Your final
                             solution was, shall we say, unique?

 KIRK                                      (solemn)
                             It had the virtue of never having
                             been tried.                             

 SPOCK                              Yours was not a solution which
                             would have occurred to a Vulcan
                             mentality.

 KIRK                              So you said at the time. Speaking
                             of which, your protg's first
                             rare -- a trifle emotional --

 SPOCK                              She's half Romulan, Jim. The
                             admixture makes her more volatile
                             than -- me, for example.

 KIRK                              Than you. Yes, I see that. By
                             the way, thank you for this.

                   He lifts the book.

 SPOCK                              I know of your fondness for antiques.

 KIRK                                      (reads)
                             'It was the best of times, it was
                             the worst of times...' Message,
                             Spock?

 SPOCK                              None of which I am consciously
                             aware -- except, of course, happy
                             birthday -- surely the best of times.

                   Kirk looks around uncomfortably, overlaps:

 KIRK                              Hrummm... and where are you off
                             to, now?

 SPOCK                              The Enterprise. I must check in
                             before your inspection. And you?

 KIRK                                      (shortly)
                             Home.

                   Spock studies him --

 SPOCK                              Something oppresses you.

                   They are old friends --

 KIRK                              Something.

                   He steps into a turbo elevator. The doors close as
                   Spock watches, wiping the scene.

 6 EXT. DEEP SPACE - NEAR CETI ALPHA V 6 
                   In f.g. is the U.S.S. RELIANT, an older, somewhat
                   battered starship of the ENTERPRISE class, with a
                   slightly different configuration. Reliant approaches
                   an inhospitable-looking yellow planet: CETI ALPHA V

                             which will serve as a suitable test
                             site for the Genesis Experiments.
                             This is the 16th planet we have
                             visited, so far, no success.
 7 INT. BRIDGE OF RELIANT 7 
                   Well-aged and distinctive. The usual compliment of
                   officers and crew. CAPTAIN CLARK TERRELL, about 45,
                   soft spoken and in good shape, but somewhat laconic.

                   Behind Terrell, surveying the data screen is COMMANDER
                   CHEKOV, aged some, but still boyish.

 TERRELL                              Standard orbit, Mr. Beach.

 BEACH                              Standard orbit, sir.

 TERRELL                              Any change in surface scan?

 BEACH                              Negative. Limited atmosphere,
                             dominated by craylon gas, sand and
                             high velocity winds. Incapable
                             of supporting life forms.

                   Forward screen: Ceti Alpha.

 CHEKOV                              Does it have to be completely
                             lifeless?

                   Terrell rises and crosses to Chekov.

 TERRELL                              Don't tell me you've got something.

 CHEKOV                                      (points)
                             We've picked up a minor energy flux
                             reading on one dyno scanner.

 TERRELL                              Damn! Are you sure? Maybe the
                             scanner's out of adjustment --

 CHEKOV                              I suppose it could be a particle
                             of preanimate matter caught in the
                             matrix...

 TERRELL                              All right, let's get on the Comm-pic to
                             Doctor Marcus. Maybe it's something
                             we can transplant.

 CHEKOV                              You know what she'll say...

 8 EXT. DEEP SPACE - REGULA I SPACE STATION 8 
                   A functional cluster of modules serve as a scientific
                   complex, a futuristic White Sands, orbiting a small
                   barren plantoid in b.g.: Regula.

 CAROL MARCUS'S VOICE (FILTERED)                              Something you can transplant? I
                             don't know --

 9 INT. SPACE STATION - CAROL'S LAB 9 
                   Big but deserted except for Carol, in contact with
                   Reliant. Surrounded by equipment clearly meant for
                   many workers, CAROL MARCUS is in her early forties,
                   attractive and intelligent. Static mars the trans-
                   missions.

                   On the monitor: Terrell and Chekov, looking hopeful.

 TERRELL                              It might only be a particle of
                             preanimate matter...

 CAROL                              Then again it might not. You
                             boys have to be clear on this:
                             there can't be so much as a
                             microbe or the show's off.
                                     (she thinks)
                             Why don't you have a look? If it
                             IS something that can be moved...

 TERRELL                                      (eager)
                             You bet, doctor. We're on our way!

                   Carol sighs as the image fades, not happy.

 10 INT. CORRIDOR, SPACE STATION REGULA I 10 
                   Carol walks through the labyrinthine complex with
                   DAVID, her son, a bright young scientist of twenty.
                   He is good looking and humorous.

 DAVID                              How can you let them pull that
                             stuff on you? They're just lazy.

 CAROL                              And bored. I know. But maybe it
                             IS something they can...

 DAVID                              Come on, Mother, that's just the
                             military mentality. Never put off
                             tomorrow what you can put off today.
                             If there's one atom of life...

 CAROL                              I know, I know...

                   Silence.

 DAVID                              Well, don't have kittens.
                             Genesis is going to work. They'll
                             remember  you in a wreath with
                             Newton, Einstein, Surak...

 CAROL                                      (mock outrage)
                             Thanks a lot. No respect from my
                             offspring --

 DAVID                              Par for the course... you teaming
                             up with me for bridge after dinner?

 CAROL                              Maybe...

 DAVID                              Every time we have dealings with
                             Starfleet, I get nervous.
                                     (shrugs)
                             We're dealing with something
                             that COULD be perverted into
                             a dreadful weapon. Remember that
                             overgrown boy scout you used to
                             hang out with? That's exactly
                             the --

                   They walk past the CAMERA, their VOICES FADING.

 CAROL                              Listen, kiddo, Jim Kirk was many
                             things, but he was never a Boy
                             Scout...

                   HOLD ON the empty corridor.

 11 INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT, TERRA - NIGHT 11 
                   Kirk reads the novel, trying to focus. His flat befits
                   an Admiral and a loner with few possessions, except
                   a collection of antiques.

 WE HEAR A SOFT BONG. 
                   Startled, Kirk lowers the book and pushes a button.

 KIRK                              Come.

                   The door slides open and Bones enters. He carries two
                   packages, one of them wrapped in brown paper.

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Bless me, doctor; and what beams
                             you into this neck of the woods?

 BONES                              'Beware Romulans bearing gifts.'
                             Happy Birthday...

                   With a flourish, he pulls out a bottle of blue
                   liquid.

 KIRK                              Romulan Ale! Bones, you know
                             this stuff is illegal --

 BONES                                      (broad)
                             I only use it for medicinal
                             purposes. Don't be a pring...

 KIRK                                      (reading the label
                                       with difficulty)
                             Twenty-two, eighty-three...

 BONES                              Takes the stuff a while to
                             ferment. Gimme.

                   He takes the bottle and pours; continues talking.

 BONES                                      (continuing)
                             Now open the other one.

                   Kirk starts to obey.

 KIRK                              I'm almost afraid to. What did
                             you bring me, contraband Klingon --

 BONES                              More antiques for your collection
                             -- Cheers!

                   They drink. The package is opened: a pair of gold
                   "Ben Franklin" half-glasses. (N.B.: Romulan Ale is
                   an INSTANT DRUNK: both men react.)

 KIRK                              Cheers. Bones, these are... charming.

 BONES                              Four hundred years old. You don't
                             find many with the lens still
                             intact.

 KIRK                              Uh -- what are they?

 BONES                              For your eyes. For most patients
                             of your age, I generally administer
                             Retlax Five to restore flexibility
                             of the lens.

 KIRK                              But I'm allergic to Retlax.

 BONES                              Exactly. Happy birthday.

                   He toasts. Kirk is unsure how they work.

 BONES                                      (continuing)
                             Slide them down your nose. Now look
                             at me over the top. And you read
                             printed matter through the bottom.

 KIRK                                      (reacts)
                             Amazing! I don't know what to say --

 BONES                              Say thank you.

 KIRK                              Thank you.

                   An awkward silence.

 BONES                              Damn it, Jim, what the hell's the
                             matter? Other people have birthdays.
                             Why're we treating yours like a funeral?

 KIRK                              Bones, I don't want to be lectured.

 BONES                              What DO you want? Damn it, why
                             isn't there a girl here? You know
                             this has nothing to do with age.
                             This is about you flying a goddamn
                             computer console when you wanna be
                             out hopping Galaxies.

 KIRK                              Spare me your notions of poetry,
                             please. We all have our assigned
                             duties and...

 BONES                              Bull. You're hiding -- hiding
                             behind the rules and regulations --

 KIRK                              And who am I hiding from?

 BONES                              From yourself, Admiral.

                   Pause. Kirk pours another drink.

 KIRK                              Don't mince words, Bones; tell
                             me what you really think.

 BONES                                      (mild take)
                             I'm your doctor and I'm your friend, 
                             Jim. Get back your command. Get it
                             back before you really do grow old.
                             Before you turn into part of this
                             collection.

                   They look at each other.

 12 EXT. RELIANT - DEEP SPACE 12 
                   orbiting Ceti Alpha V.

                   VOICES OVER indicate the transporter room is ready.

 13 OMITTED 13 
 14 EXT. SURFACE CETI ALPHA V 14 
                   A YELLOW PLANET, in constant SWIRLING HURRICANE WINDS
                   OF SAND. Terrell and Chekov materialize. Their VOICES,
                   filtered, are hard to make out.

                   With the TRICORDER to guide them, they set out...

 TERRELL                              Are you sure these are the
                             coordinates?

 CHEKOV                              Captain, this is the garden spot
                             of Ceti Alpha VI --

 TERRELL                              I can hardly see --

 15 SEVERAL ANGLES 15 
                   The difficult search, the men leaning into the wind --

 16 TERRELL 16 
                   is ahead of Chekov on a slight rise --

 CHEKOV                              There's nothing, let's go --

 17 ANGLE 17 
                   Terrell waves him frantically forward. As Chekov
                   moves up, we rise with him to the top of the ridge and
                   look down.

 18 ANGLE - THEIR POV 18 
                   A RUINED SERIES OF MAN-MADE STRUCTURES, half buried in
                   sand. They look at each other in consternation. Chekov
                   is worried; something about all this is familiar.

                   They descend towards the structures, now seen to be the
                   wreckage of some sort of space craft.

                   They pass but do not notice the FEDERATION LOGO, half
                   buried next to their feet.

 TERRELL                              They look like cargo carriers...

                   As Chekov looks at the porthole, a face suddenly looks
                   back! It is the face of a CHILD! The Apparition
                   scares the daylights out of Chekov -- and us. He
                   screams.

 TERRELL                                      (continuing)
                             What is it?

                   He comes clumsily over --

 CHEKOV                              A face! I saw -- it was like a
                             child --

                   He points. The porthole is empty.

 TERRELL                              You're crazy -- !

 CHEKOV                              I saw it -- !

 TERRELL                              There's an air-lock.

                   He points and they go into the airlock.

 19 INT. CARGO HOLD 19 
                   Terrell and Chekov enter, dumbfounded. THEIR POV.
                   Someone lives here -- there are beds, food, all jury-
                   rigged -- but no people. Terrell checks a monitor.

 TERRELL                              There's breathable atmosphere in here.

                   He takes off his helmet; Chekov likewise.

 TERRELL                                      (continuing)
                             What the hell is this? Did they
                             crash? Where's the rest of the
                             ship?

                   They wander as they talk, picking up objects that be-
                   speak a fairly sophisticated ad hoc environment: a
                   laboratory in one hold; a kitchen; A LARGE SAND TANK
                   filled with disgusting CETI EELS.

                   ABRUPTLY A SOUND -- They start: CHILD'S GURGLE.

 CHEKOV                                      (terrified)
                             I told you! I told you I saw a --

 TERRELL                              Ssssh!

                   They start looking. They enter a new chamber --

 20 KHAN'S QUARTERS 20 
                   On its side in the sand: the walls are now the floor,
                   etc. All in crookedness -- like its owner. On the
                   floor, smiling at them (i.e., the wall) is a BABY.

                   Tentatively they come over to it, looking around --

 21 ANGLE - CHEKOV'S POV 21 
                   Lethal-looking odd swords on one wall, a bookshelf;
                   CAMERA PANS by 20th Century volumes; MOBY DICK, KING
                   LEAR, THE HOLY BIBLE -- and a seat belt dangling with
                   the name on it -- Botany Bay.

                   Chekov mouths the words, softly at first, then aloud --

 CHEKOV                              Botany Bay -- oh no!

 TERRELL                                      (examines the child)
                             What's the matter -- ?

                   Chekov runs, tries to get his helmet on, tries to drag
                   Terrell --

 CHEKOV                              Captain, we've got to get out of
                             here -- now! Damn! Hurry!

                   Terrell catches his urgency --

 TERRELL                              But the child --

 CHEKOV                              Never mind! Hurry!

 22 EXT. CARGO HOLD AIRBAY 22 
                   Terrell and Chekov emerge, helmeted, then stop dead.

 23 ANGLE - THEIR POV 23 
                   A RING OF SUITED FIGURES has them surrounded.

 24 INT. RELIANT - THE BRIDGE 24 
                   Mr. Beach, the duty officer, stands looking at Ceti
                   Alpha V on the forward screen.

 BEACH                              Try again.

 KYLE                              Starship Reliant to Captain Terrell
                             ... This is Lieutenant Kyle. Will
                             you please respond, Captain...
                             Captain Terrell, respond please.

                   Nothing.

 BEACH                                      (thinks)
                             Let's give them a little more
                             time.

 25 INT. CARGO HOLD - CETI ALPHA V 25 
                   Terrell and Chekov are held by FOUR STRONG MEN.

                   They seem to be waiting. One of the men is JOACHIM.

                   Out of the airlock steps a tall masked figure. A
                   moment of suspense as Terrell and Chekov watch, terri-
                   fied. The mask is peeled back.

 CHEKOV                                      (aloud despite himself)
                             Khan!

                   KHAN is startled by the recognition; comes over and
                   examines Chekov and Terrell.

 KHAN                                      (finally)
                             I don't know you. But you. I never
                             forget a face. Mister Chekov,
                             isn't it?
                                     (wonderingly)
                             I never thought to see your face
                             again.

 TERRELL                              Chekov, who is this man?

 CHEKOV                              A criminal, Captain -- a product of
                             the late 20th Century genetic
                             engineering --

 TERRELL                              What do you want with us? I demand --

 KHAN                                      (mild)
                             You are in a position to demand
                             nothing, sir. I, on the other hand,
                             am in a position to grant nothing.
                             What you see is all that remains of
                             the ship's company and the crew of the
                             Botany Bay, marooned here fifteen
                             years ago by Captain James T. Kirk.

 TERRELL                              Listen to me -- you men and women --

 KHAN                              Save your strength, Captain, these
                             people have sworn to live and die at
                             my command two hundred years before
                             you were born. Do you mean he...
                                      (i.e. Chekov)
                             ... never told you the tale?
                             To amuse you, Captain? Never told
                             you how the Enterprise picked up the
                             Botany Bay, lost in space from the
                             year 1996, myself and the ship's
                             company in cryogenic freeze?

 TERRELL                              I've never even met Admiral Kirk --

 KHAN                              Admiral? He didn't tell you how
                             Admiral Kirk sent seventy of us into
                             exile on this barren sand heap with
                             only the contents of these cargo bays
                             to sustain us?

 CHEKOV                              You lie! On Ceti Alpha V there was
                             life, a fair chance to --

 KHAN                              This is Ceti Alpha V! Ceti Alpha VI
                             exploded six months after we were
                             left here. The shock shifted the
                             orbit of this planet and everything
                             was laid waste. Admiral Kirk never
                             bothered to check on our progress.
                             It was only the fact of my genetically
                             engineered intellect that enabled us
                             to survive! On earth, two hundred
                             years ago, I was a prince, with power
                             over millions -- now, like Prometheus
                             I have been left by Admiral Kirk to
                             digest my own entrails.

 CHEKOV                              Captain Kirk was your host! You repaid
                             his hospitality by trying to steal his
                             ship and murder him.

 KHAN                                      (moves closer)
                             And I'll wager he never told you
                             about his shipmate, the beautiful
                             and courageous Lieutenant McGiver,
                             who gave up everything to join me
                             in exile. OUT OF LOVE. And see how
                             Admiral Kirk requited her devotion --
                             She's dead as earth!

                   The wind howls in the silence. When Khan turns, his
                   eyes are filled with tears.

 KHAN                                      (continuing)
                             A plague upon you all.

                   He recovers his poise and returns to them --

 KHAN                                      (continuing)
                             You didn't expect to find me.
                             You thought this was Ceti Alpha VI.
                             Why are you here?

                   They don't answer. Khan goes over to Terrell and, WITH
 ONE HAND, LIFTS HIM INTO THE AIR -- 
 KHAN                                      (continuing)
                             Why?

                   Terrell gasps, stays silent --

 KHAN                                      (continuing)
                             No matter.

                   He lets go; Terrell falls with a thud --

                             You will soon tell me willingly
                             enough.

                   He goes over to the tank and dips a kind of strainer in,
                   pulling out TWO CETI EELS -- wriggling items --

 KHAN                                      (continuing)
                             Let me introduce you to Ceti Alpha V's
                             only remaining indigenous life form;
                             what do you think? They've killed
                             twenty of my people, including my
                             beloved wife. Oh, not all at once
                             and not instantly, to be sure. Their
                             young enter through the ears and wrap
                             themselves around the cerebral cortex.
                             This has the effect of rendering the
                             victim extremely susceptible to
                             suggestion. Later, as they grow,
                             follows madness, paralysis -- and
                             death. These are pets, of course --
                             not quite domesticated.

                   As he speaks, Khan dumps an eel in each of their helmets;
                   he swirls the helmets around as though he were mixing
                   martinis --

 CHEKOV                              Khan, listen to me! Captain Kirk
                             was only doing his duty! You --

 26 CLOSE UP - KHAN - CAMERA IN 26 KHAN                              There is some pain at first, I am
                             told, and then the effects are quite
                             benign -- until the end. That was
                             what I learned from watching my wife.

                   At a sign, the helmets are slammed down. As the muffled
                   shrieks are heard from within, the eels crawl across
                   the faces of Chekov and Terrell; with unerring in-
                   stincts they head for the ears of the two hapless men.
                   There is some atrocious pain as they enter -- then
                   dazed calm.

 KHAN                                      (continuing)
                             That's better! Now: tell me why
                             you are here -- and tell me where I
                             may find James Kirk.

 27 INT. RELIANT BRIDGE 27 
 KYLE                              Captain Terrell. Captain Terrell...
                             This is Reliant; please respond.

                   No answer -- Beach makes up his mind --

 BEACH                              Mr. Kyle, muster a landing party
                             with full arms. Alert the
                             transporter room. We're beaming
                             down.

                   He heads for the door but is stopped by:

                             Reliant, this is Terrell. Respond
                             please.

 BEACH                              This is Reliant. Clark, are you
                             all right?

                   Fractional pause.

 TERRELL'S VOICE                                      (filtered)
                             Everything's fine, commander. I'll
                             explain when I see you. Oh, by the 
                             way, we're bringing several guests
                             aboard. Prepare to beam up on my
                             next signal. Terrell out.

                   Beach and Kyle look at each other.

 KYLE                              Guests?

 BEACH                              Maybe we ARE transplanting something.

                   A SPACE SHUTTLE moving toward us.

 29 INT. SPACE SHUTTLE 29 
                   A new composite. Bones, Sulu, Uhura and Kirk -- who
                   sits, reading. Through the windows we can see the
                   approach to the starship ENTERPRISE. Kirk looks up,
                   nods. Sulu activates a comm button.

 SULU                              Enterprise, this is Admiral Kirk's
                             party on final approach.

 ENTERPRISE VOICE                                      (filtered)
                             Enterprise welcomes you. Prepare 
                             for docking.

                   Kirk looks up from his book as Sulu sits next to him.

 KIRK                              I really must thank you.

 SULU                                      (embarrassed)
                             I am delighted; any chance to go
                             aboard Enterprise, however briefly,
                             is always an excuse for nostalgia.

 KIRK                              I cut your new orders personally. By
                             the end of the month, you'll have your
                             first command: USS EXCELSIOR.

 SULU                              Thank you, sir. I've looked
                             forward to this for a long time.

 KIRK                              You've earned it. But I'm still
                             grateful to have you at the helm
                             for three weeks. I don't believe
                             these kids can steer.

                   Sulu laughs.

 30 EXT. SPOCE DOCK - TERRA (FEATURE STOCK) 30 
                   The shuttle approaches the mammoth airstrip. As we
                   near the ship, a few WORK CREWS IN SPACE flit about
                   her hull, working.

 31 EXT. ENTERPRISE (FEATURE STOCK) 31 
                   The shuttle makes its way to the Docking Lock of the

 32 INT. ENTERPRISE DOCKING BAY 32 
                   A reception group awaits, led by Captain Spock. Saavik
                   stands at his side, in company of the Trainee crew.
                   Also present: CHIEF ENGINEER MR. SCOTT and members of
                   his staff in their distinctive uniforms.

 INTERCOM VOICE                              Docking procedure complete.

 SPOCK                              Prepare for Admiral's inspection.

                   The group comes to attention.

 SPOCK                                      (continuing)
                             Open the Air Lock.

                   The doors open. Kirk and his staff are piped aboard
                   by an electronic version of the boatswain's tradi-
                   tional whistle. Kirk salutes the Federation symbol
                   and steps forward to exchange salutes with Spock.

 KIRK                              Permission to come aboard, Captain?

 SPOCK                              Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe
                             you know my trainee crew. Certainly
                             they have come to know you.

 KIRK                                      (dryly to Saavik)
                             Yes, we've been through death and
                             life together.

                   Saavik stiffens slightly -- humor is not her forte.

 KIRK                                      (continuing to Scotty)
                             Mr. Scott, you old space dog. You're
                             well?

 SCOTTY                              I had me a wee bout -- but Dr. McCoy
                             pulled me through.

 KIRK                              Oh? A wee bout of what, Mr. Scott?

                   Uncomfortable, Scotty exchanges a glance with Bones --

 BONES                              Shore leave, Admiral.

 KIRK                              Ah.

                   He stops before a BRIGHT-FACED FOURTEEN-YEAR OLD, stand-
                   ing so stiff he looks like he'll break -- in an
                   engineer's uniform.

 KIRK                                     (continuing)
                             And who is this?

 PRESTON                                      (breathless)
                             Midshipman First Class Peter Preston,
                             engineers mate, SIR.

                   A big salute. Kirk is amused, returns the salute.

 KIRK                              Your first training voyage, Mr.
                             Preston?

 PRESTON                              Yes, SIR.

 KIRK                              I see. Well, shall we start with
                             the engine room?

                   He moves, followed by his staff.

 SCOTTY                                      (eyeing his protg)
                             I believe you'll find all in order --

 SPOCK                              We'll see you on the bridge, Admiral.

 KIRK                              Very good, Mr. Spock.

                   Kirk and party leave. CAMERA PUSHES IN ON SPOCK AND
 SAAVIK. 
 SAAVIK                              He's not what I expected, Sir.

 SPOCK                              What did you expect, Lieutenant?

 SAAVIK                                      (uncertain)
                             He's very human.

 SPOCK                              We can't all be perfect, Saavik.
                             You must control your prejudices
                             and remember that as a Vulcan as
                             well as a Romulan you are forever
                             a stranger in an alien land.
                             Around you are humans, and as a
                             member of the Starfleet you are
                             unlikely ever to escape their
                             presence or their influence.
                             You must learn to tolerance in addition
                             to all else I have taught you.
                             Tolerance is logical.

                   Saavik is humbled.

 SAAVIK                              As always, my mentor. Company dismiss.

 33 INT. ENTERPRISE ENGINE ROOM - LOOKING DOWN 33 
                   The inspection party dwarfed by the size. Silence as
                   Kirk looks around, runs a finger for dust, etc.
                   Scotty, his team and Preston, stand at attention.

                   FEATURING power room separated by glass from the rest
                   of the facilities. Bones, Sulu, Uhura, and some train-
                   ees watch as Kirk inspects one console, clearly the
                   responsibility of the bursting Midshipman Preston.

 PRESTON                                       (blurting)
                             I believe you'll find everything
                             shipshape, Admiral.

 KIRK                                      (sternly puts
                                      him on)
                             Oh do you? Have you any idea,
                             Midshipman Preston, how many times
                             I've had to listen to Mr. Scott on
                             the Comm, telling me his troubles?
                             Have you any idea the ribbing I've
                             had to endure in the officers' mess
                             to the effect that the Enterprise
                             is a flying death trap?

 PRESTON                                      (scandalized)
                             Oh, no, sir! This is the finest
                             engine room in the whole Star --

                   The repressed grins of the others, and a smile on Scotty's
                   face tell Preston he's being had. He stops, confused.

 PRESTON                                      (continuing)
                             If the Admiral can't see the facts
                             for himself, then, with all due
                             respect, he's as blind as a Tiberion
                             bat. SIR.

                   Approving laughter. Kirk looks amused.

 KIRK                              Midshipman, you're a tiger.

 SCOTTY                              My sister's youngest, Admiral.
                             Crazy to get to space.

 KIRK                              Every young boy's fancy. I seem
                             to remember it myself.
                                     (brisk)
                             Very well. Mr. Scott, are your
                             engines capable of handling a minor
                             training cruise?

 SCOTTY                              Give the word, Admiral.

 KIRK                              Mr. Scott, the word is given.

 SCOTTY                              Aye, sir.

                   He moves off, followed by Preston, who gives one last
                   salute as Kirk leaves, followed by Bones.

 BONES                                      (dry)
                             What about the rest of the
                             inspection, Admiral?

 KIRK                              The inspection will continue once
                             we're underway, Doctor.

                   They step into the Turbo Lifts.

 SULU                              Admiral on the bridge!

 SPOCK                              Very well, Mr. Saavik, clear all
                             moorings.

 SAAVIK                              Aye, sir.

                   Saavik punches data into her console.

 36 EXT. SPACE DOCK AND ENTERPRISE (FEATURE STOCK) 36 
                   The dock slowly folds away from the ship.

 37 INT. BRIDGE, ENTERPRISE 37 
                   Saavik watches instruments, punches data in response.

 SAAVIK                              All moorings are clear, Captain.

 SPOCK                              Thank you, Mr. Saavik.

                   Spock casts a glance at Kirk, then, to Saavik:

 SPOCK                                      (continuing)
                             Lieutenant, how many times have you
                             piloted a Starship out of Spacedock?

 SAAVIK                              Never, sir.

                   Kirk tries to conceal his reaction. Spock enjoys it.

 SPOCK                              Take her out, Mr. Saavik.

 SAAVIK                              Aye, sir.

                   Saavik settles herself in the chair, looks again at
                   the console -- Spock looks at Kirk.

 SPOCK                              There's a first time for everything,
                             Admiral.

 KIRK                                      (casual)
                             To be sure, Captain.

                   They all stifle their responses. Kirk is like a father
                   watching his kid drive the family car for the first time.

 SAAVIK                              Aft thrusters, Mr. Sulu.

 SULU                              Aft thrusters, sir.

                   Activity hums.

 SAAVIK                              Ahead one quarter impulse power.

                   Kirk starts to say something, but doesn't. Bones looks
                   at him.

 BONES                                      (sotto voice)
                             Would you like a tranquilizer?

                   Kirk shakes his head, takes a breath --

 SULU                              Ahead one quarter impulse power.

 41 EXT. SPACE DOCK ENTERPRISE (FEATURE STOCK) 41 
                   The ship clears the dock and begins heading into space.

 42 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 42 
                   Kirk quietly lets his breath out.

 SULU                              We are clear and free to navigate.

 SAAVIK                              Course heading, Captain?

                   Spock turns inquiringly to Kirk.

 KIRK                              Captain's discretion.

                   Spock digests this with a slight smile.

 SPOCK                              Mr. Sulu, you may follow your nose.

                   close enough for us to read her markings.

 45 INT. RELIANT BRIDGE 45 
                   Khan occupies the Captain's chair. We PULL BACK: the
                   crew of the RELIANT has been replaced by Khan's fol-
                   lowers in their odd-looking clothes.

                   At the helm is Joachim, Khan's lieutenant. He is in the
                   largest and brightest of Khan's group. Terrell sits in
                   the First Officer's chair, Chekov at the Comm Console.
                   Their behavior is normal, save for subtle hesitation,
                   symptoms of their mind-controlled state.

 JOACHIM                              Steady on course. All systems normal.

 KHAN                              It's not much different from
                             Enterprise.
                                     (beat)
                             When I was a guest aboard her some
                             years ago, Captain Kirk kindly allowed
                             me to memorize her technical manuals.
                             And now, Mr. Chekov, let us review:
                             You say you have no details of
                             Project 'Genesis' ?

 CHEKOV                              Beyond what I told you, sir, it is
                             classified information.

 KHAN                              Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have
                             access to such information?

 CHEKOV                              I would think so, sir. He's on the
                             Fleet General Staff.

 KHAN                              Then to whom do you report directly
                             regarding Genesis?

 CHEKOV                              To Doctor Marcus, the civilian
                             director of the experiments on Space
                             Laboratory Regula I.

 KHAN                                      (thinks)
                             I see. Helmsman?

 HELMSMAN                              Aye, sir.

 JOACHIM                              May I speak? We're all with you,
                             sir, but consider: we are free,
                             we have a ship and the means to
                             go where we will. We have
                             escaped permanent exile on Ceti
                             Alpha V. You have proved your
                             superior intellect and defeated
                             the plans of Admiral Kirk.
                             You do not need to defeat him
                             again.

 KHAN                              He tasks me -- and I'll have him. I'll
                             chase him round the moons of Nibia
                             and round the Antares maelstrom and
                             round perdition's flames before I give
                             him up.
                                     (as no one speaks)
                             Prepare to alter course -- for Space

 47 INT. CAROL'S LAB 47 
                   Huge and busy. Among the scientists going about their
                   tasks are JEDDA, a Deltan; MARCH, thin intense;
                   MADISON, black, easy going. They are all young and
                   earnest. Carol and David huddle over a computer
                   console.

 DAVID                              Does that about do it?

 CAROL                              I don't think there's another piece
                             of information we could squeeze
                             into the memory banks. Next
                             time, we'll design a bigger
                             one.

 DAVID                              Who --

                   Jedda at the Comm Console overlaps.

 JEDDA                              Comm-Pic coming in on hyperchannel
                             ... It's Reliant.

                   Carol moves forward as the others close in.

 CAROL                              On the screen, please, Jedda.

                   Buttons punched; the screen ebbs, flows and crackles
                   on. ON SCREEN is CHEKOV.

 CHEKOV                              ... come in, please. This is Reliant
                             calling Regula I. Repeat. This is
                             USS Reliant --

 CAROL                              Commander, we are receiving. This
                             is Regula I. Go ahead.

 CHEKOV                              Dr. Marcus... good. We're en route
                             to you and should be there in three
                             days.

 CAROL                              En route? Why? We weren't expecting
                             you for another three months. Has
                             something happened?
                                     (pause)
                             Has something happened? Do you read 
                             us?

 CHEKOV                                      (fractional pause)
                             All went well. Nothing has happened.
                             Ceti Alpha VI has checked out.

                   Pleased reaction from the scientists.

 CAROL                              I still don't under --

 CHEKOV                              We have received new orders. Upon our
                             arrival at Regula I, all materials of
                             Project Genesis will be transferred to
                             this ship for immediate testing at
                             Ceti Alpha VI.

                   Consternation in the lab. David is livid -- the words
                   "Bullshit" are overlapped  by his mother.

 CAROL                              Will you please be quiet!
                                     (back to console)
                             Commander Chekov, this is completely
                             irregular. Who gave the order you
                             are quoting? Who gave the order?

 CHEKOV                                      (still smiling)
                             The order comes from Starfleet
                             command, Dr. Marcus, direct from
                             the General Staff.

 CAROL                              But Genesis is a civilian project,
                             under my control --

 CHEKOV                              I have my orders.

 DAVID                              Pin him down, mother! Who gave the
                             orders!?

                   Chekov hesitates, seems to be listening to someone off
                   the monitor.

 CHEKOV                              The orders come from Admiral James
                             T. Kirk.

                   Sensation in the lab.

 DAVID                              I knew it! I knew it! All along
                             the military has wanted to get their
                             hands on this --

                   He starts to press a button; Carol pushes his hand
                   away and communicates herself.

 CAROL                              This is completely improper,
                             Commander Chekov. I have no
                             intention of allowing Reliant or
                             any other unauthorized personnel
                             access to our work or materials.

 CHEKOV                                      (pauses; listens)
                             I'm sorry you feel that way, Doctor.
                             Admiral Kirk's orders are confirmed.
                             Please prepare to deliver Genesis to
                             us upon our arrival. Reliant out.

                   The image fades.

 CAROL                              Commander Chekov -- !

                   Chekov, in a matched cut, turns away as CAMERA WIDENS
                   TO REVEAL KHAN by his side. He is charming.

 KHAN                              Well done, Commander.

 CHEKOV                              You realize, sir, that they will
                             attempt to contact Admiral Kirk and
                             confirm the order.

                   Khan smiles, more charming than ever as we move in.

 49 INT. REGULA I LAB 49 
                   Everyone is talking at once.

 CAROL                              Will you please be quiet! We must
                             have order here.
                                     (as they subside)
                             This has to be some sort of mistake.

 DAVID                              Mistake? We're all alone here.
                             They waited until everyone was on
                             shift-leave to do this. Reliant is
                             supposed to be at our disposal, not
                             vice-versa.

 MADISON                              It seems clear that Starfleet never
                             intended that --

 CAROL                              I know, but --

 DAVID                              I've tried to warn you. Scientists
                             are always pawns of the military --

 CAROL                                      (angry)
                             Starfleet has kept the peace for
                             a hundred years, I cannot and
                             will not subscribe to your 
                             interpretation of this event.

                   Silence.

 JEDDA                                      (Deltan cool)
                             You may be right, Doctor, but what
                             about Reliant? She's on her way.

                   Carol reacts: this is certainly true.

 CAROL                              Get your gear together where it's
                             handy.

 MARCH                              Where are we going? 

 CAROL                              That's for us to know and Reliant
                             to find out. We have only three
                             days. Let's not waste time.

                   They split off in different directions as ordered.

                   In no particular hurry.

 52 INT. ENTERPRISE CORRIDOR 52 
                   Kirk waits for the Turbo Lift, which opens at last. As
                   he gets in --

 SAAVIK'S VOICE                              Hold please -- !

                   Kirk holds and Saavik dashes in. She is surprised to
                   see him.

 SAAVIK                                      (continuing)
                             Thank you, sir.

                   Kirk nods, the doors close. There is an uneasy forced
                   intimacy between them.

 KIRK                              Lieutenant, are you wearing your
                             hair differently?

 SAAVIK                              It is still regulation, Admiral.

                   She reaches out and touches a button. The lift stops.

 SAAVIK                                      (continuing)
                             May I speak, sir?

 KIRK                              Lieutenant, self-expression does not
                             seem to be one of your problems.

 SAAVIK                              I wish to thank you for the high 
                             efficiency rating.

 KIRK                              You earned it.

 SAAVIK                              I did not think so.

 KIRK                              You're bothered by your performance
                             on the Kobayashi Maru.

 SAAVIK                              I failed to resolve the situation.

 KIRK                              There is no correct resolution.
                             It is a test of character.

 SAAVIK                              May I ask how you dealt with the
                             test?

 KIRK                                      (amused)
                             You may ask, Lieutenant.

                   She stares.

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             That was a little joke.

 SAAVIK                              Humor... that is a difficult concept
                             ... it is not logical...

 KIRK                              We learn by doing, Lieutenant.

                   She's a laugh a minute. Kirk pushes the button; the
                   elevator starts.

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             You want my advice?

                   She studies him, considering. No doubt about it, the
                   attraction is mutual and she has no idea how to handle
                   it.

 SAAVIK                              Yes.

 KIRK                              Take the test again.

                   The lift stops and the doors open.

 BONES                              Who's been holding up the damn
                             elevator?

                   He reacts to them. Saavik exits demurely.

 SAAVIK                              Thank you, sir.

                   Bones enters and the doors close. Kirk studies the
                   ceiling.

 BONES                              Has she changed her hairstyle?

                   Kirk says nothing.

 BONES                                      (finally)
                             Wonderful stuff, that Romulan
                             ale --

 UHURA'S VOICE                              Admiral Kirk --

 KIRK                              Kirk here.

 UHURA'S VOICE                              I have an urgent CommPic from Space
                             Lab Regula I for the Admiral. Dr.
                             Carol Marcus.

 KIRK                              In my quarters, Uhura.

 UHURA'S VOICE                              Yes, sir.

                   Awkward silence.

 BONES                              It never rains but when it pours --

 KIRK                              As a physician you of all people
                             should appreciate the danger of
                             re-opening old wounds.

                   The elevator stops. Kirk leaves. The doors close.

 BONES                                      (annoyed with
                                      himself)
                             Sorry.

 53 INT. KIRK'S QUARTERS 53 
                   Featuring VIEW SCREEN: A scramble of interference and
                   noise. A piece of Carol's VOICE breaks through now
                   and again as we PULL BACK revealing a frustrated Kirk.

 KIRK                              Uhura. Can't you augment?

 UHURA                              I'm trying, sir. Stand by...

                   Carol's face appears. The image will never be stable
                   for long; sometimes the sound will be covered.

 CAROL                              Jim... read me? Can you read me?

 KIRK                              Message breaking up, Carol. What's
                             wrong? What's wrong?

 CAROL                              ... Can't read you... repeat...

 KIRK                              Repeat... what's wrong? What's
                             wrong?

 CAROL                              ... taking Genesis away from us...

 KIRK                              Taking Genesis? Who? Who is taking
                             Genesis?

 CAROL                              ... see you but can't hear. Did
                             you... order...?

 KIRK                              What order? Who's taking Genesis?

 CAROL                              ... Please help us, Jim... won't
                             let them have... without proper...
                             repeat... on whose authority...

 KIRK                              Carol!

 CAROL                              Jim please --

                   But the picture is irrevocably scrambled now. Kirk
                   pounds the Comm in frustration.

 KIRK                              Uhura! What's happening? Damn
                             it...

 UHURA'S VOICE                              Transmission jammed at the source,
                             sir.

 KIRK                              Damn. Alert Starfleet Headquarters.
                             I want to talk with Starfleet

                   The activity is normal. The Turbo-Lift opens and Kirk
                   strides in. Bones and Saavik react to the following:

 KIRK                              Stop engines.

 SULU                              Stop engines.

                   They look wonderingly. Kirk takes a breath --

 KIRK                              An emergency situation has arisen.
                             By order of Starfleet Command, as
                             of now, 1800 hours, I am assuming
                             command of this vessel. Duty officer
                             so note in the ship's log. Plot a

                             Mr. Scott?

 SCOTTY'S VOICE                              Aye, sir.

 KIRK                              We'll be going to warp speed --

 SCOTTY'S VOICE                              Aye, sir --

 KIRK                              Engage warp engines --

 SAAVIK                                      (comes out of being
                                      stunned)
                             Prepare for warp speed.

 SULU                              Ready, sir.

 KIRK                              Mr. Sulu, go to Warp 5.

                   Sulu does, and with a great thrust of energy --

 57 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (FEATURE STOCK) 57 
                   The ship accelerates, and then, with an eye-filled
                   burst, whips ahead to warp speed, disappearing.

 57A INT. SPOCK'S QUARTERS 57A 
                   Spock is at meditation as Kirk enters quietly. Spock
                   looks up.

 KIRK                              We've got a problem.

                   Spock raises an eyebrow --

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Something may be wrong at Regula
                             I. We've been ordered to investigate.

 SPOCK                              Regula I is a scientific research
                             laboratory, if memory serves...

 KIRK                              I told Starfleet all we had was a
                             boatload of children but we're the
                             only ship in the quadrant. Spock:
                             those cadets of yours -- how good
                             are they? How will they respond
                             under real pressure?

 SPOCK                              Like all living beings, Admiral
                             each according to his gifts. The
                             ship is yours.

 KIRK                              That won't be necessary: just take
                             me to Regula I.

 SPOCK                              Excuse my presumption, but I do not
                             agree. As a teacher on a training
                             mission, I am content to command a
                             Starship. If we are to go on actual
                             duty, it is clear that the senior
                             officer aboard must assume command.

 KIRK                              But it may be nothing; garbled
                             communications. Why don't you...

 SPOCK                              You proceed from a false assumption.
                             I am a Vulcan. I have no ego to bruise.

                   Kirk smiles in bemused wonderment.

 KIRK                              You are going to remind me that
                             logic alone dictates your actions.

 SPOCK                              I was going to remind you of nothing,
                             least of all that which you know well.
                                     (pause)
                             Your mistake, if I may be so bold,
                             was promotion. Commanding a Starship
                             is your first best destiny. Anything
                             else is a waste of material.

 KIRK                              I would not presume to debate you.

 SPOCK                              That is wise. In any case, were I
                             to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates
                             that the needs of the many outweigh
                             the needs of the few.

 KIRK                              Or the one.

                   Spock inclines his head.

 SPOCK                              You are my superior officer. You
                             are also my friend. I have been
                             and always shall be yours.

                   Kirk is moved. He starts to speak, can't -- finally:

 KIRK                              Will you accompany me to the bridge?

 SPOCK                              I'd best talk with Mr. Scott, first
                             so that he may, in his own words,
                             explain the situation to his cadets.

                   Kirk's face tells us the wisdom of Spock's choice.

 58 EXT. SPACE STATION REGULA I 58 
                   Floating quietly around the planet below. Tranquil

                   OVER we can hear, FILTERED, UHURA'S VOICE:

 UHURA'S VOICE                              Regula I, this is Enterprise. This

                             receive... I say...

 59 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 59 
                   Featuring Spock and Uhura, as she keeps trying --

 UHURA                              ... Again, this is Enterprise calling
                             Space Lab Regula I. Come in, please.
                             Dr. Marcus. Please respond, please
                             -- it's no use; no response from
                             Regula I.

 SPOCK                              But no longer jammed?

 UHURA                              No, sir. No nothing.

                   Spock considers, moves to Kirk.

 SPOCK                              There are two possibilities, sir
                             they are unwilling to respond, they
                             are unable to respond.

 KIRK                              How far?

 SPOCK                              Twelve hours and forty-three
                             minutes, present speed.

 KIRK                              Give up Genesis, she said. What in
                             God's name does that mean? Give it
                             up to whom?

 SPOCK                              It might help my analysis if I knew

                   Kirk looks at him, nods; rising now.

 KIRK                              Uhura, ask Dr. McCoy to join us in

                             Genesis is a procedure whereby
                             the molecular structure of any
                             given matter can be restructured

                             to become clear.
                             This concludes this demonstration
                             tape. Thank you for your attention.
                             The Genesis team eagerly awaits the

                             the next phase of our work.

                   The tape becomes snowy and blinks off.

                   Kirk looks at Bones and Spock -- they are stunned.

 SPOCK                              It literally is Genesis...

 KIRK                              The power of creation --

 SPOCK                              Have they proceeded with their
                             experiments?

 KIRK                              The tape was made a year ago. I
                             can only assume they've reached
                             Phase Two by now --

 BONES                              But dear Lord, are we intelligent
                             enough to -- Suppose, this
                             thing were used where life already
                             exists?

 SPOCK                              It would destroy such life in favor
                             of its new matrix --

 BONES                              It's new -- have you any idea what
                             you're saying?

 SPOCK                              I was not attempting to evaluate
                             its moral implications, Doctor.
                             As a matter of cosmic history, it
                             has always been easier to destroy
                             than to create --

 BONES                              Not anymore! Now you can do both
                             at the same time! According to myth,
                             the earth was created in six days.
                             Watch out: here comes Genesis;
                             we'll do it for you in six minutes --

                             are the right hands, my cold-blooded
                             friend? Are you in favor of these

 KIRK                              Gentlemen, this isn't --

 SPOCK                              Really, Dr. McCoy; you cannot ban
                             the acquisition of knowledge
                             because you distrust the moral

 SCOTTY                              Respirators! Get back! Use your
                             respirators!

                   And he puts his own respirator on, as do some of the
                   veterans. Preston dons his respirator -- and stays.

 81 HIGH ANGLE - ENGINE ROOM 81 
                   The angle we saw during inspection. The trainees, in
                   panic amid the gas crawl over each other trying to get
                   out. They scramble over each other's shoulders in the
                   efforts to escape, screaming and shouting.

 82 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 82 
                   The bridge is slowly righting. Crew members getting
                   back to their stations. On speaker, we hear the CRIES
                   AND SHOUTS of the Engine Room.

 KIRK                              Mr. Sulu... The shields!

 SULU                              Trying, sir!

 INTERCOM VOICE                              Medical Alert: Engine Room.

                   Bones dashes out.

 SULU                              I can't get power, sir!

 KIRK                              Scotty!

                   Scotty's voice is faint, drowned by the screams and
                   cries from a dozen intercom stations.

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Uhura, turn off those damn 
                             channels!!

                   Uhura does. There is a dead silence. Then:

 UHURA                              Mr. Scott on discrete.

 KIRK                              Scotty, let's have it.

                   Behind, the crew chief and a few others work feverishly
                   in respirators. Scotty, in respirator, with a throat
                   mike which filters his voice.

 SCOTTY                              Just hanging on, sir. Main energizers
                             out.

                   the display.

 SPOCK                              They knew just where to hit us.

 KIRK                              WHO? Who knew just where to hit
                             us? And why?

 SPOCK                                      (shakes head)
                             One thing is certain; we cannot
                             escape on auxiliary power.

                             Mr. Sulu, divert everything to the

 KIRK                              Hang on!

                   The bridge is shaken badly, screens go dark, fires spark
                   and erupt. ALARMS and SOUND full. Crew personnel try
                   to put out electrical fires, help the fallen --

                   The firefighting continues.

 KIRK                              Scotty -- what's left?

 SCOTTY'S VOICE                              Just the batteries, sir. I can have
                             auxiliary power in a few minutes --

 KIRK                              We don't have minutes. Can you
                             give me phaser power?

 SCOTTY'S VOICE                              A few shots, sir.

 SPOCK                              Not enough against their shields.

 KIRK                              Who the hell are they?

 UHURA                              Admiral... Commander Reliant is
                             signaling.

                             He wishes to discuss terms of our
                             surrender.

                   There is a moment. Kirk looks around the battered
                   bridge, and his eyes meet Spock's, and Saavik's.

 KIRK                              On screen.

 UHURA                                      (hesitating)
                             Admiral --

 KIRK                              Do it, while we have time.

                   All eyes go to the SCREEN. After momentary visual
                   confusion, Khan's face appears, smiling --

 KIRK                                      (continuing; dumbfounded)
                             Khan!

 SAAVIK                              Who?

 KHAN                              You still remember, Admiral. I
                             cannot help but be touched. Of
                             course, I remember you.

 KIRK                              What is the meaning of this attack?
                             Where is the crew of the Reliant?

 KHAN                              Surely I have made my meaning plain.
                             I mean to avenge myself upon you,
                             Admiral. I've deprived your ship of
                             power and when I swing round I mean
                             to deprive you of your life --

                             -- But I wanted you to know first
                             who it was who had beaten you: I,
                             Khan Noonian Singh, the eagle you
                             attempted to cage forever.

 KIRK                              Khan, listen to me -- if its me you
                             want, I'll have myself beamed aboard.
                             All I ask is that you spare my crew.

 KHAN                              That is a most intriguing offer.
                             Typical, I must say of your sterling
                             character. Let me think.

                             agree to your terms, if in addition
                             to yourself, you turn over to me all
                             data and material regarding the
                             project called Genesis.

                   Reactions from Spock and Kirk.

 KIRK                              Genesis, what's that?

 KHAN                              Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is
                             on the phaser control --

 KIRK                              Give me some time to recall the data
                             on our computers --

 KHAN                              I give you sixty seconds, Admiral.

                   Kirk turns from the screen --

 SPOCK                              Admiral, you can't give him Genesis...

 KIRK                              At least we know he hasn't got it.
                             Just keep nodding as though I'm
                             giving orders. Saavik, punch up the

                             console -- hurry...

                             give us time -- the bridge is
                             smashed, computers inoperative...

 KHAN                              Time is a luxury you do not have,

                             Wait for my signal, Spock -- too
                             soon and he'll have time to figure
                             it out and raise them again.

                   Spock nods; Kirk turns to the screen --

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Khan, how do I know you'll keep
                             your word?

 KHAN                                      (on screen)
                             I've given you no word to keep,
                             Admiral. In my judgment, you simply
                             have no alternative.

 KIRK                              I take your point. Stand by to
                             receive our transmission.

                   He turns from the screen again, softly:

                             right on quoting regulations.
                             Meantime, let's find out what the
                             hell is going on and see how bad
                             we've been --

                   The turbo doors whoosh open as Kirk reaches them.
                   Scotty stands there, tears streaming down his face;
                   he holds the body of Midshipman Preston. Both of them
                   are covered in blood. He sways into Kirk's arms as
                   the others rush forward.

 103 EXT. SPACE 103 
                   The Enterprise, motionless, scars of battle showing.

 104 INT. ENGINE ROOM 104 
                   The CREW, wearing respirators amid the motionless ball
                   of gas, work frantically at a dozen jobs, trying to put
                   things aright, splicing wires, etc. Some TRAINEES who
                   panicked are back.

 105 FEATURE THE CREW CHIEF 105 
                   making a final adjustment.

 CREW CHIEF                              Hit your blowers!

                   A TURBO WHINES and a great wind of suction pulls the
                   gas towards appropriate vents. The Crew Chief watches,
                   then yanks off his respirator; wipes his brow.

 106 INT. SICK BAY 106 
                   MANY CASUALTIES IN EVIDENCE. Kirk enters and LEADS
                   CAMERA THROUGH them; he has a word or two for men he
                   doesn't know by name. Kirk leads us to the operating
                   theatre, where Bones works over Preston. Scotty stands
                   by, his lips trembling. Preston opens his eyes, sees
                   Scotty and Kirk.

 PRESTON                                      (faint)
                             Is the word given?

 KIRK                                      (soft)
                             The word is given: warp speed.

 PRESTON                                      (almost smiles)
                             Aye...

                   He dies. Pause. Scotty looks across the body at Kirk.

 SCOTTY WHY? 
 KIRK                                      (looks at Preston)
                             He wants to kill me for passing
                             sentence on him 14 years ago -- and
                             he doesn't care who stands between
                             him and his vengeance.

 BONES                              Scotty, I'm sorry...

 SCOTTY                              He stayed at his post. When the
                             trainees ran, he stayed.

 KIRK                              If he hadn't, we'd be space by now.

 SPOCK'S VOICE                              Admiral, this is Spock.

                   Kirk hits a wall intercom --

 KIRK                              Yes, Spock.

 SPOCK'S VOICE                              Engine room reports auxiliary power
                             restored. We can proceed at impulse
                             power.

 KIRK                                      (thinks)
                             Best speed to Regula I. Kirk
                             out. Scotty, I've got to ask: Any
                             chance of getting the mains back on
                             the line?

 SCOTTY                              I dinna think so, sir, but you'll
                             have my best --

                   With an effort, he gets to his feet --

 SCOTTY                                      (continuing)
                             Thanks -- I know you tried, Doctor...

                   Squeezes his shoulder and limps off -- We NOW HEAR
                   the sound of impulse power taking effect.

 KIRK                              Are you all right?

                   Bones shrugs unhappily, looks at Preston.

 BONES                              Doctors lose patients sometimes.
                             Damn. I'm still in the dark: How'd
                             he know about Genesis?

 KIRK                              At the moment that question takes
                             a back seat to preventing him from
                             laying his hands on it. You said it
                             yourself; we're talking about a bang
                             that would re-arrange the universe...

 BONES                              There may still be time... you gave
                             as good as you got.

 KIRK                                      (looks him in the eye)
                             I got beat. We're only alive because
                             I knew something about these ships
                             that he didn't.

                   He turns and leaves as Bones watches, looks again at
                   Preston.

 107 EXT. SPACE - REGULA I SPACE STATION 107 
                   Regula, the dead planet beyond.

 108 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE 108 
                   Approaching. As she moves slowly PAST CAMERA, WE PAN
                   WITH her TO SEE that she is approaching the space lab.

 109 INT. BRIDGE - ENTERPRISE 109 
                   Battle damage, some repaired, some not. The bridge is
                   filled with tension, all hands at station.

 SULU (V.O.)                              Approaching Regula and Space Lab
                             Regula I.

 KIRK                              Try again.

 UHURA                              Space Station Regular I, this is
                             Starship Enterprise. Come in, please...

 110 INT. SPACE STATION REGULAR I - CAROL'S LAB - ON SCREEN 110 
                   As before, Uhura's image, imploring a response.

 UHURA                              I say again. Space Station Regular.
                             This is Starship Enterprise. Please
                             respond. Please respond.

                   During this, CAMERA HAS PANNED CLOSE AMONG the techni-
                   cal clutter. Then suddenly. SOUND -- eerie, frightening.
                   Our ears cannot place it... and before we can, it is gone
                   a warning.

 111 BACK TO BRIDGE 111 
 UHURA                              ... No response, sir.

 KIRK                              Sensors, Captain?

 SPOCK                              Scanners and sensors still inoperative.
                             There's no way to tell what's  inside
                             the station.

 KIRK                              And no way of knowing if Reliant
                             is still in the area...

 SPOCK                              Affirmative, Admiral.

 KIRK                                      (with irony)
                             ... Blind as a Tiberian Bat.
                             What do you make of the plantoid
                             beyond?

 SPOCK                              Regula is class "D'. It consists of
                             various remarkable ores. Essentially,
                             a great rock in space.

 KIRK                              Reliant could be hiding behind that rock.

 SPOCK                              A distinct possibility.

 KIRK                              Engine room... Scotty, do we have
                             enough power for the transporters?

 SCOTTY'S VOICE                              Just barely, sir.

 KIRK                                      (the decision)
                             I'm going down to the station.

                   He starts out. Bones stops him.

 BONES                              Khan could be down there!

 KIRK                              He's BEEN there and hasn't found
                             what he wants. Can you spare
                             someone? There may be people
                             hurt.

 BONES                              I can spare me...

 SAAVIK                              Begging the Admiral's pardon:
                             General Order 15: 'No  flag officer
                             shall beam into a hazardous area
                             without armed escort.'

 KIRK                              There is no such regulation.

                   Saavik's gaze falters --

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             All right, join the party.
                             Mr. Spock, the ship is yours.

 SPOCK                              Aye sir --

 KIRK                              Establish a parking orbit around
                             the station and send me a complete
                             damage report when you've talked
                             with Mr. Scott.

 SPOCK                              Be careful, Jim...

                   Kirk, Bones and Saavik head for the turbo doors.

 112 EXT. SPACE - SPACE STATION REGULAR I 112 
                   CLOSER ANGLE now. The silence is ominous.

 113 INT. SPACE STATION REGULAR I - CAROL'S LAB 113 
                   empty, except for the hums and crackles of abandoned
                   equipment. With a FAMILIAR SOUND, BONES, KIRK and
                   SAAVIK MATERIALIZE. All have phasers, communicators
                   and tricorders.

                   For a moment they look around, seeing emptiness. Like
                   being in a haunted house.

 KIRK                              Hello...! Anybody here?

                   A WEIRD ECHO reverberates his cries.

 SAAVIK                                      (raises tricorder)
                             Indeterminate life signs.

 KIRK                              Phasers on stun. Move out.

                   They separate. Each begins to search.

 114 ANGLE WITH SAAVIK 114 
                   She moves to the electronic and data area, examines the
                   consoles, the equipment, then settles for the data bank.
                   She starts keying sequences with the computer.

 115 INT. SPACE STATION - BONES 115 
                   He shows signs of fear as he walks through the deserted
                   place, like a scuba diver exploring a cave. We want
                   him to go back.

                   A NOISE. Bones reacts with brave apprehension.

                   Rounding a corner, he starts: A RAT scuttles right in
                   front of him.

                   Bones sighs with relief and moves forward. We think
                   he's safe.

                   SUDDENLY SOMETHING FALLS RIGHT ON HIS FACE: an upside
                   down human ARM.

 116 SAME LOCALE - LATER 116 
                   Kirk helps Bones cut down the last of the five BODIES
                   from where they were hanged, upside down.

                   Having recovered his composure, Bones examines the
                   corpses. We RECOGNIZE Madison, March, among others.

                   One is clearly the COOK.

 KIRK                                      (stunned)
                             They even killed the galley chief.

 BONES                              This one looks like a Steward.
                             They're not warm, but rigor hasn't
                             set in. This didn't happen all that
                             long ago, Jim.

                   Kirk looks around, despairingly --

 KIRK                              Carol...

 117 INT. SPACE LAB DATA BANK 117 
                   WITH SAAVIK working with console. Something puzzles
                   her. She frowns, but a NEW SOUND distracts her. She
                   looks up and moves off.

 118 FULL SHOT - IN THE LAB 118 
                   A moan is heard. All three now converge on the area.
                   As they near it, Saavik's tricorder hums furiously. Be
                   this a room, a locker of some other place, this time
                   they -- "open the door." The limp bodies of Chekov and
                   Terrell fall out.

 UHURA'S VOICE                                      (on screen)
                             Admiral Kirk, Enterprise. Come in,
                             please. Come in please.

                   She will continue sporadically.

 KIRK                              My God!

                   Chekov emits a live, reassuring moan.

 BONES                              That's Clark Terrell, Jim, I've
                             served with him.

                   Bones is passing his medical tricorder over Chekov.

 BONES                                      (continuing)
                             Brain disturbance. Appears to be
                             drug induced.

                   He reaches into his kit. He shoots Chekov moves off
                   to Terrell. Uhura, voice continues in the b.g.

 KIRK                              Saavik, for God's sake, tell her
                             we're all right.

                   Saavik's face appears on her screen.

                   He weeps like a child, and Kirk holds him. Meanwhile,
                   Terrell opens his eyes and stares at Bones.

 BONES                              It's Dr. McCoy, Captain. Do you
                             remember me?

                   Chekov breaks the embrace in high relief and anxiety.

 CHEKOV                              Oh, sir. It was Khan! We found him
                             on Ceti Alpha V.

 KIRK                              Easy, Pavel... Tell me what you
                             can...

 CHEKOV                              No life signs -- but he was there.
                             Captured us. He -- he put creatures
                             in our bodies. To control our minds.

                   Bones takes over Chekov --

 BONES                              It's all right, you're safe...

 CHEKOV                              ... Made us say -- lies... Do...
                             things... But we beat him... The
                             Captain and me. -- He thought he
                             controlled us, but he didn't ...
                             The Captain was strong.

                   Chekov breaks into tears. Kirk looks at Terrell, who is
                   more composed.

 KIRK                              Captain. Where is Dr. Marcus?
                             Where are the Genesis materials?

 TERRELL                              He couldn't find them. Some of
                             the scientists were still here,
                             but everything else, even the data
                             banks -- were empty.

 SAAVIK                              That's true, Admiral. All the
                             memory cells have been emptied.

 KIRK                                      (ponders)
                             Erased...

 TERRELL                              He tortured those people. None of
                             them would tell him anything. He
                             went wild, strung them up and slit
                             their throats. He wanted to tear
                             the place apart, but he was late:
                             he had to get back to Reliant in
                             time to blow you to bits.

 KIRK                              He came damn close...

 CHEKOV                              He left us.
                                     (with irony)
                             We were no longer of use.
 SAAVIK                              Where is  the Reliant crew? Dead?

 TERRELL                              Marooned on Ceti Alpha V. He's
                             completely mad, Admiral. He blames
                             you for the death of his wife...

 KIRK                              I know what he blames me for.
                                     (thinks)
                             The escape pods are all in place.
                                     (looks around)
                             Where's the transporter room?

 122 INT. SPACE STATION TRANSPORTER ROOM 122 
                   Kirk, wearing his spectacles, studies the transporter
                   consoles. ANGLE WIDENS TO REVEAL the transporter pods,
                   and the others, b.g.

 KIRK                              Did he make it down here?

                   Chekov and Terrell look at each other; they seem a bit
                   stronger.

 CHEKOV                              It was not my impression. He spent
                             most of his time trying to wring the
                             information out of the people.

                   Saavik approaches Kirk:

 SAAVIK                              Anything?

                   Kirk looks at her over the rims of the glasses:

 KIRK                              Somebody left the unit on. If
                             everyone else was dead, it implies
                             that no one remained to turn it off.
                             Those people back there bought escape
                             time for Genesis with their lives.

                   Saavik studies the console.

 SAAVIK                              It doesn't make sense. These
                             coordinates are well within
                             Regula -- a plantoid we know to be
                             lifeless and airless.

 KIRK                                      (wheels turn)
                             If Stage Two was completed, it was
                             underground -- she said it was going
                             to be underground.

 SAAVIK                              Stage Two of what?

                   Kirk gets it.

 KIRK                                      (on communicator)
                             Kirk to Enterprise. Damage report,
                             Spock?

 SPOCK'S VOICE                              Admiral, if we go by the book, like
                             Lieutenant Saavik, hours could seem
                             like days.

 KIRK                                      (beat)
                             I read you, Captain. Let's have it.

                   Fractional pause.

 SPOCK'S VOICE                              The situation is grave, Admiral. We
                             won't have main power for six days
                             at least. Auxiliary power has
                             temporarily failed, but maybe we can
                             restore that in two days. By the
                             book, Admiral.

                   Kirk frowns.

 KIRK                              Meaning you can't even beam us back?

 SPOCK'S VOICE                              Not at present.

                   Kirk looks at Saavik and Bones, decides --

 KIRK                              Captain Spock, if you do not hear
                             from us within one hour your orders
                             are to restore what power you can,
                             take the Enterprise to the nearest
                             Star Base and alert Starfleet
                             command when you are out of jamming
                             range.

 UHURA'S VOICE                              Sir -- we won't leave you behind...!

 KIRK                              Uhura, if you don't hear from us,
                             there won't be anybody behind. Kirk
                             out.
                                     (to Terrell and Chekov)
                             You gentleman can remain here, or...

 TERRELL                              If it's all the same, Admiral, we'd
                             like to share the risk.

 KIRK                                      (hesitates)
                             Very well. Let's go.

 BONES                              Go? Where are we going?

 KIRK                                      (points to console)
                             Where they went. Saavik.

                   Kirk walks onto the pods as Saavik works the console,
                   rolling in electronic coding. The others join Kirk.

 BONES                              But what if they went -- nowhere?

 KIRK                              Then this will be your big chance
                             to get away from it all.

 SAAVIK                              Ready.

                   She presses a button, joins them on the pods. Slowly
                   they VANISH.

 123 EXT. SPACE - THE PLANTOID REGULA 123 
                   CAMERA MOVES TOWARD it as the BEAM SOUND continues,
                   with irregularity. The plantoid is ugly and dead.
                   The sound frightens us, and climaxes with:

 124 INT. ROCKY CAVERN - REGULA 124 
                   The BEAM SOUND screeches, then settles into its comfort-
                   able mode as the FIVE FIGURES FLUCTUATE, FADE, then
                   APPEAR. They look around in wonder and relief.

 SAAVIK                              Admiral --

                   She indicates something O.S. They cross as CAMERA
                   reveals a cave wall stacked with technical materials
                   and crowned by a LARGE PROJECTILE, a giant version
                   of the model we saw earlier. They stare. (N.B. FEATURE
 GENESIS ARMING CONTROL BOX.) 
 BONES                              Genesis, I presume.

                   They walk by a group of crates. It all happens very
                   fast: David leaps out and tackles Kirk, throwing him to
                   the ground and landing atop him, a knife at his throat.

                   At the same time, Bones and Saavik reach for their
                   phasers, but Jedda, already armed, steps out. He has
                   them covered and helpless.

 125 ANGLE FAVORING DAVID 125 
 DAVID                              You're the sonavabitch who
                             committed mass murder up there.

                   He raises the knife --

 KIRK                              I'm Admiral Kirk...

 DAVID                              We were still there, you dumb
                             bastard! We could hear the screams
                             all the way to the transporter room --

                   Again he raises the knife --

 KIRK                              Where's Dr. Marcus --

 DAVID                              I'm Doctor Marcus!

                   Carol reaches the tunnel entrance to the cave --

 CAROL                              David --

 DAVID                              Mother, go back!

                   Carol sees Kirk --

 CAROL                              Jim --

 DAVID                              Go back. I'm going to kill him.

 CAROL                                      (takes a breath)
                             You do that and you'll have murdered
                             your father.

                   All react. David and Kirk, facing each other, are
                   turned to stone. Bones, Jedda and Chekov turn to look
                   at Carol, wondering. Terrell very casually takes the
                   phaser from Jedda.

 126 NEW ANGLE (FORMERLY SCENE 134) 126 
 TERRELL                                      (cool)
                             I'll hold onto this.

                   But Kirk and Carol ignore them and walk towards each
                   other. There are tears in Carol's eyes. She reaches
                   up, trying to smile and touches his hair --

 CAROL                              You've got a little grey --

                   She can't. Kirk takes her and holds her tightly, look-
                   ing at David, over her shoulder. He stands there,
                   stunned, looking back.

 KIRK                              Carol. Is that true?

                   She nods --

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Why didn't you tell me?

 DAVID                              She's making it up! My father was
                             Professor --

 CAROL                              David, you're just making this
                             harder --

 TERRELL                              I'm afraid it's even harder than you
                             think, Doctor.

                   He and Chekov have their phasers trained on them.

 TERRELL                                      (continuing)
                             Please don't move --

 KIRK                              Chekov -- !

 CHEKOV                              I'm sorry, Admiral.

                   Terrell speaks into his wrist recorder.

 TERRELL                              Your excellency, have you been
                             listening?

 KHAN'S VOICE                                      (filtered)
                             I have indeed, Captain. You have
                             done well...

 DAVID                              I knew it -- !

                   David makes a reckless break for Terrell; Saavik
                   instantly throws herself on him bringing him down as
                   Terrell fires, hitting Jedda, who was behind David --
                   a killing ray. Jedda dematerializes. Carol SCREAMS
                   and David reacts with horror and guilt.

                   Most importantly, Chekov begins to tremble. Terrell
                   himself is shaken by his reflexive action. He's in
                   semi-panic.

 TERRELL                              Don't move -- any of you!

 135 EXT. SPACE - THE DARK SIDE OF REGULA 135 
                   Reliant, motionless in a parking orbit.

 136 INT. RELIANT BRIDGE - FAVORING KHAN 136 
                   Joachim over his shoulder. Others in evidence. Khan
                   speaks into his console.

 KHAN                              Captain... We're waiting. What's
                             the delay?

 137 INT. ROCKY CAVERN (INTERCUT AS DESIRED) 137 
 TERRELL                              All is well, sir. You have the
                             coordinates to beam up Genesis...

 KHAN                              First things first, Captain. Kill
                             Admiral Kirk.

                   Reactions by all -- only Kirk and Bones are unsurprised.
                   David and Saavik, dazed, fight the urge to do something.
                   Chekov is close to a seizure. Terrell fights conflicting
                   mental signals.

 TERRELL                              Excellency... it is difficult.
                             I try to obey, but --

 KHAN'S VOICE                              Kill him.

                   As though tearing off a leach, Terrell grabs at the
                   wrist recorder and flings it to the ground. A shock-
                   wave of pain hits Terrell. He recovers, trembling and
                   tries to obey. Chekov is shaking badly. Terrell aims
                   his phaser at Kirk. Chekov slowly raises his phaser
                   and aims at Terrell, though his hands are like lead.
                   We THINK Chekov is going to do the right thing. Then,
                   shockingly: Terrell turns his phaser on himself.

 KHAN'S VOICE                                      (still emanates from
                                      wrist recorder)
                             Kill him, Terrell. Now.

                   Terrell does, blowing himself into oblivion.

 138 ANGLE - FAVORING CHEKOV 138 
                   He SCREAMS, horribly, drops his phaser, clutching his
                   head.

                   Bones leaps to his side, pulls an injection device from
                   his belt pack, jabs it into Chekov's arm. Chekov,
                   almost with a sigh of relief, drops.

 KHAN'S VOICE                              Terrell? Chekov -- !

 BONES                              Jim -- for God's sake!

                   They rush to his side, as do Carol and David.

 139 ANGLE - FAVORING CHEKOV 139 
                   From the fallen man's ear, something begins to emerge.

 140 VERY CLOSE - CHEKOV'S EAR 140 
                   The Ceti eel crawls out. It has grown quite large.

 141 SCENE 141 
                   Horror from all. Kirk picks up a phaser. As the eel
                   clears Chekov, he fires and destroys it. He shudders,
                   then sees the wrist recorder and grabs it.

 KIRK                              Khan, you bloodsucker, they're
                             finished! You'll have to do your
                             own dirty work now. Do you hear me?
                             Do you?

 142 INT. RELIANT BRIDGE 142 
                   Khan reacts to Kirk's VOICE: electronic shock. He
                   clutches the communicator, his eye-whites rolling.

 KHAN                              Kirk! Kirk, you are still alive --
                             my old friend...

 INTERCUT AS DESIRED WITH 
 143 ROCKY CAVERN - FAVORING KIRK 143 
 KIRK                              Still, 'old friend.' You've
                             managed to kill just about everyone
                             else, but like a poor marksman, you
                             keep missing the target.

 KHAN                                      (ironic)
                             Perhaps I no longer need to try.

                   He punches several buttons.

                   In the Rocky Cavern the transporter beam locks on to the
                   Genesis torpedo and its arming control box.

                   As Kirk and the others watch, horrified, Khan beams up
                   the materials. David tries to reach the torpedo, but
                   Saavik holds him fast --

 DAVID                              Let go -- he can't -- !

 SAAVIK                              Only half of you would get there.

                   The beam disappears and Genesis with it, leaving them
                   alone.

 KIRK                                      (desperate)
                             Khan, you have Genesis, but you
                             don't have me! You were going to
                             kill me, Khan, it was your sole
                             purpose. You'll have to come down
                             here to do it! You'll have to
                             come down!

 KHAN'S VOICE                              I've done far worse than kill you,
                             Admiral. I've hurt you. And I
                             wish to go on hurting you. I
                             shall leave you, as you left me --
                             where no one will ever find you:
                             poetic justice; marooned for
                             eternity in the center of a dead
                             planet -- buried alive.

 KIRK                              Khan -- !

 KHAN                              Goodbye, Admiral. Oh, and don't
                             count on Enterprise. She can't
                             move. My next act will be to blow
                             her out of the heavens.

 KIRK KHAN!

                   Khan closes his eyes in voluptuous satisfaction.
                   Joachim enters and Khan looks at him.

 KHAN                              Well?

 JOACHIM                              Warp drive still inoperative. All

                             shortly.

                   Khan sighs, contentedly.

 KHAN                              Excellent. We have all the time
                             in the world.

 146 INT. ROCKY CAVERN 146 
                   As before, Saavik is on the communicator.

 SAAVIK                              This is Lt. Saavik, calling Enterprise...

                   She keeps trying. Chekov stirs --

 BONES                              He's alive!

                   Bones goes and tends Chekov who moans, tries to sit up.

 KIRK                              Pavel?

                   Chekov tries to smile; Kirk takes his hand --

 SAAVIK                              No use, Admiral, they're still
                             jamming all channels.

 BONES                                      (looks across Chekov)
                             It wouldn't make any difference.
                             If Enterprise obeyed orders she's
                             long since gone. And if she couldn't
                             obey, she's finished.

 DAVID                              So are we, it looks like.

 CAROL                              I don't understand.
                             Who's responsible for all this?
                             Who is Khan?

 KIRK                              It's a long story.

 DAVID                              We appear to have plenty of time.

 BONES                                      (dry)
                             You and your father can catch up on
                             things.

 DAVID                                      (bitter)
                             My father. I hope you realize
                             another man has just been killed
                             because of...

 BONES                              Because of you, son. You shouldn't
                             have tried to rush someone holding
                             a primed phaser. Anyway it isn't
                             one man dead, it's two, in case
                             you've lost count.

                   David has been effectively spiked. Long silence.

 KIRK                              Do you have anything to eat? I
                             don't know about anyone else, but
                             I'm starved.

 BONES                              How can you think of food at a time
                             like this?

 KIRK                              Our first order of business is survival.

 CAROL                              There's food in the Genesis cave,
                             enough to last a lifetime -- should
                             that be necessary.

 BONES                              We thought this was Genesis.

                   Carol laughs -- there's an edge of hysteria to it.

 CAROL                              This? It took the Starfleet corps
                             of engineers ten months in space
                             suits to tunnel out all this. What
                             we did in there -- we did in a day.
                             David, why don't you show Dr. McCoy
                             and the Lieutenant our idea of food.

 DAVID                              But we can't just sit here -- !

 KIRK                                      (unruffled)
                             Oh, yes we can. Is there really
                             something to eat?

                   David looks at his father, who checks his watch, putting
                   on his spectacles.

 CAROL                              David. Please.

 DAVID                                      (to Kirk)
                             This is just to give us something
                             to do, isn't it?
                                     (he shrugs)
                             Come on.

                   Saavik and Bones make to follow. Saavik turns to Kirk --

 SAAVIK                              Admiral?

 KIRK                              As your teacher Mr. Spock is fond
                             of saying: I like to think there
                             always are possibilities.

                   Carol sits on the ground, Chekov's head in her lap,
                   looking at Kirk.

 CAROL                              David was right, wasn't he? It's
                             just to keep them busy.

 KIRK                              Why? Why didn't you tell me?

 CAROL                              How can you ask me that? Were we
                             together? Where we going to be?
                             You had your world and I had mine.
                             I wanted him in mine, not chasing
                             through the universe with his father.

                   Kirk turns away, overcome. She watches him.

 CAROL                                      (continuing)
                             He's a lot like you in many ways.
                             Nothing I could do about it. He's
                             smarter, of course; that goes without
                             saying. Most of Genesis is really
                             his.

                   Her joke doesn't take effect. He doesn't turn.

 CAROL                                      (continuing)
                             This is it, isn't it? We're never
                             going to get out of here.

                   Kirk says nothing.

 CAROL                                      (continuing)
                             Please. Tell me what you're feeling.

                   Kirk hesitates, comes back and sits next to Chekov; he
                   changes Bones' compress on the ear as he finally speaks.

 KIRK                              There's a man I haven't seen in
                             fifteen years who thinks he's killed
                             me. You show me a son who'd almost be
                             happy to help him. My son. My life
                             that could have been and wasn't. What
                             am I feeling? I'm feeling old --
                             worn out.

                   Carol studies him; gently she sets Chekov's head down
                   on a sweater, then stands.

 CAROL                              Let me show you something that will
                             make you feel young -- young as when
                             the world was new.

                   She offers her hand. Kirk looks at Chekov, who smiles,
                   faint assurance.

 CAROL                                      (continuing)
                             He'll be all right. Come.

                   After a moment's hesitation, Kirk takes her hand and
                   she leads him to the tunnel.

 150B INT. TUNNEL 150B 
                   TRUCKING BEFORE Carol and Kirk. A rising light falls
                   on their faces as they walk, then run with excitement
                   toward the source. Kirk races ahead...

                   for Kirk to reach the end of the tunnel, and then,
                   when it does:

 150D INT. GENESIS CAVE - PROMONTORY LEVEL 150D 
                   where the rock tunnel ends. Kirk comes out of the
                   tunnel, and his mouth drops open.

 150E FULL SHOT - THE GENESIS CAVE (MATTE AND FX) (FORMERLY 150E SCENE 130) 
                   A huge cavern. Kirk is actually standing at the middle
                   of it. Space extends vastly above and below his point
                   of view. Like Eden, lush growth everywhere, water-
                   falls, and a cobalt blue sky high, high above where a
                   round orb glows sending light and warmth downward.
                   There is a path from where Kirk stands down to the lower
                   level where Bones, and the others are waiting and calling
                   to him. Mist and haze waft gently across the cavern.

 JOACHIM                              Impulse power restored.

                   Khan smiles.

 KHAN                              More than a match for poor
                             Enterprise.

                   Kirk and the others eat fruit from the huge (matte)

 159A ANGLE FAVORING DAVID AND SAAVIK 159A 
                   who watches him.

 DAVID                              What are you looking at?

 SAAVIK                              The Admiral's son.

 DAVID                              Don't you believe it.

 SAAVIK                              Oh, I believe it.

                   She almost smiles. David returns her stare and it
                   throws her.

 SAAVIK                                      (continuing)
                             What are you looking at?
 DAVID                                      (confused)
                             I don't know.

 159B INT. GENESIS CAVE - WIDER ANGLE 159B 
                   Saavik rises, paces. Kirk puts down his food.

 KIRK                              Now that's what I call a meal.

 BONES                              It's like the Garden of Eden...

 CAROL                              Only here, every apple comes from
                             the Tree of Knowledge.

                   Kirk watches Saavik.

 KIRK                              What's on your mind, Lieutenant?

 SAAVIK                              The Kobayashi Maru, sir.

 DAVID                              The what?

 BONES                              The no-win scenario -- and with
                             what philosophy a commander faces
                             defeat.

 KIRK                              Are you asking me if we are playing
                             out that scenario now, Lieutenant?

 SAAVIK                              On the test, sir, will you tell me
                             what you did? I'd really like to
                             know.

                   Kirk looks at Bones, who smiles --

 BONES                              Lieutenant, you are looking at the
                             only Starfleet cadet who ever beat
                             the no-win scenario --

 KIRK                              And almost got tossed out of the
                             Academy...

                   He looks at his watch again, using his glasses --

 SAAVIK                              How?

 KIRK                              I reprogrammed the simulation so it
                             was possible to rescue the ship.

 SAAVIK WHAT? 
 KIRK                              I changed the conditions of the
                             test. I received a commendation for
                             original thinking.
                                     (pause)
                             I don't like to lose.

 SAAVIK                              Then -- you never faced that
                             situation -- faced death...

 BONES                              Until now.

 KIRK                              We each face death every day we're
                             alive, Saavik.

                   He picks up the communicator.

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Spock, this is Kirk. It's two hours.
                             Are you about ready?

 SPOCK'S VOICE                              Right on schedule, Admiral. Just
                             give us your coordinates and we'll
                             beam you aboard.

                   The others are on their feet, stunned with amazement --

 KIRK                              Right. I don't like to lose.

                   He clicks off.

                   David gapes at his father.

 161 EXT. SPACE DARK SIDE OF REGULA 161 
                   WE CAN SEE NOW where Enterprise is: she has slipped
                   behind the plantoid, clockwise, even as Reliant was
                   rounding into the lighted side.

 162 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM - ENTERPRISE 162 
                   Kirk, David, Saavik, Carol and Bones, holding the semi-
                   conscious Chekov MATERIALIZE. Spock is there to greet
                   them.

 SAAVIK                              But the damage report -- we were
                             immobilized...

 KIRK                              Come, come, Lieutenant, you of all
                             people go by the book. Hello,
                             Spock. You remember Dr. Marcus...

                   They are moving through the room as they talk --

 SPOCK                              Certainly...

 SAAVIK                                      (overlapping)
                             By the book...

                             are being monitored during battle...'

 SAAVIK                              '... no uncoded messages on an open
                             channel...'

                   Saavik steps in front of Spock.

 SAAVIK                                      (continuing)
                             You lied.

 SPOCK                              I exaggerated.

 KIRK                              Hours instead of days, Saavik; now
                             we have minutes instead of hours --

 BONES                                      (behind)
                             I'm taking this bunch to sick bay.

                   Saavik and Kirk follow Spock. They stop at a Turbo

 SPOCK                              They're inoperative below C-deck.

 164 INT. ANOTHER ENTERPRISE CORRIDOR 164 
                   They race down corridors as they speak -- 

 KIRK                              What IS working around here?

 SPOCK                              Not much, Admiral. We have partial
                             main power...

 KIRK                              That's it?

 SPOCK                              Best we could do in two hours.

                   We see the Enterprise emerging from the dark side of
                   Gamma Regula, where Reliant is now a moving blip.

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Uh oh.

 SPOCK                              She can out-run us and out-gun us.

                             153 mark four.

 KIRK                                      (studies his console)
                             Scotty, can we make it inside?

 SCOTTY                              The energizer's bypassed like a
                             Christmas tree -- so don't give me
                             too many bumps.

 KIRK                              No promises, Mr. Scott. On your way.

 SAAVIK                              Trouble with the nebula, sir, is all
                             that static discharge and gas clouds 
                             our tactical display. Visuals won't 
                             function and shields will be useless.

                   Kirk looks over the rims of his glasses at Spock; they
                   smile with faint amusement.

 SPOCK                              What's sauce for the goose, Mr.
                             Saavik. The odds will be even.

 SAAVIK                              Admiral... what happens if Reliant
                             fails to follow us into the nebula?

                   Kirk and Spock exchange looks --

 SPOCK                              I think we can guarantee she'll
                             follow us, Mr. Saavik. Remind me
                             to explain to you the concept of
                             human ego.

 KIRK                              Best speed, Scotty...

                   The Enterprise whooshes by CAMERA leaving Regula

 KHAN                              There! Full impulse power! Not

                             -- so much the better...

                   THEN Reliant does the same, closer in pursuit. At
                   this moment, half the distance between Regula and
                   the nebula has been covered.

 BONES                              Listen to me, Pavel; you haven't
                             the strength or the equilibrium --

 CHEKOV                              But --

                   As they talk, David, unnoticed, leaves the area. The
                   Enterprise is buffeted again --

 CAROL                              Dr. McCoy, I can't just sit here.
                             Tell me what I can do.

 BONES                                      (grim)

 SPOCK                              One minute to nebula perimeter.

                   The bridge door slides open and David enters. He
                   stares in wonder. Saavik reacts to David.

 SPOCK                                      (continuing)
                             Admiral, they're reducing speed.

 KIRK                              Uhura, patch me in --

 UHURA                              Aye, sir.

                   Khan's eyes bulge --

 KIRK'S VOICE                                      (continuing)
                             We tried it once your way, Khan.
                             Are you game for a rematch?

                   Khan's eyes bulge --

 KIRK'S VOICE                                      (continuing)
                             Khan -- ! I'm laughing at the
                             "superior" intellect.

 KHAN                              Full impulse power!

 JOACHIM                              No sir! We have Genesis -- Whatever
                             you want --

 KHAN                              Full power damn you!

                   And he reaches across and executes it himself.

 181 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 181 
                   They react to Reliant's speed-up. The nebula approach
                   is ON SCREEN.

 KIRK                                      (dry)
                             I'll say this for him: he's
                             consistent.

 182 EXT. SPACE - THE MUTARA NEBULA 182 
                   WE'RE VERY CLOSE NOW, and SEE CLEARLY the swirling,
                   slowly moving gases, magenta, purple, etc. There are
                   veils of luminescent materials and through all an
                   interlace of unpredictable electrical charges.

                   Like lightning, these intermittent great flashes
                   illumine whole sections of the nebula. OUR VIEW is
                   moving slowly forward...

 183 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 183 
 SPOCK                                      (timing)
                             And we're... in.

 184 EXT. SPACE - THE NEBULA 184 
                   As Enterprise whooshes into the PICTURE headed into the
                   purplish gas -- and disappears into a cloud bank of
                   the stuff.

                   A moment then Reliant APPEARS, pursues Enterprise into
                   the gloom, also disappears.

 185 INT. RELIANT BRIDGE 185 
                   ON SCREEN the picture is squirrelly purple, breaking
                   up. Blindness. Panic.

 KHAN                              Tactical!

 JOACHIM                                      (tries)
                             Inoperative.

 KHAN                              Raise the shields...

                   Electrical forces raging without are also reflected on
                   the circuits within. It's bumpy, on top of everything
                   else. Electronic WHINING.

 JOACHIM                              As I feared, sir. Not functional.
                             I'm reducing speed.

                   Khan does not argue.

 186 EXT. SPACE - PURPLE - SERIES OF SHOTS 186 
                   Cautiously Reliant emerges from a massive "cloudbank."
                   Electrical discharges abound. Barely moving, she feels
                   her way forward. Alone.

 187 AS THE ANGLE WIDENS 187 
                   A treat: Enterprise is above and behind Reliant.

 188 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE - ON SCREEN 188 
                   Reliant's image is breaking up.

 SULU                              Phaser lock inoperative, sir.

 KIRK                              Best guess, Mr. Sulu. Fire when
                             ready.

                   Sulu strains, then fires -- just as an electrical dis-
                   turbance bounces the bridge --

 189 EXT. SPACE NEBULA 189 
                   The bounce causes Sulu's phaser shot to go wide of
                   Reliant, amid CRACKLING discharges --

 190 INT. RELIANT BRIDGE 190 
                   Rolls from the near-miss concussion --

 KHAN                              Aft-torpedoes -- fire -- !

 191 EXT. SPACE NEBULA 191 
                   Reliant is wide of the mark with a Photon torpedo.
                   A BLINDING ELECTRICAL DISCHARGE. When it clears,
                   Enterprise appears to be alone.

 192 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 192 
                   ON SCREEN, nothing but magenta amid picture breakup --

 KIRK                                      (sweating)
                             Hold your course. Look sharp...

 SAAVIK                              At what.

 193 EXT. NEBULA (INTERCUT WITH BRIDGE) 193 
                   Enterprise feeling its way...

 194 ON BRIDGE - POV ON SCREEN 194 
                   All peer into the lousy picture. Occasional electrical
                   flashes.

 195 EXT. SPACE NEBULA 195 
                   Still Enterprise moves forward... A LARGE FLASH... a
                   SUDDEN GLIMPSE: Reliant boring in on collision course!

 196 INT. ENTERPRSIE BRIDGE 196 
                   A sudden clearing ON SCREEN: Reliant!

 KIRK                              Evasive starboard!

                   Hard over, but not fast enough. Reliant fires a phaser.

 197 SERIES OF SHOTS 197 
                   Reliant's phaser shot hits the Enterprise torpedo room
                   in Dorsal Fin area of ship.

 198 INT. ENTERPRISE TORPEDO ROOM 198 
                   An EXPLOSION rocks the room and...

 199 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 199 
                   The Bridge rattles from the explosion below; Sulu is
                   thrown from his chair. Saavik leaps to her post --

 KIRK                              Phaser bank one, fire!

 200 EXT. SPACE NEBULA 200 
                   The Enterprise fires a phaser and delivers a raking shot
                   -- which rips along the side of Reliant's primary hull.

 200A INT. RELIANT BRIDGE (FORMERLY SCENE 205) 200A 
                   The bridge is damaged; Joachim and others are wounded...

 KHAN                              Joachim!

                   For the first time, his friend wounded, Khan hesitates,
                   holds him --

 JOACHIM                              Yours... is... the superior...

 KHAN                              I shall avenge you --

 200B NEW ANGLE 200B 
                   She veers to one side with the impact and disappears
                   into a deep purple mass.

 201 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 201 
                   Sulu is being helped by David --

 KIRK                              Damage, Scotty?

 202 INT. ENGINE ROOM 202 
                   Bones is there, helping some crewmen. The Reactor Room 
                   flashes a red warning light and glows with a blue 
                   light. The air is heavy with smoke but the doors,
                   damaged earlier, still hold.

 SCOTTY                              Admiral, I've got to take the mains
                             off the line. The energizer's shaken
                             loose and I can't get in there to
                             fix her -- radiation --

 203 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 203 
 KIRK                              All right, we'll do the job with
                             auxiliary power.

                   The bridge door opens and closes; Chekov, faint,
                   stands there.

 CHEKOV                              Could you use another hand, Admiral?

 KIRK                              Man the weapons console, Mr. Chekov.

                   ANGLE FAVORING David as the others react to Chekov
                   taking his place. Quiet.

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Spock?                             

                   Spock is bent over the scanner --

 SPOCK                              Sporadic energy readings port side,
                             aft. Could be an impulse turn.

 KIRK                              He won't break off now. If he
                             followed me this far he'll be back.
                             But from where...?

 SPOCK                              He's intelligent, but not experienced.
                             His pattern indicates two dimensional
                             thinking...

                   Kirk looks at him, smiles.

 KIRK                              Mr. Saavik, all stop.

 SAAVIK                              All stop, sir.

 KIRK                              Descend ten thousand meters. Stand
                             by photon torpedoes.

 204 EXT. SPACE NEBULA 204 
                   Reliant in purplish mass, banking slightly, completing
                   a long turn, then boring ahead.

 205 OMITTED 205 
 206 EXT. SPACE NEBULA 206 
                   As Reliant emerges from the dark blue mass into a clear
                   almost tranquil place. Reliant, moving slowly, stops,
                   as if looking around.

 207 INT. RELIANT BRIDGE 207 
                   The screens are empty.

 KHAN                              Where is he? Where in God's name
                             is he?

 208 EXT. SPACE NEBULA 208 
                   Reliant motionless in the f.g. amid occasional flashes.
                   Now, behind Reliant and from below, like a great whale
                   rising from the depths, Enterprise rises vertically,
                   slowly passing the unsuspecting enemy. When Enterprise
                   is above, behind and quite close:

 209 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 209 
                   Reliant ON SCREEN, intermittent but clear.

 CHEKOV                              Torpedoes ready, sir.

 KIRK                              Fire.

 210 SERIES OF SHOTS 210 
 A) EXT. ENTERPRISE 
                   fires torpedo; one which hits, destroying Reliant's
                   weapons pod on top.

 B) INT. RELIANT 
                   C)   EXPLOSIONS rock the interior of Reliant.

 D) EXT. ENTERPRISE 
                   fires two more times. The first causes general
                   damage. The second, close behind blasts Reliant's
                   port engine off into space, debris scattering.

 E) INT. RELIANT BRIDGE 
                   is devastated. Khan is blown from his chair and
                   WE'RE UNCERTAIN of his fate.

 211 EXT. SPACE NEBULA 211 
                   Reliant, now a scarred, battered hulk, her main hull
                   still intact, but dead in space.

 212 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 212 
                   No cheers, just deadly professionalism.

 KIRK                              Cease fire. Look sharp.

 SAAVIK                              Power levels quite low, sir.

 KIRK                                      (to intercom)
                             Mr. Scott, can you get the mains
                             back on line?

 SCOTTY'S VOICE                                      (breaking up slightly) 
                             I'll need ten minutes, sir, 'til
                             the radiation dissipates.

 KIRK                              Uhura, send to Commander, Reliant:
                             prepare to be boarded.

 UHURA                              Aye, sir.

 213 INT. RELIANT BRIDGE 213 
                   Amid the smoke and ruins, WE SEE no signs of life.

 UHURA'S VOICE                              Commander, Reliant, this is
                             Enterprise. Surrender and prepare
                             to be boarded. Repeat...

                   In f.g., chillingly, Khan rises INTO SHOT by the main
                   console. He is horribly burned, and it is clear that
                   he is clinging to life by his will.

 KHAN                              No... Kirk. The game's not over.

                   As Uhura's voice continues O.S., Khan pulls himself
                   into a chair at the console, one of his hands useless
                   at his side.

 KHAN                                      (continuing)
                             To the last I will grapple with thee!

                   Painfully, with one good arm, he starts arming the
                   Genesis console.

 213A INT. RELIANT TRANSPORTER ROOM 213A 
                   There sits the Genesis torpedo: lights start blinking
                   in response. As we watch, the CHILD we met on Ceti Alpha
                   walks to the torpedo and smiles at the lights.

 214 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 214 
 UHURA                              Enterprise to Reliant: you are
                             ordered to surrender your vessel.
                             Respond!
                                     (to Kirk)
                             Nothing, sir.

 KIRK                              We'll beam aboard. Alert
                             transporter room --

 SPOCK                              Admiral. Scanning an energy source
                             on Reliant. A pattern I've never
                             seen.

                   David peers closer over Spock's shoulder, reacts.

 DAVID                              It's the Genesis Wave!

 KIRK                              What?

 DAVID                              He's on a build up to detonation!

 KIRK                              How soon --

 DAVID                              We encoded four minutes --

 KIRK                              We'll beam aboard and stop it --

 DAVID                              You can't!

                   The briefest stunned moment. Kirk hits intercom:

 KIRK                              Scotty, I need warp speed in three
                             minutes or we're all dead!

 STATIC. 
 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Scotty!

                   Spock leaps from his place and disappears through the
                   bridge doors.

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Saavik, get us out, best speed!

 SAAVIK                              Aye, sir.

 215 EXT. SPACE NEBULA 215 
                   Enterprise backs away from Reliant. Her speed is pain-
                   fully slow.

 216 INT. RELIANT BRIDGE 216 
                   ON SCREEN, Enterprise, intermittent image, backs away.
                   Khan smiles triumphantly through his pain. An elec-
                   tronic power SOUND has been building.

 KHAN                              No... You can't get away... From
                             hell's heart I stab at thee...
                                     (amid the pain)
                             For hate's sake... I spit my last
                             breath at thee!

                   Khan topples forward, dead. The WHINE continues to
                   build chillingly.

 217 INT. ENTERPRISE ENGINE ROOM 217 
                   Spock rushes in. Bones ministers to Scotty, b.g.

                   Spock sizes up the situation, starts for the radiation
                   room, Bones intercepts him.

 BONES                              Are you out of your Vulcan mind?
                             No human can tolerate the radiation
                             loose in there!

 SPOCK                              But, as you are so fond of observing,
                             Doctor, I'm not human.

 BONES                              You're not going in there -- !

 SPOCK                              I'm afraid I can't stop to discuss
                             this logically --

                   He gives Bones the Vulcan nerve pinch. Bones goes
                   down.

                   Spock presses the access button and enters the Reactor
                   Room, a separated area behind radiation-proof glass
                   and metal, RED FLASHING LIGHTS and an iridescent blue
                   glow within.

 218 ANGLE - SCOTTY AND BONES 218 
 SCOTTY                                      (in horror)
                             Spock -- get out of there!

 219 INT. ENTERPRISE REACTOR ROOM 219 
                   Bathed in blue light, arcing energy around him, Spock
                   is a silhouetted figure as he goes to work, door clos-
                   ing behind him.

 220 EXT. SPACE - RELIANT 220 
                   The WHINE increasing, the dead ship Reliant alive with
                   danger...

                             Engine room! What's happening?!

 223 INT. ENTERPRISE REACTOR ROOM (INTERCUT AS 223 REQUIRED) 
                   Outside the glass, Scotty and Bones screaming:

 SCOTTY                              Captain, please!

 BONES                              Get out! Get out, man! Oh, dear
                             God...!

 224 WITHIN 224 
                   WE CAN SEE the silent urging of Bones and Scotty.
                   Spock is oblivious. Amid the fire-blue arcs, he moves 
                   to the control panel. Between his hands and the con-
                   trols, power arcs insanely. Spock is in an inferno,
                   a radiation hell, fighting now with all his strength
                   to control it. Slowly, the damping rods move out.
                   Spock moves to a manual control, begins to turn it.

 225 CLOSE - SPOCK'S HANDS 225 
                   on the manual control, slowly turning black.

 226 HIS FACE 226 
                   His face, using all the self discipline he is capable
                   of to control the pain, continuing to work --

 227 WITHOUT 227 
                   Bones and Scotty react in helpless horror.

 228 EXT. SPACE NEBULA 228 
                   Enterprise still well within the nebula, Reliant a
                   figure still visible in b.g. She's crawling still.

 229 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 229 
                   Reliant, now symbol of death, ON SCREEN.

 KIRK                              Time!

 SAAVIK                              Three minutes, thirty seconds.

 CHEKOV                              Four hundred kilometers.

                   Kirk looks at David, but David shakes his head: No
                   way. Then:

 CADET                              Sir! The mains are back on line -- !

 KIRK                              Bless you, Scotty. Go, Saavik!

                   She increases power and --

 F) EXT. MUTARA NEBULA - MASTER EFFECT 
                        As Reliant goes, so goes the nebula. The "Genesis
                        Effect" WE SAW in its earliest experiments, now 
                        seems familiar on a gigantic, cosmic scale.

                        The blinding flash at first, followed by the same
                        tumbling turbulence of the miniature test. It is
                        awesome.

 231 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 231 
                   The bridge doors open and Carol appears. Instinctively
                   she draws near her son.

                   Finally, Kirk turns, sees Carol --

 KIRK                              Reduce speed. My God, Carl. Look
                             at it.

                   ON SCREEN and INTERCUT -- GENESIS TUMBLES and starts
                   evolving. A moment in history.

 KIRK                                      (continuing, on
                                      intercom)
                             Engine Room. Well done. Scotty?

 BONES' VOICE                                      (after a beat)
                             Jim, you'd better get down here. Hurry.

                   The tone frightens Kirk.

 KIRK                              Saavik, take the con.

                   He moves through the doors quickly, leaving the rest
                   staring at the new world evolving.

 232 INT. STAIRWAY TO ENGINE ROOM 232 
                   It is endless. Kirk runs forever, feet pounding down,
                   down, down --

 233 EXT. SPACE AND ON SCREEN 233 
                   The clouds tumble and move, new things lie beyond --

                   Kirk races --

 235 INT. ENTERPRISE ENGINE ROOM 235 
                   Kirk emerges to encounter Scotty and Bones. Their
                   looks tell him. He sees the flashing light over the
                   Reactor Room. He dashes for the control panel. Bones
                   grabs him.

 SCOTTY                              No, sir! You'll flood the whole
                             compartment...!

 KIRK                              He'll die -- !

 BONES                                      (also holds him)
                             He's dead already, Jim.

                   Kirk's eyes bulge.

 KIRK                              Oh, God.

 236 ANGLE AT REACTOR ROOM GLASS DOOR 236 
                   With stunned understanding, Kirk stumbles to the door,
                   sees Spock on his knees, hands blackened, face cracked
                   with radiation lines and scars.

                   Spock shakes his head. With a feeble hand he reaches
                   the intercom button: filtered communication.

 KIRK                              Spock!

 SPOCK                              The ship -- out of danger?

 KIRK                              Yes --

                   Spock is satisfied; he fights for breath --

 SPOCK                              Don't grieve, Admiral -- it's
                             logical: the good of the many
                             outweighs --

                   He almost keels over. Kirk has tears streaming down
                   his face.

 KIRK                              ... the good of the few...

 SPOCK                              Or the one.

                   He props a hand on the glass to support himself. Kirk's
                   hand reflexively goes to match Spock's on the other side
                   of the glass --

 SPOCK                                      (continuing)
                             I never took the Kobayashi Maru
                             test -- until now. What do you
                             think of my solution?

 KIRK                              Spock...!

 SPOCK                              I have been -- and always will be
                             -- your friend... Live. Long. And. 
                             Prosper.

                   Spock falls. Bones and Scotty react.

 KIRK                              No...!

 SAAVIK'S VOICE                                      (intercom)
                             Admiral, you've got to see this!
                             There's new life -- a whole new
                             world, a Genesis world -- !

                   But Kirk is past hearing or caring. He is huddled up
                   against the glass, destroyed. Bones looks on, helpless.

                   the Ship's Company in full dress uniforms assembled for
                   ship's burial service. Over the PULLBACK, we HEAR:

 KIRK                              In accordance with the traditions
                             of Starfleet and of Article 184
                             Starfleet Regulations, we are
                             assembled here today to pay final
                             respects to our honored dead.

                   Carol and David are PROMINENTLY FEATURED. David watching
                   Kirk attentively. So are Sulu, Uhura, Chekov, and Saavik.
                   Bones stands next to Kirk. Scotty carries his bagpipes.
                   Saavik wears her hair down.

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             And yet, in the midst of our sorrow
                             it should be noted that this death
                             takes place in the shadow of new
                             life, the sunrise of a new world,
                             a world that our beloved comrade
                             gave his own life to protect and
                             nourish. He did not feel that
                             sacrifice a vain or empty one --
                             and we will not debate his profound
                             wisdom, in these proceedings. Of
                             my friend, I can only say this, that
                             of all the souls I have encountered 
                             in my travels, his was the most --
                                     (he falters)
                             -- human.

                   He tries to go on, but catches Bones' face: Bones is
                   streaming tears. Kirk can't go on.

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Lieutenant Saavik.

                   Saavik steps forward.

 SAAVIK                              We commend the soul of our brother
                             departed. We love we commit his
                             body to the depths of space.

 SULU                              Honors -- hup!

                   All Starfleet personnel salute. Scotty begins to PIPE,
                   an odd blare which mellows into Amazing Grace. Kirk
                   nods a signal.

 242 THE CAPSULE 242 
                   A gleaming black projectile is carried by pallbearers
                   into the launching chamber, which locks behind it. At
                   a hand signal from a TORPEDOMAN, the projectile is fired.

                   Spock's remains seen on their way to the new world. 
                   The capsule grows too small to SEE. The bagpipes STOP.

 244 INT. TORPEDO ROOM 244 
 SULU                              Return -- hup!

                   The salute drop.

 KIRK                              Lieutenant.

                   She steps to him and they exchange salutes --

 KIRK                                      (continuing; very 
                                      quietly)
                             After you dismiss the company, you
                             will take the watch. Set course 
                             for Ceti Alpha V and we'll pick up 
                             survivors.

 SAAVIK                              Aye, sir.

 KIRK                              I'll be in my quarters if needed,
                             but I would prefer...

 SAAVIK                              Understood, sir.

 KIRK                                      (aloud)
                             Dismiss the company.

                   They salute. She about-faces as Kirk walks towards
                   the  Turbo Lift. Saavik issues dismissal and posting 
                   orders, but WE TRUCK with Kirk until CAMERA STOPS and
                   he leaves FRAME and WE HOLD on David. He finally
                   understands.

 245 INT. KIRK'S QUARTERS 245 
                   After a long moment, the CAMERA DISCOVERS Kirk. He
                   pours a drink, then decides not to have it.

                   He sits wearily, not knowing how to shake the ghosts.
                   Then he sees the book.

                   Kirk picks up the battered volume, the gift from his
                   friend, and closes his eyes a moment. Almost idly
                   he starts turning pages, looking for a clue. But he
                   can't see the writing -- he rummages through his
                   pockets and pulls out the half-glasses --

                   One of the lenses is broken. It has a deep impact on
                   Kirk. He puts down the book and glasses and covers
                   his eyes.

                   A SOFT BONG. Kirk clears his throat.

 KIRK                              Yes... come.

                   The door whooshes open and closes to admit David. The
                   last person Kirk expected to see.

 DAVID                              I don't mean to intrude.

 KIRK                              Uh, no...
                                     (rises)
                             I should be on the bridge.

 DAVID                              Are you running away from me?

                   David's strength is turning a corner with Kirk --

 KIRK                              I suppose I was.
                                     (pause)
                             I poured a drink. Would you like
                             it?

 DAVID                              No. I -- I guess I'm not what you
                             expected.

 KIRK                                      (rueful)
                             I didn't expect anything.

 DAVID                              That makes two of us.
                                     (he studies his
                                      father)
                             Lieutenant Saavik was right: you
                             never have faced death --

 KIRK                                      (hoarse)
                             Not like this -- no. I haven't faced
                             death, I cheated death. I tricked
                             my way out of death and patted myself
                             on the back for my ingenuity. I
                             know nothing.

 DAVID                              You knew enough to tell Saavik that
                             how we face death is at least as
                             important as how we face life --

 KIRK                              It was just words.

 DAVID                              But good words. That's where ideas
                             begin. Maybe you should listen to
                             them.

 KIRK                              I'm trying, David.

 DAVID                              So am I. My friends were killed,
                             too.

 KIRK                              I am truly sorry.

                   Pause. They study each other.

 DAVID                              I was wrong about you. And I'm
                             sorry.

 KIRK                              Is that what you came here to say?

 DAVID                              Mainly.
                                     (he starts out,
                                      then turns -- )
                             And also that I'm proud -- very
                             proud -- to be your son.

                   A stunned moment, then Kirk lets it all hang out: for
                   David, for Carol and for Spock. He hugs his son, hold-
                   ing onto him as if to life itself.

 246 EXT. SPACE 246 
                   The Enterprise passes the new planet in all its beauty.

 247 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 247 
                   The door whooshes. Kirk strides on the bridge, David
                   with him. Carol is there with Bones; they are glad at
                   what they see.

 SAAVIK                              Admiral on the bridge!

 KIRK                              As you were, Mr. Saavik.

 SAAVIK                              Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha.
                             All is well.

 KIRK                              Good, I believe you already know
                             my, uh, son --

                   Saavik comes close to blushing --

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Yes, well, why don't you show him
                             around and...

 SAAVIK                              Aye, sir --

                   She takes him off, deadpan amusement --

 SAAVIK                                      (continuing)
                             So you turn out to be the dumb
                             bastard.

                   They stare at her.

 SAAVIK                                      (continuing)
                             That is a little joke.

                   Kirk has a smile. He joins Bones and Carol facing the
                   screen.

 BONES                              She's changed her hair again.
                                     (pause)
                             Will you look at that? Think
                             they'll name it for you, Doctor?

 CAROL                              Not if I can help it. We'll name
                             it for our friend.

 KIRK                                      (quietly)
                             It is a far far better thing I do
                             than I have ever done before... a
                             far better resting place I go to
                             than I have ever known...

 CAROL                                      (soft)
                             Is that a poem?

 KIRK                              Something Spock was trying to
                             tell me. On my birthday.

                   He shakes his head, remembering --

 BONES                              You okay, Jim? How do you feel?

 KIRK                                      (considers; smiles)
                             Young. I feel young, Doctor.

                   He turns to Saavik and David --

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Lieutenant, new course: 'Second

                             till morning.'

                                                               September 29, 1995





 1 A BLACK VOID 1 
                   We can hear movement. Strange skittering sounds, like
                   razor-claws on metal... the hiss of pneumatic hoses...
                   the whirr and click of servos... liquid gurgling... an
                   eerie, alien cacophony.

 2 EARTH 2 
                   appears, hanging now in the starry blackness. The
                   alien noises continue, and far in the distance we hear
                   the muffled THUMP of what could be a distant explosion.
                   Alien TEXT suddenly appears next to Earth, and we
                   REVEAL we are in --

 3 INT. BORG RECON CENTER 3 
                   The image of Earth is actually on a monitor, which is
                   only one of DOZENS of MONITORS covering a huge wall.
                   We don't see anything of the rest of the room, but the
                   technology in view is distinctly alien and bizarre --
                   a mixture of organic and mechanical elements.
                   Circuitry and optical cabling are side-by-side with
                   what looks almost like arteries and organs. We can
                   still hear the creepy skittering and gurgling noises.
                   Occasionally, a SHADOWY FORM sweeps past the camera,
                   vaguely humanoid but we can't tell who or what it is.

                   All of the monitors are active, and they present myriad
                   IMAGES and SOUND -- all related to EARTH HISTORY. The
                   screens show everything from written Chinese... to
                   Renaissance paintings... to black and white newsreel
                   footage of World War Two... to what look like clips of
                   space battles from the 24th century. The entire range
                   of human history dancing across the monitors. The
                   effect is dizzying -- we get the feeling that whoever
                   is watching this is studying the human race.

                   There is another THUMP and the wall of monitors
                   SHUDDERS slightly. We hear the VOICE of what we will
                   come to know as the BORG COLLECTIVE -- thousands of
                   voices speaking at once :

 BORG                              Restrict search parameters to 1-9-
                             9-8 through 2-0-8-4.

                   The images on the monitors now change to show us images
                   from 21ST CENTURY Earth history.

                   Again, it's a collection of still photography, video
                   footage, text, artwork, etc. We hear snippets of sound-
                   bites, music, speeches from the period. A lot of
                   enticing details. As the images race across the
                   monitors, we should learn the following.

                   -- The turn of the 21st century brought chaos.
                   Regional wars, the collapse of the United Nations.
                   Societal break-down. Crime, starvation, desperation.

                   -- A Third World War. Nuclear explosions,
                   environmental disasters, tens of millions dead. The
                   United States ceases to exist. All political authority
                   vanishes. Humanity teetering on the edge of the Second
                   Dark Age.

                   -- The image of a single man -- ZEPHRAM COCHRANE. A
                   visionary scientist. He see the spacecraft he created
                   out of a nuclear missile. He flies the first warp
                   test, breaking the light barrier. It changes history.

                   -- Grainy black and white images of a VULCAN SCOUT SHIP
                   landing on Earth. They saw Cochrane's flight, followed
                   him back to Earth, and made First Contact with the
                   human race.

                   -- Humanity turns the corner. First Contact with an
                   alien civilization brings the planet together as never
                   before. Humans and Vulcans working together, beginning
                   to solve long-standing problems with new technology.
                   We see an early replicator producing food for the
                   starving millions. A new World Government is formed.

                   -- People from planet Earth and people from Vulcan form
                   an Alliance. They call it the United Federation of 
                   Planets. And they commission a fleet of starships for
                   protection and exploration. They call it Starfleet.

                   -- These are images recounting the birth of the Star
                   Trek universe.

                   Another muffled EXPLOSION, this one stronger, SHAKES
                   the entire wall. One of the monitors BLOWS OUT in a
                   shower of sparks. And now a new voice, a woman's
                   voice, low, threatening, with a slight metallic
                   inflection, speaks for the first time:

 WOMAN'S VOICE                              Stop search. Calculate temporal
                             coordinates. J-Fourteen.

                   Another explosion ROCKS the room and it takes us to:

 4 EXT. SPACE - A BORG SPHERE 4 
                   A huge, spherical Borg warship as it takes a phaser
                   shot from an unseen vessel. The BLAST smashes into the
                   Borg Sphere, but the massive ship continues. The
                   Sphere returns FIRE. FOLLOW the Borg fire to --

 5 A FEDERATION STARSHIP 5 
                   locked in battle with the Borg Sphere. The Borg fire
                   DESTROYS the Federation ship in a fiery blast.

 6 NEW ANGLE 6 
                   as the Borg Sphere flies away from the wreckage of the
                   decimated starship, and as it does, we reveal that this
                   is just one small part of --

 7 A MASSIVE SPACE BATTLE 7 
                   involving dozens of Starfleet and Borg vessels, engaged
                   in a fierce FIREFIGHT as far as the eye can see. Ships
                   turning, twisting, firing, exploding. Lots of movement. 
                   It's a spectacular sight.

                   The Borg Sphere is moving away from the battle, heading
                   off in another direction.
 8 NEW ANGLE 8 
                   In the middle of the battle. A BORG CUBE is attacking
                   a smaller Federation starship. The starship is taking
                   quite a beating... explosions all along the hull... it
                   doesn't look like it can take much  more of this.

                   Suddenly a spread of FOUR TORPEDOES come blazing in
                   from O.C. The torpedoes SLAM into the Borg ship,
                   causing massive damage.

 9 THE USS ENTERPRISE NCC 1701-E 9 
                   SOARS into view and moves to protect the beleaguered
                   starship.

                   The Enterprise is Starfleet's newest and most powerful
                   vessel. An elegant and majestic ship. But unlike the
                   last Enterprise, Starfleet has opted for a more
                   muscular vessel and the hull is studded with weapons
                   and other defensive armory. We get the feeling this
                   Enterprise is ready for anything.

 10 INT. ENTERPRISE-E - BRIDGE 10 
                   The Bridge has been redesigned. A single Captain's
                   chair dominates the room, and surrounding consoles and
                   stations all face inward instead of out, giving Picard
                   instant access to his officers. PICARD in the
                   Captain's chair. RIKER at a new Ops station. DATA at
                   the helm. WORF at Tactical. TROI at Communications,
                   various CREWMEMBERS at their posts. The ship is at Red

                   The Endeavor moves off as the Borg FIRE at the
                   Enterprise and BLASTS the saucer section. This should
                   also produce an unusual effect -- instead of the
                   traditional "bubble" shielding, the new armor of this
                   Enterprise ABSORBS the blast and dissipates the energy
                   across the hull. The ship is undamaged.

                   Data works and the viewer changes to a view of the
                   INTERIOR of the BORG CUBE. A vast CHAMBER crammed with
                   HUNDREDS of BORG DRONES standing upright in individual
                   alcoves. They're everywhere -- on the ceiling, walls,
                   floor. This is a BORG COLLECTIVE -- hundreds of Borg
                   that form a gigantic "hive" mind. The Borg are half-
                   man/half machine. No individual personalities. No
                   feelings. They have only one goal in life: to
                   assimilate new races into their collective. To become
                   a Borg is to experience living death. When they speak,
                   they speak as a collective -- thousands of voices
                   speaking as one:

 BORG                              Your defense perimeter is
                             useless. You will be assimilated.

 BORG                              Your opinion is irrelevant. We
                             are the Borg. Resistance is
                             futile.
 PICARD                              We'll see about that...

                   A QUANTUM TORPEDO BLASTS out of the launcher and heads
                   toward the Borg cube. This torpedo is completely
                   different than the traditional photon torpedo. It
                   oscillates and changes shape and color as it streaks 
                   toward the Borg ship.
 20 THE BORG SHIP 20 
                   as the quantum torpedo HITS IT. But instead of
                   exploding on the surface, the torpedo PIERCES the ship
                   like an armor-piercing shell and momentarily VANISHES
                   from view. The ship then EXPLODES like a star going
                   supernova -- bright light and shock waves.

                             in the time-line.

                   Worf's console sounds an alarm.

 WORF                              Captain, there are five Borg ships
                             closing in on our position.

 PICARD                                      (making a decision)
                             Data, set a course for that
                             vortex.

 TROI                              Captain...?

 PICARD                              We have to follow them back...
                             repair whatever damage they've
                             done to that time-line.

 DATA                                      (working)

                             engines.

                   The ship is suddenly ROCKED.

              33   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE & BORG SHIPS (OPTICAL)              33

                   The Enterprise is being chased by FIVE BORG SHIPS as it
                   heads down toward the planet. The Borg vessels FIRE on
                   the Enterprise.

 34 INT. BRIDGE 34 
                   As before. The ship is shaking.

 WORF                              Hull integrity down to thirty
                             percent...

 PICARD                              Steady as she goes.

 35 INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL) 35 
                   Ahead of the ship, we see the VORTEX collapsing. The
                   shaking increases. A console EXPLODES.
 WORF                              Borg vessels are closing to two
                             thousand meters.

                   The ship is HIT AGAIN AND AGAIN. On the View Screen,
                   we're nearly on the vortex, but it's closing fast.

 PICARD                              Take us in!

              36   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE & VORTEX (OPTICAL)                  36

                   The Enterprise just barely makes it inside the vortex
                   as it finally COLLAPSES. Both the Enterprise and the
                   vortex VANISH.

 CUT TO: 
 37 EXT. SPACE 37 
                   An empty star field. Suddenly, the VORTEX APPEARS and
                   the Enterprise comes ROARING out into space. The
                   vortex VANISHES behind the ship.

 38 INT. BRIDGE 38 
                   The shaking subsides. Everyone exchanges a look, tries
                   to re-orient themselves.
 PICARD                              Report.

 RIKER                              We're still in Earth orbit.

                   Which shows Earth. The Borg pollution is gone.

 PICARD                              What year is it?

 DATA                                      (working)
                             According to our astrometric
                             readings... the year is 2063.

 WORF                              Captain, I've found the Borg
                             Sphere. It's on the far side of
                             the planet...firing at the
                             surface.

 PICARD                                      (to Data)
                             Intercept course, full impulse.

                             Weapons status?

 WORF                              Phasers are off-line... we have
                             two quantum torpedoes left. But
                             the computer targeting system has
                             been destroyed.

 PICARD                              Go to manual.

                   Worf pops open a panel and a high-tech TARGETING console
                   emerges with a small MONITOR and a traditional CROSS-
                   HAIR in the center. Worf grabs the targeting hand-
                   controls -- futuristic joysticks.

 40 EXT. SPACE - THE BORG SPHERE 40 
                   The ship is FIRING its weapons down toward the planet
                   as the Enterprise comes up over the horizon.

 41 INT. BRIDGE 41 
                   As before. Worf works his controls. A complex array
                   of grids, coordinate information, speed data, and other
                   weapons info on the monitor screen. He begins trying
                   to focus the cross-hairs on the Sphere.

 PICARD                                      (over above action, to
                                      Troi)

 RIKER                              They've seen us. They're taking
                             evasive action.

 PICARD                                      (urgent)
                             Mister Worf?

                   Worf struggles with the targeting system.

 WORF                              Target...

                   The crosshairs keep missing the image of the Borg
                   Sphere, which is now twisting and turning to evade us.
                   Troi reacts to her console.

 TROI                              Captain, they're firing at a
                             nuclear missile silo... in central
                             Montana.

 WORF                                     (struggling)
                             Target...

                             Montana...

                   The crosshairs finally LOCK on the Borg Sphere.

 WORF                              Target locked!

 PICARD                              Fire!

 42 EXT. SPACE - THE BORG SPHERE 42 
                   The quantum torpedo streaks in from off-camera and
                   slams into the Borg ship. It penetrates the Sphere as
                   seen before... a long beat... and then it EXPLODES.

 43 INT. BRIDGE 43 
                   As everyone reacts to the destruction of the Sphere.
                   But Picard has no time for celebration.

 PICARD                                      (to Data)
                             Mister Data, I want to know the
                             exact date and time.
                                     (to Riker)
                             Give me a damage report on that
                             missile silo.

 DATA                                      (works)
                             Today is March second, 2063. The

                             five.

 RIKER                                      (works)
                             Looks like they damaged the
                             silo...

 PICARD                              Life signs?

 RIKER                              Can't tell. Long-range bio-
                             sensors are off-line.

                   Picard thinks for a moment... makes an instant decision
                   and turns to Worf.

 PICARD                              Worf, have Doctor Crusher, Mister
                             La Forge and a security team meet
                             me in Transporter Room Three.
                             Civilian clothes.

 WORF                              Aye, sir.

                   Worf works. Riker turns to him, curious.

 RIKER                              Captain?

 PICARD                              In twenty-four hours, Zephram
                             Cochrane is supposed to conduct
                             the very first warp test... from
                             a missile silo in Montana. If I'm
                             right, the Borg were trying to
                             change the course of human history
                             by killing him or destroying his
                             ship.

 RIKER                                      (nods in understanding)
                             And if they succeed, humans won't
                             make First Contact with the
                             Vulcans tomorrow.
                                     (beat)
                             As First Officer I should be the
                             one beaming down...

 PICARD                              Normally, I would agree. But in
                             this case, the mission requires a
                             certain knowledge of 21st century
                             history. You're many things,
                             Number One, but you're not much of
                             an historian.

                   He grins slightly, has to agree.

 RIKER                              Good luck, sir.

 PICARD                              I'll keep in contact. You have
                             the Bridge.

                   Picard EXITS...

 CUT TO: 
 44 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM 44 
                   Picard, Geordi and THREE SECURITY GUARDS are checking
                   their phasers and tricorders. Everyone is wearing civilian
                   clothes. Geordi has a large engineering kit... Transporter 
                   Chief pulling on a civilian jacket. She looks a little 
                   frazzled - it's been a long day in Sickbay.

 BEVERLY                              Will somebody please tell me where 
                             we're going?

                   Beverly joins them on the pad.

 PICARD                              Montana.

                             everything. Why the hell are we --

                   They DEMATERIALIZE.

 CUT TO: 
 45 EXT. MONTANA PLAINS - CONTINUOUS - DAY 45 
                   Picard, Geordi, Beverly and the Security Team
                   MATERIALIZE on the vast, rolling plains of Montana.

 BEVERLY                                      (continuing)
                             -- going to Montana?

                   Picard and Geordi take out their tricorders and start
                   scanning the landscape.

 GEORDI                                      (off tricorder)
                             I have the silo, sir. Bearing

 PICARD                              Let's go.

                   They start walking...

 BEVERLY                              Go where? Hello? Is anyone going
                             to tell me what we're doing here?

 PICARD                              We're here to find Zephram
                             Cochrane. He may be injured or
                             dead.

 BEVERLY                              Cochrane... the inventor of warp
                             drive?

 PICARD                              Yes...

 BEVERLY                              But he's been dead for three
                             hundred...
                                     (realizes, long sigh)
                             Oh God... we've gone back in time
                             again, haven't we?

 PICARD                              I'm afraid so. If the Borg
                             succeed in preventing First
                             Contact with the Vulcans... Earth
                             will remain in the Second Dark
                             Age... an easy target when the
                             Borg arrive in the 24th century.

 BEVERLY                              Well, why didn't you just say so
                             in the first place?

                   Picard gives her a look. As they keep walking...

                   the sheet, revealing the face of a crewman.

 TROI                              Lieutenant Sandra Farrel.

                   WIDEN to REVEAL Troi and Data. Data is holding back

                   There is repair work going on in the b.g. Two medical
                   N.D.s stand by.

 TROI                              It appears death was caused by a
                             plasma discharge.

                             never left her post.

                   Troi glances at Data, who is clearly disturbed by the
                   sight of the dead woman, holding his EMOTIONS in check
                   with difficulty.

 TROI                              Did you know her?

 DATA                              Not very well. We met shortly
                             after the Enterprise-E was
                             commissioned. I found her to be
                             a most... promising officer.

                   Troi looks at him in concern.

 TROI                              Data... are you sure you're all
                             right?

 DATA                              I am still having difficulty
                             integrating certain emotions into
                             my programming. Grief, loss,
                             remorse...

 TROI                              We still have to make reports on
                             ten more crewmen killed in action.
                             Maybe you should deactivate your
                             emotion chip until we're done.

                   Data considers.

 DATA                              No. Human beings do not have that
                             luxury, and neither should I.

 TROI                              I will admit... there are times
                             when I wish I had an emotion chip
                             I could turn on and off.

 49 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE 49 
                   A WIDE SHOT of the ship. CAMERA CLOSES ON the AFT
                   SECTION of the ship, moving underneath of the hull,
                   pushing in on an area at the very bottom of the
                   Enterprise.

 50 INT. ENVIROMENTAL CONTROL 50 
                   Data and ENSIGN PORTER ENTER through a set of doors.
                   The lights are off in the room, dim. This is a large
                   room crammed with many conduits, gas tanks, 24th
                   century machinery and monitors. It's normally unmanned --
                   this is where oxygen, gravity, heat, and other
                   environmental conditions of the ship are controlled.
                   In a far corner of the room a CONDUIT leading to a
                   series of high-pressure TANKS labeled "D-O2" has
                   ruptured and is SPEWING a corrosive, poisonous GAS.

                   Data scans it with his tricorder.

 DATA                                       (to Porter)
                             One of the diathermic oxygen tanks
                             has been damaged.

 PORTER                                       (shocked)
                             Diathermic oxygen?

 DATA                              It is a new subsystem of Nova

                             hydropressure and temperature
                             variance.
                                      (beat)
                             Remain here. The gas is highly
                             corrosive to organic material. It
                             would liquefy your flesh on
                             contact.

 PORTER                              Be my guest, sir.

                   Data walks over to the spewing gas tank, and without
                   concern shoves both hands into the corrosive gas...

                   ... groping around for the broken conduit, finally grabs
                   hold of it... and with android strength BENDS the metal
                   conduit back into the bulkhead. The gas stops leaking.
                   Data is completely unaffected by the corrosive gas.

                             been some damage during the
                             attack.

 PORTER                              Right.

                   Porter moves around a corner, behind some equipment,
                   out of Data's vision...

 51 NEW ANGLE - PORTER 51 
                   who opens a PANEL on the wall. But instead of the neat
                   and orderly Starfleet technology, he is confronted by
                   a bizarre amalgam of organic and mechanical cabling,
                   diodes and what almost look like arteries. Some of the
                   tubes are pulsing with fluids and energy. Porter
                   reacts.

 PORTER                              What the hell...

                   Porter pulls aside a large conduit and stops. Buried
                   deep within the tangle of bio-circuits is what looks
                   like a HUMAN FACE covered with cybernetic tubes and
                   chips. It's barely discernable in the darkness and
                   clutter. Porter isn't even sure what he's looking at.
                   He leans in for a closer look... and suddenly the eyes
                   open.

 52 DATA 52 
                   who hears a THUMP and a sickening liquid CRUNCH from
                   off camera. He takes a few steps in that direction.

 DATA                              Ensign Porter?

                   He stands there for a moment, puzzled. Then a faint
                   SKITTERING SCRAPE can be heard -- like tiny claws on a
                   metal surface. He  whirls at the sound.

 DATA                              Ensign... are you all right?

                   No response. Data walks around the now deathly quiet
                   room... turns the corner to where Porter was working.
                   He's gone. The open panel is still there, and there
                   doesn't appear to be any place Porter could've gone.
                   Data looks puzzled, takes a step forward when his boots
                   make a squishing sound. He looks down...

                   Nothing. Data quickly turns and heads for the door.
                   There's a metallic SCRAPE above him and he looks up --

 53 TWO BORG 53 
                   are climbing to the ceiling like two spiders ready to
                   pounce. One of them has Porter and appears to be
                   inserting some horrible Borg device into his head.
                   Before Data can react, the second Borg suddenly lunges
                   at Data.

 CUT TO: 
 54 EXT. MONTANA PLAINS - MISSILE SILO - DAY 54 
                   The SILO is buried deep underground, but on the surface
                   there is a large, poured concrete MISSILE DOOR.

                   Built to withstand a nuclear blast, the door has
                   nevertheless been badly charred and damaged by the Borg
                   attack from orbit. There are large, smoking CRATERS
                   all around. Part of the ground seems to have COLLAPSED
                   to a depth of ten feet, like a sinkhole nearby. Picard
                   and his team approach.

 GEORDI                              This must be it.

 PICARD                              How serious is the damage?

 GEORDI                                       (off tricorder)
                             I'm having trouble scanning
                             underground. There's a lot of
                             radiation leaking from something.

 PICARD                              Probably from the nuclear warhead.
                             Cochrane was planning to use it to
                             ignite the warp drive.

                   As they speak, Beverly pulls out a hypospray and gives
                   everyone injections.

 BEVERLY                              This will protect us from the
                             radiation.

                   Geordi moves to the thick, concrete missile door, scans
                   it.

 GEORDI                              I'm picking up faint life signs
                             twenty meters below.

 PICARD                              There should be an access hatch
                             nearby...

                   Everyone spreads out... looking for the hatch. One of
                   the guards -- LANGE -- finds it.

 LANGE                              Over here.

                   Everyone rushes over to him. There's a small HATCH on
                   the ground that has been partially hidden by weeds and
                   brush. Geordi kneels down, starts working a complex-
                   looking LOCK on the hatch.

 GEORDI                              Alphanumeric lock. We need a
                             password to get in...

 PICARD                              I have the password right here.

                   Picard pulls out his phaser and everyone steps back.
                   He aims and FIRES at the hatch, which is BLOWN OPEN,
                   revealing a ladder that leads down into the darkness.
                   As they start to crawl inside...
 55 INT. MISSILE SILO - CONTROL ROOM 55 
                   This is the "mission control" for Cochrane's test site.
                   The underground room is filled with 21st century
                   equipment, consoles and monitors. One entire wall of
                   the room is dominated by a huge METAL BLAST DOOR, which
                   is now closed. We will learn that on the other side of
                   that door is the nuclear missile/warp ship itself.

                   The ceiling has partially collapsed. Chunks of
                   concrete and fallen beams have destroyed some of the
                   equipment...Only a few of the consoles are active, most
                   are dark or fritzing sporadically. The lights are out,
                   and the room is illuminated by a few smoldering fires.
                   Four dead bodies can be seen strewn around the room.
                   It's a scene of destruction.

 56 PICARD 56 
                   and his team ENTER the dark and smoking ruin. Beverly
                   and Picard move to one of the dead men, while Geordi
                   and the Security Guards move to the other three.
                   Beverly rolls the man onto his back -- he's clearly
                   dead. The name stitched on his uniform says Rippert.
                   Picard looks up.

 PICARD                                       (to others)
                             See if any of these men are
                             Cochrane.

                   Geordi and the Guards start checking the dead bodies.

 GEORDI                              Mitchell... DePaul...

 LANGE                              This one's a woman... named Kirby.

                   Picard and Beverly move toward the immense blast door.
                   As Beverly scans it, Picard glances at a nearby desk...
 57 THE DESK 57 
                   is littered with debris and various documents and
                   schematics. THREE PHOTOGRAPHS are pinned to a bulletin
                   board above the desk -- they show Zephram Cochrane and
                   two angles of his warp ship. The photos are odd-
                   looking, printed on what appears to be some sort of
                   cloth.

 BEVERLY                              There's a life sign behind this
                             door... about ten meters below.

                   Geordi moves to the door.

 GEORDI                              Blast door. It's designed to
                             protect the control room when the
                             missile is launched.

 PICARD                              There should be some kind of
                             manual release...

                   They hunt around for a moment. Geordi runs his hand
                   along the edge of the blast door. Picard turns to the
                   Guards.

 PICARD                                       (to Lange)
                             Get those fires out and then try
                             to restore main power to the
                             control room.

 LANGE                              Aye, sir.

                   The Guards move off.

 GEORDI                              Got it, Captain.

                   Geordi has found an emergency BOX with several
                   pneumatic tubes and a hydraulic lever labeled
                   "emergency use only." He pulls down the lever, there
                   is a hissing sound, and the blast door slowly SLIDES
                   DOWN into the floor. We can now see the MISSILE SILO
                   itself beyond the door. Picard, Geordi and Beverly
                   step into...

 58 INT. MISSILE SILO - CONTINUOUS 58 
                   Picard, Geordi and Beverly step onto the catwalk, which
                   surrounds the Silo walls. In the middle is the WARP
                   SHIP itself. It should look like an advanced ICBM
                   missile with a COCKPIT in place of the warhead, and
                   with numerous modifications to the fuselage. The
                   cockpit is on the same level as the control room. On
                   the side of the missile is the name "Phoenix". The
                   missile itself extends down another FOUR STORIES.
                   There are other catwalks below this one, with ladders
                   connecting the different levels. Beverly sees
                   something below.

 BEVERLY                              There.

 59 NEW ANGLE 59 
                   Two catwalks below we can see a man sprawled on the
                   grating. They all scramble down the ladders past the
                   massive missile. (NOTE: Because of the design of the
                   Silo, we will see the entire missile only in a few
                   shots. For the most part, our view is limited to
                   sections of the missile.)

                   Beverly reaches the man, who is lying face-down on the
                   metal grating. She scans him...

 BEVERLY                              Severe radiation exposure...

                   Geordi looks over at the section of the missile on
                   their level. The side panels have been removed,
                   revealing complex circuitry within.

                   Picard joins Beverly, who turns over the injured man.
                   It's ZEPHRAM COCHRANE -- the man whose picture we saw
                   on the Borg monitors. Beverly begins pulling devices
                   out of her medkit, injects Cochrane with a hypospray.
                   Cochrane is a man in his mid-forties. He has a
                   youthful, dynamic appearance marred by recent radiation
                   burns.

 PICARD                              It's Cochrane.

 BEVERLY                              I've stabilized him for now... but
                             he's in a coma and he's going to
                             need radiometric therapy. I want
                             to take him to the ship.

                   Picard nods, reaches into his pants pocket, takes out
                   a combadge.

 PICARD                              Picard to Enterprise.
                                      (no response)
                             Enterprise, please respond.

 GEORDI                              It could be the radiation,
                             Captain. Try from the surface.

                   Picard nods... then takes a deep breath, tries to
                   orient himself to the task at hand... there's a lot at
                   stake and a lot to do. He turns to Geordi.

 PICARD                              Mister La Forge, listen very
                             carefully. If you remember your
                             history... in less than twenty-
                             four hours, a Vulcan ship will be
                             passing through this system. When
                             it does, this ship needs to be in
                             space, flying at warp speed.

                   Geordi takes a deep breath, it's a tall order.

 GEORDI                              I'd better get started.

                   Geordi goes to work. Picard bends down and carefully
                   hoists Cochrane up into a fireman's carry. Beverly
                   follows him up the catwalk...

 CUT TO: 60 EXT. MISSILE SILO - DAY 60 
                   Minutes later. Cochrane is lying on the ground.
                   Beverly is kneeling beside him, unfolding a portable
                   stretcher from her medkit. Picard is checking two
                   combadges with a tricorder.

 PICARD                              It's not the radiation... and
                             there's nothing wrong with the
                             combadges... the Enterprise just
                             isn't responding.

 BEVERLY                              Jean-Luc, this man needs medical
                             attention, now.

 PICARD                              As I recall, the town of
                             Resurrection is about two
                             kilometers East of here. They
                             might have a hospital...

                   Picard looks troubled at the thought.

 BEVERLY                              What are we waiting for? Let's
                             go.

 PICARD                              It may not be that simple. This
                             is an extremely difficult and
                             paranoid time in human history.

 BEVERLY                              Are you saying they won't help us?

 PICARD                              I'm saying they might shoot us on
                             sight. You have to remember...
                             these people have watched their
                             entire way of life collapse around
                             them.

 BEVERLY                              There must be some good people...
                             even in this time.

 PICARD                              Let's hope so. Because if
                             Cochrane dies... the future may
                             die with him.

                   Picard kneels down and they begin to carefully put
                   Cochrane on the stretcher...
 CUT TO: 
 61 INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE 61 
                   Riker, Troi and Worf studying a MONITOR which shows a
                   three-dimensional DIAGRAM of the Enterprise, which
                   turns and rotates as needed. The schematic shows
                   battle damage and repair efforts.

 WORF                              I have assigned two damage control
                             teams to locate the source of our
                             communication problems. So far,
                             they've had no success.

 RIKER                              Assign another team if you need
                             to. I want to re-establish
                             communication with the Captain as
                             soon as possible.

                   Worf nods and begins making notes on a PADD.

 TROI                              Are we in any danger of being
                             detected by Earth defense systems?

 WORF                              There were no planetary defense
                             systems in this era. Their
                             weapons were designed to
                             fight each other... not
                             extraterrestrials.

 RIKER                              We have to start thinking about a
                             way to get home.
                                      (to Troi)
                             Analyze our readings from the
                             temporal vortex. We're going to
                             have to recreate whatever the Borg
                             did to --

                   Just then the ship SHUDDERS and the LIGHTS FLICKER.

 RIKER                               Report.

 TROI                                       (off console)
                             We just lost main power... and
                             we've got Class-Three alerts all
                             over the ship. I'm not sure
                             what's --

                   An ALARM goes off on Worf's console. He reacts to it.

 WORF                              A ship-wide decompression has been
                             initiated!

 RIKER                              What?

 TROI                              We're venting our internal
                             atmosphere directly into space!

 62 EXT. ENTERPRISE 62 
                   CLOSE ON THE SAUCER as vents and hatches POP OPEN on
                   the hull and GIANT JETS OF VAPOR start blowing out
                   into space.

 63 INT. CORRIDOR 63 
                   Crewmembers walking along are suddenly KNOCKED to the
                   floor as hurricane force WINDS blow through the
                   Corridor. The ship is venting air into space, creating
                   a virtual VACUUM inside the ship! The people in the
                   corridor grab onto the bulkheads, struggling to hang on
                   against the force of the wind...

 64 INT. BRIDGE 64 
                   Suddenly an emergency AIRLOCK on the Bridge OPENS.
                   VIOLENT WIND roars through the Bridge and everyone
                   hangs on. Troi is ripped out of her chair, flown
                   across the Bridge, slams up against the bulkhead,
                   struggling to hang on. Worf runs over, grabs her arm,
                   keeps her from flying out.

                   Riker manages to reach a control panel -- hits a button
                   and an EMERGENCY BULKHEAD finally slides down over the
                   airlock and the wind DIES DOWN. Everyone takes a beat.

 RIKER                              What the hell is happening, Worf?

 WORF                                       (off console)
                             It appears that someone has taken
                             over the Environmental Control
                             Room.

 TROI                              Someone...?

 RIKER                                       (realizing)
                             The Borg.  Some of them must've
                             beamed over before we destroyed
                             their ship.
                                      (to Worf)
                             Seal off that entire deck with
                             emergency force fields.

 TROI                              Wil... Data was down there.

 RIKER                                       (to Worf)
                             Mister Worf... find Data if you
                             can, but your top priority is
                             isolating the Borg.

 WORF                              Understood.

                   Worf heads for a Turbolift. OFF Riker's disturbed
                   expression...

 CUT TO: 
 65 CLOSE ON DATA'S FACE 65 
                   His eyes are closed. There's a beat, then his eyes fly
                   open and he looks around.

                   We PULL BACK slightly, revealing Data is lying on some
                   kind of tabletop with metallic clamps and restraints.
                   He tenses his arm and tries to move, but he is unable
                   to break the restraints. About two feet in front of
                   his face is what appears to be a bulkhead. There is a
                   cacophony of strange background NOISE -- scratching,
                   hisses, gurgling liquids, odd alien hums...

                   Suddenly, the table begins to MOVE. It ROTATES, and as
                   it does so we realize that Data has been hanging upside
                   down staring at the floor. It's a disorienting moment
                   as our perspective changes and Data rotates upright.

 66 DATA'S POV 66 
                   As the table gyrates, we REVEAL the ROOM slowly. And
                   we realize we're in --
 67 INT. BORG HIVE 67 
                   The Environmental Control Room seen earlier has now
                   been transformed into the INNER-SANCTUM of the BORG.
                   The room has a dark, moist, organic feel -- a tropical
                   jungle of cybernetic equipment.

                   The Borg are altering the room, converting Starfleet
                   technology and materials into the living, bio-
                   mechanical look of the Borg. We see one Borg drone
                   attach a small pod to a Starfleet console and activate
                   it. The pod immediately sends out a COMPLEX WEB of
                   BORG TECHNOLOGY which covers the Starfleet console
                   inside and out. It's like weeds overpowering a flower
                   bed -- within seconds the console has been BORGIFIED.

                   The walls, ceiling and floor are now honeycombed with
                   the ALCOVES that make up the BORG COLLECTIVE. Borg
                   drones are motionless in their alcoves, cabling and
                   other conduits connecting them to various equipment...
                   while other Borg are moving about the room, carrying
                   out various modifications to the room. At one point,
                   we see Ensign Porter. He's been completely Borgified.
                   His skin pale, expression blank. No hint of humanity
                   left.

 68 DATA 68 
                   still strapped to the table, which is twisting and
                   rotating, giving him frightening new glimpses of the
                   room. A new image appears -- SIX BORG DRONES are
                   clustered together in one section of the room, each
                   with an elaborate series of hoses and conduits
                   connected to its face.

                   Through the tubes we can see an exchange of FLUID and
                   ENERGY pulsing back and forth -- some sort of bizarre
                   "feeding" or "renewal" is going on. The tubes all seem
                   to lead toward the ceiling.

                   Data is now horizontal on his back and the table LOCKS
                   into position. A Borg drone OPENS A PANEL on the side
                   of Data's head, and begins connecting a thick bundle of
                   optical cabling to it.

 DATA                                       (to Borg)
                             Your efforts to assimilate me will
                             be unsuccessful.

                   The Borg ignores him, activates a console... and the
                   cabling connected to Data's head LIGHTS UP with power.
                   They're trying to connect him to the Collective.

                   Data thinks for a moment, tilts his head slightly...
                   and then suddenly there's a SHOWER of SPARKS from the
                   cabling he's been connected to. The lights on the
                   cable go out. Data has thwarted their attempts.

 DATA                                       (to Borg)
                             It would appear that resistance is
                             not always futile.

                   Suddenly a new VOICE is heard echoing through the room -- 
                   a woman's voice, low, seductive, deadly:

 WOMAN'S VOICE                              Brave words. I've heard them
                             before from thousands of species
                             across thousands of worlds...
                             since long before you were
                             created.

                   Data looks up toward...

 69 THE CEILING 69 
                   A RUSTLE of MOVEMNET somewhere in the cyber-tangle...
                   almost like a snake slithering beneath the weeds. And
                   for a brief instant we get a glimpse of a FACE unlike
                   any Borg we've ever seen. The face of a woman. Pale-
                   skinned... piercing eyes...raven hair slicked back...
                   a hauntingly beautiful image in a sea of nightmarish
                   technology. And then it's gone.

 70 DATA 70 
                   Frowns. He saw it, too, but he's not sure what to make
                   of it.

 WOMAN'S VOICE                              But now... they are all one with
                             the Borg.

 DATA                              I am unlike any lifeform you have
                             encountered before. As an
                             android, I am in complete control
                             of my neural net. The information
                             contained there cannot be forcibly
                             removed.

 WOMAN'S VOICE                              You are an imperfect being...
                             created by an imperfect being.
                             Finding your weakness is only a
                             matter of time.

                   Suddenly three Borg drones converge on Data with
                   various wicked-looking Borg devices. One of the Borg
                   has a specialized cybernetic ARM, which EXTRUDES a
                   series of stiletto-tipped DRILL SPIKES. As the six-
                   inch spikes begin to BORE INTO Data's head...

 71 EXT. MONTANA - RESURRECTION CITY - DAY 71 
                   Resurrection is a small town -- around 1,000 people --
                   a rural, Western community that's probably existed for
                   at least two hundred years, and we can see the roots of
                   the original ranching community in some of the
                   architecture. But it's also a community of the 21st
                   century.

                   The most striking feature of the town is that it sits
                   in the middle of nearly a hundred WIND MILLS, which
                   provide the only source of power for the town. The
                   blades are enormous, but the structures supporting them
                   are little more than simple poles. Some are sleek,
                   fiberglass, futuristic... others have a more cobbled
                   together, make-shift appearance. At the moment, only
                   a few blades are turning in the gentle breeze.

                   Picard and Beverly emerge from the nearby woods
                   carrying the stretcher. They exchange a look at the
                   sight of the city and then head toward it...

 72 EXT. RESURRECTION CITY - DAY 72 
                   A few minutes later. Picard and Beverly carrying
                   Cochrane down the street toward the hospital at the
                   end. As they walk along, we get our first taste of
                   post-apocalyptic 21st century life:

                   This is a recognizable American community, but it's
                   definitely a futuristic town. Clothing, architecture,
                   technology -- all have changed over the course of
                   seventy years. But it is a broken future. What used
                   to be high-tech public COMPUTER TERMINALS are rusted
                   and abandoned. We can see the corroded hulks of HOVER-
                   CARS lying idle in the streets. Futuristic elements
                   now useless.

                   At one point, they pass a large polyurethane TENT --
                   the inside surface is covered with condensation and we
                   can see the silhouettes of people moving within. The
                   entrance is guarded by a single Militia Guard. Later
                   we will learn that this is a primitive greenhouse, the
                   only place where they can grow uncontaminated food.

                   What used to be a McDonald's, or some other
                   recognizable food chain, has now been gutted and has
                   been turned into a kind of blacksmith shop. People are
                   fashioning metal into various tools using hammer and
                   tongs.

                   The sidewalks are populated with PEOPLE, who congregate
                   in small groups, quietly talking amongst themselves,
                   others just staring vacantly off into space. Many of
                   them have visible burn scars and damage to their bodies --
                   victims of the war and post-nuclear environmental
                   dangers. A few of them are applying a special lotion
                   to their arms and face -- protection against the toxic
                   elements. A long FOOD LINE snakes around a block, as
                   people line up to get their daily rations.

                   A few people glance up at Picard and Beverly with
                   curious or suspicious looks. This is not a community
                   that welcomes strangers. At one point, they see a man
                   dressed in futuristic CAMOUFLAGE carrying an automatic
                   weapon -- we will learn he's a MILITIA SOLDIER. He
                   stares at them with a neutral expression, then walks
                   off.

                   The people here have that hollow-eyed, listless look
                   about them. They're going through something that makes
                   the Great Depression look like a minor inconvenience.
                   But there's also a toughness to these people, a
                   resilience and determination to survive in the face of
                   overwhelming odds. We are looking at our future... and
                   it's on the verge of collapse.

 CUT TO: 
 73 INT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY 73 
                   A short time later. Cochrane is being lifted onto an
                   operating table. Picard and Beverly step back from the
                   table as a DOCTOR and two NURSES look him over. The
                   doctor is in his early fifties and has a weathered,
                   tired look to him. The hospital itself is like the
                   rest of the town -- a futuristic setting fallen on hard
                   times. The light in the room is provided mostly from
                   the sunlight streaming in through the windows. Light
                   bulbs and other gear flicker dimly around the hospital --
                   we get the feeling they have very little power.

 DOCTOR                              How long has he been unconscious?

 BEVERLY                              At least four hours.

                   He checks Cochran's head injury as Beverly takes out
                   her tricorder and scans him.

 DOCTOR                              It looks like he has a cranial
                             fracture, but I'll need X-rays to
                             be sure.
                                      (to Nurse)
                             Get Ruby in here.

                   One of the nurses runs off.

 BEVERLY                                       (off tricorder)
                             He has a severe fracture of the
                             left occipital plate. He's not
                             hemorrhaging... but the radiation
                             has damaged his KNA and his APR
                             cell count...

                   He looks at her curiously.

 DOCTOR                              "APR cell count?" What the hell
                             are you talking about?

 PICARD                                      (quickly)
                             Doctor Crusher has been...
                             studying some advanced medical
                             theories.

 NURSE                                      (re: tricorder)
                             What is that?

 BEVERLY                              It's a... new medical scanner.
                             It's a little more precise than an
                             X-ray machine.

                   The Doctor eyes it.

 DOCTOR                              Is it Japanese?

 BEVERLY                              Um... yeah.
                                     (beat)
                             Now he's going to need a
                             respirator. Do you have one?

 DOCTOR                              We have two... but we don't have
                             the juice to run them.

 PICARD                              Juice?

 DOCTOR                              Power. There hasn't been a lot of
                             wind through here for the last
                             couple of weeks. Most of the
                             batteries are depleted.

 BEVERLY                              Don't you have any generators, or
                             other fuel sources?

                   The Doctor throws her an irritated look.

 DOCTOR                              Maybe you'd like to take your
                             patient to the hospital in
                             Bozemen... it's only two hundred
                             miles away.

                   Cochrane wheezes -- breathing becoming labored and
                   ragged. Beverly scans him, urgent.

 BEVERLY                              His automatic reflexes are
                             fluctuating. We've got to get him
                             on a respirator.

 DOCTOR                                      (to Nurse)
                             Bag him.

                   The nurse picks up a portable respirator sack -- puts
                   it on Cochrane's face and squeezes the bag, forcing air
                   into Cochrane's lungs. Picard has been thinking
                   through this scene, finally has a solution.
 PICARD                              Beverly -- your tricorder.

                   She hands him her tricorder.

 PICARD                                     (to Doctor)
                             Where's the battery room for the
                             hospital?

 DOCTOR                              I told you, there's no --

 PICARD                              Where?

 DOCTOR                              Outside, around back. Next to the
                             water tank.
                    Picard rushes out the doors. Beverly checks Cochrane's
                   pulse.

 BEVERLY                              His heartbeat's irregular...
                    Beverly climbs up on top of Cochrane, straddling him,
                   begins giving him 24th century CPR. She takes charge.
 BEVERLY                              Adrenaline -- ten CC's!

                   As they rush to save him.
 74 EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY 74 
                   The back of the building. Picard rushes out and spots
                   an old, dilapidated BATTERY UNIT providing power to the
                   hospital. He quickly yanks off the back panel,
                   revealing a tangle of wires, and several large
                   batteries. He kneels down, then removes the back of
                   the tricorder.
 75 CLOSE ON TRICORDER 75 
                   as Picard pulls out a small POWER CELL -- about half
                   the size of a dime. The blinkies on the tricorder go
                   out.

 76 PICARD 76 
                   holds the power cell with one hand, and starts pulling
                   out wires from the batteries with the other.

 77 INT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY 77 
                   As before. Beverly, the doctor and the nurse trying to
                   save Cochrane.

 BEVERLY                                      (pumping his chest)
                             One... two... three... compress!

                   The nurse squeezes the bag. Suddenly the room is
                   filled with the HUM of POWER and ALL OF THE LIGHTS AND
                   EQUIPMENT COME TO LIFE. Monitors blinking, fluorescent
                   lights flashing on. Everyone reacts with shock.

 78 INT. HOSPITAL WARD - DAY 78 
                   It's filled with patients. The lights and equipment
                   here FLASH ON, as well. Doctors and patients alike
                   react with surprise.

 79 INT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY 79 
                   Picard enters. They've placed a RESPIRATOR down
                   Cochrane's throat, and attached electrodes to his
                   chest. Beverly has just finished giving him an
                   injection with a hypospray. The heart monitor in the
                   background is now beating regularly. The doctor turns
                   to Picard.

 DOCTOR                              What did you do to the batteries?

 PICARD                              Oh... just a little tinkering.
                             How is he?

 BEVERLY                              He's stable... for now.
                                     (with meaning)
                             But it would be better if we could
                             contact... our friends.

 PICARD                              Yes. But until then, you'll have
                             to make do with what you've got.

 BEVERLY                              That'll be interesting.

 A WOMAN'S VOICE: 
 RUBY'S VOICE                              What happened to him?

                   Everyone turns.

 80 NEW ANGLE 80 
                   revealing RUBY SLOANE standing at the front of
                   Cochrane's bed. A striking woman in her mid-to-late
                   thirties -- dark hair, tall, lean, beautiful under
                   normal circumstances but at the moment she's not at her
                   best, it looks like she's just come in from a hard
                   day's work. She's wearing an old lab coat. But the
                   most striking quality of all is the innate intelligence
                   we can see in her eyes.

                   She's looking directly at Picard for an answer. Picard
                   realizes he has to say something. He looks into her
                   eyes and there is a moment here -- a brief spark of
                   chemistry that in normal circumstances the Captain just
                   might follow up. But at the moment, he shoves that
                   electric feeling aside and tries to give her an answer.

 PICARD                              There was some kind of explosion
                             out at the missile silo...

                   She looks at him for a moment, her eyes boring into him
                   without expression, as though probing the truthfulness
                   of his statement.

 DOCTOR                              Ruby, we're going to need a series 
                             of cranial X-rays tonight.

 RUBY                                      (nods)
                             I have a fresh set of plates at
                             home. I'll have them here by
                             eight.

                   She turns back to Cochrane, moves to his side, gently
                   takes his hand and looks at him with sad affection.

 RUBY                                      (quiet)
                             Take care of him. He's a very
                             special man.

 PICARD                              Yes, he is.

                   She looks up at Picard, and again there's a slight
                   feeling of chemistry in the air. And then she turns
                   and starts to walk out of the room. Picard's combadge
                   BEEPS. Reactions.

 GEORDI'S COM VOICE                              La Forge to Picard.

 RUBY                                      (stopping)
                             I think there's someone in your
                             pants.

 PICARD                              Excuse me. I have a... telephone
                             call.

                   Picard takes a few steps away, pulls the combadge out
                   of his pants pocket, taps it. Ruby watches him a beat,
                   then walks out of the room.

 PICARD                              Picard here.

 GEORDI'S COM VOICE                              Captain, we have a problem. I
                             think you'd better get back here.

 PICARD                              I'm on my way. Picard out.

                   Picard moves to Beverly.

 PICARD                                      (sotto)
                             I have to go back to the silo.
                             Will you be all right?

 BEVERLY                              I'll be fine.
                                     (re: Cochrane)
                             He's a different story.

                   Beverly begins examining the medical equipment she'll
                   have to work with as Picard exits...

 81 EXT. RESURRECTION CITY STREET - DAY 81 
                   A short time later. Picard walking down the main
                   street back toward the gates. People passing him,
                   taking no notice of him...Picard's mind thinking
                   ahead. He happens to glance down a side street, then
                   he stops.

 82 NEW ANGLE 82 
                   Looking down the side street. Ruby, the mysterious
                   woman from the hospital, is walking along with a camera
                   bag now slung over her shoulder. She stops for a
                   moment as she passes the hulk of a burnt-out old hover
                   car... stares at it...then pulls a home-made
                   FUTURISTIC CAMERA out of her bag and snaps a picture of
                   the car. She continues on her way. Picard is
                   intrigued -- wonders about this woman and what it is
                   she could be taking a picture of. Just then --

 MAN'S VOICE                              Catch.

                   Picard turns just in time to catch a small, metal
                   canister with a screw-top.

                   The man who threw it steps into view. It's LIEUTENANT
                   SCRIMM. Scrimm is the head of the town's militia.
                   While not a physically threatening man, there is a
                   quietly disturbing quality about him which conveys an
                   intelligence laced with a tightly reined volatility.
                   He's wearing futuristic combat fatigues and always
                   carries a sidearm. Before the war, Scrimm was probably
                   one of the "survivalists" who used to be dismissed as
                   radicals until their predictions of Armageddon came
                   true. At the moment, Scrimm is presenting his
                   friendliest face to Picard.

 SCRIMM                                      (pleasant)
                             Think you'll need that.

                   Picard eyes the canister, not sure what to make of it.

 SCRIMM                              It's no zone solution.
                                    (off his look)
                             You know. "No ozone."

                   He points to the sky.

 PICARD                              Oh...  yes... ultraviolet
                             protection. Thank you.
                             Mister...?

 SCRIMM                              Lieutenant, actually. Lieutenant
                             Jonathan Scrimm. I'm the head of
                             the Resurrection Protective Force.
                                     (beat)
                             And you are?

 PICARD                              Jean-Luc Picard.

 SCRIMM                              Great name. French?

 PICARD                              Yes.

 SCRIMM                              You don't sound French.

                   Scrimm is still smiling at him, but his eyes never
                   leave Picard.

 PICARD                              I was raised in England and here
                             in the States. Thank you for
                             the... no zone.

                   Picard begins to walk away, not wanting to engage any
                   citizens of the town. Scrimm falls in next to him.

 SCRIMM                              Where in the States?

 PICARD                              Oh... here and there. You know
                             how it is.
 SCRIMM                              Not really. I was born and raised
                             right here. Never had much use
                             for travel.

                   He casually steps in front of Picard, blocking his way.

 SCRIMM                              Where are you from most recently?

 PICARD                                      (thinking fast)
                             California. San Francisco.

 SCRIMM                              Beautiful city. Used to be,
                             anyway. I didn't think anyone
                             still lived there.

 PICARD                              There's a few of us left.

                   Picard steps around him and continues walking down the
                   street. Scrimm waits a beat, then walks after him
                   again.

 SCRIMM                              That was a pretty clever trick you
                             did with the hospital's batteries.
                             How'd you do it?

 PICARD                              It wasn't a trick. I used to be
                             an electrical engineer.

 SCRIMM                              Huh.

                   He steps in front of Picard again, still pleasant but
                   a little bit of a smile fading from his face. Picard
                   realizes he isn't going to shake this man so easily.

 SCRIMM                              And what were you doing out at the
                             missile silo?

 PICARD                              I'm an old friend of Cochrane's...
                             I wanted to see how he was doing.

 SCRIMM                              Lucky for him you came by when you
                             did. He might be dead now.

 PICARD                              Yes.

 SCRIMM                              Maybe you can tell me what he's
                             been doing in that silo. We heard
                             some explosions out there this
                             morning...

 PICARD                              I think he was running a test on
                             an old rocket engine... and one of
                             the fuel cells burst.

                   Scrimm eyes him evenly.

 SCRIMM                              You seem to have an answer for
                             everything.

 PICARD                              Something wrong with that?

 SCRIMM                              Not yet.

                   A tense beat. Then Scrimm smiles easily.

 SCRIMM                                      (re: balm)
                             Be sure you put that on. You need
                             a lot of protection around here.

                   He holds Picard's eyes for a moment.

 PICARD                              Thank you. But I've never had
                             much trouble protecting myself.

                   Now it's Picard's turn to smile pleasantly at Scrimm.
                   Picard walks around him and heads for the gates.
                   Scrimm watches him go with a thoughtful expression --
                   clearly, he's more than a little suspicious...

 CUT TO: 
 83 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE 83 
                   in orbit of Earth.

 84 INT. CORRIDOR 84 
                   Worf and a large SECURITY DETACHMENT -- a dozen or so
                   men and women -- are moving down the Corridor with grim
                   looks on their faces. They are carrying new powerful-
                   looking phaser rifles and other equipment. The feeling
                   is of an elite combat squad heading for a dangerous
                   mission. They stop at one point and Worf lifts up a
                   DECKPLATE, exposing a large HATCH in the floor. Worf
                   hits his combadge.

 WORF                              Worf to Bridge. We're in
                             position.

 85 INT. BRIDGE 85 
                   Riker in command, Troi nearby. Riker is standing at
                   the security station looking at a monitor which
                   displays a schematic graphic of the ship. The position
                   of the security team is flashing -- we can see they are
                   on Deck 46.

 RIKER                              This is the Bridge. I'm releasing
                             the emergency force fields.

                   He nods to Troi, who works a console.

 86 INT. CORRIDOR 86 
                   Worf and his team watch as the FORCEFIELD protecting
                   the hatch flashes off. Worf reaches down and releases
                   the hatch, which slides open with a soft whoosh. He
                   glances at his men for a moment, then JUMPS down the
                   hatch...

 87 INT. DECK 47 - CORRIDOR 87 
                   As Worf lands on his feet. The light is dim, no power
                   on this deck, hard to see. He looks around warily for
                   a moment, phaser at-the-ready, then activates his wrist
                   beacon. We immediately notice that we can see Worf's
                   breath -- it's freezing cold down here. He shines the
                   light around the darkened corridor, then silently
                   motions his arm for the others to follow. A beat, then
                   we see the security officers start to drop into the
                   corridor from the hatch above...

 88 NEW ANGLE - CORRIDOR 88 
                   As Worf's squad spreads out along the hall, weapons at-
                   the-ready, everyone alert with fingers on the triggers.
                   We see that the phaser rifles are equipped with their
                   own light sources, intended to illuminate the target
                   before you shoot at it. The Security Officers are
                   constantly moving their lights back and forth through
                   the chilly air. Worf gives hand signals -- holds up
                   two fingers, then a fist, and points forward.

                   Two Guards trot down the corridor about fifteen feet,
                   stop, and take up firing positions... then two more
                   members of the team run down, leap frog ahead of them
                   and take positions further down the corridor. Classic
                   military deployment. Worf starts scanning with a
                   tricorder.

 WORF                                      (hits combadge)
                             Worf to Bridge.

 RIKER'S COM VOICE                              Riker here.

 WORF                              There's a dampening field in place
                             on this deck. Our tricorders are
                             useless.

                   The team continue to explore Deck 47. It's spooky,
                   eerie, a sense of menace around every corner. They
                   open doors, check room by room, section by section,
                   still no sign of the Borg in the freezing cold
                   darkness.

 90 ANGLE ON SECURITY GUARD 90 
                   The Corridor directly ahead has been stripped of wall,
                   ceiling and deck panels -- all the normal decorative
                   Enterprise sheathing is gone, revealing the circuitry
                   and machinery of the ship itself. Unlike the rest of
                   the corridors, there does appear to be POWER flowing
                   through some of the conduits up ahead, and it gives off
                   an eerie glow.

                   We can also see that some of the machinery has been
                   altered and changed -- not just the neat and orderly
                   arrangement you'd expect to find behind bulkheads --
                   there's a sense of cross-circuitry, re-wiring,
                   equipment being rearranged. Clearly, a lot of work has
                   gone on in this area of the ship. Worf steps forward,
                   examines the corridor closely.

 ENSIGN HAWK                              What the hell is going on?

 WORF                              Borg...

                   Worf signals the team forward, and they slowly begin
                   picking their way down the Borgified Corridor. It's
                   not easy -- they have to choose their footing carefully
                   as they walk through the maze of cables, circuits, and
                   machinery... Ensign Hawk accidentally steps on some
                   circuitry, which gives off a BEEP. The entire team
                   suddenly whirls their lights and weapons on the
                   unfortunate Ensign, who pales at their sudden attention.

                   Worf looks irritated, then motions his team to continue
                   their search. They continue making their way down the
                   spooky corridor... and as they turn a corner...

 92 NEW ANGLE - ANOTHER CORRIDOR 92 
                   where the machinery is now THICKER and more BORG-LIKE
                   in appearance. Tubes and cabling hang down from the
                   ceiling. If anything, it's even colder in here. The
                   deeper they go, the worse it gets. We can now hear a
                   low, sinister HUM of alien power. At the end of this
                   corridor is the ENVIROMENTAL CONTROL ROOM, as seen
                   earlier. The entire doorway is gone -- and a weird
                   pulsing GLOW fills the room. Worf stops his team at
                   the sight. From this vantage, we cannot see directly
                   into the room, but clearly something is going on in
                   there.

                   Worf signals his men to spread out, and they take up
                   positions around the Corridor, all weapons trained on
                   Environmental Control.

 WORF                              Worf to Bridge. We're about to
                             enter the Environmental Control
                             Room.

 RIKER'S COM VOICE                              Any sign of Data, or the Borg
                             themselves?

                   As Work and Riker continue talking, we MOVE TO Ensign
                   Hawk, who is now the last man in the formation,
                   covering the rear. He's shining his phaser-beacon into
                   the empty darkness. He can't help looking back over
                   his shoulder at the rest of the team and the distant
                   Environmental Control Room -- that seems to be where
                   the action is. As he turns, his beacon moves with him,
                   throwing the Corridor behind them in and out of
                   darkness.

 WORF                                      (continuing)
                              Negative. However, they've
                              reconfigured the ODN network...
                              and re-routed all power on this
                              deck into Environmental Control.

                   As Worf speaks, Ensign Hawk turns back, but this time
                   when he shines his beacon into the darkness, something
                   MOVES in the distance -- a shadow. The Ensign freezes,
                   brings his rifle up. But did he see it, or was it his
                   imagination?

                   A tense beat as he waits, heart pounding... but nothing
                   happens. On the wall next to his head we see what can
                   only be described as a BIO-MECHANISTIC CABLE creeping
                   out of the wall... which begins slowly heading for the
                   Ensign's neck. Just as he begins to sense that
                   something is happening behind him, the cable WHIPS OUT
                   around his neck and YANKS him deep into the bed of
                   circuitry in the blink of an eye -- the motion so fast
                   we have trouble following it.

                   Worf turns his head at the sound.

 WORF                              Stand by, Commander
                                     (to team)
                             Where's Ensign Hawk?

                   Everyone looks around, surprised that he's not there.
                   Everyone is alert, keyed up. The tension is thick.
                   Utter silence, except for the hum of the machinery and
                   the frosty breathing of the team.

 RIKER'S COM VOICE                              Worf? Is something wrong?

 WORF                              Something is very wrong,
                             Commander. We're falling back.

                   Worf gives hand signals for the team to move out. But
                   just as they start to fall back, everything happens at
                   once.

 93 BORG DRONES 93 
                   EXPLODE OUT OF THE WALLS, CEILING AND FLOOR! What
                   follows is a BLUR of action happening so fast and
                   furious we never get a true sense of what's happening.

                   A flurry of violence and motion and images:

                   -- A snarling Borg face -- half-human, half-machine, a
                      cybernetic nightmare.

                   -- Strange, bio-mechanical WEAPONS extruding from Borg
                      bodies, RIPPING into human flesh.

                   -- A crewmember PULLED into a bed of machinery.

 WORF                              Fire at will!

                   But the Borg are already on top of them. It's a brutal
                   fight in close quarters with no escape.

                   Phasers and Borg lasers lighting up the corridor,
                   bodies flying through the air... utter chaos and
                   terror. The fight goes hand to hand and Worf sees that
                   they don't have a chance...

 WORF                                      (throwing off a Borg)
                             Fall back!

                   The team starts backpedaling, FIRING as they go...but
                   the Borg are unstoppable now -- they put up personal
                   force fields to protect themselves.

 WORF                              Go, go, GO!

                   Worf pushes his men down the corridor. Everyone turns
                   and RUNS like hell. Worf bends down and grabs a
                   frightened Lieutenant by the collar, pulling him along.

 94 VARIOUS SHOTS: 94 
                   -- The team running through the corridors, SHOOTING
                      behind them at the pursuing Borg, to no effect...

                   -- Two of the Borg raise their arms and FIRE LASER
                      BURSTS out of their arms and wrists, taking DOWN two
                      Security Guards. Worf sees them fall but there's no
                      time to go back.

 95 INT. DECK 46 - CORRIDOR 95 
                   As Worf's team starts CLIMBING UP and out the dark
                   hatch in the floor seen earlier.
 96 INT. DECK 47 - CORRIDOR 96 
                   As the last member of Worf's team climbs out to safety.
                   The Borg swarm is about to overpower Worf. He quickly
                   hits a few controls on his phaser, sets it to overload.
                   We hear the building WHINE. He JUMPS straight up into
                   the air, GRABBING onto the hatch rim, pulling himself
                   up. He barely manages to vanish from view just as the
                   phaser EXPLODES in a FIERY BLAST, taking out several of
                   the Borg drones.

 97 INT. DECK 46 - CORRIDOR 97 
                   The conclusive BLAST comes up through the hatch,
                   causing Worf to duck for a moment.

                   Worf reaches out to close the hatch, when a BORG HAND 
                   bursts up from below and GRABS his forearm. It's a 
                   test of strength. Worf reaches over with his other
                   arm, hits a control and the hatch SLIDES CLOSED,
                   SEVERING the Borg arm in a shower of sparks.

 WORF                              Worf to Bridge -- force fields!

                   The force field FLASHES into place. Worf and his team
                   sit there a moment, catching their breath, stunned at
                   what they've just been through.

 RIKER'S COM VOICE                              What the hell happened down there,
                             Worf?

 WORF                              Commander... we have a problem.
                    OFF Worf's shaken expression...

 CUT TO: 
 98 INT. MISSILE SILO - CATWALK - DAY 98 
                   Geordi and Picard are walking down the catwalk ladders
                   toward the missile's massive engines. Now that the
                   smoke has cleared and the place has been cleared up a
                   bit, we get our first good look at the ship and the
                   damage done in the Borg attack.

 GEORDI                                      (on the move)
                             Cochrane was going to use this
                             solid rocket booster to lift the
                             ship into orbit. Before the warp
                             drive took over... everything
                             would depend on these old chemical
                             engines.
                                     (beat)
                             Now here's the problem...

                   They arrive at a point on the fuselage where we can see
                   a large section of the engines have been BLASTED AWAY,
                   leaving a deep, ugly SCAR -- broken conduit lines,
                   wires that now lead to nothing. It's clear that a key
                   piece of equipment has been destroyed.

 GEORDI                                      (re: damage)
                             This used to be the throttle valve
                             assembly.
                                     (observing it)  
                             It controls the thrust of the
                             engines. It's been completely
                             vaporized... and without it,
                             there's no way to launch the ship.

 PICARD                              Can you reconstruct the throttle
                             valve?

 GEORDI                              Yeah... if I knew what it looked
                             like. There's probably five
                             hundred ways to design a valve
                             like this...

 PICARD                              We need to launch this ship in
                             under eighteen hours...
                                     (beat)
                             There must be some design
                             schematics... blueprints...

 GEORDI                              We're tearing this place apart
                             looking for them... but the
                             computers are down, and the fires
                             destroyed half the files...so
                             far, nothing.

                   They look at the damage in frustration.

 GEORDI                              If it was just part of the warp
                             drive, I'd know what to do. But
                             this... it's like trying to
                             rebuild Orville Wright's airplane
                             with canvass and sticks.

                   Picard thinks, remembers something.

 PICARD                              Wait a minute...

 99 INT. CONTROL ROOM 99 
                   Moments later. Picard and Geordi are looking at the
                   three cloth-printed photographs seen earlier -- the
                   headshot of Cochrane and two different angles of the
                   three cloth-printed photographs seen earlier -- the
                   warp ship with people working on it. Picard spreads
                   them out on the desk.

 GEORDI                              Yeah, I looked at these already.

                   Geordi points to a photo of the ship -- a worker is
                   walking in front of the throttle assembly, blocking
                   most of it from view.

 GEORDI                              You can almost see the throttle
                             assembly in this one... but this
                             guy walked in front of it when
                             they took the picture.

                   Picard considers, absently sticks his hand in his
                   jacket pocket. He pulls out the canister of balm
                   Scrimm gave him and tosses it onto the table.

 PICARD                              Could you reconstruct the throttle
                             from a photograph like this... if
                             that man wasn't blocking the view?

                   Geordi thinks it over.

 GEORDI                              Maybe...
                                     (beat)
                             Sure. Yeah. As long as I could
                             get a clear look at the intake
                             configuration. But so far, we
                             haven't found any other photos.

 PICARD                                      (staring at photos)
                             If there are other photographs...
                             I think I may know how to find
                             them.

 CUT TO: 
 100 INT. BORG HIVE 100 
                   It's a while later, and the Borg are making progress.
                   Data is strapped to the table, PANELS open on his HEAD
                   and CHEST. Three Borg drones are working methodically
                   on his inner-circuitry. The jagged voice of the woman
                   cuts in:

 WOMAN'S VOICE                              Your resistance is... illogical.
                             To us, your neural net is simply
                             another piece of technology. We
                             will learn its secrets.

                   Data stares at the murky ceiling.

 DATA                              Who are you?

 WOMAN'S VOICE                              I am the Borg.

 DATA                              That is a contradiction. The Borg
                             act as a collective consciousness.
                             There are no individuals.

 WOMAN'S VOICE                              I am the beginning... the end. I
                             am the one who is many. I am the
                             Borg.

                   Out of the mist that hugs the top of the room DESCENDS
                   the BORG QUEEN.

                   She is unlike any of the Borg drones we've ever seen --
                   a humanoid female with conduits and tubes running out
                   of her body. She has no legs. Her torso is SUSPENDED
                   by a complex rig of CABLES and HYDRAULICS. Her face
                   and upper-torso are much more humanoid, with the pasty-
                   pale white of Borg flesh. Her EYES have a silvery
                   glint to them. Her demeanor is seductive and sensual
                   in contrast to the harsh, mechanical surroundings. She
                   is an eerie blend of two worlds -- organic and
                   mechanical.

                   With the soft HISS of hydraulics, she LOWERS herself
                   down to where her face is very close to that of Data's.
                   Her features are almost angelic, but the silvery glint
                   in her eyes betrays an inner-darkness.

 DATA                              You are the guiding intelligence
                             behind the Borg...?

 BORG QUEEN                              Intelligence... ambition...
                             desire... I bring order to
                             chaos...

                   She studies his face with a certain child-like quality.

 BORG QUEEN                              It's unfortunate we will have to
                             destroy you to obtain the
                             information we need. You are a...
                             unique lifeform.
                                     (beat)
                             Synthetic... and yet far more than
                             a simple automaton.
                             You have no idea how close to
                             perfection you are.
                    She stares at him intently, and we get the hint that
                   her interest in Data may go beyond simple assimilation.
                   She seems fascinated by him. Data picks up on this.

 DATA                              How do you define perfection?

                   The Queen opens her arms slightly, clearly indicating
                   herself.

 BORG QUEEN                              A blending of the organic and the
                             synthetic. The highest form of
                             life in the galaxy.

                   Data eyes her, considering.

 DATA                              An interesting definition. But it
                             is not one that applies to me. I
                             am completely artificial. I have
                             no organic components.

                   She looks at him as a new thought crosses her mind.
                   She might've just found the chink in Data's armor.

 BORG QUEEN                              Have you ever wondered what it's
                             like to have flesh?

 DATA                              It is impossible to imagine
                             sensations for which I have no
                             frame of reference.
                    She smiles.

 BORG QUEEN                              That... can change.

                   The Queen looks to the three Borg drones and gives them
                   a silent command. The drones immediately stop working
                   on Data's open panels... and shift their attention to
                   his right ARM. One of the drones tears off the sleeve
                   on Data's uniform, exposing his bare arm. Another then
                   uses a small cutting device to SLICE OFF the synthetic
                   skin from Data's arm. As Data prepares himself for the
                   worst...

 101 INT. ENTERPRISE CORRIDOR 101 
                   THREE armored SECURITY GUARDS with phaser rifles run
                   into view, hit a control panel on the wall. A giant
                   EMERGENCY BULKHEAD comes SLAMMING down, cutting off the
                   rest of the corridor.

                   The security guards turn to run down the hall, but then
                   there is a high-pitched shriek of wrenching metal.
                   They drop to the deck and take combat stances.

 GUARD #1                              Set phasers to rotating
                             modulation!

                   They make adjustments to their weapons just as the
                   bulkhead doors EXPLODE INWARD in a blinding flash. The
                   guards shield themselves against the fire and debris...
                   looks up just in time to see the swift and lethal
                   shapes of the BORG jumping through the smashed
                   bulkhead, racing down the corridor toward them. The
                   guards FIRE, and when they do the PHASER BLASTS
                   alternate color -- red, blue, green, purple, orange --
                   a staccato of colors as the phasers shift frequency.

                   The phaser blasts TAKE DOWN a few of the BORG... but
                   then we see the distinctive PERSONAL FORCEFIELDS of the
                   other Borg begin to compensate, and the phasers no
                   longer affect them.

 GUARD #1                              That's it, they've adjusted --
                             fall back!

                   They turn to run but BORG PHASER FIRE lances out from
                   the Borg soldiers and RIPS them apart.

 CUT TO: 
 102 INT. BRIDGE 102 
                   The mood is tense, grim. Riker, Worf and Troi are
                   gathered around a SCHEMATIC of the ENTERPRISE. The
                   lower portion of the ship has been blocked off by 
                   the color RED, representing the Borg advance through
                   the ship. A they watch, another section of
                   compartments and corridors suddenly turn RED.

                   Riker lets out a wary breath, starts pointing to
                   various points along the schematic.

 RIKER                              All right... we've lost control of
                             eight decks... three Cargo Bays...
                             one Shuttlebay.

 TROI                              Do we have any idea how many Borg
                             we're dealing with?

 WORF                              We saw at least thirty...and
                             there are twenty-two Enterprise
                             crewmembers reported missing...
                             including Commander Data.
 RIKER                              We'll have to assume they've been
                             assimilated into the Collective.

 TROI                              Even Data?

 WORF                              Data's positronic net contains
                             classified information on the
                             Enterprise. Command codes,
                             security protocols...

 RIKER                              If they control Data, they control
                             the ship.

                   A grim beat.

 RIKER                              We can't worry about that right
                             now. Let's concentrate on what we
                             can.

                   They stare at the schematic.

 WORF                              To control the Enterprise, they'll
                             have to gain access to one of two
                             locations. Main Engineering... or
                             the Bridge.

 RIKER                              We have to cover both
                             possibilities.
                                     (to Troi)
                             We'll take care of the Bridge.
                             Worf, take your men and seal off
                             Main Engineering. Turn it into a
                             fortress -- nothing gets in.

                   Worf nods and EXITS. As Riker and Troi exchange a
                   tense look...

 CUT TO: 
 103 EXT. RESURRECTION CITY - HOSPITAL - NIGHT 103 
                   The hospital is completely LIT UP -- the only building
                   in town with this much power.

 104 INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT 104 
                   Picard walks down the hall, stops outside a door marked
                   "X-RAY PROCESSING." The RED LIGHT is on above the
                   door, but that means nothing to Picard... who opens the
                   door and steps inside...
 105 INT. X-RAY PROCESSING ROOM 105 
                   Much like a traditional darkroom, trays of chemicals
                   and washes, etc. But everything has a slightly
                   futuristic and cobbled-together feel. They are
                   developing X-rays by hand instead of by machine. The
                   room is lit with an AMBER glow. As soon as Picard
                   opens the door, we hear Ruby's voice:

 RUBY'S VOICE                              Shut that door!

                   Picard quickly shuts the door behind him, looks around
                   the room. Ruby, who's working at a tray of chemicals,
                   turns around in fury.

 RUBY                              What are you, an idiot? Didn't
                             you see the red light was on?

 PICARD                              Ah... yes... but, I didn't realize
                             that --

 RUBY                              Thank God this plate was already
                             fixed.

                   She pulls down a small pane of glass (probably from a
                   window) out of a tub of water... holds it up to the
                   light. And there on the glass is a X-RAY of a man's
                   SKULL. Picard moves to her.

 PICARD                                      (re: X-ray)
                             Cochrane?

 RUBY                              Yes... and I only had enough
                             silver halide for one shot. So
                             you're lucky you didn't screw it
                             up.

 PICARD                              I'm very sorry.

                   She glances at him, sees he feels genuinely bad. She
                   softens a little.

 RUBY                              Don't worry about it.

                   She picks up a rubber squeegee and carefully starts to
                   dry off the pane of glass.
 RUBY                              Did you need something?

 PICARD                              Yes... I wanted to ask you about
                             some photographs I saw out at the
                             silo. There were three of them...
                             printed on some kind of fabric.

 RUBY                              Bed sheets.
                                     (off his look)
                             I used my last set of bed sheets to
                             make those prints. Not the best
                             material, but I haven't seen a
                             clean piece of paper in five
                             years.

 PICARD                              Did you take any other pictures of
                             the rocket?

                   The X-ray is now dry, and Ruby turns and looks at him.

 RUBY                              Sure.
                                     (jokingly)
                             Why, did you want to buy them?

                   Picard doesn't realize she was kidding -- jumps on the
                   opportunity to get the photos.

 PICARD                              Yes. I don't have any money right
                             now, but I may be able to get
                             some.

                   Ruby looks at him for a moment -- is he serious? She
                   gives him a curious smile.

 RUBY                              "Money." So you can get dome
                             money...

 PICARD                              I can try.
 RUBY                              You'd have to try real hard. No
                             one's used currency in over ten
                             years. What are you, from another
                             planet?
                    Picard hesitates, smiles at her, tries to laugh it off.

 PICARD                              No... but sometimes I feel that
                             way.
                                     (beat)
                             What I meant was, I'd be willing
                             to trade for the photographs.

 RUBY                              Trade. Okay. The photographs...
                             for a straight answer.
                                     (beat)
                             Who are you? And how do you know
                             Zephram?

 PICARD                              I'm an old friend... I met him
                             when he was doing his
                             undergraduate work at Cornell back
                             in --

 RUBY                                      (cuts him off)
                             'Fraid not.

                   Ruby walks past him with the X-ray...

 106 INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS 106 
                   Picard follows Ruby out into the corridor. She has a
                   satisfied smile on her face -- it's not easy to put one
                   over on this woman. And the truth is, she's enjoying
                   Picard's frustration. As they walk along...

 PICARD                              What?

 RUBY                                      (casual)
                             You're lying.

 PICARD                              What makes you say that?

 RUBY                              You're not someone who lies very
                             easily... so it's obvious when you
                             do... at least to me.

 PICARD                              Are you always sucha good judge
                             of character?

                   She stops, turns, looks at him.

 RUBY                              Always.

                   Ruby turns and walks off. Picard follows her, doggedly
                   determined to get those photos...

 107 INT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT 107 
                   Beverly is holding the X-ray glass Ruby made up to the
                   light, as the Doctor seen earlier looks on.

 BEVERLY                              The occipital fracture is
                             widening... we're going to have
                             to fuse the bones...

 DOCTOR                              I'm a little worried about some of
                             these bone fragments. If they
                             move any closer to the brain, we
                             could be looking at a hemorrhage.

                   As Beverly and the Doctor examine the X-ray, we MOVE TO
                   Ruby, who's looking down at Cochrane. He's still in
                   bed and on a respirator. She smoothes his hair with
                   affection. Picard stands on the other side of the bed,
                   watching her.

 PICARD                              Were the two of you... involved?

 RUBY                              No... not like you and Doctor
                             Crusher used to be.

 PICARD                                      (surprised)
                             How did you know about that?

                   Ruby looks at him with a smile.

 RUBY                              I didn't.

                   Her smile widens, and then she leaves the bed to join
                   the Doctor and Beverly. Picard shakes his head and
                   smiles after her -- chagrinned and amused at the same
                   time.

 RUBY                                      (to Doctor)
                             We can't take any more X-rays
                             until I can mix up a new batch of
                             the silver halide.

 DOCTOR                              Can you do it tonight? We may
                             have to operate.

 RUBY                              Sure. It'll be ready by morning.

                   Ruby turns and heads for the door. Picard moves after
                   her.

 PICARD                              Ruby... I need to talk to you
                             about those photographs. It's 
                             very important.

 RUBY                              I'm sure it is. But it'll have to
                             wait until tomorrow.

 PICARD                              It can't wait until tomorrow...

 RUBY                              Too bad.
                                     (beat)
                             Besides, it'll give you all night
                             to think up a new set of lies.

                   She flashes him that smile again, then darts out the
                   door. Picard is left frustrated -- he knows that he
                   can't let it go at that...

 CUT TO: 
 108 INT. ENTERPRISE - ENGINEERING 108 
                   Worf and a team of TEN SECURITY GUARDS are preparing
                   for battle. They're setting up large, heavy-duty
                   phaser equivalents of machine guns --  big, mean-looking
                   weapons on tripods. There are two of these weapons
                   aimed at each entrance to Engineering. The Security
                   Officers are strapping on body armor, checking weapons,
                   building makeshift barricades over each of the doors.

                   Worf is in command, directing the action.

 WORF                                      (to team)
                             Double check each assault
                             phaser... make certain that the
                             range setting is no more than
                             thirty meters. We don't want to
                             blast through the hull.

                   Worf turns and picks up his BAT'LETH SWORD off a nearby
                   console. He checks the sharpness of the blade.

 SECURITY OFFICER                              Are you sure you don't want
                             something a little more...
                             sophisticated, sir?

 WORF                              Mind your post, Lieutenant.

                   The Lieutenant decides not to pursue the matter and
                   moves off. Worf makes a quick practiced motion with
                   the sword... decides he's ready.

 109 INT. BRIDGE 109 
                   Riker and Troi watching the schematic.

                   Riker works a control and the display ZOOMS IN to
                   display a cutaway view of the ship highlighting
                   Engineering and the surrounding deck. A SWARM of DOTS
                   representing the Borg is advancing on Engineering.

 RIKER                                      (to com)
                             Riker to Engineering. Mister
                             Worf...the Borg are approaching
                             your position.

 WORF'S COM VOICE                              Understood. We're ready.

                   Riker and Troi watch as the DOTS move closer...
                   closer...right up to the perimeter of Engineering.
                   The dots begin surrounding Engineering -- which looks
                   like it's being swarmed over by a sea of ants.

 110 INT. ENGINEERING 110 
                   As before. The security guards have taken positions
                   around the room, all weapons trained on the doors.

                   Worf is standing in front of the warp core, Bat'leth in-
                   hand.

 WORF                                      (calls out)
                             Charge weapons!

                   A massive HUM of power fills the room as all of the
                   phaser weapons begin charging. It's tense -- everyone
                   standing ready with their weapons charging. This is
                   the moment of truth.

                   Worf stands ready, phaser in one hand, Bat'leth in the
                   other. This is Worf at his purest -- the warrior ready
                   for battle.

 111 INT. BRIDGE 111 
                   Riker and Troi, as before, watching the schematic of
                   the ship. The DOTS representing Borg have now
                   completely surrounded Engineering on all sides,
                   including the deck directly above and below. In
                   essence, the Borg have cocooned Engineering from the
                   rest of the ship.

 112 INT. ENGINEERING 112 
                   As before. Worf and the security team in their
                   positions, tense. A few beats of silence...then they
                   start to hear soft SCRATCHING coming from somewhere
                   behind the walls -- it sounds like rats skittering
                   through the walls and ceiling of an old house.

                   Everyone stays alert, checks and re-checks their
                   weapons... a couple of hard swallows... then from
                   somewhere up above a LOUD, METALLIC CLANG. Then a
                   large, SCRAPING SOUND that seems to start at one end of
                   the room and travel to the other. There's an
                   overpowering sense of creatures just outside those
                   walls, moving about. It's unnerving, even for crack
                   Starfleet troops.

 113 INT. BRIDGE 113 
                   Riker and Troi watching the display. The Borg dots
                   teeming around Engineering like ants on a candy bar.

 114 INT. ENGINEERING 114 
                   The clawing, skittering, clanging noises increase and
                   get louder...

                   ... we expect to see the Borg bursting into the room at
                   any moment. Worf tightens his grip on his Bat'leth,
                   teeth bared. Unbearable tension and then...

                   The noises begin to FADE AWAY... eventually
                   disappearing all together. If anything, the silence is
                   even scarier. Worf's eyes narrow. He looks around the
                   room, all his senses alert, waiting for the slightest
                   sign of the Borg... but nothing happens.

 115 INT. BRIDGE 115 
                   Riker and Troi react to the diagram as the Borg dots
                   begin moving away from Engineering. It looks like the
                   swarm of ants have left the candy bar and are on the
                   ground, moving toward the forward part of the ship.

 TROI                              They're bypassing Engineering...

 RIKER                              Where the hell are they going?

                   OFF the mystery...

 CUT TO: 
 116 INT. BORG HIVE 116 
                   CLOSE ON DATA'S FACE. His eyes are closed -- he is in
                   the android equivalent of sleep. CAMERA ROTATING and
                   PUSHING IN on his face as we hear the overlapping
                   sounds of VOICES from Data's past -- Picard, Riker,
                   Troi, the Enterprise crew, aliens he's met, Data's own
                   voice... bits and pieces of his life...

                   The theme of the sound bites should be Data's quest for
                   humanity: Picard giving him advice, Troi counseling
                   him, Soong talking to his son, etc. The last line of
                   dialogue we hear is Data saying "I want to be more
                   human."

 BORG QUEEN'S VOICE                              Data...

                   Data's eyes fly open, now awake. We PULL BACK
                   revealing that Data is still strapped to the Borg
                   operating table... his right arm and shoulder are
                   encased in some kind of strange cybernetic SHELL,
                   obscured from view. Clear tubes run out of the shell
                   into Borg machinery -- liquid is coursing through the
                   tubes. A couple of Borg drones are moving about the
                   room, carrying out various tasks.

                   There's been a change since we've been here last.
                   There are now several Plexiglass CYLINDERS surrounding
                   Data's table -- each of them filled with some kind of
                   murky red fluid, which is swirling around. Every once
                   in awhile, something that looks like RAW FLESH bumps up
                   against the clear Plexiglass, then disappears again.
                   We don't know what these tubes are for, but they're
                   definitely creepy.

                   Data takes all this in, but there is nothing he can do,
                   he's still immobilized.

                   Suddenly the table ROTATES and begins to MOVE up toward
                   the mist and cabling at the top of the ceiling. It
                   stops a few feet away... and Data finds himself face-to-
                   face with the Borg Queen again.

 BORG QUEEN                              You've taken your first step
                             toward perfection. How does it
                             feel?

 DATA                              I do not know what you are
                             referring to.

 BORG QUEEN                              That's because you haven't been
                             properly... stimulated yet.

                   A WHOOSH of hydraulic power signals another movement by
                   the Borg Queen. She slithers through the air and down
                   slightly, so that she is on the same level as Data.
                   She looks at the cybernetic shell that is encasing
                   Data's right arm, which OPENS at her silent command and
                   moves away...

                   We can now see that all of the skin has been removed
                   from Data's right arm, showing the INNER-WORKINGS of
                   his android limb -- circuitry and servos, etc. But on
                   the top of the mechanical forearm there is something
                   new -- a small PATCH of HUMAN FLESH held in place with
                   various nasty-looking hooks and clamps and small tubes
                   carrying blood. It's a delicate, fragile piece of
                   organic life on an ugly, mechanical surface.

                   Data looks down at the patch of flesh with a little
                   puzzlement.

 BORG QUEEN                                      (re: flesh)
                             Do you know what this is, Data?

 DATA                              It would appear that you are
                             attempting to graft organic skin
                             onto my endo-skeletal structure.

 BORG QUEEN                              What a cold description... for
                             such a beautiful gift.

                   She smiles slightly, utterly confident. She leans her
                   face in close to Data's still immobilized right arm.

 117 EXTREME CLOSE UP - DATA'S ARM 117 
                   We are so close to the patch of flesh that we can see
                   the individual hairs. The Borg Queen's LIPS move into
                   frame, and she EXHALES a long and sensuous breath. We
                   see GOOSE BUMPS form on the skin, and the hairs stand
                   straight up in response.
 118 NEW ANGLE 118                    As Data's eyes widen and he looks down at the skin in
                   surprise -- this is a sensation he's never felt before.
                   The Borg Queen sees the look on his face and smiles.

 BORG QUEEN                              Was that good for you?

                   Data can barely describe the sensation. But clearly,
                   it was pleasurable.

 DATA                              It was... interesting.

                   He looks at her.

 DATA                              Do it again... please.

                   As she smiles...

 CUT TO: 
 119 EXT. RUBY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 119 
                   A tiny, single-story house -- one or two rooms at the
                   most, in serious need of repair and maintenance. No
                   yard. The house sits on dirt. The nearest other
                   structure is at least a hundred yards away. A very
                   solitary place. The windows are dark, painted over
                   from the inside.

                   Some large pieces of exotic-looking EQUIPMENT are
                   sitting off the front porch.

                   After a beat, the front door opens, letting out a soft,
                   feeble light.

                   Ruby steps out onto the porch, carrying a gallon size
                   plastic jug. The light from the house now lights the 
                   equipment a little, giving us a better view. There's
                   a contraption that appears to be a PUMP of some kind,
                   with a funnel on top, spigot at the bottom, and several
                   stages of filters and tubing in between. Ruby sets the
                   jug underneath the spigot... then sits down for a 
                   moment on the edge of the porch. She takes a breath
                   and runs a hand through her hair, stretches her back,
                   trying to work out some of the kinks in her neck. An
                   exhausting day.

 120 PICARD 120 
                   is watching her intently from afar. He's concealed
                   behind a supporting beam of one the town's many
                   WINDMILLS. He's in shadow, hidden from Ruby's view.

 121 RUBY 121 
                   pulls off her jacket. she's wearing a pull-over
                   shirt... and in one motion she pulls off the shirt,
                   revealing only a tee-shirt underneath, sleeves torn off
                   long ago. She stands up... kicks off her boots...
                   undoes her pants... and begins sliding the jeans off
                   her hips...

 122 PICARD 122 
                   is surprised. Glances around, a little awkward. This
                   really isn't why he came out here.

 123 RUBY 123 
                   kicks aside the jeans. She's now down to tee-shirt and
                   panties. She grabs the bottom of the tee-shirt...
                   pulls it off...

 124 PICARD 124 
                   doesn't want to look, but can't help himself...

 125 RUBY 125 
                   moves to the side of the porch... and steps into a
                   large ENVIROMENTAL SUIT, a bulky one-piece with gloves
                   and helmet attached.

 126 PICARD 126 
                   is a little relieved... keeps watching...

 127 RUBY 127 
                   has now encased herself in the thick, rubbery suit...
                   pulls over a HELMET with a gas mask. She walks over to
                   an OIL DRUM marked with a distinctive BIO-HAZARD
                   SYMBOL. She carefully opens the lid... takes a metal
                   pitcher... reaches down into the drum and scoops out a
                   pitcher-full of TOXIC WASTE. She closes the lid, walks
                   over to the pump-filter contraption. She pours the
                   sludge-like waste into the funnel...primes the pump...
                   makes a few adjustments to the filters... and then
                   turns the spigot...

                   After a beat, a trickle of CLEAR LIQUID starts to come
                   out of the spigot. Ruby steps back and pulls off the
                   helmet.

 128 PICARD 128 
                   watches, curious about what she's doing...

 129 RUBY 129 
                   is now out of the bio-suit again... pulling on her
                   shirt and jeans... grabs her jacket... turns off the
                   lights in the house, and shuts the front door behind
                   her. She begins walking toward the windmill.

 130 PICARD 130 
                   steps behind the girder, stays very still in the
                   shadows... waits quietly as Ruby passes by the windmill
                   without a glance and heads into town. After she's
                   gone, Picard steps out from his hiding place, watches
                   her go, then quickly heads for Ruby's house...

 131 FRONT PORCH 131 
                   Picard opens the front door and goes inside... but he
                   doesn't notice that at the base of the doorjamb a small
                   RED LIGHT starts flashing -- some sort of silent alarm.

 132 INT. RUBY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 132 
                   Picard ENTERS and closes the door behind him. It's
                   dark. He fumbles around for a light switch... finally
                   locates one... and a soft, golden glow fills the room.

                   The house has only one room, which functions as a
                   living room, kitchen, bedroom, etc. This is also
                   Ruby's DARKROOM. The windows have been painted black,
                   and there are photographic plates and futuristic photo-
                   equipment all around. But the most striking feature of
                   the house are the large, hanging cloth-printed
                   PHOTOGRAPHS. They vary in size and shape. Some are
                   hanging on walls, others hang from the ceiling in mid-
                   air, still others are stacked on the few pieces of
                   furniture that's here. The absence of paper has forced
                   Ruby to print photos on anything she can find --
                   bed sheets, shirts, pieces of upholstery, backs of
                   carpeting, etc. Picard stands there for a moment,
                   taking in the scene -- he's never been in anyplace
                   quite like this. The cloth photos give the room a
                   feeling of a small, intensely personal gallery.

                   Picard moves around the room, looking from photo to
                   photo... hunting for the elusive shots of the missile
                   silo... and as he does, we get our first close look at
                   Ruby's images, and they tell us a great deal about
                   her...

                   She has an artistic eye for finding beauty in the
                   mundane and the ugly. There are pictures of hope
                   amidst despair... beauty amongst devastation. There
                   seems to be a theme running through the photographs --
                   a romantic, almost idealistic sense of optimism.

                   At one point, Picard finds a photograph he recognizes.
                   It's the rusted-out hover car she photographed on the
                   streets of Resurrection. It's an ugly, decrepit piece
                   of junk... but there in the center, spot-lighted by a
                   single ray of sunshine... is a tiny flower about to
                   bloom.

                   Picard takes in the image for a brief moment... then
                   pushes onward... goes to a file of photos sitting in a
                   box... begins sorting through them quickly... we see
                   PRE-WAR photos printed on real paper. They show a
                   younger Ruby with her parents... Resurrection the way
                   it used to look... Ruby with a dog...

                   Picard pauses, frowns... gets the odd feeling that
                   someone is watching him. He turns around to see...

 133 HIMSELF 133 
                   A three foot PHOTOGRAPH OF PICARD is drying in the air
                   behind him.

                   Ruby must've taken the photo when Picard was on the
                   street talking to Scrimm. It was taken through a
                   telephoto lens, a close-up of Picard's face -- he looks
                   focused, determined, heroic. It's a remarkable shot of
                   the Captain, and even Picard is a little taken aback by
                   the image. She's captured the essence of the man.

                   CLICK-CLACK! The sound of a shotgun being cocked.
                   Picard freezes... slowly turns around to see who's
                   there...

 134 RUBBY 134 
                   is standing in the open doorway, a shotgun leveled at
                   Picard.

 RUBY                              You should pay closer attention to
                             those little red lights.

                   Picard glances down at the doorway, sees the flashing
                   red light in the doorjamb. He's busted.

 RUBY                              You know, I'd be perfectly
                             justified in shooting you right
                             now.

                   Picard glances at the photograph of himself.

 PICARD                              I'd say you already have.

 RUBY                              Don't flatter yourself. I take
                             pictures of a lot of junk.

                   She perches herself on the arm of a small couch, holds
                   the gun loosely, but never taking the aim away from
                   Picard.

 RUBY                              Okay, let's hear it. I'm sure you
                             have a great explanation for why
                             those rocket photos are so
                             important you broke into my house.

 PICARD                              We're trying to repair Doctor
                             Cochrane's ship. It's been
                             damaged and --

 RUBY                              We?

 PICARD                              Myself... and a few other friends
                             of Zephram's.

 RUBY                              Friends from Cornell...

 PICARD                              Some.

 RUBY                              Lie. That's one. Keep going.

 PICARD                              A key piece of the ship has been
                             destroyed... and our only hope to
                             reconstruct it is if one of your
                             photographs shows us what it
                             looked like.

 RUBY                                      (considers)
                             All right. Truth. I believe that
                             one. Why is it so urgent you
                             couldn't wait until morning?

 PICARD                              We have to launch his ship by
                             tomorrow afternoon.

 RUBY                              Or...?

                   Picard has to come up with something -- decides to
                   throw her off with a high-tech explanation.

 PICARD                              Or the shielding around the
                             plutonium core will begin to
                             deteriorate. Within a day, the
                             entire silo will become so
                             radioactive that no one will be
                             able to come near it for a hundred
                             years.

                   Ruby eyes him evenly.

 RUBY                              Lie. That's two. One more, and
                             I pull the trigger.

                  Picard is starting to get angry.

 PICARD                              Why are you being so difficult?
                             All I'm asking for is to look at
                             one of the photographs. It'll
                             take five minutes.

 RUBY                              And all I'm asking for is the
                             truth. That would take five
                             minutes.
                                     (beat)
                             For all I know, you caused the
                             explosions at the silo... and now
                             you're trying to steal Zephram's
                             ship.

 PICARD                              I am not a thief...

                   Ruby's had enough -- her temper flares and she gets off
                   the couch, takes a threatening step toward Picard.

 RUBY                              No, you're a petty burglar and a
                             liar...
                                     (beat)
                             You're no friend of Zephram's. He
                             is a great man. He's not like you
                             or me or any of the other zombies
                             walking around this town.

                   Picard jumps in with a quiet, forceful quality:

 PICARD                              No. He's a man with vision. He
                             can see beyond the problems that
                             surround us. He knows there's a
                             better future out there for
                             everyone... a future where crime,
                             poverty and war are things of the
                             past... a future where we reach
                             out and seek our destiny in the
                             stars.
                                    (beat)
                             I believe in that future, too,
                             Ruby. I believe in it in every
                             fiber of my being. And I'm
                             telling you... if we don't launch
                             that warp ship tomorrow, there's
                             a very good chance that future
                             will never happen.

                   She eyes him for a moment -- and we're not sure if his
                   words have had any effect.

                   Ruby still has her doubts, but decides to go with her
                   gut...and finally hands him the photographs. Picard
                   glances through them -- his expression tells us the
                   photo he needs is in there.

 PICARD                              You won't regret this.

                   They share a look... and then Picard turns and walks
                   off into the night. Ruby watches him go... and we can
                   see on her face a confused jumble of mixed emotions.
                   Something about that man has touched her...

 135 NIGHT SCPOE POV 135 
                   A telescopic, green and white image of Picard walking
                   away from Ruby's home.

 136 LIEUTENANT SCRIMM 136 
                   is watching Picard through a set of night vision
                   binoculars, perched on the roof of a nearby building.
                   He frowns, wondering what Picard is up to...

 CUT TO: 
 137 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE DEFLECTOR DISH 137 
                   The giant DEFLECTOR ARRAY at the front of the ship --
                   a giant, round, bowl-shaped array used for
                   communications and shielding. As we watch, FOUR
                   HATCHES OPEN surrounding the dish and BORG start to
                   emerge from the interior of the ship and CRAWL OUT on
                   the hull. The Borg do not need pressure suits or
                   breathing equipment -- they crawl around the hull with
                   ease and onto the deflector dish...

 PULL BACK TO REVEAL: 
 138 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE - VIEWSCREEN 138 
                   Where Riker, Troi, Worf and N.D.s are watching this
                   image on the Viewscreen.

 RIKER                              What are they doing?

 WORF                              They appear to be modifying the
                             deflector dish.

 TROI                              To do what? If they wanted a
                             weapon, they could've taken over
                             a phaser bank or torpedo bay...

 RIKER                              Deflector dish... why the
                             deflector dish...?

 WORF                              It doesn't make sense. The
                             deflector is only used for
                             shielding and long range
                             sensors...

                   Riker stares at the screen... notices something.

 RIKER                              Computer -- magnify grid twenty-
                             one alpha.

                   The image on the Viewscreen ZOOMS IN to a specific
                   point on the deflector dish, giving us a clear view of
                   two Borg who have opened a gigantic panel on the dish.
                   They appear top be modifying power conduits in some
                   fashion.

 WORF                              They're re-routing the deflector
                             power conduits...

 RIKER                              Computer -- thermal enhancement.

                   The image now is overlaid with an INFRARED VIEW of what
                   they're doing. The power conduits are glowing bright
                   red, very hot -- we can see the heat signature travel
                   back behind the dish and connect to a corkscrew-shaped
                   coil, which is pulsing.

 RIKER                              They're connecting the conduits to
                             subspace communications...

 WORF                                      (realizing)
                             They're converting the deflector
                             dish into an antennae...

 TROI                              They may be trying to send a
                             message to the other Borg...the
                             Borg in this time period...
 WORF                              What kind of message?

 RIKER                                      (thinking)
                             If it was me... I'd say "attack
                             Earth now... in the 21st
                             century... they'll be too strong
                             in the 24th."

                   They think about this for a moment as they watch the
                   Borg swarming on the deflector array.

 WORF                              We have to stop them from sending
                             that message.

 RIKER                              Agreed. Options?

 WORF                              Destroy the deflector dish.

 TROI                              Can we aim our dorsal phasers at
                             it?

                   Riker shakes his head.

 RIKER                              We've lost control of all weapons
                             systems... Transporters are
                             down... we can't get to a
                             Shuttlecraft... and it would take
                             us too long to fight our way down
                             to deflector control...

                   They think.

 WORF                              There is another way, Commander.
                             Do you remember your zero-G combat
                             training?

                   Riker looks a little wary at the suggestion.

 RIKER                              I remember it made me sick.

 TROI                                      (to Worf)
                             What are you suggesting?

 RIKER                              I think Mister Worf is suggesting
                             that we go outside for a little
                             stroll...

                   OFF their expressions...

 139 CLOSE ON A PHOTOGRAPH 139 
                   Another one of Ruby's cloth-printed photos, this one a
                   clear view of the base of the missile engines --
                   Cochrane standing underneath the massive rocket nozzle.
                   Above him on the fuselage is the crucial throttle-valve
                   assembly.

 GEORDI'S VOICE                              I'm almost afraid to say this,
                             Captain... but I think it's going
                             to work.

                   MOVE TO REVEAL we're in:

 140 INT. MISSILE SILO - LOWER CATWALK - DAY 140 
                   The cloth photo is hanging from a beam on the catwalk.
                   Geordi and Picard are watching a couple of N.D.s attach
                   the newly-built throttle assembly to the side of the
                   ship. The N.D.s are using high-tech welding tools and
                   sparks are flying. As they talk, they head back up the
                   catwalk toward the control room...

 PICARD                              Where's you get the alloy for the
                             throttle itself?

 GEORDI                              They used copper pipes in their
                             plumbing... so I melted it down...
                             and fused it with some tritanium
                             from one of our phaser casings.
                                     (beat)
                             It's not the strongest alloy...
                             but it's better than all this
                             crude aluminum and steel.

 141 INT. MISSILE CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS 141 
                   As Geordi and Picard ENTER. Lange is checking out a
                   launch console.

                   The room is now humming with power -- it's beginning to
                   look like the place is up and running. Picard stops
                   near the desk.

 PICARD                              Mister Lange -- have you brought
                             the computer systems back on-line
                             yet?

 LANGE                              Aye, Captain. This trinary
                             language is pretty archaic... but
                             I think I understand it now.

 PICARD                             Good.

                   As they speak, CAMERA MOVES in on the metal canister
                   of lotion Picard set on the desk earlier...

 142 EXT. MONTONA WOODS - DAY - CONTINUOUS 142 
                   Scrimm and three militia guards are huddled around a
                   cluster of military surveillance gear, listening to
                   Picard and Geordi's conversation. Far in the distance,
                   we can see the missile silo.

 PICARD'S VOICE                              Are we on schedule? The Vulcan
                             ship will be here in less than two
                             hours.

 GEORDI'S VOICE                              It'll be tight, but we should make
                             it.

 PICARD'S VOICE                              What about our warp signature? It
                             has to be strong enough for them
                             to detect.

 GEORDI'S VOICE                              I've enhanced the plasma injectors --
                             don't worry, they'll see it.

 PICARD'S VOICE                              Well, with any luck... the Vulcans
                             will land outside Resurrection
                             tomorrow morning... and Earth will
                             never be the same again.
                    Scrimm and his men listen with growing alarm -- it
                   sounds like Picard is planning an invasion!

 143 INT. MISSILE CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS 143 
                   As before.

 PICARD                              All right. I'd better start
                             familiarizing myself with the
                             flight controls.

                   A console BUZZES. Lange moves to it, and activates a
                   small color video MONITOR. It shows an external view
                   of the MISSILE silo, just outside the hatch. Beverly
                   can be seen standing nearby with a now conscious
                   Zephram Cochrane.

 LANGE                              Doctor Crusher's at the access
                             hatch, Captain.

 PICARD                              Let her in.

                   Lange hits a couple of buttons...

 CUT TO: 
 144 CLOSE ON COCHRANE'S FACE 144 
                   A short time later. His head is bandaged, and he's
                   conscious, but frankly he looks like hell. He sits
                   back, looking a little overwhelmed.

 COCHRANE                              Let me get this straight... you're
                             from the future... I'm about to
                             change history... and all I have
                             to do is sit here and let you fly
                             my ship?

 145 WIDER 145 
                   Picard, Geordi and Beverly are standing around
                   Cochrane, who is sitting in a high-backed chair in a
                   corner of the Control Room.

 PICARD                              That's right.

                   He studies their faces -- sees they're serious. He
                   smiles a little ruefully.

 COCHRANE                              And people say I'm crazy...

                   Picard smiles.

 PICARD                              I assure you, Doctor, that after
                             today... no one will ever call you
                             that again.

                   Cochrane considers them...finally nods, what the hell.

 COCHRANE                              Just do me a favor... bring my
                             ship back in one piece.

 PICARD                              That's a promise.

                   Picard turns and walks off with Beverly. Geordi moves
                   to Cochrane with a little bit of awe.

 GEORDI                              Doctor... my name is Geordi La
                             Forge. I'm an engineer. Can I
                             shake your hand?

                   Cochrane is touched by Geordi's obvious respect. They
                   shake hands.

 COCHRANE                              I wish I could go with you. Is
                             there anything I can do to help?

 GEORDI                              Not really... but I do have about
                             a thousand questions I've always
                             wanted to ask you.

 COCHRANE                              Since time is short... why don't
                             you pick the top ten and fire
                             away?

                   Geordi smiles...

 146 PICARD AND BEVERLY 146 
                   have moved to another part of the room. Beverly looks
                   exhausted. She sets her medkit on a table and plops
                   down into a chair. Mid-conversation.

 PICARD                                       (surprised)
                             You actually performed surgery...?

 BEVERLY                              It was an experience. Metal
                             scalpels... needle and thread...

                   She looks up with a smile, pulls a small DEVICE out of
                   the medkit -- a surgical transporter.

 BEVERLY                                      (re: device)
                             But I had a little help. Surgical
                             transporter. I used it to beam
                             out most of the bone fragments
                             from his brain.

 PICARD                              How did Doctor Almack react to
                             that?

 BEVERLY                              He was so confused by what I was
                             doing, I don't think he even
                             noticed.
                                     (beat)
                             Any word from the Enterprise?

 PICARD                              Not yet.

 BEVERLY                              You think they're still up there?

 PICARD                                      (wry)
                             If they're not... we'd better get
                             used to living in Montana.

 BEVERLY                                      (light)
                             That might not be so bad... at
                             least for you.

                   She's kidding, but Picard is a little defensive.

 PICARD                              What's that supposed to mean?

                   There is no animosity or hint of jealousy in Beverly's
                   attitude, she's simply making an observation about
                   someone she cares about.

 BEVERLY                              I saw the way you looker at her...
                             and I know that look.

                   Picard doesn't want to argue about this -- to him, it's
                   a pointless conversation.

 PICARD                              Regardless of how I may feel about
                             Ruby... our fates lie along
                             different paths. Nothing can
                             change that.

 BEVERLY                              You want some advice? Don't do
                             this again.
                                     (off his look)
                             You know exactly what I mean.

 PICARD                              Beverly, there were many reasons
                             why you and I...

 BEVERLY                              I'd call them excuses. And the
                             first excuse on both our lists was
                             our "sense of duty." We convinced
                             ourselves that it was more
                             important than anything else. And
                             you know what? It's not.

                   She holds his look for a moment.

 PICARD                                      (neutral)
                             I have a ship to launch.

                   Picard turns and leaves. Beverly watches him go...
                   wondering whether her words had any affect...

 147 EXT. RUBY'S HOUSE - DAY 147 
                   Ruby is turning off the spigot on the filter-pump. The
                   plastic jug is now filled with the clear fluid --
                   silver halide. She caps the jug, picks it up, begins
                   walking up on the porch...then hesitates for a
                   moment... looks out over the horizon.

                   She hesitates... then frowns and goes inside...

                   Ruby comes inside, sets down the jug... begins to pick
                   up some more glass plates... stops... thinks... looks
                   up. Only a few feet away is the large picture of
                   Picard. She doesn't want to look at him, doesn't want
                   to think about him... but there he is.

                   She glances back at the open door... struggles for a
                   moment... then makes a decision.

                   Despite herself, she can't get Picard out of her head.
                   With a little frustration, she grabs her camera bag and
                   heads for the door...

 149 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE 149 
                   in Earth orbit.

 150 INT. BORG HIVE 150 
                   ANGLE ON CEILING as the Borg Queen descends from her
                   nesting place down towards the camera... ultimately
                   stopping just a few feet away. She speaks directly to
                   the camera.

 BORG QUEEN                              How do you feel?

 151 CLOSE ON DATA'S HAND 151 
                   His right hand is made of FLESH -- it has color,
                   fingernails, hair, sweat. It's completely human in
                   every way. His fingers move slightly, and then the
                   hand begins to rise. We follow his hand as it comes up
                   and touches his FACE, which is also FLESH. The gold
                   color is gone, his hair is tousled and natural-looking.
                   Even his eyes are real now -- blue. He touches his
                   face tentatively, his expression confused... but
                   intrigued.

 DATA                              Different.
                    The Borg Queen descends closer. Data's arms are now
                   free, but he is still restrained on the table. The
                   rest of his body is still android, mechanical.

                   Data touches his two hands together, feeling the
                   sensations, flesh against machine. He touches his face
                   and lips, discovering himself in a totally new way.

 DATA                              My internal sensors tell me the
                             ambient temperature in the room is
                             ten point two degrees Celsius...
                                     (wondrous)
                             But my skin tells me it is cold.

                   As he talks, we can see that he's becoming seduced by
                   his own newfound senses.

 DATA                              My visual acuity has been reduced
                             by seventy-eight percent... and I
                             can no longer perceive light
                             beyond the ultraviolet or the
                             infrared...
                                     (beat)
                             But I can see.

                   It's an amazing moment, Data riding a wave of feeling
                   and emotion like he's never had before. The Borg Queen
                   watches, pleased. She hovers close to him.

 BORG QUEEN                              Until today... your emotions were
                             trapped inside an artificial
                             shell. You didn't know what it
                             was to truly feel.
                                     (beat)
                             And there's so much more for you
                             to experience.  I will guide you
                             into a world of sensation unlike
                             anything you can imagine.
                                     (beat)
                             All you have to do... is give us
                             access to your neural net.

                   Data looks at her, suddenly shocked back into reality.

 DATA                              No. I will not betray my friends.

 BORG QUEEN                              They're not your friends...
                             they've held you back... kept you
                             from your destiny...

 DATA                              That is not true. They have tried
                             to help me.

 BORG QUEEN                              Have they given you what I have
                             given you? Did they even try?

 DATA                              I... do not want this...

                   But his words have a certain hollow quality to them.
                   He is no longer as convinced as he was before and the
                   Borg Queen notes this immediately. She reaches out
                   with a hand and gently strokes Data's cheek.

 BORG QUEEN                              You're becoming more human all the 
                             time, Data. Now you're learning 
                             how to lie.

 DATA                              I wish to... go back to the way I
                             was.

 BORG QUEEN                              More lies.

                   She SLAPS him hard across the face. Data feels the
                   pain, the shock. A small trickle of blood comes from
                   his mouth. He looks at her in surprise, but before he
                   can say anything she moves forward and KISSES him on
                   the mouth deeply and intensely. It's a disturbing and
                   erotic moment. She pulls back. Data reels, trying to
                   sort out the rapid succession of pleasure and pain.
                   Her voice drops to a whisper and she moves even closer
                   to him, face-to-face... seductive... beguiling.

 BORG QUEEN                              Have you ever know a woman? Do
                             you know what it's like to feel
                             her breath on your face... her
                             skin against yours... flesh
                             against flesh?

 DATA                              My creator did not intend for me
                             to experience these things.

 BORG QUEEN                              I'm your creator now.

                   She rubs her body against his, cat-like... then pulls
                   him to her and kisses him deeply. Off the image of
                   their bizarre embrace...

 CUT TO: 
 152 INT. BRIDGE 152 
                   Riker, Worf, and three Security N.D.s are pulling on
                   SPACESUITS. The suits are form-fitting, sleek, no
                   bulky oxygen tanks. The helmets are the same -- they
                   conform to the contours of the skull and face.

 WORF                                      (to Riker)
                             You will have to realign the
                             targeting array of the quantum
                             torpedo... and reprogram the
                             warhead for the localized
                             detonation.
                                     (beat)
                             There's only one torpedo left...
 RIKER                              I guess I'd better get it right
                             the first time.

 WORF                                      (to all)
                             The Borg will undoubtedly attack.
                             Set phasers to rotating
                             modulation.

                   The Security Officers check their phasers and wait as
                   Riker and Worf finish putting on their suits. Riker
                   straps a tool case to his suit.

 RIKER                              Ready?

                   Everyone nods. Riker goes to a wall panel and
                   activates the control. The Airlock door seen earlier
                   OPENS. Riker turns back to Troi.

 TROI                              Good luck.

                   Riker nods. Then he, Worf, and the Guards ENTER the
                   airlock and Troi close the door behind them.

 153 INT. AIRLOCK 153 
                   A tiny room separating the Bridge from the outer hull.

 RIKER                              Depressurize.

                   Worf hits a control and the room DEPRESSURIZES with a
 HISSING SOUND. 
 WORF                                      (to others)
                             Activate magnetic constrictors.

                   They all activate controls on their wrists and there is
                   a faint hum of power as the suits are magnetized.

                   Riker hits another control and the OUTER AIRLOCK DOOR
                   SLIDES OPEN, revealing the vast vacuum of SPACE. They
                   begin to walk out of the airlock...

 154 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE - AIRLOCK 154 
                   As Riker and his team come out of the airlock on the
                   top of the saucer section. It's a spectacular sight as
                   the small group of figures, with weapons at the ready,
                   marches toward the leading edge of the saucer. The
                   scene is lit by light reflected by the Earth, which
                   hangs above the ship.

             155   ON RIKER & WORF                                            155

                   As they approach the edge. Worf gives a hand signal
                   and the rest of the team spreads out into a tactical
                   deployment and drops down onto their bellies. They
                   crawl up to the very edge of the saucer and pause.
                   Worf looks at Riker, who looks a little queasy.

 WORF                                      (to Riker)
                             Are you alright? 

 RIKER                              Just a little queasy...

 WORF                              Try not to look at the stars...
                             keep your eyes on the ship.

 RIKER                              Right.

 WORF                              And Commander, whatever you do...
                             do not vomit in your exo-suit. It
                             would be... unpleasant.

 RIKER                              I'll keep that in mind.

                   Riker takes a few deep breaths to steady himself.

 RIKER                                      (to all)
                             Over and under!

                   They all quickly scramble over the edge and onto the
                   underside of the saucer.

                   The CAMERA ROTATES AND SPINS with them as they
                   traverse to the underside of the hull -- they're
                   upside down relative to their previous position, but
                   there's no up or down in space and their magnetized
                   suits hold them to the hull.

                   It's a dizzying moment as we try to orient ourselves to
                   their new position. From this angle, the Enterprise
                   appears to be upside down!
                    Once they're on the underside of the saucer, they can
                   see the rest of the ship laid out above them.

 156 NEW ANGLE - THEIR POV 156 
                   The deflector dish (which is now above us) is covered
                   with dozens of Borg drones, who are working to modify
                   it. Some of them turn and see us.

 157 RIKER AND WORF 157 
                   Begin running toward the torpedo tube on the saucer.
                   (Running is difficult, they must keep one foot on the
                   hull at all times.) Several Borg PHASER SHOTS whip past
                   them as the Borg open fire.

 158 THE BORG 158 
                   A DOZEN of them leave the work on the dish and begin
                   skittering down (which is normally up) the
                   interconnecting dorsal on all fours toward our heroes
                   like a swarm of ants -- a frightening sight.

 159 A SECURITY GUARD 159 
                   Is HIT by a phaser shot and goes FLYING OFF into space.

 160 THE TORPEDO TUBE 160 
                   Riker reaches the opening to the torpedo tube, bends
                   down and opens the hatch. Borg phaser shots hitting
                   all around him. The open hatch cover provides some
                   protection from the Borg fire.

 RIKER                              Worf! I'm going to need at least
                             five minutes!

 WORF                              Understood!

                   Worf and his team lie down on the hull and begin
                   exchanging fire with the approaching mass of Borg.

                   They pick off a few Borg, who also go FLYING into
                   space. As Riker begins to work...

                      rapt with attention. Beverly checking him with her
                      MEDKIT, which is sitting open on a console nearby.

                   -- The BLAST DOOR begins closing.

                   headsets. Picard exchanges a look with Geordi.

 PICARD                              Ready to make a little history?

 GEORDI                              Always am.

 164 INT. CONTROL ROOM 164 
                   Lange and the other N.D.s watching the countdown.
                   Suddenly a console BUZZES. Lange goes to the monitor
                   seen earlier, hits a switch -- the monitor comes alive,
                   shows that Ruby is now standing outside at the hatch.
                   Lange reacts in surprise.

                   Picard and Geordi working the controls, watching the
                   readings, etc. We hear Lange's com voice:

 LANGE'S COM VOICE                              Phoenix, we have a problem out
                             here. There's a woman at the
                             outer hatch... says her name's
                             Ruby Sloan and she wants to see
                             the Captain.

                   Picard and Geordi react -- her timing is pretty bad.

 LANGE'S COM VOICE                              What do you want me to do, sir?

 GEORDI                              We can't let her in... she'll see
                             Cochrane isn't making the flight.

 PICARD                              We can't leave her out there.
                             When the ship launches... she'll
                             be killed.

 GEORDI                              Tell her to go back to
                             Resurrection.

 166 EXT. MISSILE SILO - DAY 166 
                   Ruby standing by the hatch, trying to look calm...
                   Scrimm and three Militia Soldiers holding her at
                   gunpoint. The hatch hisses and POPS OPEN. Scrimm
                   shoves a gun into Ruby's side -- get going. As they
                   start to crawl inside...

 167 INT. CONTROL ROOM 167 
                   Lange and the other N.D.s have focused their attention
                   on the countdown. Ruby climbs down the ladder, a tense
                   look on her face.

 LANGE                              Ms. Sloane, if you'll have a seat,
                             I'll let you talk to --

                   Suddenly, the three heavily-armed militia soldiers jump
                   down the ladder from the hatch. One of the Starfleet
                   N.D.s goes for a phaser, and a soldier BLASTS him
                   backward with a spray of bullets from his automatic
                   weapon. Everyone else freezes. A tense beat, then
                   Scrimm climbs down the ladder and looks around the
                   room...

 CUT TO: 
 168 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE - BATTLE ON THE HULL 168 
                   Riker in the torpedo tube, frantically working. He
                   begins to physically MOVE the torpedo tube itself like
                   he's moving the barrel of a huge cannon... as he
                   struggles to aim it toward the huge deflector dish...

 169 WORF AND THE SECURITY GUARDS 169 
                   are about fifty feet away from Riker. From their prone
                   positions, they try to keep the Borg at bay, BLASTING
                   them off the hull one by one. They have taken cover
                   behind some outcroppings of equipment on the hull of
                   the ship. The Borg have to cross an open field of
                   metal to get to them, making then easy targets.

                   Suddenly the Borg change tactics. From the deflector
                   dish high above them, Borg begin LAUNCHING THEMSELVES
                   directly at the Starfleet Officers, jumping off the
                   dish and flying through the vacuum of space like
                   paratroopers. This tips the balance. There are too
                   many targets to defend from above and below. One of
                   the flying Borg CRASHES into a Security Guard and a
                   vicious hand-to-hand FIGHT erupts. The Borg SLASHES
                   the guard's pressure suit, which DEPRESSURIZES killing
                   the man instantly. Worf FIRES  a phaser blast into the
                   Borg, knocking him off the hull and into space.

                   Worf turns to Riker.

 WORF                              Commander, you're five minutes are
                             up!

 170 RIKER 170 
                   swings the torpedo tube into place, aiming it at the
                   deflector dish. He hits a control on the side of the
                   tube... and a QUANTUM TORPEDO automatically slides up
                   from below and LOCKS INTO position in the tube, like a
                   panel on the torpedo and begins working on the
                   circuitry.

 SERGEANT                              No good, sir. They're on internal

                   Scrimm looks frustrated for a moment...then turns his
                   attention to Ruby.

 GEORDI                              One minute to launch.

 SCRIMM'S COM VOICE                              Mister Picard... this is
                             Lieutenant Scrimm. I'm going to
                             have to insist that you shut down
                             the launch. You see, I know what
                             you're doing... and I'm not going
                             to just stand by and let it

                             who'll be first.

                   As Picard reacts in shock...

 INTERCUT: 
 175 INT. CONTROL ROOM 175 
                   Scrimm is now holding Ruby by the arm. He shoves the
                   com headset to her mouth.

 SCRIMM                              Say hello...

                   Ruby is scared, but trying to keep it together.

                             Launch the ship.

                   Picard reacts to her voice, but keeps working the
                   controls, trying to concentrate. Scrimm draws his gun.

 SCRIMM                              Go ahead -- launch it. Ruby will
                             be here when you get back... but
                             she won't have a whole lot to say.

 176 INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT 176 
                   Geordi and Picard exchange a tense look. Picard
                   struggles. It's a difficult moment -- what does he do?
                   The countdown clock is approaching 15 seconds...14...

                   Everything hangs in the balance -- Ruby's life, the
                   future of the Earth, Picard's feelings, his duty...

                   Finally, Picard reaches out hits a control -- the
                   countdown clock stops at 11 seconds.

 GEORDI                              Captain --

                             the launch sequence.

 SCRIMM'S COM VOICE                              Thanks. Now, why don't you join
                             us and we'll have a little talk?

                   Picard unstraps himself and takes off the headset.

 GEORDI                              Captain... we've got less than ten
                             minutes before that Vulcan ship
                             leaves the system. We've got to
                             go now.

 PICARD                              It'll have to wait. Come on.

                   Geordi quickly starts unstrapping himself...

 177 INT. MISSILE SILO - CATWALK 177 
                   Picard and Geordi stop outside the massive blast doors,
                   which are separating them from the control room.

 PICARD                              Geordi, can you see into the room?

                   Geordi looks at the blast doors... and he does so, the
                   electronic PUPILS in his eyes rotate, change shape and
                   color.

 GEORDI                              No... the door's too thick.

                             Then we'll just have to assume
                             it's still there...

 GEORDI                              What's still there?

 PICARD                              Get a tricorder. You're going to
                             have to track my exact position in

                   mechanism. She glances up -- there's a BORG flying
                   through space directly at him! Riker tries to bring up
                   his phaser, but it's too late. The Borg SLAMS into
                   him.

                   Riker makes a desperate grab for the torpedo tube itself,
                   trying to hold on, but the momentum of the Borg impact
                   is too great -- they both tumble off into space together,

 SCRIMM                                      (skeptical)
                             And you know all this... because
                             you're a space-man too...

 PICARD                              I'm afraid you've caught me. I am
                             a space-man.

                   Scrimm smirks at him -- what gall this guy has. But
                   Ruby seems to discern some deeper meaning in Picard's
                   words. She frowns in puzzlement.

 RUBY                                      (quiet)
                             Truth... he's telling the truth...

                   Picard looks at Ruby, and at that moment something on
                   a console behind her catches his eye: a LIGHT on
                   Beverly's SURGICAL TRANSPORTER is now FLASHING. No one
                   else notices.

 SCRIMM                              You're an entertaining man, Mister
                             Picard. But you're also full of
                             shit.

                   Scrimm cocks back the hammer on the pistol he's holding
                   to Ruby's head. The following happens very quickly:

                   -- Picard reaches out his hand, trying to stop Scrimm.

 PICARD                              Now, Geordi!

                   -- The gun in Scrimm's hand DEMATERIALIZES. Scrimm
                   reacts in shock.

                   -- Instantly, the gun REMATERIALIZES in Picard's
                   outstretched hand. He quickly pushes the barrel to
                   Scrimm's forehead.

 PICARD                              Actually, you're full of shit.

                   Everyone is in the room stunned by what's happened.
                   Picard takes charge before anyone can recover.

 PICARD                                      (continuing)
                             Now, tell your men to drop their
                             weapons.

                   There's a beat, but then Scrimm sees he has little
                   choice.

 SCRIMM                              Weapons... down.

                   The other militia soldiers drop their weapons, which
                   are quickly picked up by Beverly and a Starfleet N.D.
                   Picard hands his gun to Lange, who covers Scrimm with
                   it.

                   Ruby turns to Picard.

 PICARD                              Are you all --

                   Ruby throws her arms around him and pulls him close.
                   He hugs her back, grateful she's alive. Ruby pulls
                   away.

 RUBY                              I think you have a plane to catch.

                   Picard smiles and heads back toward the Phoenix...

                   Riker slams into the hull and the BEAM goes OFF. He
                   gets his bearings quickly and then RUNS toward the
                   torpedo tube where Worf and his few remaining men are
                   still fighting the Borg, who are about to overrun their

                   reaches the torpedo tube, pulls up the firing control
                   mechanism, which shows a monitor screen with a cross-
                   hair targeting display. He activates the monitor,
                   which begins tracking over toward the deflector dish.

                   clamps a conduit into a power junction... then grabs
                   hold of a rotating lever inside the tube and TURNS it.
                   He ducks out of the way as the torpedo is LAUNCHED with
                   a ROAR.

                   As the torpedo streaks out from the saucer section and
                   slams into the deflector dish. The dish EXPLODES in a
                   burst of FLAME... blowing away the Borg who were

 204 INT. BRIDGE 204 
                   Troi and the other N.D.s react with relief. The

 205 EXT. MONTANA - MISSILE SILO - WIDE SHOT - DAY 205 
                   as the concrete missile doors slide open and the
                   Phoenix is LAUNCHED up into the sky, riding a pillar of
                   fire and smoke. This is our first real look at the
                   ship and it resembles an oversized ICBM with a
                   specialized cockpit on top.

 206 INT. MISSILE SILO - CONTROL ROOM 206 
                   Lange and the other N.D.s have the militia soldiers
                   under guard. Ruby is watching the missile launch on a
                   video monitor. She smiles.

 207 INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT 207 
                   Picard and Geordi working the controls as the ship

                   The g-forces push them back into their seats.

 GEORDI                              Ignore it. We'll be fine.

                   The rocket booster SHUTS DOWN as the ship leaves
                   Earth's orbit and coasts on its momentum. After a
                   beat, the first stage booster separates from the ship
                   and DROPS AWAY, leaving three-quarters of the ship in
                   space.

 211 INT. BORG HIVE 211 
                   CLOSE ON DATA, head tilted back, eyes closed,
                   smiling...a few droplets of WATER fall from above onto
                   his face. He smiles wider, reveling in the sensation.

 212 WIDER 212 
                   Data is still restrained on the table, but a conduit
                   has been placed above his head and is dripping
                   condensation onto his face. Data is now a completely
                   new being. His entire BODY is now made of HUMAN FLESH.
                   It's a shocking sight -- for anyone who ever wondered
                   what Data would look like human, we're now getting our
                   first look.

 213 THE BORG QUEEN 213 
                   DESCENDS from her nest in the ceiling. She watches
                   Data for a moment... rubs the moisture into his face.

 BORG QUEEN                              A Borg in all but name.

                   Data, although clearly enraptured with his new
                   sensations and feelings still struggles to maintain
                   his own sense of identity.

 DATA                                      (weak)
                             I am... grateful for what you have
                             given me. But I still do not wish
                             to be assimilated.

 BORG QUEEN                              A universe of sensation is waiting
                             for you... don't you want to
                             explore it... with me?

                   To his surprise, Data finds that he is becoming drawn
                   to this strange creature and all that she can offer
                   him.

 DATA                              Yes...

 BORG QUEEN                              Then take the final step... give
                             me the Enterprise... and we can be
                             together... always.

                   He struggles, but ultimately there's only one answer.

 DATA                              No... I cannot.

                   Without taking her eyes away from Data, she reaches out
                   a hand and touches a control on a nearby console. The
                   color of Data's FACE turns an ASHEN GRAY --  as though
                   the blood has drained from his skin. Another droplet
                   of moisture falls and hits him on the cheek -- but this
                   time his eyes widen in shock.

                   The sensation of human feeling is gone.

 BORG QUEEN                              I've deactivated the sensory
                             inputs. That flesh on your body
                             is just meat, now.

 DATA                              No... no, please... you cannot...

                   She moves in close on him, an edge creeping into her
                   voice:

 BORG QUEEN                              You must give me what I want...
                             now. Without the deflector dish,
                             we can no longer send for an early
                             invasion. We must assimilate
                             Earth ourselves. I need this
                             ship.

                   She hits the control, and the COLOR returns to his
                   face. Data gasps -- filled with feeling once again.
                   The Borg Queen runs her hand across his cheek -- her
                   attitude seductive and affectionate once again.

 BORG QUEEN                              Isn't it better like this...?

 DATA                              Yes... but the Enterprise... my
                             duty...

 BORG QUEEN                              ... is to yourself. Don't make me
                             hurt you again...

                   She touches the control again. Data is shocked back
                   into his cold, android self. He's like a heroin addict
                   being denied his "high" with the flick of a switch.

 DATA                              No... no, it's so... empty...
                             please... give it back... I need
                             it...

 BORG QUEEN                              And I need to control this ship.
                             Let me into your mind.

                   Data struggles, anguished... we've never seen him like
                   this before... completely beaten down... finally, he
                   nods. The Borg Queen touches the control again. A
                   sharp intake of breath as the feeling returns to Data.
                   And the Queen kisses him on the mouth.

                   This time, he responds eagerly, throwing himself into
                   the emotion of the moment. She pulls back a little,
                   looks at him softly, passionately. Data stares back at
                   her, breathless -- he seems to be completely in her
                   thrall.

 DATA                              In order to access my neural
                             net... you will need to create a
                             positronic interface.
                                     (beat)
                             I will tell you how.

                   OFF the Borg Queen's smile of victory...

 CUT TO: 
 214 INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT 214 
                   As before. Picard and Geordi work the control in
                   silence for a few moments. The ship is floating in
                   space, now a good distance from Earth.

 GEORDI                              Ready to deploy the warp nacelles.

 PICARD                              As they used to say... all systems
                             are go.

                   Geordi works his console...

 215 EXT. SPACE - THE PHOENIX 215 
                   Two fifty-foot long sheets of metal fall away from the
                   ship on either side of the Phoenix, revealing primitive
                   WARP NACELLES tucked inside the craft. The warp
                   nacelles then begin slowly extending themselves outward
                   on either side -- the basic designs of the nacelles
                   should be familiar to anyone who's ever seen a STAR
                   TREK starship.

                   This is the beginning of a long-standing architectural
                   design element of our ships.

 216 INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT 216 
                   As before.

 GEORDI                              The Vulcans should be out there
                             right now. We need to break the
                             warp barrier in the next five
                             minutes if we're going to get
                             their attention.

 PICARD                              Bring the warp core on-line. I'll
                             lay in a heading.

 GEORDI                              The nacelles are charged...
                             nuclear warhead standing by.
                             We're ready to ignite the warp
                             drive.

 PICARD                              Engage.

 217 EXT. SPACE - THE PHOENIX 217 
                   The warp nacelles FLARE with power and the ship begins
                   moving forward in space.

 218 INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT 218 
                   They're SLAMMED BACK into their seats from the massive
                   G-forces.

 GEORDI                              Warp field looks good...
                             structural integrity holding...

                   Picard activates a monitor which begins showing a 
                   digital display of their speed.

 PICARD                                      (off monitor)
                             Speed... twenty thousand
                             kilometers per second.

 219 EXT. SPACE - THE PHOENIX 219 
                   The ship is going faster... faster...

 220 INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE 220 
                   Troi is standing outside the emergency airlock with the
                   Ensign, who is working the wall panel.

                   The airlock door OPENS after a beat, and Riker, Worf
                   and One Security Guard ENTER. They're exhausted after
                   the pitched battle. Troi smiles at them as they remove
                   their helmets.

 TROI                              I have to admit there was a moment
                             there when --

 RIKER                                      (holds up a hand)
                             Hold that thought.

                   He turns away and then doubles over behind a console
                   and begins vomiting off screen. Worf shrugs.

 WORF                              Strong heart. Weak stomach.

                   A light beat, and then suddenly the entire Bridge GOES
                   DARK -- ALL POWER GONE. Console, monitors, everything.

 RIKER                              Report!

 WORF                              We've lost Bridge control!
 RIKER                              Emergency override!

 WORF                                      (works)
                             Nothing.

 221 INT. BORG HIVE 221 
                   The Borg Queen is floating in the middle of the room,
                   surrounded by Borg consoles and technology. Data is
                   still on the table, with some kind of specialized
                   conduit connecting his head to a group of monitors,
                   which are inactive at the moment. He appears to be
                   caught up in the rapture of his new sensations, and his
                   personal connection to the Borg Queen. All thought of
                   his Starfleet responsibilities are gone.

 DATA                                      (to Queen)
                             I am re-routing Bridge command
                             functions to this location.

                   Data thinks for a moment, and the monitors suddenly
                   COME TO LIFE and the equipment around the Queen HUMS
                   with POWER.

                   Information about critical Enterprise systems flows
                   across the monitor screens -- we might recognize
                   graphics from the Bridge displays. The Borg are now in
                   control.

 BORG QUEEN                              Eliminate their remaining
                             defenses. I will send Borg to
                             assimilate the rest of the crew.

                   Data nods... but then one of the consoles BEEPS.

 DATA                                      (reacts)
                             There is a perimeter alert. A
                             ship has entered sensor range.
 BORG QUEEN                              Vulcan?

 DATA                              No.

                   Data tilts his head and --

 222 A MONITOR 222 
                   shows an exterior space shot. The image rapidly ZOOMS
                   IN on the distant PHOENIX. The ship is racing through
                   space.

 BORG QUEEN                                      (reacts, to Data)
                             Give me helm control.

                   Data nods. Another console lights up. She moves to
                   work it herself...

 223 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE 223 
                   As the ship turns and begins moving off at impulse
                   speed.

 224 INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT 224 
                   As before, Picard is now steering the ship with a 21st
                   century JOYSTICK CONTROL. The ship is moving faster
                   and faster, trembling now, a ROAR building.

 PICARD                              Passing one-half light speed. The
                             starboard nacelle's running a
                             little hot...

 GEORDI                              I'm on it...

                   The CABIN shakes a little.

 GEORDI                              The inertial dampers are having
                             trouble compensating... I don't
                             think Cochrane built this thing
                             for comfort.

 PICARD                              Speed -- two hundred, seventy-five
                             thousand kilometers per second.

                   WHOOSH! A weird DISTORTION passes through the cabin
                   like a wave, then vanishes.

 GEORDI                              There's no temporal shielding in
                             here! We're starting to pick up
                             relativistic effects!

 PICARD                              One minute to warp threshold...

 225 EXT. SPACE 225 
                   The warp ship WHIPS by... and then a moment later, the
                   ENTERPRISE ROARS into view, chasing the tiny ship.

 226 INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT 226 
                   Geordi glances out the window... does a double-take and
                   looks back up in surprise...

 GEORDI                              Captain, the Enterprise!

 PICARD                                      (taps combadge)
                             Picard to Enterprise.
                                     (beat)
                             Picard to Enterprise -- do you
                             read me?

                   No response.

 PICARD                              Their com system must still be
                             down.

 GEORDI                              Well, I feel a whole lot better
                             with them out there. We may need
                             some help.

 227 INT. BORG HIVE 227 
                   As before, the Queen floating above the helm control
                   console. The warp ship is on the monitor, getting
                   closer.

 DATA                              I have repaired the weapons array.
                             Phasers are on-line.

                   A floating CROSSHAIR appears on the monitor showing the
                   warp ship. The Queen works the console. The crosshair
                   moves, but refuses to lock onto the warp ship. She
                   frowns.

 BORG QUEEN                              The targeting lock isn't working.

                   Data looks puzzled.

 DATA                              I do not understand. The optical
                             data network has been repaired,
                             and all systems are functioning.

                   The Queen works furiously, still can't get the
                   crosshairs to lock onto the ship.

 BORG QUEEN                              Your diagnostics are in error. I
                             need weapons.

 DATA                                      (thinks)
                             The problem must lie in the
                             interface between Starfleet and
                             Borg technology. Your console may
                             not be configured to handle the
                             data flow.
 BORG QUEEN                              Can you configure it?

 DATA                              I believe so.

 BORG QUEEN                              Do it.

                   She hits a series of Borg controls on a nearby
                   console... and the restraints holding Data to the table
                   are RELEASED. Two Borg drones move to him... as he
                   stands up and heads for the Queen, the specialized
                   cable still attached to his head...

 228 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE 228 
                   closing in on the tiny warp ship. It's like a shark
                   chasing a guppy.

 229 INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT 229 
                   Ship SHAKING with power and acceleration.

 PICARD                              Approaching light speed...

                   Geordi glances out a side window.

 GEORDI                              They're getting awfully close...
                             what the hell are they doing?
 PICARD                              We're crossing the threshold!

                   The ship is really SHAKING HARD now -- and the
                   compartment is DISTORTING slightly, stretching,
                   everything becoming elongated...

 230 EXT. SPACE - THE PHOENIX 230 
                   The ship is STRETCHING in the familiar "rubber band
                   effect" that tells us a ship is going into warp... but
                   this effect is much slower. It's on the verge of
                   hitting warp speed. The Enterprise still on their
                   tail.

 231 INT. BORG HIVE 231 
                   Data is standing right next to the Queen, and is
                   studying the Borg console intently. Two Borg drones
                   stand nearby, watching closely.

 DATA                              I believe I see the problem.

                   In the blink of an eye:

 -- DATA WHIRLS AROUND AND SLAMS AN ARM INTO ONE OF THE                    BORG DRONES. The drone is knocked off its feet.

                   -- The second Borg rushes at Data, swings his arm at
                   Data's head. This is the same Borg with the deadly
                   stiletto-tipped DRILL SPIKES seen earlier. The spikes
                   TEAR into the flesh of Data's neck, drawing BLOOD.

                   -- Data reacts in pain. He GRABS the Borg's arm and
                   with android strength KICKS HIM IN THE CHEST at the
                   same time. The Borg FLIES BACKWARD, causing the
                   cybernetic ARM to RIP from its socket in a shower of
                   sparks.

                   -- The Borg Queen SWOOPS down at Data for the kill.
                   But Data's too quick for her. With one swift motion,
                   he turns and THROWS the BORG ARM like a JAVELIN across
                   the room.

 232 NEW ANGLE 232 
                   As the spikes on the severed Borg arm PUNCTURE one of
                   the diathermic oxygen tanks seen earlier. A HUGE
                   EXPLOSION of DEADLY GAS bursts out of the ruptured
                   tank. The WALL of roiling gas sweeps through the
                   entire Borg Hive.

 BORG QUEEN                                      (screams)
                             No!

                   She lunges at Data just as the gas envelopes them!

 233 EXT. SPACE - THE PHOENIX 233 
                   As it GOES INTO WARP -- it shoots forward and streaks
                   away from the Enterprise!

 234 INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT 234 
                   As Picard and Geordi are slammed back into their seats
                   and the stars WHIP PAST the windows in the familiar
                   warp effect.

 235 INT. BORG HIVE 235 
                   Data and the Borg Queen tearing and clawing at each 
                   other amongst the spewing gas. The Borg drones try to
                   get away, but they are SWALLOWED by the rush of gas,
                   fall to the deck, twitching in pain.

                   Data and the Borg Queen both fall to the deck,
                   grappling with each other.

 236 EXT. SPACE - THE WARP SHIP 236 
                   As it STREAKS PAST -- the warp ship flying at top
                   speed.

 237 INT. BORG HIVE 237 
                   Data and the Borg Queen struggling against each
                   other... the gas swirling around their bodies... and as
                   it does, we see the FLESH on their bodies start to
                   LIQUEFY and MELT AWAY in a horrific ooze of blood and
                   skin.

 238 INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT 238 
                   As before, but the ride has smoothed out considerably,
                   Warp stars streaking by.

 PICARD                              Bring us about...

                   A beat as Geordi works.

 GEORDI                              Dropping out of warp.

                   Out the front windows, the warp stars STOP... the ship
                   JOLTS slightly... turns to the left... Earth can be
                   seen in the distance.

                   They smile. It's a moment of victory.

 PICARD                              Let's begin the landing procedure.

 239 INT. CARGO BAY/BORG HIVE 239 
                   The onrush of gas is gone. But it has affected every
                   surface of the room like an acid wash. Every piece of
                   Borg machinery is smoking and hissing. The two Borg
                   drones are lying on the floor, dead -- all organic
                   matter and flesh have been dissolved from their bodies,
                   leaving only raw mechanical skeletons.

 MOVE TO REVEAL: 
 240 DATA AND THE BORG QUEEN 240 
                   lying on the floor, still locked together. Data is a
                   shocking image: all of his human flesh has been
                   STRIPPED AWAY, leaving only his pure android self. His
                   metallic skull gleams in the dim light... even his eyes
                   are gone. His mechanical left arm is still intact, but
                   the right human arm is completely gone. His torso is
                   stripped of the human flesh, leaving pure android with
                   no soft human touches. Data as we've never seen him
                   before -- raw and mechanistic.

                   Data rolls over... still locked around him is the
                   MECHANICAL SKELETON of the Borg Queen. A metallic
                   spinal column with two arms with clawed hands leading
                   off it... and a blinking, electronic BRAIN STEM at the
                   very top of the spine.

                   Data throws off the grotesque form. The Borg Queen
                   carcass writhes and claws at the air. She speaks in a
                   flat, mechanical voice.

 BORG QUEEN                                      (fritzed)
                             Data...

                   Data reaches out with one hand... grabs the metal
                   spinal column just below the brain stem... and SNAPS IT
                   IN TWO. The blinking brain stem FRITZES OUT.

 241 INT. CORRIDOR 241 
                   Two Borg Drones moving down the hall suddenly stop...
                   twitch... the blinkies on their bodies GO OUT... and
                   they both FALL OVER DEAD. Their connection to their
                   Queen severed.

 242 INT. JEFFERIES TUBE 242 
                   Another Borg Drone reacts... lights out... slumps over
 DEAD. 
 243 INT. BORG HIVE 243 
                   Data releases the remains of the dead Borg Queen. He
                   leans back a little, as though exhausted by his
                   remarkable experience. CAMERA PULLS BACK, emphasizing
                   the loneliness of this smoking, scorched android
                   sitting alone in the ruins of the Borg Hive...

 CUT TO: 
 244 EXT. MISSILE SILO - DAY 244 
                   The missile doors now open, the ground badly scorched
                   from the launch. Scrimm and his militia guards are
                   sitting on the ground, while Lange and the other
                   Starfleet N.D. keep a watchful eye on them. Cochrane
                   is sitting against a rock, while Beverly checks him
                   over. Ruby is pacing, lost in thought...

 PICARD'S VOICE                              Isn't anyone going to say welcome
                             back?

                   Everyone looks up to see --

 245 PICARD AND GEORDI 245 
                   standing a few feet away, tired but triumphant.

 BEVERLY                              Did it work?

                   Picard nods. Beverly, Lange and the N.D. look
                   relieved. Ruby takes a few steps toward Picard.

 246 COCHRANE 246 
                   smiles up at Geordi.

 COCHRANE                              Mister La Forge... now I'd like to
                             shake your hand.

                   Geordi smiles and walks over to him.

 247 PICARD AND RUBY 247 
                   stop a few feet away from each other, their eyes
                   locked. They drink in sight of each other...
                   there's an undercurrent of unspoken feelings and words.
                   She smiles... he smiles back. A satisfying moment.

 PICARD (V.O.)                              Captain's log, March 3rd, 2063.
                             The voyage of the Phoenix was a
                             success... again.

 CUT TO: 
 248 EXT. RESURRECTION CITY - NIGHT 248 
                   Townspeople along the Main Street. A sense of
                   urgency -- something's going on.

 PICARD (V.O.)                              And it appears the Vulcan ship has
                             detected the warp signature and is
                             now on its way to Earth.

                   Suddenly something in the night sky catches their
                   attention. A BRIGHT LIGHT is moving down towards the
                   city. We now realize this is what people are reacting
                   to...

 249 JUST OUTSIDE OF TOWN 249 
                   Just a hundred yards beyond the city limits we see the
                   massive VULCAN SCOUT SHIP SETTLING down onto the
                   ground. Dust flying everywhere. Windmill blades
                   spinning wildly from the exhaust.

 250 THE TOWNSPEOPLE 250 
                   squinting into the wind, trying to make out what's
                   happening...

 251 NEW ANGLE - ON A HILLTOP 251 
                   A good distance away, but with a good view of the
                   entire scene. Riker, Worf, Beverly, Troi and Geordi
                   watching from a distance as the Vulcan ship LANDS.

 252 JUST OUTSIDE OF TOWN 252                    Picard, Ruby and a bandaged, but much healthier Zephram
                   Cochrane watching the landing. People from town are
                   surging around them. Everyone is shocked and amazed at
                   what they're seeing. Picard watches with satisfaction --
                   this is the moment he's been waiting for.

                   Cochrane and Ruby are particularly awestruck.

 253 THE VULCAN SHIP 253 
                   settles, engines whining down... dust settling.
 254 PICARD 254 
                   moves to Cochrane, takes him gently by the arm.

 PICARD                              Doctor Cochrane... this is your
                             moment.

                   Cochrane looks a little bewildered, tries to grapple
                   with the moment.

 COCHRANE                              My God... they're really from
                             another world?

 PICARD                              That's right. And they're going
                             to want to meet the man who flew
                             that warp ship.

                   Cochrane looks at him.

 COCHRANE                              And that's supposed to be me...

 PICARD                              Zephram, you had the vision to
                             build that ship when no one else
                             on this planet could see beyond
                             their own problems.
                                     (beat)
                             You flew that ship... all I did
                             was push a few buttons.

                   Cochrane looks at him for a moment... takes a breath,
                   nods...

 COCHRANE                              All right.
                                     (beat)
                             And don't worry -- I'll keep your
                             secret.

                   They hear a mechanical WHIRR and a HISS of air.

 255 NEW ANGLE 255 
                   as a HATCH opens on the Vulcan ship. The townspeople
                   behind them react with shock and fear... a few people
                   take a step back. Picard looks at Cochrane, who
                   hesitates for a moment... then finally takes a deep
                   breath... and strides out toward the alien ship. A man
                   alone about to change the course of human history.

                   Ruby moves closer to Picard and puts her arm around
                   him... and he puts his arm around her.

 256 HILLTOP 256 
                   As the rest of our crew is enraptured by the moment...
                   they glance at each other with excitement as they watch
                   history unfold...

 257 VULCAN SHIP 257 
                   Cochrane stops a few feet away from the ship as the
                   hatch swings completely open... light streams out into
                   the night air... and THREE HOODED, ROBED FIGURES
                   EMERGE. They stand across from Cochrane -- a moment
                   frozen in time.

 258 THE TOWNSPEOPLE 258 
                   watching in awe...

 259 PICARD AND RUBY 259 
                   watching...

 260 THE LEAD VULCAN 260 
                   pulls his hood back, revealing the familiar slanted
                   eyebrows and pointed ears, holding himself with that
                   austere, regal dignity we've come to associate with his
                   race. He steps forward to greet Cochrane... raises his
                   hand as if to wave.

                   Cochrane raises his hand automatically, as if to wave
                   in return...

                   But then the Vulcan splits his fingers in the classic
                   Vulcan greeting.

 VULCAN                              Live Long and Prosper.

                   Cochrane tries to emulate the Vulcan hand-sign...but
                   can't quite do the awkward finger-split.

 COCHRANE                              Um... thanks.

                   The Vulcan cocks an eyebrow at him. The very first
                   Alien-Human relationship is underway...

 261 PICARD AND RUBY 261 
                   are now surrounded by townspeople, who are watching the
                   scene unfold...

 262 HILLTOP 262 
                   Our heroes share a glance with each other and smile,
                   Riker taps his combadge.

 RIKER                              Riker to Enterprise. Five to beam
                             up.

                   The crew DEMATERIALIZES...

 263 PICARD AND RUBY 263 
                   have now moved away from the crowd... no one paying
                   attention to them. The bright lights from the Vulcan
                   ship cast them in a dramatic silhouette. Picard turns
                   to Ruby. It's the moment he's been dreading. This is
                   goodbye. She looks at him.

 RUBY                              You're leaving, aren't you?

 PICARD                              I have to...

 RUBY                              Where? And don't tell me San
                             Francisco...

 PICARD                              No. It's a lot further than that.

 RUBY                              It's the future, isn't it? Just
                             like you told Scrimm.
                                     (beat)
                             I knew you weren't from around
                             here.

 PICARD                                      (with humor)
                             No... I'm from France.

 RUBY                              I don't care if you're from France
                             or Venus... just take me with you.

 PICARD                              That's impossible.

 RUBY                              Why?

 PICARD                              This may be hard for you to
                             understand... but I'm duty-bound
                             not to interfere with you, or
                             anyone else here... any more than
                             is absolutely necessary.

 RUBY                              You've been interfering with my
                             life ever since I met you.
                                     (with meaning)
                             Don't stop now.

                   Picard struggles... he doesn't want to do this, but
                   he's torn between his heart and his duty.

 PICARD                              Ruby... I'm sorry.
                                     (remembering his words
                                      to Beverly)
                             But our fates lie along different
                             paths.

                   A long, difficult moment... then he lets her go...
                   turns and starts walking off into the night. She
                   stands where she is, watching him go with tears in her
                   eyes...

                   Picard hits his combadge.

 PICARD                              Picard to Enterprise. One to...

                   He stops where he is.

 RIKER'S COM VOICE                              Riker here. Captain, we didn't
                             get your whole transmission.

                   Picard turns, looks back at Ruby. Their eyes meet...
                   and he makes the decision.

 PICARD                              To hell with fate.

 RIKER'S COM VOICE                              Say again, Captain?

                   He starts walking towards her. She sees him coming...
                   starts running to him. She throws herself into his
                   arms and he holds her close. They kiss. A magical
                   moment, then...

 PICARD                              Enterprise. Two to beam up.

                   They DEMATERIALIZE holding each other tight...

 264 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE 264 
                   moving out of Earth orbit...

 265 INT. BRIDGE 265 
                   Riker, Worf, Troi, N.D.s. Picard ENTERS with Ruby.
                   Everyone reacts to seeing her there. Ruby stays in the
                   Turbolift, staring around the Bridge in amazement.
                   Picard takes her hand and leads her out onto the
                   Bridge.

 PICARD                              How's Mister Data?

                   Riker glances at Ruby uneasily.

 RIKER                              He's in Sickbay. Doctor Crusher
                             says he can be repaired... but we
                             have to wait until we...

                   He glances at Ruby again, awkward. But Picard finishes
                   his thought.

 PICARD                              Return to our own time?

 RIKER                              Yes, sir.

 PICARD                              Then make it so. Have you
                             determined how to recreate the
                             temporal vortex?

                   Picard sits in his chair. Riker hesitates.

 RIKER                              Yes, sir. But Captain... are
                             we... all going back?

 PICARD                              Unless you'd like to stay.
 RIKER                              No, sir.

                   Ruby stands stock-still, staring at Worf. Worf looks
                   up at her with a Klingon smile -- teeth and all.

                   Ruby manages a weak smile in return, then moves off to
                   stand next to Picard.

 RIKER                              Bridge to Engineering. Mister La
                             Forge... initiate the temporal
                             vortex.

 266 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE 266 
                   moving through space... and then the TEMPORAL VORTEX
                   forms directly ahead of it, as seen before. The ship
                   ENTERS the vortex...

 267 EXT. SPACE - THE 24TH CENTURY 267 
                   The Enterprise EXITS the VORTEX and into Earth orbit.

 268 INT. BRIDGE 268 
                   As before.

 WORF                              Incoming transmission from
                             Starfleet Command. Admiral Hayes.

 PICARD                              Onscreen.

 269 INCLUDE VIEWER 269 
                   Admiral Hayes appears.

 PICARD                              Admiral... what's the status of
                             the Borg fleet?

 ADMIRAL HAYES                              It's been destroyed. The Borg
                             threat is over.
                                     (beat)
                             Are you all right? The Enterprise
                             disappeared from our sensors for
                             a moment.

 PICARD                              We're fine, sir. It will take
                             some... time to explain.

 ADMIRAL HAYES                              I look forward to reading your
                             report.

                   The transmission ends. Ruby turns to Picard with
                   amazement.

 RUBY                              That makes two of us.

                   Picard gives her a gentle smile. OFF the moment...

 CUT TO: 
 270 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE 270 
                   The great ship entering a Starfleet SPACE DOCK.

 271 INT. BORG HIVE/ENVIROMENTAL CONTROL ROOM 271                    Geordi is directing a work crew of a dozen engineers,
                   as they clean up the room and repair the damage.

 GEORDI                                      (to a couple of N.D.s)
                             No, no -- we'll have to rip out
                             this entire bulkhead. We'll need
                             new bracing members for the deck
                             above and below.

                   The N.D.s move off, making notes on their PADDS.
                   Geordi turns and sees Data standing in the doorway.
                   He's now been fully restored to his original android
                   self.

 GEORDI                              Data...

                   Geordi moves to him, puts a hand on his shoulder.

 GEORDI                              You look good as new.

 DATA                              You could say that I'm back to my
                             old self.

 GEORDI                              That's great.

                   Geordi's smile fades a little as Data walks into the
                   room.

 DATA                              Her remains... are they still
                             here?

                   Geordi points over to a corner, where some N.D.s are
                   about to close a storage container. Data walks over.
                   Geordi goes with him. The N.D.s move aside, and Data
                   looks down into the storage container. The broken,
                   mangles pieces of machinery are all that's left of the
                   Borg Queen.

 GEORDI                              I'm sending them to the Daystrom
                             Institute for analysis.

                   Data stares down at the remains with a haunted look.

 DATA                              I never realized how powerful an
                             emotion temptation could be.

 GEORDI                              Temptation? You said in your
                             report it was all a ruse... you
                             were manipulating her.

                   A quiet beat.

 DATA                              She was... a unique lifeform. In
                             her own way... nearly perfect.

                   Geordi smiles a little.

 GEORDI                                      (joking)
                             It almost sounds like you miss
                             her.

                   Data looks up at him -- his expression unreadable.
                   Geordi's smile fades. Data reaches out, closes the lid
                   on the storage container, turns and walks out of the
                   room. Geordi watches him go, left to wonder what Data
                   is really feeling.

 CUT TO: 
 272 EXT. MONTANA - HILLTOP - DAY 272                    Picard and Ruby walk up the familiar hilltop, and when
                   they reach the crest, we reveal...

 273 A MOMENT 273 
                   A large memorial cordoned off by a chain. A PLAQUE on
                   the monument reads "On this spot, Man and Vulcan met
                   for the first time... and changed the course of
                   history. March 3rd, 2063."

 274 PICARD AND RUBY 274 
                   step into view. They stare at the sculpture for a
                   moment.

 PICARD                              Welcome home.

 275 WIDE SHOT 275 
                   Picard, Ruby and the monument are at the gates of
                   RESURRECTION CITY as it is in the 23rd century. This
                   is the place where man first reached out to the stars,
                   and the architecture has a distinctive uplifting
                   feeling -- spires reaching up toward the sky.
                   Shuttlecraft and aircars are taking off and landing.
                   The tiny Western town is now a thriving, futuristic
 METROPOLIS. 
                   As Picard and Ruby walk towards the city hand-in-
                   hand...

 FADE TO BLACK.

                                                               September 29, 1995





 1 A BLACK VOID 1 
                   We can hear movement. Strange skittering sounds, like
                   razor-claws on metal... the hiss of pneumatic hoses...
                   the whirr and click of servos... liquid gurgling... an
                   eerie, alien cacophony.

 2 EARTH 2 
                   appears, hanging now in the starry blackness. The
                   alien noises continue, and far in the distance we hear
                   the muffled THUMP of what could be a distant explosion.
                   Alien TEXT suddenly appears next to Earth, and we
                   REVEAL we are in --

 3 INT. BORG RECON CENTER 3 
                   The image of Earth is actually on a monitor, which is
                   only one of DOZENS of MONITORS covering a huge wall.
                   We don't see anything of the rest of the room, but the
                   technology in view is distinctly alien and bizarre --
                   a mixture of organic and mechanical elements.
                   Circuitry and optical cabling are side-by-side with
                   what looks almost like arteries and organs. We can
                   still hear the creepy skittering and gurgling noises.
                   Occasionally, a SHADOWY FORM sweeps past the camera,
                   vaguely humanoid but we can't tell who or what it is.

                   All of the monitors are active, and they present myriad
                   IMAGES and SOUND -- all related to EARTH HISTORY. The
                   screens show everything from written Chinese... to
                   Renaissance paintings... to black and white newsreel
                   footage of World War Two... to what look like clips of
                   space battles from the 24th century. The entire range
                   of human history dancing across the monitors. The
                   effect is dizzying -- we get the feeling that whoever
                   is watching this is studying the human race.

                   There is another THUMP and the wall of monitors
                   SHUDDERS slightly. We hear the VOICE of what we will
                   come to know as the BORG COLLECTIVE -- thousands of
                   voices speaking at once :

 BORG                              Restrict search parameters to 1-9-
                             9-8 through 2-0-8-4.

                   The images on the monitors now change to show us images
                   from 21ST CENTURY Earth history.

                   Again, it's a collection of still photography, video
                   footage, text, artwork, etc. We hear snippets of sound-
                   bites, music, speeches from the period. A lot of
                   enticing details. As the images race across the
                   monitors, we should learn the following.

                   -- The turn of the 21st century brought chaos.
                   Regional wars, the collapse of the United Nations.
                   Societal break-down. Crime, starvation, desperation.

                   -- A Third World War. Nuclear explosions,
                   environmental disasters, tens of millions dead. The
                   United States ceases to exist. All political authority
                   vanishes. Humanity teetering on the edge of the Second
                   Dark Age.

                   -- The image of a single man -- ZEPHRAM COCHRANE. A
                   visionary scientist. He see the spacecraft he created
                   out of a nuclear missile. He flies the first warp
                   test, breaking the light barrier. It changes history.

                   -- Grainy black and white images of a VULCAN SCOUT SHIP
                   landing on Earth. They saw Cochrane's flight, followed
                   him back to Earth, and made First Contact with the
                   human race.

                   -- Humanity turns the corner. First Contact with an
                   alien civilization brings the planet together as never
                   before. Humans and Vulcans working together, beginning
                   to solve long-standing problems with new technology.
                   We see an early replicator producing food for the
                   starving millions. A new World Government is formed.

                   -- People from planet Earth and people from Vulcan form
                   an Alliance. They call it the United Federation of 
                   Planets. And they commission a fleet of starships for
                   protection and exploration. They call it Starfleet.

                   -- These are images recounting the birth of the Star
                   Trek universe.

                   Another muffled EXPLOSION, this one stronger, SHAKES
                   the entire wall. One of the monitors BLOWS OUT in a
                   shower of sparks. And now a new voice, a woman's
                   voice, low, threatening, with a slight metallic
                   inflection, speaks for the first time:

 WOMAN'S VOICE                              Stop search. Calculate temporal
                             coordinates. J-Fourteen.

                   Another explosion ROCKS the room and it takes us to:

 4 EXT. SPACE - A BORG SPHERE 4 
                   A huge, spherical Borg warship as it takes a phaser
                   shot from an unseen vessel. The BLAST smashes into the
                   Borg Sphere, but the massive ship continues. The
                   Sphere returns FIRE. FOLLOW the Borg fire to --

 5 A FEDERATION STARSHIP 5 
                   locked in battle with the Borg Sphere. The Borg fire
                   DESTROYS the Federation ship in a fiery blast.

 6 NEW ANGLE 6 
                   as the Borg Sphere flies away from the wreckage of the
                   decimated starship, and as it does, we reveal that this
                   is just one small part of --

 7 A MASSIVE SPACE BATTLE 7 
                   involving dozens of Starfleet and Borg vessels, engaged
                   in a fierce FIREFIGHT as far as the eye can see. Ships
                   turning, twisting, firing, exploding. Lots of movement. 
                   It's a spectacular sight.

                   The Borg Sphere is moving away from the battle, heading
                   off in another direction.
 8 NEW ANGLE 8 
                   In the middle of the battle. A BORG CUBE is attacking
                   a smaller Federation starship. The starship is taking
                   quite a beating... explosions all along the hull... it
                   doesn't look like it can take much  more of this.

                   Suddenly a spread of FOUR TORPEDOES come blazing in
                   from O.C. The torpedoes SLAM into the Borg ship,
                   causing massive damage.

 9 THE USS ENTERPRISE NCC 1701-E 9 
                   SOARS into view and moves to protect the beleaguered
                   starship.

                   The Enterprise is Starfleet's newest and most powerful
                   vessel. An elegant and majestic ship. But unlike the
                   last Enterprise, Starfleet has opted for a more
                   muscular vessel and the hull is studded with weapons
                   and other defensive armory. We get the feeling this
                   Enterprise is ready for anything.

 10 INT. ENTERPRISE-E - BRIDGE 10 
                   The Bridge has been redesigned. A single Captain's
                   chair dominates the room, and surrounding consoles and
                   stations all face inward instead of out, giving Picard
                   instant access to his officers. PICARD in the
                   Captain's chair. RIKER at a new Ops station. DATA at
                   the helm. WORF at Tactical. TROI at Communications,
                   various CREWMEMBERS at their posts. The ship is at Red
                   Alert and everyone is tense.

 PICARD                              Signal the Endeavor to fall back.
                             We'll cover them.

 TROI                              Aye, sir.

                   She works her console.

              11   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE & BORG SHIP                     11

                   The Endeavor moves off as the Borg FIRE at the
                   Enterprise and BLASTS the saucer section. This should
                   also produce an unusual effect -- instead of the
                   traditional "bubble" shielding, the new armor of this
                   Enterprise ABSORBS the blast and dissipates the energy
                   across the hull. The ship is undamaged.

 12 INT. BRIDGE 12 
                   The ship is ROCKED by the blast.

 DATA                              Dispersive armor is holding.

 PICARD                              Bring us about. Target Borg ship
                             alpha four, port side battery.

 WORF                              Port battery, ready sir!

 PICARD                              Fire.

 13 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE 13 
                   As RAPID PHASER SHOTS leap out from half a dozen points
                   along the ship's port side. (NOTE: The phasers also
                   look different, more along the lines of a gatling gun).
                   The Borg Cube EXPLODES. The Enterprise flies through
                   the debris.

 14 INT. BRIDGE 14 
                   Including MAIN VIEWSCREEN, which has a view of the
                   chaotic battle surrounding them. Another Borg vessel
                   looms into view.

 PICARD                              Starboard battery -- fire.

 15 EXT. SPACE 15 
                   The Enterprise fires a burst of phasers -- but this
                   time, the phasers have no effect. We see a strange
                   SHIELDING appears around the Borg ship.

 16 INT. BRIDGE 16 
                   On the main viewer, the massive Borg ship looms closer.

 DATA                              The Borg ship has modified its
                             shields, Captain. Our phasers
                             will no longer be effective.

 PICARD                              Ready quantum torpedo.

 WORF                              Aye, sir. Only three left.

                   Another JOLT as we're hit.

 GEORDI'S COM VOICE                              La Forge to bridge.

 PICARD                              Go ahead.

 INTERCUT: 
 17 INT. MAIN ENGINEERING 17 
                   Where GEORDI and N.D. Engineers are rushing about, hard
                   at work. Geordi is no longer wearing his VISOR -- he
                   now has artificial ocular implants for eyes. They have
                   a distinctive electronic look to them.

 GEORDI                              Captain, I'm starting to worry
                             about the hull integrity. We've
                             been running the support field at
                             full power for three hours
                             straight. I don't know how much
                             longer it's going to hold up.

 PICARD                              Understood. Keep me informed.

 END INTERCUT: 
 18 INT. BRIDGE 18 
                   The Borg cube is huge on the main viewer as the
                   Enterprise rushes toward it.

 TROI                              Incoming transmission from the
                             Borg.

                   Data works and the viewer changes to a view of the
                   INTERIOR of the BORG CUBE. A vast CHAMBER crammed with
                   HUNDREDS of BORG DRONES standing upright in individual
                   alcoves. They're everywhere -- on the ceiling, walls,
                   floor. This is a BORG COLLECTIVE -- hundreds of Borg
                   that form a gigantic "hive" mind. The Borg are half-
                   man/half machine. No individual personalities. No
                   feelings. They have only one goal in life: to
                   assimilate new races into their collective. To become
                   a Borg is to experience living death. When they speak,
                   they speak as a collective -- thousands of voices
                   speaking as one:

 BORG                              Your defense perimeter is
                             useless. You will be assimilated.

 PICARD                                      (to Borg)
                             Break off your attack. By now,
                             you must realize you can't win...

 BORG                              Your opinion is irrelevant. We
                             are the Borg. Resistance is
                             futile.
 PICARD                              We'll see about that...

 19 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE - CLOSE ON TORPEDO BAY 19 
                   A QUANTUM TORPEDO BLASTS out of the launcher and heads
                   toward the Borg cube. This torpedo is completely
                   different than the traditional photon torpedo. It
                   oscillates and changes shape and color as it streaks 
                   toward the Borg ship.

                   as the quantum torpedo HITS IT. But instead of
                   exploding on the surface, the torpedo PIERCES the ship
                   like an armor-piercing shell and momentarily VANISHES
                   from view. The ship then EXPLODES like a star going
                   supernova -- bright light and shock waves.

                             Weapons status?

 WORF                              Phasers are off-line... we have
                             two quantum torpedoes left. But
                             the computer targeting system has
                             been destroyed.

 PICARD                              Go to manual.

                   Worf pops open a panel and a high-tech TARGETING console
                   emerges with a small MONITOR and a traditional CROSS-
                   HAIR in the center. Worf grabs the targeting hand-
                   controls -- futuristic joysticks.

 40 EXT. SPACE - THE BORG SPHERE 40 
                   The ship is FIRING its weapons down toward the planet
                   as the Enterprise comes up over the horizon.

 41 INT. BRIDGE 41 
                   As before. Worf works his controls. A complex array
                   of grids, coordinate information, speed data, and other
                   weapons info on the monitor screen. He begins trying
                   to focus the cross-hairs on the Sphere.

 PICARD                                      (over above action, to

 RIKER                              They've seen us. They're taking

                             Mister Worf?

                   Worf struggles with the targeting system.

 WORF                              Target...

                   The crosshairs keep missing the image of the Borg
                   Sphere, which is now twisting and turning to evade us.
                   Troi reacts to her console.

 TROI                              Captain, they're firing at a
                             nuclear missile silo... in central
                             Montana.

 WORF                                     (struggling)

                             Montana...

                   The crosshairs finally LOCK on the Borg Sphere.

 WORF                              Target locked!

 PICARD                              Fire!

 42 EXT. SPACE - THE BORG SPHERE 42 
                   The quantum torpedo streaks in from off-camera and
                   slams into the Borg ship. It penetrates the Sphere as
                   seen before... a long beat... and then it EXPLODES.

 43 INT. BRIDGE 43 
                   As everyone reacts to the destruction of the Sphere.
                   But Picard has no time for celebration.

 PICARD                                      (to Data)
                             Mister Data, I want to know the
                             exact date and time.
                                     (to Riker)
                             Give me a damage report on that
                             missile silo.

 DATA                                      (works)
                             Today is March second, 2063. The
                             time in Montana is oh-eight-forty-
                             five.

 RIKER                                      (works)
                             Looks like they damaged the
                             silo...

 PICARD                              Life signs?

 RIKER                              Can't tell. Long-range bio-
                             sensors are off-line.

                   Picard thinks for a moment... makes an instant decision
                   and turns to Worf.

 PICARD                              Worf, have Doctor Crusher, Mister
                             La Forge and a security team meet
                             me in Transporter Room Three.
                             Civilian clothes.

 WORF                              Aye, sir.

                   Worf works. Riker turns to him, curious.

 RIKER                              Captain?

 PICARD                              In twenty-four hours, Zephram
                             Cochrane is supposed to conduct
                             the very first warp test... from
                             a missile silo in Montana. If I'm
                             right, the Borg were trying to
                             change the course of human history
                             by killing him or destroying his
                             ship.

 RIKER                                      (nods in understanding)
                             And if they succeed, humans won't
                             make First Contact with the
                             Vulcans tomorrow.
                                     (beat)
                             As First Officer I should be the
                             one beaming down...

 PICARD                              Normally, I would agree. But in
                             this case, the mission requires a
                             certain knowledge of 21st century
                             history. You're many things,
                             Number One, but you're not much of
                             an historian.

                   He grins slightly, has to agree.

 RIKER                              Good luck, sir.

 PICARD                              I'll keep in contact. You have
                             the Bridge.

 CUT TO: 
 44 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM 44 
                   Picard, Geordi and THREE SECURITY GUARDS are checking
                   their phasers and tricorders. Everyone is wearing civilian
                   clothes. Geordi has a large engineering kit... Transporter 
                   Chief pulling on a civilian jacket. She looks a little 
                   frazzled - it's been a long day in Sickbay.

 BEVERLY                              Will somebody please tell me where 
                             we're going?

                   Beverly joins them on the pad.

 PICARD                              Montana.

                             everything. Why the hell are we --

                   They DEMATERIALIZE.

                   Picard, Geordi, Beverly and the Security Team
                   MATERIALIZE on the vast, rolling plains of Montana.

 BEVERLY                                      (continuing)
                             -- going to Montana?

                   Picard and Geordi take out their tricorders and start
                   scanning the landscape.

 GEORDI                                      (off tricorder)
                             I have the silo, sir. Bearing

 PICARD                              Let's go.

                   They start walking...

 BEVERLY                              Go where? Hello? Is anyone going
                             to tell me what we're doing here?

 PICARD                              We're here to find Zephram
                             Cochrane. He may be injured or
                             dead.

 BEVERLY                              Cochrane... the inventor of warp
                             drive?

 PICARD                              Yes...

 BEVERLY                              But he's been dead for three
                             hundred...
                                     (realizes, long sigh)
                             Oh God... we've gone back in time
                             again, haven't we?

 PICARD                              I'm afraid so. If the Borg
                             succeed in preventing First
                             Contact with the Vulcans... Earth
                             will remain in the Second Dark
                             Age... an easy target when the
                             Borg arrive in the 24th century.

 BEVERLY                              Well, why didn't you just say so
                             in the first place?

                   Picard gives her a look. As they keep walking...

                   CLOSE ON A DEAD CREWMEMBER lying on her back. A sheet

                   the sheet, revealing the face of a crewman.

 TROI                              Lieutenant Sandra Farrel.

                   There is repair work going on in the b.g. Two medical
                   N.D.s stand by.

 TROI                              It appears death was caused by a
                             plasma discharge.

                             never left her post.

                   Troi glances at Data, who is clearly disturbed by the
                   sight of the dead woman, holding his EMOTIONS in check
                   with difficulty.

 TROI                              Did you know her?

 DATA                              Not very well. We met shortly
                             after the Enterprise-E was
                             commissioned. I found her to be
                             a most... promising officer.

                   Troi looks at him in concern.

 TROI                              Data... are you sure you're all
                             right?

 DATA                              I am still having difficulty
                             integrating certain emotions into
                             my programming. Grief, loss,

 TROI                              We still have to make reports on
                             ten more crewmen killed in action.
                             Maybe you should deactivate your
                             emotion chip until we're done.

                   Data considers.

 DATA                              No. Human beings do not have that
                             luxury, and neither should I.

 TROI                              I will admit... there are times
                             when I wish I had an emotion chip
                             I could turn on and off.

                             would liquefy your flesh on
                             contact.

 PORTER                              Be my guest, sir.

                   Data walks over to the spewing gas tank, and without
                   concern shoves both hands into the corrosive gas...

                   ... groping around for the broken conduit, finally grabs
                   hold of it... and with android strength BENDS the metal
                   conduit back into the bulkhead. The gas stops leaking.
                   Data is completely unaffected by the corrosive gas.
 DATA                                       (to Porter)
                             Begin a diagnostic on the safety
                             interlocks. There appears to have
                             been some damage during the
                             attack.

 PORTER                              Right.

                   Porter moves around a corner, behind some equipment,
                   out of Data's vision...

 51 NEW ANGLE - PORTER 51 
                   who opens a PANEL on the wall. But instead of the neat
                   and orderly Starfleet technology, he is confronted by
                   a bizarre amalgam of organic and mechanical cabling,
                   diodes and what almost look like arteries. Some of the
                   tubes are pulsing with fluids and energy. Porter
                   reacts.

 PORTER                              What the hell...

                   Porter pulls aside a large conduit and stops. Buried
                   deep within the tangle of bio-circuits is what looks
                   like a HUMAN FACE covered with cybernetic tubes and
                   chips. It's barely discernable in the darkness and
                   clutter. Porter isn't even sure what he's looking at.
                   He leans in for a closer look... and suddenly the eyes
                   open.

 52 DATA 52 
                   who hears a THUMP and a sickening liquid CRUNCH from
                   off camera. He takes a few steps in that direction.

 DATA                              Ensign Porter?

                   He stands there for a moment, puzzled. Then a faint
                   SKITTERING SCRAPE can be heard -- like tiny claws on a
                   metal surface. He  whirls at the sound.

 DATA                              Ensign... are you all right?

                   No response. Data walks around the now deathly quiet
                   room... turns the corner to where Porter was working.
                   He's gone. The open panel is still there, and there
                   doesn't appear to be any place Porter could've gone.
                   Data looks puzzled, takes a step forward when his boots
                   make a squishing sound. He looks down...

                             Data to Bridge.

                             This is Lieutenant Data to anyone
                             who can hear my signal. I need
                             assistance in the Environmental
                             Control Room.

                   Nothing. Data quickly turns and heads for the door.
                   There's a metallic SCRAPE above him and he looks up --

 53 TWO BORG 53 
                   are climbing to the ceiling like two spiders ready to
                   pounce. One of them has Porter and appears to be
                   inserting some horrible Borg device into his head.
                   Before Data can react, the second Borg suddenly lunges
                   at Data.

 CUT TO: 
 54 EXT. MONTANA PLAINS - MISSILE SILO - DAY 54 
                   The SILO is buried deep underground, but on the surface
                   there is a large, poured concrete MISSILE DOOR.

                   Built to withstand a nuclear blast, the door has
                   nevertheless been badly charred and damaged by the Borg
                   attack from orbit. There are large, smoking CRATERS
                   all around. Part of the ground seems to have COLLAPSED
                   to a depth of ten feet, like a sinkhole nearby. Picard
                   and his team approach.

 GEORDI                              This must be it.

 PICARD                              How serious is the damage?

 GEORDI                                       (off tricorder)
                             I'm having trouble scanning
                             underground. There's a lot of
                             radiation leaking from something.

 PICARD                              Probably from the nuclear warhead.
                             Cochrane was planning to use it to
                             ignite the warp drive.

                   As they speak, Beverly pulls out a hypospray and gives
                   everyone injections.

 BEVERLY                              This will protect us from the
                             radiation.

                   Geordi moves to the thick, concrete missile door, scans
                   it.

 GEORDI                              I'm picking up faint life signs
                             twenty meters below.

 PICARD                              There should be an access hatch
                             nearby...

                   Everyone spreads out... looking for the hatch. One of
                   the guards -- LANGE -- finds it.

 LANGE                              Over here.

                   Everyone rushes over to him. There's a small HATCH on
                   the ground that has been partially hidden by weeds and
                   brush. Geordi kneels down, starts working a complex-
                   looking LOCK on the hatch.

 GEORDI                              Alphanumeric lock. We need a
                             password to get in...

 PICARD                              I have the password right here.

                   Picard pulls out his phaser and everyone steps back.
                   He aims and FIRES at the hatch, which is BLOWN OPEN,
                   revealing a ladder that leads down into the darkness.
                   As they start to crawl inside...
 55 INT. MISSILE SILO - CONTROL ROOM 55 
                   This is the "mission control" for Cochrane's test site.
                   The underground room is filled with 21st century
                   equipment, consoles and monitors. One entire wall of
                   the room is dominated by a huge METAL BLAST DOOR, which
                   is now closed. We will learn that on the other side of
                   that door is the nuclear missile/warp ship itself.

                   The ceiling has partially collapsed. Chunks of
                   concrete and fallen beams have destroyed some of the
                   equipment...Only a few of the consoles are active, most
                   are dark or fritzing sporadically. The lights are out,
                   and the room is illuminated by a few smoldering fires.
                   Four dead bodies can be seen strewn around the room.
                   It's a scene of destruction.

 56 PICARD 56 
                   and his team ENTER the dark and smoking ruin. Beverly
                   and Picard move to one of the dead men, while Geordi
                   and the Security Guards move to the other three.
                   Beverly rolls the man onto his back -- he's clearly
                   dead. The name stitched on his uniform says Rippert.
                   Picard looks up.

 PICARD                                       (to others)
                             See if any of these men are
                             Cochrane.

                   Geordi and the Guards start checking the dead bodies.

 GEORDI                              Mitchell... DePaul...

 LANGE                              This one's a woman... named Kirby.

                   Picard and Beverly move toward the immense blast door.
                   As Beverly scans it, Picard glances at a nearby desk...
 57 THE DESK 57 
                   is littered with debris and various documents and
                   schematics. THREE PHOTOGRAPHS are pinned to a bulletin
                   board above the desk -- they show Zephram Cochrane and
                   two angles of his warp ship. The photos are odd-
                   looking, printed on what appears to be some sort of
                   cloth.

 BEVERLY                              There's a life sign behind this
                             door... about ten meters below.

                   Geordi moves to the door.

 GEORDI                              Blast door. It's designed to
                             protect the control room when the
                             missile is launched.

 PICARD                              There should be some kind of
                             manual release...

                   They hunt around for a moment. Geordi runs his hand
                   along the edge of the blast door. Picard turns to the
                   Guards.

 PICARD                                       (to Lange)
                             Get those fires out and then try
                             to restore main power to the
                             control room.

 LANGE                              Aye, sir.

                   The Guards move off.

 GEORDI                              Got it, Captain.

                   Geordi has found an emergency BOX with several
                   pneumatic tubes and a hydraulic lever labeled
                   "emergency use only." He pulls down the lever, there
                   is a hissing sound, and the blast door slowly SLIDES
                   DOWN into the floor. We can now see the MISSILE SILO
                   itself beyond the door. Picard, Geordi and Beverly
                   step into...

 58 INT. MISSILE SILO - CONTINUOUS 58 
                   Picard, Geordi and Beverly step onto the catwalk, which
                   surrounds the Silo walls. In the middle is the WARP
                   SHIP itself. It should look like an advanced ICBM
                   missile with a COCKPIT in place of the warhead, and
                   with numerous modifications to the fuselage. The
                   cockpit is on the same level as the control room. On
                   the side of the missile is the name "Phoenix". The
                   missile itself extends down another FOUR STORIES.
                   There are other catwalks below this one, with ladders
                   connecting the different levels. Beverly sees
                   something below.

 BEVERLY                              There.

 59 NEW ANGLE 59 
                   Two catwalks below we can see a man sprawled on the
                   grating. They all scramble down the ladders past the
                   massive missile. (NOTE: Because of the design of the
                   Silo, we will see the entire missile only in a few
                   shots. For the most part, our view is limited to
                   sections of the missile.)

                   Beverly reaches the man, who is lying face-down on the
                   metal grating. She scans him...

 BEVERLY                              Severe radiation exposure...

                   Geordi looks over at the section of the missile on
                   their level. The side panels have been removed,
                   revealing complex circuitry within.

                   Picard joins Beverly, who turns over the injured man.
                   It's ZEPHRAM COCHRANE -- the man whose picture we saw
                   on the Borg monitors. Beverly begins pulling devices
                   out of her medkit, injects Cochrane with a hypospray.
                   Cochrane is a man in his mid-forties. He has a
                   youthful, dynamic appearance marred by recent radiation
                   burns.

 PICARD                              It's Cochrane.

 BEVERLY                              I've stabilized him for now... but
                             he's in a coma and he's going to
                             need radiometric therapy. I want
                             to take him to the ship.

                   Picard nods, reaches into his pants pocket, takes out
                   a combadge.

 PICARD                              Picard to Enterprise.
                                      (no response)
                             Enterprise, please respond.

 GEORDI                              It could be the radiation,
                             Captain. Try from the surface.

                   Picard nods... then takes a deep breath, tries to
                   orient himself to the task at hand... there's a lot at
                   stake and a lot to do. He turns to Geordi.

 PICARD                              Mister La Forge, listen very
                             carefully. If you remember your
                             history... in less than twenty-
                             four hours, a Vulcan ship will be
                             passing through this system. When
                             it does, this ship needs to be in
                             space, flying at warp speed.

                   Geordi takes a deep breath, it's a tall order.

 GEORDI                              I'd better get started.

                   Geordi goes to work. Picard bends down and carefully
                   hoists Cochrane up into a fireman's carry. Beverly
                   follows him up the catwalk...

 CUT TO: 60 EXT. MISSILE SILO - DAY 60 
                   Minutes later. Cochrane is lying on the ground.
                   Beverly is kneeling beside him, unfolding a portable
                   stretcher from her medkit. Picard is checking two
                   combadges with a tricorder.

 PICARD                              It's not the radiation... and
                             there's nothing wrong with the
                             combadges... the Enterprise just
                             isn't responding.

 BEVERLY                              Jean-Luc, this man needs medical
                             attention, now.

 PICARD                              As I recall, the town of
                             Resurrection is about two
                             kilometers East of here. They
                             might have a hospital...

                   Picard looks troubled at the thought.

 BEVERLY                              What are we waiting for? Let's
                             go.

 PICARD                              It may not be that simple. This
                             is an extremely difficult and
                             paranoid time in human history.

 BEVERLY                              Are you saying they won't help us?

 PICARD                              I'm saying they might shoot us on
                             sight. You have to remember...
                             these people have watched their
                             entire way of life collapse around
                             them.

 BEVERLY                              There must be some good people...
                             even in this time.

 PICARD                              Let's hope so. Because if
                             Cochrane dies... the future may
                             die with him.

                   Picard kneels down and they begin to carefully put
                   Cochrane on the stretcher...

 61 INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE 61 
                   Riker, Troi and Worf studying a MONITOR which shows a
                   three-dimensional DIAGRAM of the Enterprise, which
                   turns and rotates as needed. The schematic shows
                   battle damage and repair efforts.

 WORF                              I have assigned two damage control
                             teams to locate the source of our
                             communication problems. So far,
                             they've had no success.

 RIKER                              Assign another team if you need
                             to. I want to re-establish
                             communication with the Captain as
                             soon as possible.

                   Worf nods and begins making notes on a PADD.

 TROI                              Are we in any danger of being
                             detected by Earth defense systems?

 WORF                              There were no planetary defense
                             systems in this era. Their
                             weapons were designed to
                             fight each other... not
                             extraterrestrials.

 RIKER                              We have to start thinking about a
                             way to get home.
                                      (to Troi)
                             Analyze our readings from the
                             temporal vortex. We're going to
                             have to recreate whatever the Borg
                             did to --

                   Just then the ship SHUDDERS and the LIGHTS FLICKER.

 RIKER                               Report.

 TROI                                       (off console)
                             We just lost main power... and
                             we've got Class-Three alerts all
                             over the ship. I'm not sure
                             what's --

                   An ALARM goes off on Worf's console. He reacts to it.

 WORF                              A ship-wide decompression has been
                             initiated!

 RIKER                              What?

 TROI                              We're venting our internal
                             atmosphere directly into space!

 62 EXT. ENTERPRISE 62 
                   CLOSE ON THE SAUCER as vents and hatches POP OPEN on
                   the hull and GIANT JETS OF VAPOR start blowing out
                   into space.

 63 INT. CORRIDOR 63 
                   Crewmembers walking along are suddenly KNOCKED to the
                   floor as hurricane force WINDS blow through the
                   Corridor. The ship is venting air into space, creating
                   a virtual VACUUM inside the ship! The people in the
                   corridor grab onto the bulkheads, struggling to hang on
                   against the force of the wind...

 64 INT. BRIDGE 64 
                   Suddenly an emergency AIRLOCK on the Bridge OPENS.
                   VIOLENT WIND roars through the Bridge and everyone
                   hangs on. Troi is ripped out of her chair, flown
                   across the Bridge, slams up against the bulkhead,
                   struggling to hang on. Worf runs over, grabs her arm,
                   keeps her from flying out.

                   Riker manages to reach a control panel -- hits a button
                   and an EMERGENCY BULKHEAD finally slides down over the
                   airlock and the wind DIES DOWN. Everyone takes a beat.

 RIKER                              What the hell is happening, Worf?

 WORF                                       (off console)
                             It appears that someone has taken
                             over the Environmental Control
                             Room.

 TROI                              Someone...?

 RIKER                                       (realizing)
                             The Borg.  Some of them must've
                             beamed over before we destroyed
                             their ship.
                                      (to Worf)
                             Seal off that entire deck with
                             emergency force fields.

 TROI                              Wil... Data was down there.

 RIKER                                       (to Worf)
                             Mister Worf... find Data if you
                             can, but your top priority is
                             isolating the Borg.

 WORF                              Understood.

                   Worf heads for a Turbolift. OFF Riker's disturbed
                   expression...

 CUT TO: 
 65 CLOSE ON DATA'S FACE 65 
                   His eyes are closed. There's a beat, then his eyes fly
                   open and he looks around.

                   We PULL BACK slightly, revealing Data is lying on some
                   kind of tabletop with metallic clamps and restraints.
                   He tenses his arm and tries to move, but he is unable
                   to break the restraints. About two feet in front of
                   his face is what appears to be a bulkhead. There is a
                   cacophony of strange background NOISE -- scratching,
                   hisses, gurgling liquids, odd alien hums...

                   Suddenly, the table begins to MOVE. It ROTATES, and as
                   it does so we realize that Data has been hanging upside
                   down staring at the floor. It's a disorienting moment
                   as our perspective changes and Data rotates upright.

 66 DATA'S POV 66 
                   As the table gyrates, we REVEAL the ROOM slowly. And
                   we realize we're in --
 67 INT. BORG HIVE 67 
                   The Environmental Control Room seen earlier has now
                   been transformed into the INNER-SANCTUM of the BORG.
                   The room has a dark, moist, organic feel -- a tropical
                   jungle of cybernetic equipment.

                   The Borg are altering the room, converting Starfleet
                   technology and materials into the living, bio-
                   mechanical look of the Borg. We see one Borg drone
                   attach a small pod to a Starfleet console and activate
                   it. The pod immediately sends out a COMPLEX WEB of
                   BORG TECHNOLOGY which covers the Starfleet console
                   inside and out. It's like weeds overpowering a flower
                   bed -- within seconds the console has been BORGIFIED.

                   The walls, ceiling and floor are now honeycombed with
                   the ALCOVES that make up the BORG COLLECTIVE. Borg
                   drones are motionless in their alcoves, cabling and
                   other conduits connecting them to various equipment...
                   while other Borg are moving about the room, carrying
                   out various modifications to the room. At one point,
                   we see Ensign Porter. He's been completely Borgified.
                   His skin pale, expression blank. No hint of humanity
                   left.

 68 DATA 68 
                   still strapped to the table, which is twisting and
                   rotating, giving him frightening new glimpses of the
                   room. A new image appears -- SIX BORG DRONES are
                   clustered together in one section of the room, each
                   with an elaborate series of hoses and conduits
                   connected to its face.

                   Through the tubes we can see an exchange of FLUID and
                   ENERGY pulsing back and forth -- some sort of bizarre
                   "feeding" or "renewal" is going on. The tubes all seem
                   to lead toward the ceiling.

                   Data is now horizontal on his back and the table LOCKS
                   into position. A Borg drone OPENS A PANEL on the side
                   of Data's head, and begins connecting a thick bundle of
                   optical cabling to it.

 DATA                                       (to Borg)
                             Your efforts to assimilate me will
                             be unsuccessful.

                   The Borg ignores him, activates a console... and the
                   cabling connected to Data's head LIGHTS UP with power.
                   They're trying to connect him to the Collective.

                   Data thinks for a moment, tilts his head slightly...
                   and then suddenly there's a SHOWER of SPARKS from the
                   cabling he's been connected to. The lights on the
                   cable go out. Data has thwarted their attempts.

 DATA                                       (to Borg)
                             It would appear that resistance is
                             not always futile.

                   Suddenly a new VOICE is heard echoing through the room -- 
                   a woman's voice, low, seductive, deadly:

 WOMAN'S VOICE                              Brave words. I've heard them
                             before from thousands of species
                             across thousands of worlds...
                             since long before you were
                             created.

                   Data looks up toward...

 69 THE CEILING 69 
                   A RUSTLE of MOVEMNET somewhere in the cyber-tangle...
                   almost like a snake slithering beneath the weeds. And
                   for a brief instant we get a glimpse of a FACE unlike
                   any Borg we've ever seen. The face of a woman. Pale-
                   skinned... piercing eyes...raven hair slicked back...
                   a hauntingly beautiful image in a sea of nightmarish
                   technology. And then it's gone.

 70 DATA 70 
                   Frowns. He saw it, too, but he's not sure what to make
                   of it.

 WOMAN'S VOICE                              But now... they are all one with
                             the Borg.

 DATA                              I am unlike any lifeform you have
                             encountered before. As an
                             android, I am in complete control
                             of my neural net. The information
                             contained there cannot be forcibly
                             removed.

 WOMAN'S VOICE                              You are an imperfect being...
                             created by an imperfect being.
                             Finding your weakness is only a
                             matter of time.

                   Suddenly three Borg drones converge on Data with
                   various wicked-looking Borg devices. One of the Borg
                   has a specialized cybernetic ARM, which EXTRUDES a
                   series of stiletto-tipped DRILL SPIKES. As the six-
                   inch spikes begin to BORE INTO Data's head...

 CUT TO: 
 71 EXT. MONTANA - RESURRECTION CITY - DAY 71 
                   Resurrection is a small town -- around 1,000 people --
                   a rural, Western community that's probably existed for
                   at least two hundred years, and we can see the roots of
                   the original ranching community in some of the
                   architecture. But it's also a community of the 21st
                   century.

                   The most striking feature of the town is that it sits
                   in the middle of nearly a hundred WIND MILLS, which
                   provide the only source of power for the town. The
                   blades are enormous, but the structures supporting them
                   are little more than simple poles. Some are sleek,
                   fiberglass, futuristic... others have a more cobbled
                   together, make-shift appearance. At the moment, only
                   a few blades are turning in the gentle breeze.

                   Picard and Beverly emerge from the nearby woods
                   carrying the stretcher. They exchange a look at the
                   sight of the city and then head toward it...

 72 EXT. RESURRECTION CITY - DAY 72 
                   A few minutes later. Picard and Beverly carrying
                   Cochrane down the street toward the hospital at the
                   end. As they walk along, we get our first taste of
                   post-apocalyptic 21st century life:

                   This is a recognizable American community, but it's
                   definitely a futuristic town. Clothing, architecture,
                   technology -- all have changed over the course of
                   seventy years. But it is a broken future. What used
                   to be high-tech public COMPUTER TERMINALS are rusted
                   and abandoned. We can see the corroded hulks of HOVER-
                   CARS lying idle in the streets. Futuristic elements
                   now useless.

                   At one point, they pass a large polyurethane TENT --
                   the inside surface is covered with condensation and we
                   can see the silhouettes of people moving within. The
                   entrance is guarded by a single Militia Guard. Later
                   we will learn that this is a primitive greenhouse, the
                   only place where they can grow uncontaminated food.

                   What used to be a McDonald's, or some other
                   recognizable food chain, has now been gutted and has
                   been turned into a kind of blacksmith shop. People are
                   fashioning metal into various tools using hammer and
                   tongs.

                   The sidewalks are populated with PEOPLE, who congregate
                   in small groups, quietly talking amongst themselves,
                   others just staring vacantly off into space. Many of
                   them have visible burn scars and damage to their bodies --
                   victims of the war and post-nuclear environmental
                   dangers. A few of them are applying a special lotion
                   to their arms and face -- protection against the toxic
                   elements. A long FOOD LINE snakes around a block, as
                   people line up to get their daily rations.

                   A few people glance up at Picard and Beverly with
                   curious or suspicious looks. This is not a community
                   that welcomes strangers. At one point, they see a man
                   dressed in futuristic CAMOUFLAGE carrying an automatic
                   weapon -- we will learn he's a MILITIA SOLDIER. He
                   stares at them with a neutral expression, then walks
                   off.

                   The people here have that hollow-eyed, listless look
                   about them. They're going through something that makes
                   the Great Depression look like a minor inconvenience.
                   But there's also a toughness to these people, a
                   resilience and determination to survive in the face of
                   overwhelming odds. We are looking at our future... and
                   it's on the verge of collapse.

 CUT TO: 
 73 INT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY 73 
                   A short time later. Cochrane is being lifted onto an
                   operating table. Picard and Beverly step back from the
                   table as a DOCTOR and two NURSES look him over. The
                   doctor is in his early fifties and has a weathered,
                   tired look to him. The hospital itself is like the
                   rest of the town -- a futuristic setting fallen on hard
                   times. The light in the room is provided mostly from
                   the sunlight streaming in through the windows. Light
                   bulbs and other gear flicker dimly around the hospital --
                   we get the feeling they have very little power.

 DOCTOR                              How long has he been unconscious?

 BEVERLY                              At least four hours.

                   He checks Cochran's head injury as Beverly takes out
                   her tricorder and scans him.

 DOCTOR                              It looks like he has a cranial
                             fracture, but I'll need X-rays to
                             be sure.
                                      (to Nurse)
                             Get Ruby in here.

                   One of the nurses runs off.

 BEVERLY                                       (off tricorder)
                             He has a severe fracture of the
                             left occipital plate. He's not
                             hemorrhaging... but the radiation
                             has damaged his KNA and his APR
                             cell count...

                   He looks at her curiously.

 DOCTOR                              "APR cell count?" What the hell
                             are you talking about?

 PICARD                                      (quickly)
                             Doctor Crusher has been...
                             studying some advanced medical
                             theories.

 NURSE                                      (re: tricorder)
                             What is that?

 BEVERLY                              It's a... new medical scanner.
                             It's a little more precise than an
                             X-ray machine.

                   The Doctor eyes it.

 DOCTOR                              Is it Japanese?

 BEVERLY                              Um... yeah.
                                     (beat)
                             Now he's going to need a
                             respirator. Do you have one?

 DOCTOR                              We have two... but we don't have
                             the juice to run them.

 PICARD                              Juice?

 DOCTOR                              Power. There hasn't been a lot of
                             wind through here for the last
                             couple of weeks. Most of the
                             batteries are depleted.

 BEVERLY                              Don't you have any generators, or
                             other fuel sources?

                   The Doctor throws her an irritated look.

 DOCTOR                              Maybe you'd like to take your
                             patient to the hospital in
                             Bozemen... it's only two hundred
                             miles away.

                   Cochrane wheezes -- breathing becoming labored and
                   ragged. Beverly scans him, urgent.

 BEVERLY                              His automatic reflexes are
                             fluctuating. We've got to get him
                             on a respirator.

 DOCTOR                                      (to Nurse)
                             Bag him.

                   The nurse picks up a portable respirator sack -- puts
                   it on Cochrane's face and squeezes the bag, forcing air
                   into Cochrane's lungs. Picard has been thinking
                   through this scene, finally has a solution.
 PICARD                              Beverly -- your tricorder.

                   She hands him her tricorder.

 PICARD                                     (to Doctor)
                             Where's the battery room for the
                             hospital?

 DOCTOR                              I told you, there's no --

 PICARD                              Where?

 DOCTOR                              Outside, around back. Next to the
                             water tank.
                    Picard rushes out the doors. Beverly checks Cochrane's
                   pulse.

 BEVERLY                              His heartbeat's irregular...
                    Beverly climbs up on top of Cochrane, straddling him,
                   begins giving him 24th century CPR. She takes charge.
 BEVERLY                              Adrenaline -- ten CC's!

                   As they rush to save him.
 74 EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY 74 
                   The back of the building. Picard rushes out and spots
                   an old, dilapidated BATTERY UNIT providing power to the
                   hospital. He quickly yanks off the back panel,
                   revealing a tangle of wires, and several large
                   batteries. He kneels down, then removes the back of
                   the tricorder.
 75 CLOSE ON TRICORDER 75 
                   as Picard pulls out a small POWER CELL -- about half
                   the size of a dime. The blinkies on the tricorder go
                   out.

 76 PICARD 76 
                   holds the power cell with one hand, and starts pulling
                   out wires from the batteries with the other.

 77 INT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY 77 
                   As before. Beverly, the doctor and the nurse trying to
                   save Cochrane.

 BEVERLY                                      (pumping his chest)
                             One... two... three... compress!

                   The nurse squeezes the bag. Suddenly the room is
                   filled with the HUM of POWER and ALL OF THE LIGHTS AND
                   EQUIPMENT COME TO LIFE. Monitors blinking, fluorescent
                   lights flashing on. Everyone reacts with shock.

 78 INT. HOSPITAL WARD - DAY 78 
                   It's filled with patients. The lights and equipment
                   here FLASH ON, as well. Doctors and patients alike
                   react with surprise.

 79 INT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY 79 
                   Picard enters. They've placed a RESPIRATOR down
                   Cochrane's throat, and attached electrodes to his
                   chest. Beverly has just finished giving him an
                   injection with a hypospray. The heart monitor in the
                   background is now beating regularly. The doctor turns
                   to Picard.

 DOCTOR                              What did you do to the batteries?

 PICARD                              Oh... just a little tinkering.
                             How is he?

 BEVERLY                              He's stable... for now.
                                     (with meaning)
                             But it would be better if we could
                             contact... our friends.

 PICARD                              Yes. But until then, you'll have
                             to make do with what you've got.

 BEVERLY                              That'll be interesting.

 A WOMAN'S VOICE: 
 RUBY'S VOICE                              What happened to him?

                   Everyone turns.

 80 NEW ANGLE 80 
                   revealing RUBY SLOANE standing at the front of
                   Cochrane's bed. A striking woman in her mid-to-late
                   thirties -- dark hair, tall, lean, beautiful under
                   normal circumstances but at the moment she's not at her
                   best, it looks like she's just come in from a hard
                   day's work. She's wearing an old lab coat. But the
                   most striking quality of all is the innate intelligence
                   we can see in her eyes.

                   She's looking directly at Picard for an answer. Picard
                   realizes he has to say something. He looks into her
                   eyes and there is a moment here -- a brief spark of
                   chemistry that in normal circumstances the Captain just
                   might follow up. But at the moment, he shoves that
                   electric feeling aside and tries to give her an answer.

 PICARD                              There was some kind of explosion
                             out at the missile silo...

                   She looks at him for a moment, her eyes boring into him
                   without expression, as though probing the truthfulness
                   of his statement.

 DOCTOR                              Ruby, we're going to need a series 
                             of cranial X-rays tonight.

 RUBY                                      (nods)
                             I have a fresh set of plates at
                             home. I'll have them here by
                             eight.

                   She turns back to Cochrane, moves to his side, gently
                   takes his hand and looks at him with sad affection.

 RUBY                                      (quiet)
                             Take care of him. He's a very
                             special man.

 PICARD                              Yes, he is.

                   She looks up at Picard, and again there's a slight
                   feeling of chemistry in the air. And then she turns
                   and starts to walk out of the room. Picard's combadge
                   BEEPS. Reactions.

 GEORDI'S COM VOICE                              La Forge to Picard.

 RUBY                                      (stopping)
                             I think there's someone in your
                             pants.

 PICARD                              Excuse me. I have a... telephone
                             call.

                   Picard takes a few steps away, pulls the combadge out
                   of his pants pocket, taps it. Ruby watches him a beat,
                   then walks out of the room.

 PICARD                              Picard here.

 GEORDI'S COM VOICE                              Captain, we have a problem. I
                             think you'd better get back here.

 PICARD                              I'm on my way. Picard out.

                   Picard moves to Beverly.

 PICARD                                      (sotto)
                             I have to go back to the silo.
                             Will you be all right?

 BEVERLY                              I'll be fine.
                                     (re: Cochrane)
                             He's a different story.

                   Beverly begins examining the medical equipment she'll
                   have to work with as Picard exits...

 81 EXT. RESURRECTION CITY STREET - DAY 81 
                   A short time later. Picard walking down the main
                   street back toward the gates. People passing him,
                   taking no notice of him...Picard's mind thinking
                   ahead. He happens to glance down a side street, then
                   he stops.

 82 NEW ANGLE 82 
                   Looking down the side street. Ruby, the mysterious
                   woman from the hospital, is walking along with a camera
                   bag now slung over her shoulder. She stops for a
                   moment as she passes the hulk of a burnt-out old hover
                   car... stares at it...then pulls a home-made
                   FUTURISTIC CAMERA out of her bag and snaps a picture of
                   the car. She continues on her way. Picard is
                   intrigued -- wonders about this woman and what it is
                   she could be taking a picture of. Just then --

 MAN'S VOICE                              Catch.

                   Picard turns just in time to catch a small, metal
                   canister with a screw-top.

                   The man who threw it steps into view. It's LIEUTENANT
                   SCRIMM. Scrimm is the head of the town's militia.
                   While not a physically threatening man, there is a
                   quietly disturbing quality about him which conveys an
                   intelligence laced with a tightly reined volatility.
                   He's wearing futuristic combat fatigues and always
                   carries a sidearm. Before the war, Scrimm was probably
                   one of the "survivalists" who used to be dismissed as
                   radicals until their predictions of Armageddon came
                   true. At the moment, Scrimm is presenting his
                   friendliest face to Picard.

 SCRIMM                                      (pleasant)
                             Think you'll need that.

                   Picard eyes the canister, not sure what to make of it.

 SCRIMM                              It's no zone solution.
                                    (off his look)
                             You know. "No ozone."

                   He points to the sky.

 PICARD                              Oh...  yes... ultraviolet
                             protection. Thank you.
                             Mister...?

 SCRIMM                              Lieutenant, actually. Lieutenant
                             Jonathan Scrimm. I'm the head of
                             the Resurrection Protective Force.
                                     (beat)
                             And you are?

 PICARD                              Jean-Luc Picard.

 SCRIMM                              Great name. French?

 PICARD                              Yes.

 SCRIMM                              You don't sound French.

                   Scrimm is still smiling at him, but his eyes never
                   leave Picard.

 PICARD                              I was raised in England and here
                             in the States. Thank you for
                             the... no zone.

                   Picard begins to walk away, not wanting to engage any
                   citizens of the town. Scrimm falls in next to him.

 SCRIMM                              Where in the States?

 PICARD                              Oh... here and there. You know
                             how it is.
 SCRIMM                              Not really. I was born and raised
                             right here. Never had much use
                             for travel.

                   He casually steps in front of Picard, blocking his way.

 SCRIMM                              Where are you from most recently?

 PICARD                                      (thinking fast)
                             California. San Francisco.

 SCRIMM                              Beautiful city. Used to be,
                             anyway. I didn't think anyone
                             still lived there.

 PICARD                              There's a few of us left.

                   Picard steps around him and continues walking down the
                   street. Scrimm waits a beat, then walks after him
                   again.

 SCRIMM                              That was a pretty clever trick you
                             did with the hospital's batteries.
                             How'd you do it?

 PICARD                              It wasn't a trick. I used to be
                             an electrical engineer.

 SCRIMM                              Huh.

                   He steps in front of Picard again, still pleasant but
                   a little bit of a smile fading from his face. Picard
                   realizes he isn't going to shake this man so easily.

 SCRIMM                              And what were you doing out at the
                             missile silo?

 PICARD                              I'm an old friend of Cochrane's...
                             I wanted to see how he was doing.

 SCRIMM                              Lucky for him you came by when you
                             did. He might be dead now.

 PICARD                              Yes.

 SCRIMM                              Maybe you can tell me what he's
                             been doing in that silo. We heard
                             some explosions out there this
                             morning...

 PICARD                              I think he was running a test on
                             an old rocket engine... and one of
                             the fuel cells burst.

                   Scrimm eyes him evenly.

 SCRIMM                              You seem to have an answer for
                             everything.

 PICARD                              Something wrong with that?

 SCRIMM                              Not yet.

                   A tense beat. Then Scrimm smiles easily.

 SCRIMM                                      (re: balm)
                             Be sure you put that on. You need
                             a lot of protection around here.

                   He holds Picard's eyes for a moment.

 PICARD                              Thank you. But I've never had
                             much trouble protecting myself.

                   Now it's Picard's turn to smile pleasantly at Scrimm.
                   Picard walks around him and heads for the gates.
                   Scrimm watches him go with a thoughtful expression --
                   clearly, he's more than a little suspicious...

 CUT TO: 
 83 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE 83 
                   in orbit of Earth.

 84 INT. CORRIDOR 84 
                   Worf and a large SECURITY DETACHMENT -- a dozen or so
                   men and women -- are moving down the Corridor with grim
                   looks on their faces. They are carrying new powerful-
                   looking phaser rifles and other equipment. The feeling
                   is of an elite combat squad heading for a dangerous
                   mission. They stop at one point and Worf lifts up a
                   DECKPLATE, exposing a large HATCH in the floor. Worf
                   hits his combadge.

 WORF                              Worf to Bridge. We're in
                             position.

 85 INT. BRIDGE 85 
                   Riker in command, Troi nearby. Riker is standing at
                   the security station looking at a monitor which
                   displays a schematic graphic of the ship. The position
                   of the security team is flashing -- we can see they are
                   on Deck 46.

 RIKER                              This is the Bridge. I'm releasing
                             the emergency force fields.

                   He nods to Troi, who works a console.

 86 INT. CORRIDOR 86 
                   Worf and his team watch as the FORCEFIELD protecting
                   the hatch flashes off. Worf reaches down and releases
                   the hatch, which slides open with a soft whoosh. He
                   glances at his men for a moment, then JUMPS down the
                   hatch...

 87 INT. DECK 47 - CORRIDOR 87 
                   As Worf lands on his feet. The light is dim, no power
                   on this deck, hard to see. He looks around warily for
                   a moment, phaser at-the-ready, then activates his wrist
                   beacon. We immediately notice that we can see Worf's
                   breath -- it's freezing cold down here. He shines the
                   light around the darkened corridor, then silently
                   motions his arm for the others to follow. A beat, then
                   we see the security officers start to drop into the
                   corridor from the hatch above...

 88 NEW ANGLE - CORRIDOR 88 
                   As Worf's squad spreads out along the hall, weapons at-
                   the-ready, everyone alert with fingers on the triggers.
                   We see that the phaser rifles are equipped with their
                   own light sources, intended to illuminate the target
                   before you shoot at it. The Security Officers are
                   constantly moving their lights back and forth through
                   the chilly air. Worf gives hand signals -- holds up
                   two fingers, then a fist, and points forward.

                   Two Guards trot down the corridor about fifteen feet,
                   stop, and take up firing positions... then two more
                   members of the team run down, leap frog ahead of them
                   and take positions further down the corridor. Classic
                   military deployment. Worf starts scanning with a
                   tricorder.

 WORF                                      (hits combadge)
                             Worf to Bridge.

 RIKER'S COM VOICE                              Riker here.

 WORF                              There's a dampening field in place
                             on this deck. Our tricorders are
                             useless.

                   The team continue to explore Deck 47. It's spooky,
                   eerie, a sense of menace around every corner. They
                   open doors, check room by room, section by section,
                   still no sign of the Borg in the freezing cold
                   darkness.

 90 ANGLE ON SECURITY GUARD 90 
                   The Corridor directly ahead has been stripped of wall,
                   ceiling and deck panels -- all the normal decorative
                   Enterprise sheathing is gone, revealing the circuitry
                   and machinery of the ship itself. Unlike the rest of
                   the corridors, there does appear to be POWER flowing
                   through some of the conduits up ahead, and it gives off
                   an eerie glow.

                   We can also see that some of the machinery has been
                   altered and changed -- not just the neat and orderly
                   arrangement you'd expect to find behind bulkheads --
                   there's a sense of cross-circuitry, re-wiring,
                   equipment being rearranged. Clearly, a lot of work has
                   gone on in this area of the ship. Worf steps forward,
                   examines the corridor closely.

 ENSIGN HAWK                              What the hell is going on?

 WORF                              Borg...

                   Worf signals the team forward, and they slowly begin
                   picking their way down the Borgified Corridor. It's
                   not easy -- they have to choose their footing carefully
                   as they walk through the maze of cables, circuits, and
                   machinery... Ensign Hawk accidentally steps on some
                   circuitry, which gives off a BEEP. The entire team
                   suddenly whirls their lights and weapons on the
                   unfortunate Ensign, who pales at their sudden attention.

                   Worf looks irritated, then motions his team to continue
                   their search. They continue making their way down the
                   spooky corridor... and as they turn a corner...

 92 NEW ANGLE - ANOTHER CORRIDOR 92 
                   where the machinery is now THICKER and more BORG-LIKE
                   in appearance. Tubes and cabling hang down from the
                   ceiling. If anything, it's even colder in here. The
                   deeper they go, the worse it gets. We can now hear a
                   low, sinister HUM of alien power. At the end of this
                   corridor is the ENVIROMENTAL CONTROL ROOM, as seen
                   earlier. The entire doorway is gone -- and a weird
                   pulsing GLOW fills the room. Worf stops his team at
                   the sight. From this vantage, we cannot see directly
                   into the room, but clearly something is going on in
                   there.

                   Worf signals his men to spread out, and they take up
                   positions around the Corridor, all weapons trained on
                   Environmental Control.

 WORF                              Worf to Bridge. We're about to
                             enter the Environmental Control
                             Room.

 RIKER'S COM VOICE                              Any sign of Data, or the Borg
                             themselves?

                   As Work and Riker continue talking, we MOVE TO Ensign
                   Hawk, who is now the last man in the formation,
                   covering the rear. He's shining his phaser-beacon into
                   the empty darkness. He can't help looking back over
                   his shoulder at the rest of the team and the distant
                   Environmental Control Room -- that seems to be where
                   the action is. As he turns, his beacon moves with him,
                   throwing the Corridor behind them in and out of
                   darkness.

 WORF                                      (continuing)
                              Negative. However, they've
                              reconfigured the ODN network...
                              and re-routed all power on this
                              deck into Environmental Control.

                   As Worf speaks, Ensign Hawk turns back, but this time
                   when he shines his beacon into the darkness, something
                   MOVES in the distance -- a shadow. The Ensign freezes,
                   brings his rifle up. But did he see it, or was it his
                   imagination?

                   A tense beat as he waits, heart pounding... but nothing
                   happens. On the wall next to his head we see what can
                   only be described as a BIO-MECHANISTIC CABLE creeping
                   out of the wall... which begins slowly heading for the
                   Ensign's neck. Just as he begins to sense that
                   something is happening behind him, the cable WHIPS OUT
                   around his neck and YANKS him deep into the bed of
                   circuitry in the blink of an eye -- the motion so fast
                   we have trouble following it.

                   Worf turns his head at the sound.

 WORF                              Stand by, Commander
                                     (to team)
                             Where's Ensign Hawk?

                   Everyone looks around, surprised that he's not there.
                   Everyone is alert, keyed up. The tension is thick.
                   Utter silence, except for the hum of the machinery and
                   the frosty breathing of the team.

 RIKER'S COM VOICE                              Worf? Is something wrong?

 WORF                              Something is very wrong,
                             Commander. We're falling back.

                   Worf gives hand signals for the team to move out. But
                   just as they start to fall back, everything happens at
                   once.

 93 BORG DRONES 93 
                   EXPLODE OUT OF THE WALLS, CEILING AND FLOOR! What
                   follows is a BLUR of action happening so fast and
                   furious we never get a true sense of what's happening.

                   A flurry of violence and motion and images:

                   -- A snarling Borg face -- half-human, half-machine, a
                      cybernetic nightmare.

                   -- Strange, bio-mechanical WEAPONS extruding from Borg
                      bodies, RIPPING into human flesh.

                   -- A crewmember PULLED into a bed of machinery.

 WORF                              Fire at will!

                   But the Borg are already on top of them. It's a brutal
                   fight in close quarters with no escape.

                   Phasers and Borg lasers lighting up the corridor,
                   bodies flying through the air... utter chaos and
                   terror. The fight goes hand to hand and Worf sees that
                   they don't have a chance...

 WORF                                      (throwing off a Borg)
                             Fall back!

                   The team starts backpedaling, FIRING as they go...but
                   the Borg are unstoppable now -- they put up personal
                   force fields to protect themselves.

 WORF                              Go, go, GO!

                   Worf pushes his men down the corridor. Everyone turns
                   and RUNS like hell. Worf bends down and grabs a
                   frightened Lieutenant by the collar, pulling him along.

 94 VARIOUS SHOTS: 94 
                   -- The team running through the corridors, SHOOTING
                      behind them at the pursuing Borg, to no effect...

                   -- Two of the Borg raise their arms and FIRE LASER
                      BURSTS out of their arms and wrists, taking DOWN two
                      Security Guards. Worf sees them fall but there's no
                      time to go back.

 95 INT. DECK 46 - CORRIDOR 95 
                   As Worf's team starts CLIMBING UP and out the dark
                   hatch in the floor seen earlier.
 96 INT. DECK 47 - CORRIDOR 96 
                   As the last member of Worf's team climbs out to safety.
                   The Borg swarm is about to overpower Worf. He quickly
                   hits a few controls on his phaser, sets it to overload.
                   We hear the building WHINE. He JUMPS straight up into
                   the air, GRABBING onto the hatch rim, pulling himself
                   up. He barely manages to vanish from view just as the
                   phaser EXPLODES in a FIERY BLAST, taking out several of
                   the Borg drones.

 97 INT. DECK 46 - CORRIDOR 97 
                   The conclusive BLAST comes up through the hatch,
                   causing Worf to duck for a moment.

                   Worf reaches out to close the hatch, when a BORG HAND 
                   bursts up from below and GRABS his forearm. It's a 
                   test of strength. Worf reaches over with his other
                   arm, hits a control and the hatch SLIDES CLOSED,
                   SEVERING the Borg arm in a shower of sparks.

 WORF                              Worf to Bridge -- force fields!

                   The force field FLASHES into place. Worf and his team
                   sit there a moment, catching their breath, stunned at
                   what they've just been through.

 RIKER'S COM VOICE                              What the hell happened down there,
                             Worf?

 WORF                              Commander... we have a problem.
                    OFF Worf's shaken expression...

 CUT TO: 
 98 INT. MISSILE SILO - CATWALK - DAY 98 
                   Geordi and Picard are walking down the catwalk ladders
                   toward the missile's massive engines. Now that the
                   smoke has cleared and the place has been cleared up a
                   bit, we get our first good look at the ship and the
                   damage done in the Borg attack.

 GEORDI                                      (on the move)
                             Cochrane was going to use this
                             solid rocket booster to lift the
                             ship into orbit. Before the warp
                             drive took over... everything
                             would depend on these old chemical
                             engines.
                                     (beat)
                             Now here's the problem...

                   They arrive at a point on the fuselage where we can see
                   a large section of the engines have been BLASTED AWAY,
                   leaving a deep, ugly SCAR -- broken conduit lines,
                   wires that now lead to nothing. It's clear that a key
                   piece of equipment has been destroyed.

 GEORDI                                      (re: damage)
                             This used to be the throttle valve
                             assembly.
                                     (observing it)  
                             It controls the thrust of the
                             engines. It's been completely
                             vaporized... and without it,
                             there's no way to launch the ship.

 PICARD                              Can you reconstruct the throttle
                             valve?

 GEORDI                              Yeah... if I knew what it looked
                             like. There's probably five
                             hundred ways to design a valve
                             like this...

 PICARD                              We need to launch this ship in
                             under eighteen hours...
                                     (beat)
                             There must be some design
                             schematics... blueprints...

 GEORDI                              We're tearing this place apart
                             looking for them... but the
                             computers are down, and the fires
                             destroyed half the files...so
                             far, nothing.

                   They look at the damage in frustration.

 GEORDI                              If it was just part of the warp
                             drive, I'd know what to do. But
                             this... it's like trying to
                             rebuild Orville Wright's airplane
                             with canvass and sticks.

                   Picard thinks, remembers something.

 PICARD                              Wait a minute...

 99 INT. CONTROL ROOM 99 
                   Moments later. Picard and Geordi are looking at the
                   three cloth-printed photographs seen earlier -- the
                   headshot of Cochrane and two different angles of the
                   three cloth-printed photographs seen earlier -- the
                   warp ship with people working on it. Picard spreads
                   them out on the desk.

 GEORDI                              Yeah, I looked at these already.

                   Geordi points to a photo of the ship -- a worker is
                   walking in front of the throttle assembly, blocking
                   most of it from view.

 GEORDI                              You can almost see the throttle
                             assembly in this one... but this
                             guy walked in front of it when
                             they took the picture.

                   Picard considers, absently sticks his hand in his
                   jacket pocket. He pulls out the canister of balm
                   Scrimm gave him and tosses it onto the table.

 PICARD                              Could you reconstruct the throttle
                             from a photograph like this... if
                             that man wasn't blocking the view?

                   Geordi thinks it over.

 GEORDI                              Maybe...
                                     (beat)
                             Sure. Yeah. As long as I could
                             get a clear look at the intake
                             configuration. But so far, we
                             haven't found any other photos.

 PICARD                                      (staring at photos)
                             If there are other photographs...
                             I think I may know how to find
                             them.

 CUT TO: 
 100 INT. BORG HIVE 100 
                   It's a while later, and the Borg are making progress.
                   Data is strapped to the table, PANELS open on his HEAD
                   and CHEST. Three Borg drones are working methodically
                   on his inner-circuitry. The jagged voice of the woman
                   cuts in:

 WOMAN'S VOICE                              Your resistance is... illogical.
                             To us, your neural net is simply
                             another piece of technology. We
                             will learn its secrets.

                   Data stares at the murky ceiling.

 DATA                              Who are you?

 WOMAN'S VOICE                              I am the Borg.

 DATA                              That is a contradiction. The Borg
                             act as a collective consciousness.
                             There are no individuals.

 WOMAN'S VOICE                              I am the beginning... the end. I
                             am the one who is many. I am the
                             Borg.

                   Out of the mist that hugs the top of the room DESCENDS
                   the BORG QUEEN.

                   She is unlike any of the Borg drones we've ever seen --
                   a humanoid female with conduits and tubes running out
                   of her body. She has no legs. Her torso is SUSPENDED
                   by a complex rig of CABLES and HYDRAULICS. Her face
                   and upper-torso are much more humanoid, with the pasty-
                   pale white of Borg flesh. Her EYES have a silvery
                   glint to them. Her demeanor is seductive and sensual
                   in contrast to the harsh, mechanical surroundings. She
                   is an eerie blend of two worlds -- organic and
                   mechanical.

                   With the soft HISS of hydraulics, she LOWERS herself
                   down to where her face is very close to that of Data's.
                   Her features are almost angelic, but the silvery glint
                   in her eyes betrays an inner-darkness.

 DATA                              You are the guiding intelligence
                             behind the Borg...?

 BORG QUEEN                              Intelligence... ambition...
                             desire... I bring order to
                             chaos...

                   She studies his face with a certain child-like quality.

 BORG QUEEN                              It's unfortunate we will have to
                             destroy you to obtain the
                             information we need. You are a...
                             unique lifeform.
                                     (beat)
                             Synthetic... and yet far more than
                             a simple automaton.
                             You have no idea how close to
                             perfection you are.
                    She stares at him intently, and we get the hint that
                   her interest in Data may go beyond simple assimilation.
                   She seems fascinated by him. Data picks up on this.

 DATA                              How do you define perfection?

                   The Queen opens her arms slightly, clearly indicating
                   herself.

 BORG QUEEN                              A blending of the organic and the
                             synthetic. The highest form of
                             life in the galaxy.

                   Data eyes her, considering.

 DATA                              An interesting definition. But it
                             is not one that applies to me. I
                             am completely artificial. I have
                             no organic components.

                   She looks at him as a new thought crosses her mind.
                   She might've just found the chink in Data's armor.

 BORG QUEEN                              Have you ever wondered what it's
                             like to have flesh?

 DATA                              It is impossible to imagine
                             sensations for which I have no
                             frame of reference.
                    She smiles.

 BORG QUEEN                              That... can change.

                   The Queen looks to the three Borg drones and gives them
                   a silent command. The drones immediately stop working
                   on Data's open panels... and shift their attention to
                   his right ARM. One of the drones tears off the sleeve
                   on Data's uniform, exposing his bare arm. Another then
                   uses a small cutting device to SLICE OFF the synthetic
                   skin from Data's arm. As Data prepares himself for the
                   worst...

 101 INT. ENTERPRISE CORRIDOR 101 
                   THREE armored SECURITY GUARDS with phaser rifles run
                   into view, hit a control panel on the wall. A giant
                   EMERGENCY BULKHEAD comes SLAMMING down, cutting off the
                   rest of the corridor.

                   The security guards turn to run down the hall, but then
                   there is a high-pitched shriek of wrenching metal.
                   They drop to the deck and take combat stances.

 GUARD #1                              Set phasers to rotating
                             modulation!

                   They make adjustments to their weapons just as the
                   bulkhead doors EXPLODE INWARD in a blinding flash. The
                   guards shield themselves against the fire and debris...
                   looks up just in time to see the swift and lethal
                   shapes of the BORG jumping through the smashed
                   bulkhead, racing down the corridor toward them. The
                   guards FIRE, and when they do the PHASER BLASTS
                   alternate color -- red, blue, green, purple, orange --
                   a staccato of colors as the phasers shift frequency.

                   The phaser blasts TAKE DOWN a few of the BORG... but
                   then we see the distinctive PERSONAL FORCEFIELDS of the
                   other Borg begin to compensate, and the phasers no
                   longer affect them.

 GUARD #1                              That's it, they've adjusted --
                             fall back!

                   They turn to run but BORG PHASER FIRE lances out from
                   the Borg soldiers and RIPS them apart.

 CUT TO: 
 102 INT. BRIDGE 102 
                   The mood is tense, grim. Riker, Worf and Troi are
                   gathered around a SCHEMATIC of the ENTERPRISE. The
                   lower portion of the ship has been blocked off by 
                   the color RED, representing the Borg advance through
                   the ship. A they watch, another section of
                   compartments and corridors suddenly turn RED.

                   Riker lets out a wary breath, starts pointing to
                   various points along the schematic.

 RIKER                              All right... we've lost control of
                             eight decks... three Cargo Bays...
                             one Shuttlebay.

 TROI                              Do we have any idea how many Borg
                             we're dealing with?

 WORF                              We saw at least thirty...and
                             there are twenty-two Enterprise
                             crewmembers reported missing...
                             including Commander Data.
 RIKER                              We'll have to assume they've been
                             assimilated into the Collective.

 TROI                              Even Data?

 WORF                              Data's positronic net contains
                             classified information on the
                             Enterprise. Command codes,
                             security protocols...

 RIKER                              If they control Data, they control
                             the ship.

                   A grim beat.

 RIKER                              We can't worry about that right
                             now. Let's concentrate on what we
                             can.

                   They stare at the schematic.

 WORF                              To control the Enterprise, they'll
                             have to gain access to one of two
                             locations. Main Engineering... or
                             the Bridge.

 RIKER                              We have to cover both
                             possibilities.
                                     (to Troi)
                             We'll take care of the Bridge.
                             Worf, take your men and seal off
                             Main Engineering. Turn it into a
                             fortress -- nothing gets in.

                   Worf nods and EXITS. As Riker and Troi exchange a
                   tense look...

 CUT TO: 
 103 EXT. RESURRECTION CITY - HOSPITAL - NIGHT 103 
                   The hospital is completely LIT UP -- the only building
                   in town with this much power.

 104 INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT 104 
                   Picard walks down the hall, stops outside a door marked
                   "X-RAY PROCESSING." The RED LIGHT is on above the
                   door, but that means nothing to Picard... who opens the
                   door and steps inside...
 105 INT. X-RAY PROCESSING ROOM 105 
                   Much like a traditional darkroom, trays of chemicals
                   and washes, etc. But everything has a slightly
                   futuristic and cobbled-together feel. They are
                   developing X-rays by hand instead of by machine. The
                   room is lit with an AMBER glow. As soon as Picard
                   opens the door, we hear Ruby's voice:

 RUBY'S VOICE                              Shut that door!

                   Picard quickly shuts the door behind him, looks around
                   the room. Ruby, who's working at a tray of chemicals,
                   turns around in fury.

 RUBY                              What are you, an idiot? Didn't
                             you see the red light was on?

 PICARD                              Ah... yes... but, I didn't realize
                             that --

 RUBY                              Thank God this plate was already
                             fixed.

                   She pulls down a small pane of glass (probably from a
                   window) out of a tub of water... holds it up to the
                   light. And there on the glass is a X-RAY of a man's
                   SKULL. Picard moves to her.

 PICARD                                      (re: X-ray)
                             Cochrane?

 RUBY                              Yes... and I only had enough
                             silver halide for one shot. So
                             you're lucky you didn't screw it
                             up.

 PICARD                              I'm very sorry.

                   She glances at him, sees he feels genuinely bad. She
                   softens a little.

 RUBY                              Don't worry about it.

                   She picks up a rubber squeegee and carefully starts to
                   dry off the pane of glass.
 RUBY                              Did you need something?

 PICARD                              Yes... I wanted to ask you about
                             some photographs I saw out at the
                             silo. There were three of them...
                             printed on some kind of fabric.

 RUBY                              Bed sheets.
                                     (off his look)
                             I used my last set of bed sheets to
                             make those prints. Not the best
                             material, but I haven't seen a
                             clean piece of paper in five
                             years.

 PICARD                              Did you take any other pictures of
                             the rocket?

                   The X-ray is now dry, and Ruby turns and looks at him.

 RUBY                              Sure.
                                     (jokingly)
                             Why, did you want to buy them?

                   Picard doesn't realize she was kidding -- jumps on the
                   opportunity to get the photos.

 PICARD                              Yes. I don't have any money right
                             now, but I may be able to get
                             some.

                   Ruby looks at him for a moment -- is he serious? She
                   gives him a curious smile.

 RUBY                              "Money." So you can get dome
                             money...

 PICARD                              I can try.
 RUBY                              You'd have to try real hard. No
                             one's used currency in over ten
                             years. What are you, from another
                             planet?
                    Picard hesitates, smiles at her, tries to laugh it off.

 PICARD                              No... but sometimes I feel that
                             way.
                                     (beat)
                             What I meant was, I'd be willing
                             to trade for the photographs.

 RUBY                              Trade. Okay. The photographs...
                             for a straight answer.
                                     (beat)
                             Who are you? And how do you know
                             Zephram?

 PICARD                              I'm an old friend... I met him
                             when he was doing his
                             undergraduate work at Cornell back
                             in --

 RUBY                                      (cuts him off)
                             'Fraid not.

                   Ruby walks past him with the X-ray...

 106 INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS 106 
                   Picard follows Ruby out into the corridor. She has a
                   satisfied smile on her face -- it's not easy to put one
                   over on this woman. And the truth is, she's enjoying
                   Picard's frustration. As they walk along...

 PICARD                              What?

 RUBY                                      (casual)
                             You're lying.

 PICARD                              What makes you say that?

 RUBY                              You're not someone who lies very
                             easily... so it's obvious when you
                             do... at least to me.

 PICARD                              Are you always sucha good judge
                             of character?

                   She stops, turns, looks at him.

 RUBY                              Always.

                   Ruby turns and walks off. Picard follows her, doggedly
                   determined to get those photos...

 107 INT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT 107 
                   Beverly is holding the X-ray glass Ruby made up to the
                   light, as the Doctor seen earlier looks on.

 BEVERLY                              The occipital fracture is
                             widening... we're going to have
                             to fuse the bones...

 DOCTOR                              I'm a little worried about some of
                             these bone fragments. If they
                             move any closer to the brain, we
                             could be looking at a hemorrhage.

                   As Beverly and the Doctor examine the X-ray, we MOVE TO
                   Ruby, who's looking down at Cochrane. He's still in
                   bed and on a respirator. She smoothes his hair with
                   affection. Picard stands on the other side of the bed,
                   watching her.

 PICARD                              Were the two of you... involved?

 RUBY                              No... not like you and Doctor
                             Crusher used to be.

 PICARD                                      (surprised)
                             How did you know about that?

                   Ruby looks at him with a smile.

 RUBY                              I didn't.

                   Her smile widens, and then she leaves the bed to join
                   the Doctor and Beverly. Picard shakes his head and
                   smiles after her -- chagrinned and amused at the same
                   time.

 RUBY                                      (to Doctor)
                             We can't take any more X-rays
                             until I can mix up a new batch of
                             the silver halide.

 DOCTOR                              Can you do it tonight? We may
                             have to operate.

 RUBY                              Sure. It'll be ready by morning.

                   Ruby turns and heads for the door. Picard moves after
                   her.

 PICARD                              Ruby... I need to talk to you
                             about those photographs. It's 
                             very important.

 RUBY                              I'm sure it is. But it'll have to
                             wait until tomorrow.

 PICARD                              It can't wait until tomorrow...

 RUBY                              Too bad.
                                     (beat)
                             Besides, it'll give you all night
                             to think up a new set of lies.

                   She flashes him that smile again, then darts out the
                   door. Picard is left frustrated -- he knows that he
                   can't let it go at that...

 CUT TO: 
 108 INT. ENTERPRISE - ENGINEERING 108 
                   Worf and a team of TEN SECURITY GUARDS are preparing
                   for battle. They're setting up large, heavy-duty
                   phaser equivalents of machine guns --  big, mean-looking
                   weapons on tripods. There are two of these weapons
                   aimed at each entrance to Engineering. The Security
                   Officers are strapping on body armor, checking weapons,
                   building makeshift barricades over each of the doors.

                   Worf is in command, directing the action.

 WORF                                      (to team)
                             Double check each assault
                             phaser... make certain that the
                             range setting is no more than
                             thirty meters. We don't want to
                             blast through the hull.

                   Worf turns and picks up his BAT'LETH SWORD off a nearby
                   console. He checks the sharpness of the blade.

 SECURITY OFFICER                              Are you sure you don't want
                             something a little more...
                             sophisticated, sir?

 WORF                              Mind your post, Lieutenant.

                   The Lieutenant decides not to pursue the matter and
                   moves off. Worf makes a quick practiced motion with
                   the sword... decides he's ready.

 109 INT. BRIDGE 109 
                   Riker and Troi watching the schematic.

                   Riker works a control and the display ZOOMS IN to
                   display a cutaway view of the ship highlighting
                   Engineering and the surrounding deck. A SWARM of DOTS
                   representing the Borg is advancing on Engineering.

 RIKER                                      (to com)
                             Riker to Engineering. Mister
                             Worf...the Borg are approaching
                             your position.

 WORF'S COM VOICE                              Understood. We're ready.

                   Riker and Troi watch as the DOTS move closer...
                   closer...right up to the perimeter of Engineering.
                   The dots begin surrounding Engineering -- which looks
                   like it's being swarmed over by a sea of ants.

 110 INT. ENGINEERING 110 
                   As before. The security guards have taken positions
                   around the room, all weapons trained on the doors.

                   Worf is standing in front of the warp core, Bat'leth in-
                   hand.

 WORF                                      (calls out)
                             Charge weapons!

                   A massive HUM of power fills the room as all of the
                   phaser weapons begin charging. It's tense -- everyone
                   standing ready with their weapons charging. This is
                   the moment of truth.

                   Worf stands ready, phaser in one hand, Bat'leth in the
                   other. This is Worf at his purest -- the warrior ready
                   for battle.

 111 INT. BRIDGE 111 
                   Riker and Troi, as before, watching the schematic of
                   the ship. The DOTS representing Borg have now
                   completely surrounded Engineering on all sides,
                   including the deck directly above and below. In
                   essence, the Borg have cocooned Engineering from the
                   rest of the ship.

 112 INT. ENGINEERING 112 
                   As before. Worf and the security team in their
                   positions, tense. A few beats of silence...then they
                   start to hear soft SCRATCHING coming from somewhere
                   behind the walls -- it sounds like rats skittering
                   through the walls and ceiling of an old house.

                   Everyone stays alert, checks and re-checks their
                   weapons... a couple of hard swallows... then from
                   somewhere up above a LOUD, METALLIC CLANG. Then a
                   large, SCRAPING SOUND that seems to start at one end of
                   the room and travel to the other. There's an
                   overpowering sense of creatures just outside those
                   walls, moving about. It's unnerving, even for crack
                   Starfleet troops.

 113 INT. BRIDGE 113 
                   Riker and Troi watching the display. The Borg dots
                   teeming around Engineering like ants on a candy bar.

 114 INT. ENGINEERING 114 
                   The clawing, skittering, clanging noises increase and
                   get louder...

                   ... we expect to see the Borg bursting into the room at
                   any moment. Worf tightens his grip on his Bat'leth,
                   teeth bared. Unbearable tension and then...

                   The noises begin to FADE AWAY... eventually
                   disappearing all together. If anything, the silence is
                   even scarier. Worf's eyes narrow. He looks around the
                   room, all his senses alert, waiting for the slightest
                   sign of the Borg... but nothing happens.

 115 INT. BRIDGE 115 
                   Riker and Troi react to the diagram as the Borg dots
                   begin moving away from Engineering. It looks like the
                   swarm of ants have left the candy bar and are on the
                   ground, moving toward the forward part of the ship.

 TROI                              They're bypassing Engineering...

 RIKER                              Where the hell are they going?

                   OFF the mystery...

 CUT TO: 
 116 INT. BORG HIVE 116 
                   CLOSE ON DATA'S FACE. His eyes are closed -- he is in
                   the android equivalent of sleep. CAMERA ROTATING and
                   PUSHING IN on his face as we hear the overlapping
                   sounds of VOICES from Data's past -- Picard, Riker,
                   Troi, the Enterprise crew, aliens he's met, Data's own
                   voice... bits and pieces of his life...

                   The theme of the sound bites should be Data's quest for
                   humanity: Picard giving him advice, Troi counseling
                   him, Soong talking to his son, etc. The last line of
                   dialogue we hear is Data saying "I want to be more
                   human."

 BORG QUEEN'S VOICE                              Data...

                   Data's eyes fly open, now awake. We PULL BACK
                   revealing that Data is still strapped to the Borg
                   operating table... his right arm and shoulder are
                   encased in some kind of strange cybernetic SHELL,
                   obscured from view. Clear tubes run out of the shell
                   into Borg machinery -- liquid is coursing through the
                   tubes. A couple of Borg drones are moving about the
                   room, carrying out various tasks.

                   There's been a change since we've been here last.
                   There are now several Plexiglass CYLINDERS surrounding
                   Data's table -- each of them filled with some kind of
                   murky red fluid, which is swirling around. Every once
                   in awhile, something that looks like RAW FLESH bumps up
                   against the clear Plexiglass, then disappears again.
                   We don't know what these tubes are for, but they're
                   definitely creepy.

                   Data takes all this in, but there is nothing he can do,
                   he's still immobilized.

                   Suddenly the table ROTATES and begins to MOVE up toward
                   the mist and cabling at the top of the ceiling. It
                   stops a few feet away... and Data finds himself face-to-
                   face with the Borg Queen again.

 BORG QUEEN                              You've taken your first step
                             toward perfection. How does it
                             feel?

 DATA                              I do not know what you are
                             referring to.

 BORG QUEEN                              That's because you haven't been
                             properly... stimulated yet.

                   A WHOOSH of hydraulic power signals another movement by
                   the Borg Queen. She slithers through the air and down
                   slightly, so that she is on the same level as Data.
                   She looks at the cybernetic shell that is encasing
                   Data's right arm, which OPENS at her silent command and
                   moves away...

                   We can now see that all of the skin has been removed
                   from Data's right arm, showing the INNER-WORKINGS of
                   his android limb -- circuitry and servos, etc. But on
                   the top of the mechanical forearm there is something
                   new -- a small PATCH of HUMAN FLESH held in place with
                   various nasty-looking hooks and clamps and small tubes
                   carrying blood. It's a delicate, fragile piece of
                   organic life on an ugly, mechanical surface.

                   Data looks down at the patch of flesh with a little
                   puzzlement.

 BORG QUEEN                                      (re: flesh)
                             Do you know what this is, Data?

 DATA                              It would appear that you are
                             attempting to graft organic skin
                             onto my endo-skeletal structure.

 BORG QUEEN                              What a cold description... for
                             such a beautiful gift.

                   She smiles slightly, utterly confident. She leans her
                   face in close to Data's still immobilized right arm.

 117 EXTREME CLOSE UP - DATA'S ARM 117 
                   We are so close to the patch of flesh that we can see
                   the individual hairs. The Borg Queen's LIPS move into
                   frame, and she EXHALES a long and sensuous breath. We
                   see GOOSE BUMPS form on the skin, and the hairs stand
                   straight up in response.
 118 NEW ANGLE 118                    As Data's eyes widen and he looks down at the skin in
                   surprise -- this is a sensation he's never felt before.
                   The Borg Queen sees the look on his face and smiles.

 BORG QUEEN                              Was that good for you?

                   Data can barely describe the sensation. But clearly,
                   it was pleasurable.

 DATA                              It was... interesting.

                   He looks at her.

 DATA                              Do it again... please.

                   As she smiles...

 CUT TO: 
 119 EXT. RUBY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 119 
                   A tiny, single-story house -- one or two rooms at the
                   most, in serious need of repair and maintenance. No
                   yard. The house sits on dirt. The nearest other
                   structure is at least a hundred yards away. A very
                   solitary place. The windows are dark, painted over
                   from the inside.

                   Some large pieces of exotic-looking EQUIPMENT are
                   sitting off the front porch.

                   After a beat, the front door opens, letting out a soft,
                   feeble light.

                   Ruby steps out onto the porch, carrying a gallon size
                   plastic jug. The light from the house now lights the 
                   equipment a little, giving us a better view. There's
                   a contraption that appears to be a PUMP of some kind,
                   with a funnel on top, spigot at the bottom, and several
                   stages of filters and tubing in between. Ruby sets the
                   jug underneath the spigot... then sits down for a 
                   moment on the edge of the porch. She takes a breath
                   and runs a hand through her hair, stretches her back,
                   trying to work out some of the kinks in her neck. An
                   exhausting day.

 120 PICARD 120 
                   is watching her intently from afar. He's concealed
                   behind a supporting beam of one the town's many
                   WINDMILLS. He's in shadow, hidden from Ruby's view.

 121 RUBY 121 
                   pulls off her jacket. she's wearing a pull-over
                   shirt... and in one motion she pulls off the shirt,
                   revealing only a tee-shirt underneath, sleeves torn off
                   long ago. She stands up... kicks off her boots...
                   undoes her pants... and begins sliding the jeans off
                   her hips...

 122 PICARD 122 
                   is surprised. Glances around, a little awkward. This
                   really isn't why he came out here.

 123 RUBY 123 
                   kicks aside the jeans. She's now down to tee-shirt and
                   panties. She grabs the bottom of the tee-shirt...
                   pulls it off...

 124 PICARD 124 
                   doesn't want to look, but can't help himself...

 125 RUBY 125 
                   moves to the side of the porch... and steps into a
                   large ENVIROMENTAL SUIT, a bulky one-piece with gloves
                   and helmet attached.

 126 PICARD 126 
                   is a little relieved... keeps watching...

 127 RUBY 127 
                   has now encased herself in the thick, rubbery suit...
                   pulls over a HELMET with a gas mask. She walks over to
                   an OIL DRUM marked with a distinctive BIO-HAZARD
                   SYMBOL. She carefully opens the lid... takes a metal
                   pitcher... reaches down into the drum and scoops out a
                   pitcher-full of TOXIC WASTE. She closes the lid, walks
                   over to the pump-filter contraption. She pours the
                   sludge-like waste into the funnel...primes the pump...
                   makes a few adjustments to the filters... and then
                   turns the spigot...

                   After a beat, a trickle of CLEAR LIQUID starts to come
                   out of the spigot. Ruby steps back and pulls off the
                   helmet.

 128 PICARD 128 
                   watches, curious about what she's doing...

 129 RUBY 129 
                   is now out of the bio-suit again... pulling on her
                   shirt and jeans... grabs her jacket... turns off the
                   lights in the house, and shuts the front door behind
                   her. She begins walking toward the windmill.

 130 PICARD 130 
                   steps behind the girder, stays very still in the
                   shadows... waits quietly as Ruby passes by the windmill
                   without a glance and heads into town. After she's
                   gone, Picard steps out from his hiding place, watches
                   her go, then quickly heads for Ruby's house...

 131 FRONT PORCH 131 
                   Picard opens the front door and goes inside... but he
                   doesn't notice that at the base of the doorjamb a small
                   RED LIGHT starts flashing -- some sort of silent alarm.

 132 INT. RUBY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 132 
                   Picard ENTERS and closes the door behind him. It's
                   dark. He fumbles around for a light switch... finally
                   locates one... and a soft, golden glow fills the room.

                   The house has only one room, which functions as a
                   living room, kitchen, bedroom, etc. This is also
                   Ruby's DARKROOM. The windows have been painted black,
                   and there are photographic plates and futuristic photo-
                   equipment all around. But the most striking feature of
                   the house are the large, hanging cloth-printed
                   PHOTOGRAPHS. They vary in size and shape. Some are
                   hanging on walls, others hang from the ceiling in mid-
                   air, still others are stacked on the few pieces of
                   furniture that's here. The absence of paper has forced
                   Ruby to print photos on anything she can find --
                   bed sheets, shirts, pieces of upholstery, backs of
                   carpeting, etc. Picard stands there for a moment,
                   taking in the scene -- he's never been in anyplace
                   quite like this. The cloth photos give the room a
                   feeling of a small, intensely personal gallery.

                   Picard moves around the room, looking from photo to
                   photo... hunting for the elusive shots of the missile
                   silo... and as he does, we get our first close look at
                   Ruby's images, and they tell us a great deal about
                   her...

                   She has an artistic eye for finding beauty in the
                   mundane and the ugly. There are pictures of hope
                   amidst despair... beauty amongst devastation. There
                   seems to be a theme running through the photographs --
                   a romantic, almost idealistic sense of optimism.

                   At one point, Picard finds a photograph he recognizes.
                   It's the rusted-out hover car she photographed on the
                   streets of Resurrection. It's an ugly, decrepit piece
                   of junk... but there in the center, spot-lighted by a
                   single ray of sunshine... is a tiny flower about to
                   bloom.

                   Picard takes in the image for a brief moment... then
                   pushes onward... goes to a file of photos sitting in a
                   box... begins sorting through them quickly... we see
                   PRE-WAR photos printed on real paper. They show a
                   younger Ruby with her parents... Resurrection the way
                   it used to look... Ruby with a dog...

                   Picard pauses, frowns... gets the odd feeling that
                   someone is watching him. He turns around to see...

 133 HIMSELF 133 
                   A three foot PHOTOGRAPH OF PICARD is drying in the air
                   behind him.

                   Ruby must've taken the photo when Picard was on the
                   street talking to Scrimm. It was taken through a
                   telephoto lens, a close-up of Picard's face -- he looks
                   focused, determined, heroic. It's a remarkable shot of
                   the Captain, and even Picard is a little taken aback by
                   the image. She's captured the essence of the man.

                   CLICK-CLACK! The sound of a shotgun being cocked.
                   Picard freezes... slowly turns around to see who's
                   there...

 134 RUBBY 134 
                   is standing in the open doorway, a shotgun leveled at
                   Picard.

 RUBY                              You should pay closer attention to
                             those little red lights.

                   Picard glances down at the doorway, sees the flashing
                   red light in the doorjamb. He's busted.

 RUBY                              You know, I'd be perfectly
                             justified in shooting you right
                             now.

                   Picard glances at the photograph of himself.

 PICARD                              I'd say you already have.

 RUBY                              Don't flatter yourself. I take
                             pictures of a lot of junk.

                   She perches herself on the arm of a small couch, holds
                   the gun loosely, but never taking the aim away from
                   Picard.

 RUBY                              Okay, let's hear it. I'm sure you
                             have a great explanation for why
                             those rocket photos are so
                             important you broke into my house.

 PICARD                              We're trying to repair Doctor
                             Cochrane's ship. It's been
                             damaged and --

 RUBY                              We?

 PICARD                              Myself... and a few other friends
                             of Zephram's.

 RUBY                              Friends from Cornell...

 PICARD                              Some.

 RUBY                              Lie. That's one. Keep going.

 PICARD                              A key piece of the ship has been
                             destroyed... and our only hope to
                             reconstruct it is if one of your
                             photographs shows us what it
                             looked like.

 RUBY                                      (considers)
                             All right. Truth. I believe that
                             one. Why is it so urgent you
                             couldn't wait until morning?

 PICARD                              We have to launch his ship by
                             tomorrow afternoon.

 RUBY                              Or...?

                   Picard has to come up with something -- decides to
                   throw her off with a high-tech explanation.

 PICARD                              Or the shielding around the
                             plutonium core will begin to
                             deteriorate. Within a day, the
                             entire silo will become so
                             radioactive that no one will be
                             able to come near it for a hundred
                             years.

                   Ruby eyes him evenly.

 RUBY                              Lie. That's two. One more, and
                             I pull the trigger.

                  Picard is starting to get angry.

 PICARD                              Why are you being so difficult?
                             All I'm asking for is to look at
                             one of the photographs. It'll
                             take five minutes.

 RUBY                              And all I'm asking for is the
                             truth. That would take five
                             minutes.
                                     (beat)
                             For all I know, you caused the
                             explosions at the silo... and now
                             you're trying to steal Zephram's
                             ship.

 PICARD                              I am not a thief...

                   Ruby's had enough -- her temper flares and she gets off
                   the couch, takes a threatening step toward Picard.

 RUBY                              No, you're a petty burglar and a
                             liar...
                                     (beat)
                             You're no friend of Zephram's. He
                             is a great man. He's not like you
                             or me or any of the other zombies
                             walking around this town.

                   Picard jumps in with a quiet, forceful quality:

 PICARD                              No. He's a man with vision. He
                             can see beyond the problems that
                             surround us. He knows there's a
                             better future out there for
                             everyone... a future where crime,
                             poverty and war are things of the
                             past... a future where we reach
                             out and seek our destiny in the
                             stars.
                                    (beat)
                             I believe in that future, too,
                             Ruby. I believe in it in every
                             fiber of my being. And I'm
                             telling you... if we don't launch
                             that warp ship tomorrow, there's
                             a very good chance that future
                             will never happen.

                   She eyes him for a moment -- and we're not sure if his
                   words have had any effect.

                   Ruby still has her doubts, but decides to go with her
                   gut...and finally hands him the photographs. Picard
                   glances through them -- his expression tells us the
                   photo he needs is in there.

 PICARD                              You won't regret this.

                   They share a look... and then Picard turns and walks
                   off into the night. Ruby watches him go... and we can
                   see on her face a confused jumble of mixed emotions.
                   Something about that man has touched her...

 135 NIGHT SCPOE POV 135 
                   A telescopic, green and white image of Picard walking
                   away from Ruby's home.

 136 LIEUTENANT SCRIMM 136 
                   is watching Picard through a set of night vision
                   binoculars, perched on the roof of a nearby building.
                   He frowns, wondering what Picard is up to...

 CUT TO: 
 137 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE DEFLECTOR DISH 137 
                   The giant DEFLECTOR ARRAY at the front of the ship --
                   a giant, round, bowl-shaped array used for
                   communications and shielding. As we watch, FOUR
                   HATCHES OPEN surrounding the dish and BORG start to
                   emerge from the interior of the ship and CRAWL OUT on
                   the hull. The Borg do not need pressure suits or
                   breathing equipment -- they crawl around the hull with
                   ease and onto the deflector dish...

 PULL BACK TO REVEAL: 
 138 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE - VIEWSCREEN 138 
                   Where Riker, Troi, Worf and N.D.s are watching this
                   image on the Viewscreen.

 RIKER                              What are they doing?

 WORF                              They appear to be modifying the
                             deflector dish.

 TROI                              To do what? If they wanted a
                             weapon, they could've taken over
                             a phaser bank or torpedo bay...

 RIKER                              Deflector dish... why the
                             deflector dish...?

 WORF                              It doesn't make sense. The
                             deflector is only used for
                             shielding and long range
                             sensors...

                   Riker stares at the screen... notices something.

 RIKER                              Computer -- magnify grid twenty-
                             one alpha.

                   The image on the Viewscreen ZOOMS IN to a specific
                   point on the deflector dish, giving us a clear view of
                   two Borg who have opened a gigantic panel on the dish.
                   They appear top be modifying power conduits in some
                   fashion.

 WORF                              They're re-routing the deflector
                             power conduits...

 RIKER                              Computer -- thermal enhancement.

                   The image now is overlaid with an INFRARED VIEW of what
                   they're doing. The power conduits are glowing bright
                   red, very hot -- we can see the heat signature travel
                   back behind the dish and connect to a corkscrew-shaped
                   coil, which is pulsing.

 RIKER                              They're connecting the conduits to
                             subspace communications...

 WORF                                      (realizing)
                             They're converting the deflector
                             dish into an antennae...

 TROI                              They may be trying to send a
                             message to the other Borg...the
                             Borg in this time period...
 WORF                              What kind of message?

 RIKER                                      (thinking)
                             If it was me... I'd say "attack
                             Earth now... in the 21st
                             century... they'll be too strong
                             in the 24th."

                   They think about this for a moment as they watch the
                   Borg swarming on the deflector array.

 WORF                              We have to stop them from sending
                             that message.

 RIKER                              Agreed. Options?

 WORF                              Destroy the deflector dish.

 TROI                              Can we aim our dorsal phasers at
                             it?

                   Riker shakes his head.

 RIKER                              We've lost control of all weapons
                             systems... Transporters are
                             down... we can't get to a
                             Shuttlecraft... and it would take
                             us too long to fight our way down
                             to deflector control...

                   They think.

 WORF                              There is another way, Commander.
                             Do you remember your zero-G combat
                             training?

                   Riker looks a little wary at the suggestion.

 RIKER                              I remember it made me sick.

 TROI                                      (to Worf)
                             What are you suggesting?

 RIKER                              I think Mister Worf is suggesting
                             that we go outside for a little
                             stroll...

                   OFF their expressions...

 139 CLOSE ON A PHOTOGRAPH 139 
                   Another one of Ruby's cloth-printed photos, this one a
                   clear view of the base of the missile engines --
                   Cochrane standing underneath the massive rocket nozzle.
                   Above him on the fuselage is the crucial throttle-valve
                   assembly.

 GEORDI'S VOICE                              I'm almost afraid to say this,
                             Captain... but I think it's going
                             to work.

                   MOVE TO REVEAL we're in:

 140 INT. MISSILE SILO - LOWER CATWALK - DAY 140 
                   The cloth photo is hanging from a beam on the catwalk.
                   Geordi and Picard are watching a couple of N.D.s attach
                   the newly-built throttle assembly to the side of the
                   ship. The N.D.s are using high-tech welding tools and
                   sparks are flying. As they talk, they head back up the
                   catwalk toward the control room...

 PICARD                              Where's you get the alloy for the
                             throttle itself?

 GEORDI                              They used copper pipes in their
                             plumbing... so I melted it down...
                             and fused it with some tritanium
                             from one of our phaser casings.
                                     (beat)
                             It's not the strongest alloy...
                             but it's better than all this
                             crude aluminum and steel.

 141 INT. MISSILE CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS 141 
                   As Geordi and Picard ENTER. Lange is checking out a
                   launch console.

                   The room is now humming with power -- it's beginning to
                   look like the place is up and running. Picard stops
                   near the desk.

 PICARD                              Mister Lange -- have you brought
                             the computer systems back on-line
                             yet?

 LANGE                              Aye, Captain. This trinary
                             language is pretty archaic... but
                             I think I understand it now.

 PICARD                             Good.

                   As they speak, CAMERA MOVES in on the metal canister
                   of lotion Picard set on the desk earlier...

 142 EXT. MONTONA WOODS - DAY - CONTINUOUS 142 
                   Scrimm and three militia guards are huddled around a
                   cluster of military surveillance gear, listening to
                   Picard and Geordi's conversation. Far in the distance,
                   we can see the missile silo.

 PICARD'S VOICE                              Are we on schedule? The Vulcan
                             ship will be here in less than two
                             hours.

 GEORDI'S VOICE                              It'll be tight, but we should make
                             it.

 PICARD'S VOICE                              What about our warp signature? It
                             has to be strong enough for them
                             to detect.

 GEORDI'S VOICE                              I've enhanced the plasma injectors --
                             don't worry, they'll see it.

 PICARD'S VOICE                              Well, with any luck... the Vulcans
                             will land outside Resurrection
                             tomorrow morning... and Earth will
                             never be the same again.
                    Scrimm and his men listen with growing alarm -- it
                   sounds like Picard is planning an invasion!

 143 INT. MISSILE CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS 143 
                   As before.

 PICARD                              All right. I'd better start
                             familiarizing myself with the
                             flight controls.

                   A console BUZZES. Lange moves to it, and activates a
                   small color video MONITOR. It shows an external view
                   of the MISSILE silo, just outside the hatch. Beverly
                   can be seen standing nearby with a now conscious
                   Zephram Cochrane.

 LANGE                              Doctor Crusher's at the access
                             hatch, Captain.

 PICARD                              Let her in.

                   Lange hits a couple of buttons...

 CUT TO: 
 144 CLOSE ON COCHRANE'S FACE 144 
                   A short time later. His head is bandaged, and he's
                   conscious, but frankly he looks like hell. He sits
                   back, looking a little overwhelmed.

 COCHRANE                              Let me get this straight... you're
                             from the future... I'm about to
                             change history... and all I have
                             to do is sit here and let you fly
                             my ship?

 145 WIDER 145 
                   Picard, Geordi and Beverly are standing around
                   Cochrane, who is sitting in a high-backed chair in a
                   corner of the Control Room.

 PICARD                              That's right.

                   He studies their faces -- sees they're serious. He
                   smiles a little ruefully.

 COCHRANE                              And people say I'm crazy...

                   Picard smiles.

 PICARD                              I assure you, Doctor, that after
                             today... no one will ever call you
                             that again.

                   Cochrane considers them...finally nods, what the hell.

 COCHRANE                              Just do me a favor... bring my
                             ship back in one piece.

 PICARD                              That's a promise.

                   Picard turns and walks off with Beverly. Geordi moves
                   to Cochrane with a little bit of awe.

 GEORDI                              Doctor... my name is Geordi La
                             Forge. I'm an engineer. Can I
                             shake your hand?

                   Cochrane is touched by Geordi's obvious respect. They
                   shake hands.

 COCHRANE                              I wish I could go with you. Is
                             there anything I can do to help?

 GEORDI                              Not really... but I do have about
                             a thousand questions I've always
                             wanted to ask you.

 COCHRANE                              Since time is short... why don't
                             you pick the top ten and fire
                             away?

                   Geordi smiles...

 146 PICARD AND BEVERLY 146 
                   have moved to another part of the room. Beverly looks
                   exhausted. She sets her medkit on a table and plops
                   down into a chair. Mid-conversation.

 PICARD                                       (surprised)
                             You actually performed surgery...?

 BEVERLY                              It was an experience. Metal
                             scalpels... needle and thread...

                   She looks up with a smile, pulls a small DEVICE out of
                   the medkit -- a surgical transporter.

 BEVERLY                                      (re: device)
                             But I had a little help. Surgical
                             transporter. I used it to beam
                             out most of the bone fragments
                             from his brain.

 PICARD                              How did Doctor Almack react to
                             that?

 BEVERLY                              He was so confused by what I was
                             doing, I don't think he even
                             noticed.
                                     (beat)
                             Any word from the Enterprise?

 PICARD                              Not yet.

 BEVERLY                              You think they're still up there?

 PICARD                                      (wry)
                             If they're not... we'd better get
                             used to living in Montana.

 BEVERLY                                      (light)
                             That might not be so bad... at
                             least for you.

                   She's kidding, but Picard is a little defensive.

 PICARD                              What's that supposed to mean?

                   There is no animosity or hint of jealousy in Beverly's
                   attitude, she's simply making an observation about
                   someone she cares about.

 BEVERLY                              I saw the way you looker at her...
                             and I know that look.

                   Picard doesn't want to argue about this -- to him, it's
                   a pointless conversation.

 PICARD                              Regardless of how I may feel about
                             Ruby... our fates lie along
                             different paths. Nothing can
                             change that.

 BEVERLY                              You want some advice? Don't do
                             this again.
                                     (off his look)
                             You know exactly what I mean.

 PICARD                              Beverly, there were many reasons
                             why you and I...

 BEVERLY                              I'd call them excuses. And the
                             first excuse on both our lists was
                             our "sense of duty." We convinced
                             ourselves that it was more
                             important than anything else. And
                             you know what? It's not.

                   She holds his look for a moment.

 PICARD                                      (neutral)
                             I have a ship to launch.

                   Picard turns and leaves. Beverly watches him go...
                   wondering whether her words had any affect...

 147 EXT. RUBY'S HOUSE - DAY 147 
                   Ruby is turning off the spigot on the filter-pump. The
                   plastic jug is now filled with the clear fluid --
                   silver halide. She caps the jug, picks it up, begins
                   walking up on the porch...then hesitates for a
                   moment... looks out over the horizon.

                   She hesitates... then frowns and goes inside...

                   Ruby comes inside, sets down the jug... begins to pick
                   up some more glass plates... stops... thinks... looks
                   up. Only a few feet away is the large picture of
                   Picard. She doesn't want to look at him, doesn't want
                   to think about him... but there he is.

                   She glances back at the open door... struggles for a
                   moment... then makes a decision.

                   Despite herself, she can't get Picard out of her head.
                   With a little frustration, she grabs her camera bag and
                   heads for the door...

 149 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE 149 
                   in Earth orbit.

 150 INT. BORG HIVE 150 
                   ANGLE ON CEILING as the Borg Queen descends from her
                   nesting place down towards the camera... ultimately
                   stopping just a few feet away. She speaks directly to
                   the camera.

 BORG QUEEN                              How do you feel?

 151 CLOSE ON DATA'S HAND 151 
                   His right hand is made of FLESH -- it has color,
                   fingernails, hair, sweat. It's completely human in
                   every way. His fingers move slightly, and then the
                   hand begins to rise. We follow his hand as it comes up
                   and touches his FACE, which is also FLESH. The gold
                   color is gone, his hair is tousled and natural-looking.
                   Even his eyes are real now -- blue. He touches his
                   face tentatively, his expression confused... but
                   intrigued.

 DATA                              Different.
                    The Borg Queen descends closer. Data's arms are now
                   free, but he is still restrained on the table. The
                   rest of his body is still android, mechanical.

                   Data touches his two hands together, feeling the
                   sensations, flesh against machine. He touches his face
                   and lips, discovering himself in a totally new way.

 DATA                              My internal sensors tell me the
                             ambient temperature in the room is
                             ten point two degrees Celsius...
                                     (wondrous)
                             But my skin tells me it is cold.

                   As he talks, we can see that he's becoming seduced by
                   his own newfound senses.

 DATA                              My visual acuity has been reduced
                             by seventy-eight percent... and I
                             can no longer perceive light
                             beyond the ultraviolet or the
                             infrared...
                                     (beat)
                             But I can see.

                   It's an amazing moment, Data riding a wave of feeling
                   and emotion like he's never had before. The Borg Queen
                   watches, pleased. She hovers close to him.

 BORG QUEEN                              Until today... your emotions were
                             trapped inside an artificial
                             shell. You didn't know what it
                             was to truly feel.
                                     (beat)
                             And there's so much more for you
                             to experience.  I will guide you
                             into a world of sensation unlike
                             anything you can imagine.
                                     (beat)
                             All you have to do... is give us
                             access to your neural net.

                   Data looks at her, suddenly shocked back into reality.

 DATA                              No. I will not betray my friends.

 BORG QUEEN                              They're not your friends...
                             they've held you back... kept you
                             from your destiny...

 DATA                              That is not true. They have tried
                             to help me.

 BORG QUEEN                              Have they given you what I have
                             given you? Did they even try?

 DATA                              I... do not want this...

                   But his words have a certain hollow quality to them.
                   He is no longer as convinced as he was before and the
                   Borg Queen notes this immediately. She reaches out
                   with a hand and gently strokes Data's cheek.

 BORG QUEEN                              You're becoming more human all the 
                             time, Data. Now you're learning 
                             how to lie.

 DATA                              I wish to... go back to the way I
                             was.

 BORG QUEEN                              More lies.

                   She SLAPS him hard across the face. Data feels the
                   pain, the shock. A small trickle of blood comes from
                   his mouth. He looks at her in surprise, but before he
                   can say anything she moves forward and KISSES him on
                   the mouth deeply and intensely. It's a disturbing and
                   erotic moment. She pulls back. Data reels, trying to
                   sort out the rapid succession of pleasure and pain.
                   Her voice drops to a whisper and she moves even closer
                   to him, face-to-face... seductive... beguiling.

 BORG QUEEN                              Have you ever know a woman? Do
                             you know what it's like to feel
                             her breath on your face... her
                             skin against yours... flesh
                             against flesh?

 DATA                              My creator did not intend for me
                             to experience these things.

 BORG QUEEN                              I'm your creator now.

                   She rubs her body against his, cat-like... then pulls
                   him to her and kisses him deeply. Off the image of
                   their bizarre embrace...

 CUT TO: 
 152 INT. BRIDGE 152 
                   Riker, Worf, and three Security N.D.s are pulling on
                   SPACESUITS. The suits are form-fitting, sleek, no
                   bulky oxygen tanks. The helmets are the same -- they
                   conform to the contours of the skull and face.

 WORF                                      (to Riker)
                             You will have to realign the
                             targeting array of the quantum
                             torpedo... and reprogram the
                             warhead for the localized
                             detonation.
                                     (beat)
                             There's only one torpedo left...
 RIKER                              I guess I'd better get it right
                             the first time.

 WORF                                      (to all)
                             The Borg will undoubtedly attack.
                             Set phasers to rotating
                             modulation.

                   The Security Officers check their phasers and wait as
                   Riker and Worf finish putting on their suits. Riker
                   straps a tool case to his suit.

 RIKER                              Ready?

                   Everyone nods. Riker goes to a wall panel and
                   activates the control. The Airlock door seen earlier
                   OPENS. Riker turns back to Troi.

 TROI                              Good luck.

                   Riker nods. Then he, Worf, and the Guards ENTER the
                   airlock and Troi close the door behind them.

 153 INT. AIRLOCK 153 
                   A tiny room separating the Bridge from the outer hull.

 RIKER                              Depressurize.

                   Worf hits a control and the room DEPRESSURIZES with a
 HISSING SOUND. 
 WORF                                      (to others)
                             Activate magnetic constrictors.

                   They all activate controls on their wrists and there is
                   a faint hum of power as the suits are magnetized.

                   Riker hits another control and the OUTER AIRLOCK DOOR
                   SLIDES OPEN, revealing the vast vacuum of SPACE. They
                   begin to walk out of the airlock...

 154 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE - AIRLOCK 154 
                   As Riker and his team come out of the airlock on the
                   top of the saucer section. It's a spectacular sight as
                   the small group of figures, with weapons at the ready,
                   marches toward the leading edge of the saucer. The
                   scene is lit by light reflected by the Earth, which
                   hangs above the ship.

             155   ON RIKER & WORF                                            155

                   As they approach the edge. Worf gives a hand signal
                   and the rest of the team spreads out into a tactical
                   deployment and drops down onto their bellies. They
                   crawl up to the very edge of the saucer and pause.
                   Worf looks at Riker, who looks a little queasy.

 WORF                                      (to Riker)
                             Are you alright? 

 RIKER                              Just a little queasy...

 WORF                              Try not to look at the stars...
                             keep your eyes on the ship.

 RIKER                              Right.

 WORF                              And Commander, whatever you do...
                             do not vomit in your exo-suit. It
                             would be... unpleasant.

 RIKER                              I'll keep that in mind.

                   Riker takes a few deep breaths to steady himself.

 RIKER                                      (to all)
                             Over and under!

                   They all quickly scramble over the edge and onto the
                   underside of the saucer.

                   The CAMERA ROTATES AND SPINS with them as they
                   traverse to the underside of the hull -- they're
                   upside down relative to their previous position, but
                   there's no up or down in space and their magnetized
                   suits hold them to the hull.

                   It's a dizzying moment as we try to orient ourselves to
                   their new position. From this angle, the Enterprise
                   appears to be upside down!
                    Once they're on the underside of the saucer, they can
                   see the rest of the ship laid out above them.

 156 NEW ANGLE - THEIR POV 156 
                   The deflector dish (which is now above us) is covered
                   with dozens of Borg drones, who are working to modify
                   it. Some of them turn and see us.

 157 RIKER AND WORF 157 
                   Begin running toward the torpedo tube on the saucer.
                   (Running is difficult, they must keep one foot on the
                   hull at all times.) Several Borg PHASER SHOTS whip past
                   them as the Borg open fire.

 158 THE BORG 158 
                   A DOZEN of them leave the work on the dish and begin
                   skittering down (which is normally up) the
                   interconnecting dorsal on all fours toward our heroes
                   like a swarm of ants -- a frightening sight.

 159 A SECURITY GUARD 159 
                   Is HIT by a phaser shot and goes FLYING OFF into space.

 160 THE TORPEDO TUBE 160 
                   Riker reaches the opening to the torpedo tube, bends
                   down and opens the hatch. Borg phaser shots hitting
                   all around him. The open hatch cover provides some
                   protection from the Borg fire.

 RIKER                              Worf! I'm going to need at least
                             five minutes!

 WORF                              Understood!

                   Worf and his team lie down on the hull and begin
                   exchanging fire with the approaching mass of Borg.

                   They pick off a few Borg, who also go FLYING into
                   space. As Riker begins to work...

                   Picard, Geordi making final adjustments to the control
                   panels. Both are wearing 21st century communications
                   headsets. Picard exchanges a look with Geordi.

 PICARD                              Ready to make a little history?

 GEORDI                              Always am.

 PICARD                              Phoenix to control.

 164 INT. CONTROL ROOM 164 
                   Lange and the other N.D.s watching the countdown.
                   Suddenly a console BUZZES. Lange goes to the monitor
                   seen earlier, hits a switch -- the monitor comes alive,
                   shows that Ruby is now standing outside at the hatch.
                   Lange reacts in surprise.

                   Picard and Geordi working the controls, watching the
                   readings, etc. We hear Lange's com voice:

 LANGE'S COM VOICE                              Phoenix, we have a problem out
                             here. There's a woman at the
                             outer hatch... says her name's
                             Ruby Sloan and she wants to see
                             the Captain.

                   Picard and Geordi react -- her timing is pretty bad.

 LANGE'S COM VOICE                              What do you want me to do, sir?

 GEORDI                              We can't let her in... she'll see
                             Cochrane isn't making the flight.

 PICARD                              We can't leave her out there.
                             When the ship launches... she'll
                             be killed.

 GEORDI                              Tell her to go back to
                             Resurrection.

 PICARD                              She's a very... determined woman.

 166 EXT. MISSILE SILO - DAY 166 
                   Ruby standing by the hatch, trying to look calm...
                   Scrimm and three Militia Soldiers holding her at
                   gunpoint. The hatch hisses and POPS OPEN. Scrimm
                   shoves a gun into Ruby's side -- get going. As they
                   start to crawl inside...

 167 INT. CONTROL ROOM 167 
                   Lange and the other N.D.s have focused their attention
                   on the countdown. Ruby climbs down the ladder, a tense
                   look on her face.

 LANGE                              Ms. Sloane, if you'll have a seat,
                             I'll let you talk to --

                   Suddenly, the three heavily-armed militia soldiers jump
                   down the ladder from the hatch. One of the Starfleet
                   N.D.s goes for a phaser, and a soldier BLASTS him
                   backward with a spray of bullets from his automatic
                   weapon. Everyone else freezes. A tense beat, then
                   Scrimm climbs down the ladder and looks around the
                   room...

 CUT TO: 
 168 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE - BATTLE ON THE HULL 168 
                   Riker in the torpedo tube, frantically working. He
                   begins to physically MOVE the torpedo tube itself like
                   he's moving the barrel of a huge cannon... as he
                   struggles to aim it toward the huge deflector dish...

 169 WORF AND THE SECURITY GUARDS 169 
                   are about fifty feet away from Riker. From their prone
                   positions, they try to keep the Borg at bay, BLASTING
                   them off the hull one by one. They have taken cover
                   behind some outcroppings of equipment on the hull of
                   the ship. The Borg have to cross an open field of
                   metal to get to them, making then easy targets.

                   Suddenly the Borg change tactics. From the deflector
                   dish high above them, Borg begin LAUNCHING THEMSELVES
                   directly at the Starfleet Officers, jumping off the
                   dish and flying through the vacuum of space like
                   paratroopers. This tips the balance. There are too
                   many targets to defend from above and below. One of
                   the flying Borg CRASHES into a Security Guard and a
                   vicious hand-to-hand FIGHT erupts. The Borg SLASHES
                   the guard's pressure suit, which DEPRESSURIZES killing
                   the man instantly. Worf FIRES  a phaser blast into the
                   Borg, knocking him off the hull and into space.

                   Worf turns to Riker.

 WORF                              Commander, you're five minutes are
                             up!

 170 RIKER 170 
                   swings the torpedo tube into place, aiming it at the
                   deflector dish. He hits a control on the side of the
                   tube... and a QUANTUM TORPEDO automatically slides up
                   from below and LOCKS INTO position in the tube, like a
                   panel on the torpedo and begins working on the
                   circuitry.

 171 INT. BRIDGE 171 
                   Troi in command, watching the VIEWSCREEN, which shows
                   a different angle of the battle on the hull.

 COM OFFICER                              The Borg are charging the subspace
                             emitters.

 TROI                              How long until they can send a

                   The Sergeant is examining one of the monitors. The

 SERGEANT                              No good, sir. They're on internal

                             from here.

 SCRIMM                                      (re: blast doors)
                             What about these doors?

 PRIVATE                              They're locked down tight from the

 SERGEANT                              And those doors were made to
                             withstand a nuclear attack.

                   Scrimm looks frustrated for a moment...then turns his
                   attention to Ruby.

 GEORDI                              One minute to launch.

 SCRIMM'S COM VOICE                              Mister Picard... this is
                             Lieutenant Scrimm. I'm going to
                             have to insist that you shut down
                             the launch. You see, I know what
                             you're doing... and I'm not going
                             to just stand by and let it
                             happen.

                             who'll be first.

                   As Picard reacts in shock...

 INTERCUT: 
 175 INT. CONTROL ROOM 175 
                   Scrimm is now holding Ruby by the arm. He shoves the
                   com headset to her mouth.

 SCRIMM                              Say hello...

                   Ruby is scared, but trying to keep it together.

                             Launch the ship.

                   Picard reacts to her voice, but keeps working the
                   controls, trying to concentrate. Scrimm draws his gun.

 SCRIMM                              Go ahead -- launch it. Ruby will
                             be here when you get back... but
                             she won't have a whole lot to say.

 176 INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT 176 
                   Geordi and Picard exchange a tense look. Picard
                   struggles. It's a difficult moment -- what does he do?
                   The countdown clock is approaching 15 seconds...14...
 13... 
                   Everything hangs in the balance -- Ruby's life, the
                   future of the Earth, Picard's feelings, his duty...

                   Finally, Picard reaches out hits a control -- the
                   countdown clock stops at 11 seconds.

 GEORDI                              Captain --

                             This is Picard. I've suspended
                             the launch sequence.

 SCRIMM'S COM VOICE                              Thanks. Now, why don't you join
                             us and we'll have a little talk?

                   Picard unstraps himself and takes off the headset.

 GEORDI                              Captain... we've got less than ten
                             minutes before that Vulcan ship
                             leaves the system. We've got to
                             go now.

 PICARD                              It'll have to wait. Come on.

                   Geordi quickly starts unstrapping himself...

 177 INT. MISSILE SILO - CATWALK 177 
                   Picard and Geordi stop outside the massive blast doors,
                   which are separating them from the control room.

 PICARD                              Geordi, can you see into the room?

                   Geordi looks at the blast doors... and he does so, the
                   electronic PUPILS in his eyes rotate, change shape and
                   color.

 GEORDI                              No... the door's too thick.

 PICARD                                      (frustrated)
                             Then we'll just have to assume
                             it's still there...

 GEORDI                              What's still there?

 PICARD                              Get a tricorder. You're going to
                             have to track my exact position in
                             that room...

                   Geordi moves off. Clearly, Picard has a plan...

                   Riker finishes working on the torpedo... he closes the
                   panel... turns and reaches for the fire control
                   mechanism. She glances up -- there's a BORG flying
                   through space directly at him! Riker tries to bring up
                   his phaser, but it's too late. The Borg SLAMS into
                   him.

                   Riker makes a desperate grab for the torpedo tube itself,
                   trying to hold on, but the momentum of the Borg impact
                   is too great -- they both tumble off into space together,
                   away from the ship.

                   As the tractor beam from the Enterprise SPLITS in two
                   and separates Riker from the Borg. The second beam

                   He shoves his gun against Ruby's head. The tension

                             And you know all this... because
                             you're a space-man too...

 PICARD                              I'm afraid you've caught me. I am
                             a space-man.

                   Scrimm smirks at him -- what gall this guy has. But
                   Ruby seems to discern some deeper meaning in Picard's
                   words. She frowns in puzzlement.

                             Truth... he's telling the truth...

                   Picard looks at Ruby, and at that moment something on
                   a console behind her catches his eye: a LIGHT on
                   Beverly's SURGICAL TRANSPORTER is now FLASHING. No one
                   else notices.

 SCRIMM                              You're an entertaining man, Mister
                             Picard. But you're also full of
                             shit.

                   Scrimm cocks back the hammer on the pistol he's holding
                   to Ruby's head. The following happens very quickly:

                   -- Picard reaches out his hand, trying to stop Scrimm.

 PICARD                              Now, Geordi!

                   -- The gun in Scrimm's hand DEMATERIALIZES. Scrimm
                   reacts in shock.

                   -- Instantly, the gun REMATERIALIZES in Picard's
                   outstretched hand. He quickly pushes the barrel to
                   Scrimm's forehead.

 PICARD                              Actually, you're full of shit.

                   Everyone is in the room stunned by what's happened.
                   Picard takes charge before anyone can recover.

 PICARD                                      (continuing)
                             Now, tell your men to drop their
                             weapons.

                   There's a beat, but then Scrimm sees he has little
                   choice.

 SCRIMM                              Weapons... down.

                   The other militia soldiers drop their weapons, which
                   are quickly picked up by Beverly and a Starfleet N.D.
                   Picard hands his gun to Lange, who covers Scrimm with
                   it.

                   Ruby turns to Picard.

 PICARD                              Are you all --

                   Ruby throws her arms around him and pulls him close.
                   He hugs her back, grateful she's alive. Ruby pulls
                   away.

 RUBY                              I think you have a plane to catch.

                   Picard smiles and heads back toward the Phoenix...

                   hair targeting display. He activates the monitor,
                   which begins tracking over toward the deflector dish.

 198 INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT 198 
                   Picard and Geordi's hands are flying across the
                   controls...

 199 EXT. SPACE - RIKER 199 
                   clamps a conduit into a power junction... then grabs
                   hold of a rotating lever inside the tube and TURNS it.
                   He ducks out of the way as the torpedo is LAUNCHED with
                   a ROAR.

 200 WIDER 200 
                   As the torpedo streaks out from the saucer section and
                   slams into the deflector dish. The dish EXPLODES in a
                   burst of FLAME... blowing away the Borg who were
                   working on it...

 201 INT. MISSSILE SILO - PHOENIX ENGINES 201 
                   As they IGNITE and start pouring out sheets of FLAME.

 202 INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT 202 
                   which is shuddering and shaking...

             203   EXT. SPACE - RIKER & WORF                                  203

                   React with smiles. They did it.

 204 INT. BRIDGE 204 
                   Troi and the other N.D.s react with relief. The
                   countdown on the monitors are stopped at 00:03.

 205 EXT. MONTANA - MISSILE SILO - WIDE SHOT - DAY 205 
                   as the concrete missile doors slide open and the
                   Phoenix is LAUNCHED up into the sky, riding a pillar of
                   fire and smoke. This is our first real look at the
                   ship and it resembles an oversized ICBM with a
                   specialized cockpit on top.

 206 INT. MISSILE SILO - CONTROL ROOM 206 
                   Lange and the other N.D.s have the militia soldiers
                   under guard. Ruby is watching the missile launch on a
                   video monitor. She smiles.

 207 INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT 207 
                   Picard and Geordi working the controls as the ship
                   bounces and shakes.

                   The g-forces push them back into their seats.

 GEORDI                              Solid rocket fuel at twenty-five

 PICARD                              Altitude fifty kilometers...

 GEORDI                              Entering the upper ionospere...

 PICARD                              There's a red light on the second
                             intake valve.

 GEORDI                              Ignore it. We'll be fine.
                                     (beat)
                             Prepare for first stage shut-down

                   As before.

 GEORDI                              Three... two... one... mark!

 210 EXT. SPACE - THE PHOENIX 210 
                   The rocket booster SHUTS DOWN as the ship leaves
                   Earth's orbit and coasts on its momentum. After a
                   beat, the first stage booster separates from the ship
                   and DROPS AWAY, leaving three-quarters of the ship in
                   space.

 211 INT. BORG HIVE 211 
                   CLOSE ON DATA, head tilted back, eyes closed,
                   smiling...a few droplets of WATER fall from above onto
                   his face. He smiles wider, reveling in the sensation.

 212 WIDER 212 
                   Data is still restrained on the table, but a conduit
                   has been placed above his head and is dripping
                   condensation onto his face. Data is now a completely
                   new being. His entire BODY is now made of HUMAN FLESH.
                   It's a shocking sight -- for anyone who ever wondered
                   what Data would look like human, we're now getting our
                   first look.

 213 THE BORG QUEEN 213 
                   DESCENDS from her nest in the ceiling. She watches
                   Data for a moment... rubs the moisture into his face.

 BORG QUEEN                              A Borg in all but name.

                   Data, although clearly enraptured with his new
                   sensations and feelings still struggles to maintain
                   his own sense of identity.

 DATA                                      (weak)
                             I am... grateful for what you have
                             given me. But I still do not wish
                             to be assimilated.

 BORG QUEEN                              A universe of sensation is waiting
                             for you... don't you want to
                             explore it... with me?

                   To his surprise, Data finds that he is becoming drawn
                   to this strange creature and all that she can offer
                   him.

 DATA                              Yes...

 BORG QUEEN                              Then take the final step... give
                             me the Enterprise... and we can be
                             together... always.

                   He struggles, but ultimately there's only one answer.

 DATA                              No... I cannot.

                   Without taking her eyes away from Data, she reaches out
                   a hand and touches a control on a nearby console. The
                   color of Data's FACE turns an ASHEN GRAY --  as though
                   the blood has drained from his skin. Another droplet
                   of moisture falls and hits him on the cheek -- but this
                   time his eyes widen in shock.

                   The sensation of human feeling is gone.

 BORG QUEEN                              I've deactivated the sensory
                             inputs. That flesh on your body
                             is just meat, now.

 DATA                              No... no, please... you cannot...

                   She moves in close on him, an edge creeping into her
                   voice:

 BORG QUEEN                              You must give me what I want...
                             now. Without the deflector dish,
                             we can no longer send for an early
                             invasion. We must assimilate
                             Earth ourselves. I need this
                             ship.

                   She hits the control, and the COLOR returns to his
                   face. Data gasps -- filled with feeling once again.
                   The Borg Queen runs her hand across his cheek -- her
                   attitude seductive and affectionate once again.

 BORG QUEEN                              Isn't it better like this...?

 DATA                              Yes... but the Enterprise... my
                             duty...

 BORG QUEEN                              ... is to yourself. Don't make me
                             hurt you again...

                   She touches the control again. Data is shocked back
                   into his cold, android self. He's like a heroin addict
                   being denied his "high" with the flick of a switch.

 DATA                              No... no, it's so... empty...
                             please... give it back... I need
                             it...

 BORG QUEEN                              And I need to control this ship.
                             Let me into your mind.

                   Data struggles, anguished... we've never seen him like
                   this before... completely beaten down... finally, he
                   nods. The Borg Queen touches the control again. A
                   sharp intake of breath as the feeling returns to Data.
                   And the Queen kisses him on the mouth.

                   This time, he responds eagerly, throwing himself into
                   the emotion of the moment. She pulls back a little,
                   looks at him softly, passionately. Data stares back at
                   her, breathless -- he seems to be completely in her
                   thrall.

 DATA                              In order to access my neural
                             net... you will need to create a
                             positronic interface.
                                     (beat)
                             I will tell you how.

                   OFF the Borg Queen's smile of victory...

 CUT TO: 
 214 INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT 214 
                   As before. Picard and Geordi work the control in
                   silence for a few moments. The ship is floating in
                   space, now a good distance from Earth.

 GEORDI                              Ready to deploy the warp nacelles.

 PICARD                              As they used to say... all systems
                             are go.

                   Geordi works his console...

 215 EXT. SPACE - THE PHOENIX 215 
                   Two fifty-foot long sheets of metal fall away from the
                   ship on either side of the Phoenix, revealing primitive
                   WARP NACELLES tucked inside the craft. The warp
                   nacelles then begin slowly extending themselves outward
                   on either side -- the basic designs of the nacelles
                   should be familiar to anyone who's ever seen a STAR
                   TREK starship.

                   This is the beginning of a long-standing architectural
                   design element of our ships.

 216 INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT 216 
                   As before.

 GEORDI                              The Vulcans should be out there
                             right now. We need to break the
                             warp barrier in the next five
                             minutes if we're going to get
                             their attention.

 PICARD                              Bring the warp core on-line. I'll
                             lay in a heading.

 GEORDI                              The nacelles are charged...
                             nuclear warhead standing by.
                             We're ready to ignite the warp
                             drive.

 PICARD                              Engage.

 217 EXT. SPACE - THE PHOENIX 217 
                   The warp nacelles FLARE with power and the ship begins
                   moving forward in space.

 218 INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT 218 
                   They're SLAMMED BACK into their seats from the massive
                   G-forces.

 GEORDI                              Warp field looks good...
                             structural integrity holding...

                   Picard activates a monitor which begins showing a 
                   digital display of their speed.

 PICARD                                      (off monitor)
                             Speed... twenty thousand
                             kilometers per second.

 219 EXT. SPACE - THE PHOENIX 219 
                   The ship is going faster... faster...

 220 INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE 220 
                   Troi is standing outside the emergency airlock with the
                   Ensign, who is working the wall panel.

                   The airlock door OPENS after a beat, and Riker, Worf
                   and One Security Guard ENTER. They're exhausted after
                   the pitched battle. Troi smiles at them as they remove
                   their helmets.

 TROI                              I have to admit there was a moment
                             there when --

 RIKER                                      (holds up a hand)
                             Hold that thought.

                   He turns away and then doubles over behind a console
                   and begins vomiting off screen. Worf shrugs.

 WORF                              Strong heart. Weak stomach.

                   A light beat, and then suddenly the entire Bridge GOES
                   DARK -- ALL POWER GONE. Console, monitors, everything.

 RIKER                              Report!

 WORF                              We've lost Bridge control!
 RIKER                              Emergency override!

 WORF                                      (works)
                             Nothing.

 221 INT. BORG HIVE 221 
                   The Borg Queen is floating in the middle of the room,
                   surrounded by Borg consoles and technology. Data is
                   still on the table, with some kind of specialized
                   conduit connecting his head to a group of monitors,
                   which are inactive at the moment. He appears to be
                   caught up in the rapture of his new sensations, and his
                   personal connection to the Borg Queen. All thought of
                   his Starfleet responsibilities are gone.

 DATA                                      (to Queen)
                             I am re-routing Bridge command
                             functions to this location.

                   Data thinks for a moment, and the monitors suddenly
                   COME TO LIFE and the equipment around the Queen HUMS
                   with POWER.

                   Information about critical Enterprise systems flows
                   across the monitor screens -- we might recognize
                   graphics from the Bridge displays. The Borg are now in
                   control.

 BORG QUEEN                              Eliminate their remaining
                             defenses. I will send Borg to
                             assimilate the rest of the crew.

                   Data nods... but then one of the consoles BEEPS.

 DATA                                      (reacts)
                             There is a perimeter alert. A
                             ship has entered sensor range.
 BORG QUEEN                              Vulcan?

 DATA                              No.

                   Data tilts his head and --

 222 A MONITOR 222 
                   shows an exterior space shot. The image rapidly ZOOMS
                   IN on the distant PHOENIX. The ship is racing through
                   space.

 BORG QUEEN                                      (reacts, to Data)
                             Give me helm control.

                   Data nods. Another console lights up. She moves to
                   work it herself...

 223 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE 223 
                   As the ship turns and begins moving off at impulse
                   speed.

 224 INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT 224 
                   As before, Picard is now steering the ship with a 21st
                   century JOYSTICK CONTROL. The ship is moving faster
                   and faster, trembling now, a ROAR building.

 PICARD                              Passing one-half light speed. The
                             starboard nacelle's running a
                             little hot...

 GEORDI                              I'm on it...

                   The CABIN shakes a little.

 GEORDI                              The inertial dampers are having
                             trouble compensating... I don't
                             think Cochrane built this thing
                             for comfort.

 PICARD                              Speed -- two hundred, seventy-five
                             thousand kilometers per second.

                   WHOOSH! A weird DISTORTION passes through the cabin
                   like a wave, then vanishes.

 GEORDI                              There's no temporal shielding in
                             here! We're starting to pick up
                             relativistic effects!

 PICARD                              One minute to warp threshold...

 225 EXT. SPACE 225 
                   The warp ship WHIPS by... and then a moment later, the
                   ENTERPRISE ROARS into view, chasing the tiny ship.

 226 INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT 226 
                   Geordi glances out the window... does a double-take and
                   looks back up in surprise...

 GEORDI                              Captain, the Enterprise!

 PICARD                                      (taps combadge)
                             Picard to Enterprise.
                                     (beat)
                             Picard to Enterprise -- do you
                             read me?

                   No response.

 PICARD                              Their com system must still be
                             down.

 GEORDI                              Well, I feel a whole lot better
                             with them out there. We may need
                             some help.

 227 INT. BORG HIVE 227 
                   As before, the Queen floating above the helm control
                   console. The warp ship is on the monitor, getting
                   closer.

 DATA                              I have repaired the weapons array.
                             Phasers are on-line.

                   A floating CROSSHAIR appears on the monitor showing the
                   warp ship. The Queen works the console. The crosshair
                   moves, but refuses to lock onto the warp ship. She
                   frowns.

 BORG QUEEN                              The targeting lock isn't working.

                   Data looks puzzled.

 DATA                              I do not understand. The optical
                             data network has been repaired,
                             and all systems are functioning.

                   The Queen works furiously, still can't get the
                   crosshairs to lock onto the ship.

 BORG QUEEN                              Your diagnostics are in error. I
                             need weapons.

 DATA                                      (thinks)
                             The problem must lie in the
                             interface between Starfleet and
                             Borg technology. Your console may
                             not be configured to handle the
                             data flow.
 BORG QUEEN                              Can you configure it?

 DATA                              I believe so.

 BORG QUEEN                              Do it.

                   She hits a series of Borg controls on a nearby
                   console... and the restraints holding Data to the table
                   are RELEASED. Two Borg drones move to him... as he
                   stands up and heads for the Queen, the specialized
                   cable still attached to his head...

 228 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE 228 
                   closing in on the tiny warp ship. It's like a shark
                   chasing a guppy.

 229 INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT 229 
                   Ship SHAKING with power and acceleration.

 PICARD                              Approaching light speed...

                   Geordi glances out a side window.

 GEORDI                              They're getting awfully close...
                             what the hell are they doing?
 PICARD                              We're crossing the threshold!

                   The ship is really SHAKING HARD now -- and the
                   compartment is DISTORTING slightly, stretching,
                   everything becoming elongated...

 230 EXT. SPACE - THE PHOENIX 230 
                   The ship is STRETCHING in the familiar "rubber band
                   effect" that tells us a ship is going into warp... but
                   this effect is much slower. It's on the verge of
                   hitting warp speed. The Enterprise still on their
                   tail.

 231 INT. BORG HIVE 231 
                   Data is standing right next to the Queen, and is
                   studying the Borg console intently. Two Borg drones
                   stand nearby, watching closely.

 DATA                              I believe I see the problem.

                   In the blink of an eye:

 -- DATA WHIRLS AROUND AND SLAMS AN ARM INTO ONE OF THE                    BORG DRONES. The drone is knocked off its feet.

                   -- The second Borg rushes at Data, swings his arm at
                   Data's head. This is the same Borg with the deadly
                   stiletto-tipped DRILL SPIKES seen earlier. The spikes
                   TEAR into the flesh of Data's neck, drawing BLOOD.

                   -- Data reacts in pain. He GRABS the Borg's arm and
                   with android strength KICKS HIM IN THE CHEST at the
                   same time. The Borg FLIES BACKWARD, causing the
                   cybernetic ARM to RIP from its socket in a shower of
                   sparks.

                   -- The Borg Queen SWOOPS down at Data for the kill.
                   But Data's too quick for her. With one swift motion,
                   he turns and THROWS the BORG ARM like a JAVELIN across
                   the room.

 232 NEW ANGLE 232 
                   As the spikes on the severed Borg arm PUNCTURE one of
                   the diathermic oxygen tanks seen earlier. A HUGE
                   EXPLOSION of DEADLY GAS bursts out of the ruptured
                   tank. The WALL of roiling gas sweeps through the
                   entire Borg Hive.

 BORG QUEEN                                      (screams)
                             No!

                   She lunges at Data just as the gas envelopes them!

 233 EXT. SPACE - THE PHOENIX 233 
                   As it GOES INTO WARP -- it shoots forward and streaks
                   away from the Enterprise!

 234 INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT 234 
                   As Picard and Geordi are slammed back into their seats
                   and the stars WHIP PAST the windows in the familiar
                   warp effect.

 235 INT. BORG HIVE 235 
                   Data and the Borg Queen tearing and clawing at each 
                   other amongst the spewing gas. The Borg drones try to
                   get away, but they are SWALLOWED by the rush of gas,
                   fall to the deck, twitching in pain.

                   Data and the Borg Queen both fall to the deck,
                   grappling with each other.

 236 EXT. SPACE - THE WARP SHIP 236 
                   As it STREAKS PAST -- the warp ship flying at top
                   speed.

 237 INT. BORG HIVE 237 
                   Data and the Borg Queen struggling against each
                   other... the gas swirling around their bodies... and as
                   it does, we see the FLESH on their bodies start to
                   LIQUEFY and MELT AWAY in a horrific ooze of blood and
                   skin.

 238 INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT 238 
                   As before, but the ride has smoothed out considerably,
                   Warp stars streaking by.

 PICARD                              Bring us about...

                   A beat as Geordi works.

 GEORDI                              Dropping out of warp.

                   Out the front windows, the warp stars STOP... the ship
                   JOLTS slightly... turns to the left... Earth can be
                   seen in the distance.

                   They smile. It's a moment of victory.

 PICARD                              Let's begin the landing procedure.

 239 INT. CARGO BAY/BORG HIVE 239 
                   The onrush of gas is gone. But it has affected every
                   surface of the room like an acid wash. Every piece of
                   Borg machinery is smoking and hissing. The two Borg
                   drones are lying on the floor, dead -- all organic
                   matter and flesh have been dissolved from their bodies,
                   leaving only raw mechanical skeletons.

 MOVE TO REVEAL: 
 240 DATA AND THE BORG QUEEN 240 
                   lying on the floor, still locked together. Data is a
                   shocking image: all of his human flesh has been
                   STRIPPED AWAY, leaving only his pure android self. His
                   metallic skull gleams in the dim light... even his eyes
                   are gone. His mechanical left arm is still intact, but
                   the right human arm is completely gone. His torso is
                   stripped of the human flesh, leaving pure android with
                   no soft human touches. Data as we've never seen him
                   before -- raw and mechanistic.

                   Data rolls over... still locked around him is the
                   MECHANICAL SKELETON of the Borg Queen. A metallic
                   spinal column with two arms with clawed hands leading
                   off it... and a blinking, electronic BRAIN STEM at the
                   very top of the spine.

                   Data throws off the grotesque form. The Borg Queen
                   carcass writhes and claws at the air. She speaks in a
                   flat, mechanical voice.

 BORG QUEEN                                      (fritzed)
                             Data...

                   Data reaches out with one hand... grabs the metal
                   spinal column just below the brain stem... and SNAPS IT
                   IN TWO. The blinking brain stem FRITZES OUT.

 241 INT. CORRIDOR 241 
                   Two Borg Drones moving down the hall suddenly stop...
                   twitch... the blinkies on their bodies GO OUT... and
                   they both FALL OVER DEAD. Their connection to their
                   Queen severed.

 242 INT. JEFFERIES TUBE 242 
                   Another Borg Drone reacts... lights out... slumps over
 DEAD. 
 243 INT. BORG HIVE 243 
                   Data releases the remains of the dead Borg Queen. He
                   leans back a little, as though exhausted by his
                   remarkable experience. CAMERA PULLS BACK, emphasizing
                   the loneliness of this smoking, scorched android
                   sitting alone in the ruins of the Borg Hive...

 CUT TO: 
 244 EXT. MISSILE SILO - DAY 244 
                   The missile doors now open, the ground badly scorched
                   from the launch. Scrimm and his militia guards are
                   sitting on the ground, while Lange and the other
                   Starfleet N.D. keep a watchful eye on them. Cochrane
                   is sitting against a rock, while Beverly checks him
                   over. Ruby is pacing, lost in thought...

 PICARD'S VOICE                              Isn't anyone going to say welcome
                             back?

                   Everyone looks up to see --

 245 PICARD AND GEORDI 245 
                   standing a few feet away, tired but triumphant.

 BEVERLY                              Did it work?

                   Picard nods. Beverly, Lange and the N.D. look
                   relieved. Ruby takes a few steps toward Picard.

 246 COCHRANE 246 
                   smiles up at Geordi.

 COCHRANE                              Mister La Forge... now I'd like to
                             shake your hand.

                   Geordi smiles and walks over to him.

 247 PICARD AND RUBY 247 
                   stop a few feet away from each other, their eyes
                   locked. They drink in sight of each other...
                   there's an undercurrent of unspoken feelings and words.
                   She smiles... he smiles back. A satisfying moment.

 PICARD (V.O.)                              Captain's log, March 3rd, 2063.
                             The voyage of the Phoenix was a
                             success... again.

 CUT TO: 
 248 EXT. RESURRECTION CITY - NIGHT 248 
                   Townspeople along the Main Street. A sense of
                   urgency -- something's going on.

 PICARD (V.O.)                              And it appears the Vulcan ship has
                             detected the warp signature and is
                             now on its way to Earth.

                   Suddenly something in the night sky catches their
                   attention. A BRIGHT LIGHT is moving down towards the
                   city. We now realize this is what people are reacting
                   to...

 249 JUST OUTSIDE OF TOWN 249 
                   Just a hundred yards beyond the city limits we see the
                   massive VULCAN SCOUT SHIP SETTLING down onto the
                   ground. Dust flying everywhere. Windmill blades
                   spinning wildly from the exhaust.

 250 THE TOWNSPEOPLE 250 
                   squinting into the wind, trying to make out what's
                   happening...

 251 NEW ANGLE - ON A HILLTOP 251 
                   A good distance away, but with a good view of the
                   entire scene. Riker, Worf, Beverly, Troi and Geordi
                   watching from a distance as the Vulcan ship LANDS.

 252 JUST OUTSIDE OF TOWN 252                    Picard, Ruby and a bandaged, but much healthier Zephram
                   Cochrane watching the landing. People from town are
                   surging around them. Everyone is shocked and amazed at
                   what they're seeing. Picard watches with satisfaction --
                   this is the moment he's been waiting for.

                   Cochrane and Ruby are particularly awestruck.

 253 THE VULCAN SHIP 253 
                   settles, engines whining down... dust settling.
 254 PICARD 254 
                   moves to Cochrane, takes him gently by the arm.

 PICARD                              Doctor Cochrane... this is your
                             moment.

                   Cochrane looks a little bewildered, tries to grapple
                   with the moment.

 COCHRANE                              My God... they're really from
                             another world?

 PICARD                              That's right. And they're going
                             to want to meet the man who flew
                             that warp ship.

                   Cochrane looks at him.

 COCHRANE                              And that's supposed to be me...

 PICARD                              Zephram, you had the vision to
                             build that ship when no one else
                             on this planet could see beyond
                             their own problems.
                                     (beat)
                             You flew that ship... all I did
                             was push a few buttons.

                   Cochrane looks at him for a moment... takes a breath,
                   nods...

 COCHRANE                              All right.
                                     (beat)
                             And don't worry -- I'll keep your
                             secret.

                   They hear a mechanical WHIRR and a HISS of air.

 255 NEW ANGLE 255 
                   as a HATCH opens on the Vulcan ship. The townspeople
                   behind them react with shock and fear... a few people
                   take a step back. Picard looks at Cochrane, who
                   hesitates for a moment... then finally takes a deep
                   breath... and strides out toward the alien ship. A man
                   alone about to change the course of human history.

                   Ruby moves closer to Picard and puts her arm around
                   him... and he puts his arm around her.

 256 HILLTOP 256 
                   As the rest of our crew is enraptured by the moment...
                   they glance at each other with excitement as they watch
                   history unfold...

 257 VULCAN SHIP 257 
                   Cochrane stops a few feet away from the ship as the
                   hatch swings completely open... light streams out into
                   the night air... and THREE HOODED, ROBED FIGURES
                   EMERGE. They stand across from Cochrane -- a moment
                   frozen in time.

 258 THE TOWNSPEOPLE 258 
                   watching in awe...

 259 PICARD AND RUBY 259 
                   watching...

 260 THE LEAD VULCAN 260 
                   pulls his hood back, revealing the familiar slanted
                   eyebrows and pointed ears, holding himself with that
                   austere, regal dignity we've come to associate with his
                   race. He steps forward to greet Cochrane... raises his
                   hand as if to wave.

                   Cochrane raises his hand automatically, as if to wave
                   in return...

                   But then the Vulcan splits his fingers in the classic
                   Vulcan greeting.

 VULCAN                              Live Long and Prosper.

                   Cochrane tries to emulate the Vulcan hand-sign...but
                   can't quite do the awkward finger-split.

 COCHRANE                              Um... thanks.

                   The Vulcan cocks an eyebrow at him. The very first
                   Alien-Human relationship is underway...

 261 PICARD AND RUBY 261 
                   are now surrounded by townspeople, who are watching the
                   scene unfold...

 262 HILLTOP 262 
                   Our heroes share a glance with each other and smile,
                   Riker taps his combadge.

 RIKER                              Riker to Enterprise. Five to beam
                             up.

                   The crew DEMATERIALIZES...

 263 PICARD AND RUBY 263 
                   have now moved away from the crowd... no one paying
                   attention to them. The bright lights from the Vulcan
                   ship cast them in a dramatic silhouette. Picard turns
                   to Ruby. It's the moment he's been dreading. This is
                   goodbye. She looks at him.

 RUBY                              You're leaving, aren't you?

 PICARD                              I have to...

 RUBY                              Where? And don't tell me San
                             Francisco...

 PICARD                              No. It's a lot further than that.

 RUBY                              It's the future, isn't it? Just
                             like you told Scrimm.
                                     (beat)
                             I knew you weren't from around
                             here.

 PICARD                                      (with humor)
                             No... I'm from France.

 RUBY                              I don't care if you're from France
                             or Venus... just take me with you.

 PICARD                              That's impossible.

 RUBY                              Why?

 PICARD                              This may be hard for you to
                             understand... but I'm duty-bound
                             not to interfere with you, or
                             anyone else here... any more than
                             is absolutely necessary.

 RUBY                              You've been interfering with my
                             life ever since I met you.
                                     (with meaning)
                             Don't stop now.

                   Picard struggles... he doesn't want to do this, but
                   he's torn between his heart and his duty.

 PICARD                              Ruby... I'm sorry.
                                     (remembering his words
                                      to Beverly)
                             But our fates lie along different
                             paths.

                   A long, difficult moment... then he lets her go...
                   turns and starts walking off into the night. She
                   stands where she is, watching him go with tears in her
                   eyes...

                   Picard hits his combadge.

 PICARD                              Picard to Enterprise. One to...

                   He stops where he is.

 RIKER'S COM VOICE                              Riker here. Captain, we didn't
                             get your whole transmission.

                   Picard turns, looks back at Ruby. Their eyes meet...
                   and he makes the decision.

 PICARD                              To hell with fate.

 RIKER'S COM VOICE                              Say again, Captain?

                   He starts walking towards her. She sees him coming...
                   starts running to him. She throws herself into his
                   arms and he holds her close. They kiss. A magical
                   moment, then...

 PICARD                              Enterprise. Two to beam up.

                   They DEMATERIALIZE holding each other tight...

 264 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE 264 
                   moving out of Earth orbit...

 265 INT. BRIDGE 265 
                   Riker, Worf, Troi, N.D.s. Picard ENTERS with Ruby.
                   Everyone reacts to seeing her there. Ruby stays in the
                   Turbolift, staring around the Bridge in amazement.
                   Picard takes her hand and leads her out onto the
                   Bridge.

 PICARD                              How's Mister Data?

                   Riker glances at Ruby uneasily.

 RIKER                              He's in Sickbay. Doctor Crusher
                             says he can be repaired... but we
                             have to wait until we...

                   He glances at Ruby again, awkward. But Picard finishes
                   his thought.

 PICARD                              Return to our own time?

 RIKER                              Yes, sir.

 PICARD                              Then make it so. Have you
                             determined how to recreate the
                             temporal vortex?

                   Picard sits in his chair. Riker hesitates.

 RIKER                              Yes, sir. But Captain... are
                             we... all going back?

 PICARD                              Unless you'd like to stay.
 RIKER                              No, sir.

                   Ruby stands stock-still, staring at Worf. Worf looks
                   up at her with a Klingon smile -- teeth and all.

                   Ruby manages a weak smile in return, then moves off to
                   stand next to Picard.

 RIKER                              Bridge to Engineering. Mister La
                             Forge... initiate the temporal
                             vortex.

 266 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE 266 
                   moving through space... and then the TEMPORAL VORTEX
                   forms directly ahead of it, as seen before. The ship
                   ENTERS the vortex...

 267 EXT. SPACE - THE 24TH CENTURY 267 
                   The Enterprise EXITS the VORTEX and into Earth orbit.

 268 INT. BRIDGE 268 
                   As before.

 WORF                              Incoming transmission from
                             Starfleet Command. Admiral Hayes.

 PICARD                              Onscreen.

 269 INCLUDE VIEWER 269 
                   Admiral Hayes appears.

 PICARD                              Admiral... what's the status of
                             the Borg fleet?

 ADMIRAL HAYES                              It's been destroyed. The Borg
                             threat is over.
                                     (beat)
                             Are you all right? The Enterprise
                             disappeared from our sensors for
                             a moment.

 PICARD                              We're fine, sir. It will take
                             some... time to explain.

 ADMIRAL HAYES                              I look forward to reading your
                             report.

                   The transmission ends. Ruby turns to Picard with
                   amazement.

 RUBY                              That makes two of us.

                   Picard gives her a gentle smile. OFF the moment...

 CUT TO: 
 270 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE 270 
                   The great ship entering a Starfleet SPACE DOCK.

 271 INT. BORG HIVE/ENVIROMENTAL CONTROL ROOM 271                    Geordi is directing a work crew of a dozen engineers,
                   as they clean up the room and repair the damage.

 GEORDI                                      (to a couple of N.D.s)
                             No, no -- we'll have to rip out
                             this entire bulkhead. We'll need
                             new bracing members for the deck
                             above and below.

                   The N.D.s move off, making notes on their PADDS.
                   Geordi turns and sees Data standing in the doorway.
                   He's now been fully restored to his original android
                   self.

 GEORDI                              Data...

                   Geordi moves to him, puts a hand on his shoulder.

 GEORDI                              You look good as new.

 DATA                              You could say that I'm back to my
                             old self.

 GEORDI                              That's great.

                   Geordi's smile fades a little as Data walks into the
                   room.

 DATA                              Her remains... are they still
                             here?

                   Geordi points over to a corner, where some N.D.s are
                   about to close a storage container. Data walks over.
                   Geordi goes with him. The N.D.s move aside, and Data
                   looks down into the storage container. The broken,
                   mangles pieces of machinery are all that's left of the
                   Borg Queen.

 GEORDI                              I'm sending them to the Daystrom
                             Institute for analysis.

                   Data stares down at the remains with a haunted look.

 DATA                              I never realized how powerful an
                             emotion temptation could be.

 GEORDI                              Temptation? You said in your
                             report it was all a ruse... you
                             were manipulating her.

                   A quiet beat.

 DATA                              She was... a unique lifeform. In
                             her own way... nearly perfect.

                   Geordi smiles a little.

 GEORDI                                      (joking)
                             It almost sounds like you miss
                             her.

                   Data looks up at him -- his expression unreadable.
                   Geordi's smile fades. Data reaches out, closes the lid
                   on the storage container, turns and walks out of the
                   room. Geordi watches him go, left to wonder what Data
                   is really feeling.

 CUT TO: 
 272 EXT. MONTANA - HILLTOP - DAY 272                    Picard and Ruby walk up the familiar hilltop, and when
                   they reach the crest, we reveal...

 273 A MOMENT 273 
                   A large memorial cordoned off by a chain. A PLAQUE on
                   the monument reads "On this spot, Man and Vulcan met
                   for the first time... and changed the course of
                   history. March 3rd, 2063."

 274 PICARD AND RUBY 274 
                   step into view. They stare at the sculpture for a
                   moment.

 PICARD                              Welcome home.

 275 WIDE SHOT 275 
                   Picard, Ruby and the monument are at the gates of
                   RESURRECTION CITY as it is in the 23rd century. This
                   is the place where man first reached out to the stars,
                   and the architecture has a distinctive uplifting

                   Shuttlecraft and aircars are taking off and landing.

 FADE IN: 
 1 EXT. SPACE (VFX-I) 1 
                   A vast and sparkling starfield. A pinpoint of LIGHT 
                   appears and starts moving toward the camera... a small 
                   and distant cylindrical object tumbling end over end, 
                   but we can't determine exactly what it is yet...

 2 EXT. WHEATFIELD - DAY 2 
                   A vast and undulating sea of wheat. We become aware 
                   that there are two HEADS sticking out of the stalks of 
                   wheat: two men are standing and looking up at the 
                   sky. As we move towards them,  we begin to hear their
                   conversation...and we can see that the two men are 
                   SCOTTY and CHEKOV, dressed in civilian clothing.

 CHEKOV                                      (points to sky)
                             There he is -- there, to the 
                             South!

 SCOTTY                                      (peers upward)
                             What are ye, blind? That's a 
                             bird.

                   As they stare up at the sky...

 3 EXT. SPACE (VFX-I) 3 
                   The cylinder tumbling through space is now closer, and 
                   we can now see that it is a BOTTLE of some sort, and it 
                   is tumbling directly toward the camera...

 4 EXT. WHEATFIELD- DAY 4 
                   As before, Chekov and Scotty staring at the sky.

 SCOTTY                                      (concerned)
                             Repelling the Crystalline 
                             Trench... rafting down lava 
                             flows... orbital skydiving. it's 
                             like the man is running a bloody 
                             decathlon across the galaxy.

                   Suddenly we hear a double SONIC BOOM.

 CHEKOV                                      (re: sound)
                             That should be him now. I think 
                             he's just crossed the sound 
                             barrier.

                   They shield their eyes against the sun and look up.

 5 EXT. SPACE (VFX-I) 5 
                   The bottle gets CLOSER...

 6 EXT. WHEATFIELD - DAY 6 
                   A man in a high-tech body harness and parachute LANDS 
                   in the wheat flat on his back. His body-suit is 
                   charred, scorched, wisps of smoke still curling off of
                   it. There are small thrusters attached to his backpack 
                   and boots. Scotty and Chekov move to him. The man 
                   removes his helmet. Revealing that it is KIRK. He 
                   smiles broadly, like a child who has just come off a
                   roller-coaster.

 KIRK                              Right on target! I jump out over 
                             the Arabian Peninsula... and I end 
                             up here, right on the dime.

                   Kirk gets to his feet.

 CHEKOV                              Actually, Captain, your precise 
                             target area was thirty-five 
                             meters...
                                     (points)
                             That way.
 KIRK                              Thanks for pointing that out.

                   Kirk starts to pull off his suit, reacts to a sudden 
                   pain in his back.

 KIRK                              Oh...

 SCOTTY                              I've warned ye about that back of 
                             yours. You should have a doctor 
                             take a look at it.

                   Kirk waves him away, and continues to remove his 
                   harness.

 6A EXT. SPACE (VFX-I) 6A 
                   The tumbling bottle rushes past, and we can now see 
                   that it is a CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE - Dom Perignon, 2265. 
                   Follow the bottle as it tumbles through space...

 6B EXT. WHEATFIELD - DAY 6B                    Kirk, Scotty and Chekov as before.

 KIRK                              Tomorrow I want to make a tri-
                             elliptical jump. That's where you 
                             jump out over Northern China, and 
                             make three complete orbits before 
                             you start re-entry...

 CHEKOV                              Captain. Perhaps you have 
                             forgotten that tomorrow is the 
                             christening ceremony.

                   This strikes a nerve with Kirk -- we see a flash of
                   hesitation and irritation cross his face.

 KIRK                              I'm not going.
                                     (beat) 
                             Scotty, help me with this chute.

 SCOTTY                              What do you mean, you're not 
                             going? We promised.

 KIRK                              When I retired, I swore I'd never 
                             set foot on a starship again, and 
                             I meant it.

 CHEKOV                              Captain...

 KIRK                                      (firm)
                             I don't want to hear anymore about 
                             it. I'm not going, and that's 
                             final.

 7 EXT. SPACE (VFX-I) 7 
                   The champagne bottle SMASHES onto the bow of a 
                   Federation starship(Excelsior class) sitting in its 
                   dock in orbit around Earth.

 7A EXT. SPACE (VFX-I) 7A 
                   FOLLOW the shards of glass from the bottle as they 
                   spread over the ship...revealing the name on the hull: 
 U.S.S. ENTERPRISE NCC-1701-B. 
 8 ANGLE ON SPACEDOCK WINDOW 8 
                   A large picture window overlooking the starship in its 
                   berth. The window is filled with people in Starfleet 
                   uniforms, applauding the christening of the ship (but 
                   we hear nothing).

 8A INT. SPACEDOCK OBSERVATION ROOM (VFX-I) 8A                    The people are still applauding and we can see that 
                   they are looking out over the ship in its berth.

 8B EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE-B IN SPACEDOCK (VFX-I) 8B 
                   The great ship sits in spacedock.

 9 INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE 9 
                   CLOSE ON A SET OF TURBOLIFT DOORS as they slide open to 
                   reveal Kirk, Scotty and Chekov. A bright light shines 
                   into their faces and they react. MOVE TO REVEAL -
                   that the bright light is coming from a futuristic
                   CAMERA with a small bank of lights attached to it. The 
                   camera is a holographic recorder with two lenses and is 
                   worn on an operator's head. There are four JOURNALISTS 
                   clustered in front of the Turbolift -- one associated 
                   with the camera, the others using PADDS to make 
                   notations.

                   Also clustered around the door are the BRIDGE CREW of 
                   the Enterprise-B. Everyone is APPLAUDING as Kirk and 
                   the others blink under the bright lights and ENTER the
                   Bridge.

 JOURNALISTS                                      (overlapping)
                             Captain Kirk, how does it feel 
                             to be back on the Enterprise 
                             Bridge... Captain, can I have a 
                             Minute... Captain Scott, do you 
                             have any comment on... Commander
                             Chekov... etc.

                   CAPTAIN JOHN HARRIMAN pushes through the crowd.

 HARRIMAN                              Excuse me, excuse me...there will 
                             be plenty of time for questions
                             later...

                   The journalists edge away, and the cameraman moves to 
                   get a good angle.

 HARRIMAN                                      (continuing, to all)
                             I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd 
                             like to welcome you all aboard.

 KIRK                              It's our pleasure.

                   Harriman is young, confident, eager -- this is his 
                   first command and he takes it very seriously.

 HARRIMAN                              I just want you to know how 
                             excited we all are to have a group 
                             of living legends with us on our 
                             maiden voyage. 
                                     (beat) 
                             I remember reading about your 
                             missions when I was in grade 
                             school.

                   The original Enterprise officers all stop and give him 
                   a look. Harriman looks a little embarrassed -- he 
                   didn't mean to insult them. But Kirk gives him a
                   little smile, lets it roll off. 
 KIRK                              Well... may we have a look around?

 HARRIMAN                              Please... please.

                   Chekov sees someone in the background, calls out to 
                   her.

 CHEKOV                              Demora!

                   Chekov moves off.

 JOURNALIST                                      (breezy)
                             So, Captain... this is the first 
                             Starship Enterprise in thirty 
                             years without James T. Kirk in 
                             command. How do you feel about 
                             that?

                   The Journalist has unknowingly touched a nerve. Kirk's 
                   eyes flash for a moment -- the longer he's on this 
                   Bridge, the more he realizes he doesn't feel good about 
                   it at all. He tries to shrug it off with a smile.
 KIRK                              Just fine. I'm glad to be here to 
                             send her on her way...

                   He tries to move away from the Journalist, who dogs 
                   him.

 JOURNALIST                              What have you been doing since you 
                             retired?

 KIRK                              I've been... keeping busy.

                   At this point, Chekov approaches with a young, (mid-
                   twenties) attractive, Asian female Ensign named DEMORA.

 CHEKOV                                      (to Kirk)
                             Excuse me, Captain. I'd like you 
                             to meet the Helmsman of the
                             Enterprise-B. Ensign Demora Sulu --
                             Captain James Kirk.

 DEMORA                              It's a pleasure to meet you, sir. 
                             My father's told me some...
                             interesting stories about you.

                   Kirk is shocked. For a long moment, he stares at her 
                   in amazement.

 KIRK                              Your father... Hikaru Sulu is your 
                             father?

 DEMORA                              Yes, sir.

 CHEKOV                              You met her once before, but she 
                             was...

                   Chekov holds out his hand and indicates a very short 
                   height.

 KIRK                              But that wasn't so long ago... it 
                             couldn't have been more than...

 CHEKOV                              Twelve years, sir.

 KIRK                              Yes... well... congratulations, 
                             Ensign. It wouldn't be the 
                             Enterprise without a Sulu at the 
                             helm.

 DEMORA                              Thank you, sir. 
                                      (to Chekov) 
                             Let me show you the new inertial 
                             guidance system.

                   Demora and Chekov move off and Kirk looks after them 
                   for a long beat. The expression on his face changes 
                   from shock to sadness... Something is clearly 
                   bothering him. 

                   Scotty moves over to Kirk, with a smile on his face.

 SCOTTY                                      (to Kirk)
                             Damn fine ship if you ask me...

                   But Kirk's mind is still on Demora. He watches her as 
                   she moves to the Helmsman's position.

 KIRK                              You know, Scotty... it amazes me.

 SCOTTY                              And what would that be, sir?

 KIRK                              Sulu. When did he find the time 
                             for a family?

 SCOTTY                              It's like you always said -- if 
                             something's important enough, you 
                             make the time.

                   Kirk nods absently. Scotty realizes something...

 SCOTTY                              So... that's why you've been 
                             running around the galaxy like an
                             eighteen-year-old. Finding 
                             retirement a little lonely, are we?

                   Kirk gives him a look.

 KIRK                              With that kind of tact, I'm glad 
                             you're an engineer and not a
                             psychiatrist.

                   Harriman interrupts.

 HARRIMAN                              Excuse me, gentlemen... if you'll 
                             take your seats.

 KIRK                              Oh... of course.

 10 NEW ANGLE 10 
                   Revealing that three CHAIRS have been neatly arranged 
                   to one side.

                   Scotty, Kirk and Chekov all take their seats. The 
                   Journalists take positions on the opposite side of the 
                   Bridge. Harriman moves to the command chair and the 
                   rest of the Bridge crew go to their stations.

 HARRIMAN                                      (to all)
                             Prepare to leave spacedock. Aft 
                             thrusters ahead one quarter, port 
                             and starboard at station keeping. 
                                     (beat) 
                             Captain Kirk, I'd be honored if 
                             you would give the order to get 
                             underway.

 KIRK                              No... no. Thank you.

 HARRIMAN                              Please, I insist.

                   All eyes on Kirk -- he has little choice. He stands 
                   uncomfortably. There is a moment of anticipation.

 KIRK                                      (to all)
                             Take us out.

                   Everyone breaks into APPLAUSE. Kirk sits down in 
                   acute embarrassment and  annoyance.

 CHEKOV                                      (sotto)
                             Very good, sir.

 SCOTTY                                      (sotto)
                             Brought a tear to my eye.

 CUT TO: 11 EXT. SPACE- ENTERPRISE-B (VFX-I) 11 
                   The great ship majestically LEAVES the dock, and heads 
                   out into open space, passing DIRECTLY OVERHEAD.

 12 INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE 12 
                   A short time later. Harriman turns to his guests.

 HARRIMAN                              Well... we've just cleared the 
                             asteroid belt. Our course will 
                             take us out beyond Pluto and then 
                             back to spacedock. Just a quick 
                             run around the block. 
                                     (beat) 
                             If we have time, we'll conduct a 
                             few tests of the warp --

                   Suddenly the communications console starts to BEEP. 
                   The COM OFFICER hits a few commands in response.

 COM OFFICER                                      (to Harriman)
                             We're picking up a distress call, 
                             Captain.

                   This grabs everyone's attention.

 HARRIMAN                              On speakers.

                   We hear the voice of a crewmember who sounds panicked 
                   and urgent.

 COM VOICE                                      (fritzed)
                             This is the transport ship Lakul. 
                             We're caught in some kind of
                             energy distortion. We can't break 
                             free... need immediate help... 
                             It' tearing us --

                   The voice is drowned out by STATIC. The SCIENCE 
                   OFFICER checks something on his console. The 
                   Journalist with the Holo-camera turns on his light and 
                   pans it around to capture the action.

 SCIENCE OFFICER                              The Lakul is one of two ships 
                             transporting El-Aurian refugees to 
                             Earth.

                   Harriman blinks a couple of times, surprised at this 
                   unexpected turn of  events. Kirk watches him intently. 
                   Harriman clears his throat, then turns to Demora.

 HARRIMAN                              Can you locate them?

 DEMORA                              The ships are bearing at three one
                             zero mark two one five. Distance:
                             Three light years.

 HARRIMAN                              Signal the closest starship. 
                             We're in no condition to mount a 
                             rescue... We don't even have a 
                             full crew aboard.

                   The NAVIGATOR checks his console.

 NAVIGATOR                              We're the only one in range, sir.

                   The Holo-camera light is shined on Harriman as he 
                   shifts in his seat, hesitant to take the plunge. Kirk 
                   is drumming his fingers impatiently on his leg. 
                   Finally, Harriman takes a breath and straightens his 
                   jacket a bit.

 HARRIMAN                              Well, then... I guess it's up to 
                             us. 
                                      (to Demora) 
                             Helm, lay in an intercept course 
                             and engage at maximum warp.

                   Kirk fidgets in his chair, itching to get in on the 
                   action - his instincts taking over. Scotty shoots him 
                   a side-long glance.

 SCOTTY                              Is there something wrong with your 
                             chair, Captain?

                   Kirk gives him a look.

 13 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE-B (VFX-I) 13 
                   The ship snaps into warp.
 14 INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE 14 
                   A few minutes later. Demora is watching her console.

 DEMORA                              We're within visual range of the 
                             energy distortion, Captain.

 HARRIMAN                              On screen.

 15 INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (VFX-I) 15 
                   Which now shows a HUGE RIBBON OF CRACKLING ENERGY 
                   directly ahead of the Enterprise-B. 

                   Everyone reacts to the bizarre sight.

 CHEKOV                              What the hell is that?

 DEMORA                                      (off console)
                             I've found the transport ships.

 15A INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (VFX-I) 15A 
                   The Viewscreen now shows TWO TRANSPORT SHIPS trapped 
                   like insects in the violent torrent of energy. The 
                   ships are being buffeted and thrown about by large 
                   TENDRILS of CRACKLING ENERGY.

 DEMORA                                      (cont'd)
                             Their hulls are starting to buckle 
                             under the stress -- they won't 
                             survive much longer.

                   The ship suddenly SHAKES. The Navigator works his 
                   console.

 NAVIGATOR                              We're encountering severe 
                             gravimetric distortions from the 
                             energy ribbon.

 HARRIMAN                              We'll have to keep our distance...
                             we don't want to get pulled in
                             too...

                   Harriman frowns at the screen, trying to figure out 
                   what to do. Kirk can barely contain himself -- to him 
                   the answer is obvious. He blurts out the answer --

 KIRK                              Tractor beam...

                   Scotty quickly elbows him in the side -- this isn't 
                   Kirk's ship. Kirk shuts up.  Harriman glances at Kirk.

 HARRIMAN                              We don't have a tractor beam.

 KIRK                              You left spacedock without a 
                             tractor beam?

 HARRIMAN                              It won't be installed until 
                             Tuesday. 
                                     (beat) 
                             Ensign Sulu... try generating a 
                             subspace field around the ships. 
                             That might break them free.

 DEMORA                              Aye, sir.

                   When Kirk hears this order, he shakes his head slightly 
                   and mouths the word "no" under his breath. He knows 
                   that won't work.

 DEMORA                                      (continuing; shakes her 
                                      head)
                             There's too much quantum 
                             interference, Captain.

                   Harriman frowns again, trying to come up with another
                   solution, but it isn't easy -- it's his first day in 
                   command; his ship is under-manned and ill-prepared. 
                   It's a nightmare come true. Kirk is itching to get in 
                   On this, his fingers digging into the arms of his chair --
                   but he restrains himself.

 HARRIMAN                              What about... venting plasma from 
                             the warp nacelles? That might 
                             disrupt the ribbon's hold on the 
                             ships.

 NAVIGATOR                              Aye, sir.. releasing drive 
                             plasma...

                   A tense beat. Harriman glances over at the 
                   journalists, then glances over at Kirk. Kirk gives him 
                   a pained smile, trying to be encouraging even though he 
                   knows this is not the right course of action.

 NAVIGATOR                                      (continuing)
                             It's not having any effect, sir. 
                             I think --
 DEMORA                              Sir! The starboard vessel's hull 
                             is collapsing --
 15B INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (VFX-I) 15B 
                   Suddenly the right-hand ship on the screen is engulfed 
                   by a fiery TENDRIL of energy and it EXPLODES. The 
                   other ship continues to be thrown about and buffeted. 
                   Everyone reacts with shock on the Bridge.

 CHEKOV                              How many people were aboard 
                             that ship?

 DEMORA                              Two hundred sixty-five.

                   Harriman pales at the sight... seems shell-shocked by 
                   the destruction of the ship. He's overwhelmed now, at 
                   a genuine loss as to what to do next.

 DEMORA                                      (urgent)
                             The Lakul's hull integrity is down 
                             to twelve percent, sir.

                   Harriman looks over at Kirk, who has remained quiet 
                   during this entire sequence only through great effort 
                   and out of deference to the young Captain. This is a 
                   delicate moment -- Harriman doesn't want to look 
                   incapable, but at the same time, he needs help.

 HARRIMAN                              Captain Kirk... I would appreciate 
                             any... suggestions you might have.

                   Kirk is out of his chair like a cork out of a bottle. 
                   He moves down to stand next to Harriman.

 KIRK                                      (sotto)
                             First -- move us within 
                             transporter range and beam those 
                             people to the Enterprise.

                   Harriman looks at him with surprise.

 HARRIMAN                              What about the gravimetric 
                             distortions? They'll tear us 
                             apart...

 KIRK                                      (gently)
                             Risk is part of the game if you 
                             want to sit in that chair.

                   Kirk gives him a supportive look. Harriman buckles 
                   down and grimly looks at the image on the screen.

 HARRIMAN                              Helm, close to within transporter 
                             range.

                   Kirk glances at the Cameraman, who's still shining the 
                   light on them  all.

 KIRK                              And second -- turn that damned 
                             thing off.

                   The cameraman turns OFF the light.

 CUT TO: 
 16 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE-B (VFX-I) 16 
                   The ship edges in yet closer to the crackling ribbon. 
                   The tendrils from the ribbon lash out at the ship, just 
                   missing it.

 17 INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE 17 
                   As before.

 DEMORA                              We're within range, sir.

 HARRIMAN                                      (to lieutenant)
                             Beam them directly to Sickbay.

 CHEKOV                                      (concerned)
                             How big's your medical staff?

 HARRIMAN                                      (embarrassed)
                             The medical staff... doesn't
                             arrive until Tuesday.

                   Chekov turns to the two journalists.

 CHEKOV                              You and you. You've just become 
                             nurses. Let's go.

                   Chekov and the journalists EXIT to the turbolift.
 DEMORA                              Main Engineering reports 
                             fluctuations in the warp plasma 
                             relays.

 SCOTTY                              By-pass the relays and go to 
                             auxiliary systems.

                   The LIEUTENANT is having problems at the aft console.

 LIEUTENANT                              Sir, I'm having trouble locking 
                             onto them. They appear to be...
                             in some sort of... temporal flux.

                   Kirk turns to Scotty.

 KIRK                              Scotty?

                   Scotty quickly moves to look at the Transporter 
                   console.

 SCOTTY                              What the hell...

                   Kirk moves to him.

 SCOTTY                              Their life signs are... are
                             phasing in and out of our 
                             space-time continuum.

 KIRK                              Phasing? To where?

                   Scotty begins to work.

 NAVIGATOR                              Sir! Their hull's collapsing!

 18 EXT. SPACE- THE LAKUL (VFX-I) 18 
                   The ship is destroyed by an energy tendril.

 19 INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE 19 
                   All eyes on Scotty.

 SCOTTY                              I got forty-seven of them...
                                     (beat, grim) 
                             ... out of one hundred fifty.

                   Suddenly the ship is rocked violently. KLAXONS and 
                   alarms start to wail and the lights FLICKER on and off. 
                   BULKHEAD EXPLODES, sending metal fragments screaming 
                   across the Bridge and KILLING the Navigator. Scotty 
                   quickly takes over the dead man's console.

 KIRK                              Report!

 DEMORA                              We're caught in a gravimetric 
                             field emanating from the trailing 
                             edge of the ribbon.

 HARRIMAN                              All engines, full reverse!

              20   EXT. SPACE- ENTERPRISE-B & RIBBON (VFX-I)                   20

                   The ship is turning sideways into the WAKE of the
                   ribbon, but cannot break away. It is clearly being 
                   pulled along, out of control. Tendrils leap up from the
                   ribbon, lashing against the ship.

 21 INT. ENTERPRISE-B- SICKBAY 21 
                   The room is filled with the SURVIVORS of the Lakul. 
                   They are all members of the EL-AURIAAN  race -- humanoid 
                   and dressed in distinctive clothing. The survivors are 
                   in various states of shock. Many sit on the floor, 
                   staring into middle distance. some lie on tables, 
                   unconscious. others are mumbling incoherently to 
                   themselves. Chekov and the Journalists are moving from 
                   person to person trying to get control of the 
                   situation as the ship is ROCKED and FLUNG about. 
                   Chekov has a tricorder.

 SURVIVORS                                      (incoherent, overlapping)
                             The colors are touching me... I'm 
                             caught in the glass... Help me...
                             I can see the seconds... Over 
                             here... etc

 CHEKOV                              It will be all right. We're going 
                             to take care of you.

                   He looks at the tricorder.

 CHEKOV                                      (off tricorder)
                             Only minor injuries so far...
                                     (beat) 
                             But it looks like they're all
                             suffering from some kind of
                             neural shock.

                   One Journalist moves past a man sitting on a bio-bed 
                   with a dazed look on his face. He has a nasty-looking 
                   wound on one side of his face. (We will later learn 
                   that this man is named DOCTOR SORAN.)

                   The journalist is about to turn away when suddenly 
                   Soran GRABS him roughly -- clearly a man of great 
                   Strength -- and pulls him close. Soran's eyes are 
                   suddenly wild, crazed.

 SORAN                              Why...why?

 JOURNALIST                              It's all right... you're safe...
                             you're on the Enterprise.

 SORAN                              No... I have to go... I have to 
                             get back... You don't understand! 
                             Let me go!

                   Soran begins to attack the journalist, but before he 
                   can do any real damage, Chekov injects Soran with a 
                   hypospray and Soran falls unconscious.

 JOURNALIST                              What was he talking about?

                   Suddenly a WOMAN with her back toward us stumbles 
                   nearby. Chekov quickly grabs her arm and catches her 
                   before she falls.

 CHEKOV                              Easy there...

                   The woman turns around and we see her face for the 
                   first time -- it's GUINAN. She seems dazed and 
                   confused. Chekov smiles at her warmly.

 CHEKOV                              It's going to be okay. Here, just 
                             lie down.

                   As he guides Guinan onto a table...

 22 INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE (VFX-I) 22 
                   Energy ribbon on viewscreen.

 DEMORA                              Inertial dampers failing.

 SCOTTY                              Engines not responding!

                   Harriman is gripping the arms of his chair with one 
                   hand. His face pales.

 HARRIMAN                                      (quiet)
                             I didn't expect to die my first 
                             day on the job.

                   Kirk tries to buck up the young captain.

 KIRK                                      (sotto)
                             The first thing you learn as 
                             Captain is how to cheat death. 
                                     (beat, then louder) 
                             Scotty?

 SCOTTY                                      (outraged)
                             There's just no way to disrupt a 
                             gravimetric field of this 
                             magnitude!

 DEMORA                              Hull integrity failing.

                   Kirk looks at Scotty expectantly for a moment.

 SCOTTY                                      (continuing)
                             But I do have a theory...

 KIRK                              I thought you might.

 SCOTTY                              An anti-matter discharge directly 
                             ahead... it might disrupt the 
                             field long enough for us to break 
                             away.

 KIRK                              A photon torpedo?

 SCOTTY                              Aye.

 KIRK                                      (quickly, to Demora)
                             Load torpedo bays, prepare to fire 
                             on my command.

                   Demora turns to him.

 DEMORA                              Captain... we don't have any 
                             torpedoes.

                   Kirk glances at Harriman.

 KIRK                              Don't tell me... Tuesday.

                   Harriman nods, a little embarrassed. The SHAKING gets 
                   worse.

 SCOTTY                              Captain, it may be possible to 
                             simulate a torpedo blast using a
                             resonance burst from the main 
                             deflector dish.

 KIRK                                      (onto the idea)
                             Where are the deflector relays?

 DEMORA                              Deck fifteen, section twenty-one
                             alpha

 HARRIMAN                                      (to Kirk)
                             I'll go. You have the Bridge.

                   Harriman heads for the turbolift, and there is a moment 
                   as Kirk is sorely tempted to take command of the ship 
                   and sit in the Captain's chair one more time. But he 
                   pulls himself back before Harriman can exit.

 KIRK                              No... a Captain's place is on the 
                             Bridge of his ship. 
                                     (beat) 
                             I'll take care of it.

                   Harriman nods in acknowledgement. Kirk heads for the 
                   turbolift.

 KIRK                                      (on the move, to Scotty)
                             Keep her together until I get 
                             back.

 SCOTTY                                      (matter of fact)
                             I always do.

                   Kirk smiles as the turbolift doors slide shut...

 25 INT. ENTERPRISE-B - DEFLECTOR ROOM (CONTINUOUS) 25 
                   A small control room with a few consoles. Kirk rushes 
                   in and rips off one of the large wall panels. He 
                   quickly begins to re-route cabling and circuitry...

                   As before. The ship is SHAKING badly.

 SCOTTY                              Captain, I don't know how much 
                             longer I can hold her together!

                   Kirk finishes working and slams the wall panel closed.

 KIRK                              That's it. Go!

 29 EXT. SPACE- ENTERPRISE-B (VFX-I) 29 
                   A large BURST 0F ENERGY leaps out of the main deflector 
                   dish and EXPLODES in front of the ship. There is an 
                   immediate reaction within the Energy Ribbon, which 
                   roils and fluctuates in response.

 30 INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE 30

                   The ship now begins to turn away from the crackling 
                   ribbon. But just as it's turning, one final TENDRIL of 
                   energy suddenly leaps out and hits the ship.

                   The ship is ROCKED so hard that everyone is knocked off

                   scrambles back into position.

 DEMORA                              We're clear.
                    Everyone reacts with relief.

                   Harriman, very concerned, gets up and follows Scotty. 
                   They EXIT to the Turbolift.

 CUT TO: 
 34 INT. ENTERPRISE-B - CORRIDOR 34 
                   Scotty and Harriman head down the Corridor. They round
                   a bend... and then stop short. They react to 
                   something ahead of them...

 35 NEW ANGLE (VFX-P) 35 
                   Revealing that the corridor ahead of them is GONE. A 
                   jagged hole has been ripped in the ship and OPEN SPACE 
                   can be seen beyond the twisted metal. 

                   A FORCEFIELD flickers on and off, holding the vacuum of 
                   space at bay.

                   Scotty and Harriman look at the awesome sight for a 
                   moment. Chekov comes running up the Corridor behind 
                   them. He stops and reacts.

 CHEKOV                              My God...
                                     (beat) 
                             Was anyone in there?

                   A long silent beat as Scotty looks out into space.

 SCOTTY                              Aye.

 36 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE-B (VFX-I) 36 
                   A huge chunk has been ripped out of the Engineering 
                   section, looking like an open wound. Scotty, Chekov,
                   and Harriman can be seen standing inside the small 
                   Corridor, looking out into space...

 37 INT. ENTERPRISE-B- BRIDGE 37 
                   A short time later. Scotty, Harriman and Chekov are 
                   listening to Demora, who is working the Helm console.

 DEMORA                              I've checked the entire ship and 
                             the surrounding space. there's 
                             no sign of him.

                   A silent moment. Chekov looks to Scotty, hoping to 
                   hear some sort of miracle. Scotty takes a moment
                   looks at the empty command chair. Then he shakes his 
                   head. A long beat as everyone is forced to accept this
                   terrible truth.

 SCOTTY                                      (quiet)
                             Just a quick... run around the 
                             block.

 CHEKOV                              I never thought it would end like 
                             this...

 SCOTTY                              All things must end, Mr. Chekov.

                   Harriman finally breaks the stillness of the Bridge.

 HARRIMAN                              Let's go home.

                   Harriman steps down to the Captain's chair and takes 
                   command of his ship.

                   Scotty and Chekov exchange a final look. Off the 
                   reactions of these two friends who've just lost someone 
                   very dear to them both...

 CUT TO: 
 38 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE-B (VFX-I) 38 
                   The crippled ship turns and heads away...

 FADE TO BLACK. 
 SUPER: SEVENTY-EIGHT YEARS LATER... 
 39 CLOSE ON A HALYARD 39 
                   as a FLAG is quickly hoisted to the top of a mast. The 
                   flag reaches the top and is then caught by the wind -- 
                   the blue and white banner of the United Federation of 
                   Planets waves in the breeze.

 MOVE TO REVEAL THE LOCATION 
 40 EXT. SAILING VESSEL - DAY 40 
                   A nineteenth-century three-masted sailing vessel (about 
                   the size of a frigate) is hove-to and sitting in the 
                   water gently rocking. Across the stern of the ship, we 
                   can see the name ENTERPRISE picked out in gold letters.

 41 ON THE MAIN DECK 41 
                   Where PICARD and RIKER are standing before the 
                   assembled crew of the ship. Everyone is dressed in 
                   full-dress naval uniforms of the period, complete with 
                   cocked hats, epaulettes, etc. The crew is standing at 
                   attention... the wind whistles through the rigging...
                   the timbers creak...

                   Picard grimly looks over his crew... then finally  he
                   nods to Riker.

 RIKER                              Bring out the prisoner!

                   A drummer begins a long DRUM ROLL.

 42 ON A HATCH 42 
                   as WORF is brought on deck by TROI and GEORDI. Worf is 
                   shackled by hand and leg irons. Troi and Geordi hold 
                   him by either arm and shove him toward the Captain. 
                   The drum roll STOPS. Picard moves to Worf and peers at 
                   him closely.
 PICARD                              Mister Worf... I always knew this 
                             day would come. Are you prepared 
                             to face the charges?

                   Worf doesn't answer and Troi jabs him in the side.

 TROI                              Answer him!

 WORF                              I am prepared.

                   Picard looks to Riker, who then pulls out a large, 
                   rolled piece of parchment. He opens the scroll and 
                   begins to read from it. In the b.g. Geordi removes 
                   Worf's shackles.

 RIKER                              "We, the officers and crew of the 
                             U.S.S. Enterprise, being of sound 
                             mind and judgment, hereby make 
                             the following charges against 
                             Lieutenant Worf: One. That he did 
                             knowingly and willfully perform 
                             above and beyond the call of duty 
                             on countless occasions. Two. 
                             That he has been a good and solid 
                             officer on this ship for one score 
                             less twelve years. And Three. 
                             Most seriously... that he has 
                             earned the respect and admiration 
                             of the entire crew."

                   Riker puts away the scroll

 PICARD                              There can be only one punishment 
                             for such crimes...
                                     (beat) 
                             I hereby promote you to the rank 
                             of Lieutenant Commander, with all 
                             the rights and privileges thereto. 
                             And may God have mercy on your 
                             soul.

                   Everyone ROARS in APPROVAL. Picard smiles at Worf and
                   shakes his hand.

 PICARD                                      (cont'd)
                             Congratulations, Commander.

 WORF                                      (smiles)
                             Thank you, sir.

                   Picard continues to smile at him for a moment...then 
                   Riker steps in.

 RIKER                              Extend the plank!!

                   Worf's face registers surprise as everyone GRABS HIM
                   and hauls him toward the side, where a long plank is 
                   being pushed out over the water.

 CREWMEMBERS                              Into the sea with him... feed him 
                             to the sharks... walk the 
                             plank... etc.

                   Picard gives Riker a questioning look.

 PICARD                              Don't you think you're taking this 
                             a little too far, Number One?

 RIKER                              When we went to ancient Rome for 
                             Deanna's promotion, we threw her 
                             to the lions, remember?

                   Picard shrugs it off... it's not exactly his cup of 
                   tea, but he'll go along with it.

                   Worf is hustled to the rail where BEVERLY is waiting 
                   patiently by the plank, holding a long PIKE. Worf is 
                   put on the plank and Crusher prods him with the pike 
                   until Worf is nearly at the end.

                   Worf finally stops and turns around.

 WORF                                      (a shout)
 WAIT!! 
                   Everyone falls silent a moment. Worf looks over 
                   the side at the water below.

 WORF                                      (a little embarrassed)
                             I can't swim.

 LA FORGE                                      (calmly, to Worf)
                             The Holodeck safety program is 
                             engaged... The computer won't let 
                             you drown.

 BEVERLY                              But the sharks are quite 
                             convincing.

                   Beverly prods him with the pike and Worf FALLS INTO THE
                   SEA  with a huge SPLASH . Everyone LAUGHS and CHEERS. 
                   Reveal DATA, who is standing near the side rail, 
                   looking a little confused at the reaction.

 DATA                                      (to Beverly)
                             Doctor, I must confess I am 
                             uncertain as to why pushing 
                             someone into freezing, shark-
                             infested water is amusing.
 BEVERLY                              It's all done in good fun, Data. 
                             Get in the spirit of things.

 DATA                              Ah.

                   Data thinks a moment, then he LIFTS Beverly with one 
                   hand and hold her over the rail.

 BEVERLY                              Data...Data -- !

                   Data lets go and Beverly PLUMMETS into the ocean. Data 
                   looks around -- no one is laughing. They all look a 
                   little surprised.

 GEORDI                              Data. that wasn't funny.

                   Data is puzzled by the reaction of the crowd... he's 
                   more confused than ever.

 43 PICARD AND RIKER 43 
                   are standing on the quarterdeck as a very wet Beverly 
                   comes up on deck.

 PICARD                              Well, now that we're all aboard...
                                     (beat, then smiles) 
                             Number One, bring the ship before 
                             the wind. 
                                     (savoring the moment) 
                             Let's see what's out there.

 RIKER                              Aye, aye, sir. 
                                     (to Troi) 
                             Take the wheel, Commander.

                   Troi takes the ship's wheel.

 RIKER                                      (shouts)
                             All hands make sail! Raise up 
                             tacks and stand by the braces!

                   The crew springs into action... rushing to their places 
                   aloft and on deck... grabbing ropes and lines...
                   starting to unfurl the sails... trimming the 
                   yardarms... getting the ship ready to sail.

 44 44 THRU OMITTED THRU 45 45 
 46 PICARD AND RIKER 46 
                   Picard is drinking in the scene with a look of great 
                   satisfaction and  contentment.

 PICARD                              Imagine what it was like, Will. No 
                             engines... no computers... just 
                             the wind, the sea and the stars to 
                             guide you.

 RIKER                              Bad food, brutal discipline... 
                                     (beat) 
                             No women.

                   But Picard won't let Riker rain on his parade -- he's 
                   thoroughly enjoying himself.

 COM VOICE                              Bridge to Captain Picard.

 PICARD                              Picard here.

 COM VOICE                              There is a personal message for 
                             you from Earth.

 PICARD                                      (annoyed)
                             Put it through down here. 
                                     (to Riker) 
                             But the best thing about a life at 
                             sea was that they couldn't get to 
                             you.

                   Picard walks toward the bow.

 PICARD                                      (to com)
                             Computer, arch.

 46A ANGLE (VFX-P) 46A 
                   A U-shaped ARCH with several computer panels visible 
                   appears on the forecastle. It's a strange sight to see 
                   a piece of the 24th century on the deck of this ship. 
                   Picard goes to the arch and activates one of the 
                   monitors and waits for the transmission to appear.

 46B NEW ANGLE (VFX-P) 46B 
                   A text message APPEARS and he starts to read it. After 
                   a moment, he reacts with shock and dismay to something 
                   on the screen.

 47 ON TROI 47 
                   whose attention has been drawn to Picard, at the arch. 
                   She reacts with concern at the expression on his face.

 TROI                                       (to crewmember)
                             Here. Take the wheel.

                   Troi moves toward the bow.

 48 ON PICARD (VFX-P) 48 
                   whose face is now ashen with shock. Clearly he has 
                   just read something on the screen which is very 
                   disturbing. 

                   He stares into the middle distance for a moment. Troi 
                   moves to him.

                             Captain, are you all right?

 PICARD                              Yes. Fine. If you'll excuse 
                             me...

                   He turns OFF the screen.

                   The Holodeck DOORS APPEAR within the Arch. Picard is 
                   clearly distracted as he EXITS to the Corridor. Troi 
                   looks after him with concern.

                   Worf looks at him blankly for a moment.

 WORF                              The Royal... studs...?

 RIKER                                      (smiles, points aloft)

 RIKER                              Riker here.

 COM VOICE                              We're picking up a distress call 
                             from the Amargosa observatory, 
                             sir. They say they're under 
                             attack.

 RIKER                                       (to all)
                             Red Alert! All hands to

                             the Bridge.

                   Everyone on the ship reacts, and there is a general 
                   rush to the bow of the ship...

                   The great ship at impulse. We FOLLOW it and then see 
                   ahead of the ship, a small SOLAR OBSERVATORY with a 
                   complex optical array. The observatory bears scorch 
                   marks and other signs of recent battle. (In the b.g.
                   a YELLOW SUN can be seen.)

                   all still dressed in their costumes from the ceremony. 
                   The ship is at Red Alert. The image of the burnt-out 
                   observatory is on the VIEWSCREEN.

 RIKER                              It looks like we're too late...

 WORF                                      (off console)
                             There are no other ships in the 
                             system.

 DATA                              Sensors show five life signs 
                             aboard the station, Captain.

 RIKER                              The station complement was 
                             nineteen.

                   A grim beat. Picard gets up and starts heading for the 
                   Ready Room - his attitude is dismissive, almost 
                   irritated that this has interrupted some deeper concern 
                   of his.

 PICARD                              Secure from Red Alert. Number 
                             One, begin an investigation. I'll 
                             be in my Ready Room.

                   Troi and Riker exchange a surprised look.

 RIKER                              Sir?

 PICARD                                      (hard)
                             Make it so.

                   Picard EXITS. An awkward beat. What's wrong with the 
                   Captain? But they have their orders. 

                   As Riker and  Worf head for the EXIT...

 CUT TO: 
 52 INT. OBSERVATORY - OPS CENTER (VFX-P) 52 
                   The station is a SMOKING RUIN -- consoles flickering, 
                   lights dim, damage everywhere. Only a few minutes have 
                   passed since they were attacked. Riker, Worf, Beverly
                   and two SECURITY GUARDS MATERIALIZE. They're all back 
                   in uniform, holding phasers and palm beacons. Worf has 
                   a tricorder and Beverly has a medical kit. The room is 
                   cramped, there are fallen bulk-heads and blown-out 
                   consoles. The debris makes it difficult to get a clear 
                   view of the room.

 WORF                              These blast patterns are 
                             consistent with type-three 
                             disruptors.

 RIKER                              Well, that narrows it to Klingon, 
                             Breen or Romulan.

                   Beverly follows her tricorder readings.

 BEVERLY                              I'm picking up life signs... about 
                             twenty meters ahead.

 WORF                              That rules out Klingons.

                   Riker gives him a look.

 WORF                              They would not have left anyone 
                             alive.

 BEVERLY                              Over here.

                   They pick their way carefully through the carnage of 
                   the station...and come to the body of a Starfleet 
                   Science Officer. He has taken a disruptor blast to the 
                   back and there is a nasty-looking scorch mark on his 
                   uniform. Beverly immediately takes some devices out of 
                   her medical kit and begins to treat him.

 RIKER                              Worf, you're with me. Paskall, 
                             you and Mendez search the upper 
                             deck.

                   The Security Guards climb a nearby ladder while Riker 
                   and Worf head down a dimly-lit corridor. Riker stops 
                   at two bodies in the hall, checks them over -- but 
                   they're dead. There is a sudden banging from the far 
                   corner of the room. Worf and Riker quickly move to a 
                   collapsed bulkhead.

 WORF                              Under here...

                   They both grab hold of a large metal plate, pull it 
                   aside and begin to dig through the debris. Finally, a 
                   HAND can be seen grasping about from within the pile of 
                   rubble. Riker and Worf work faster. Worf grabs the 
                   man's hand.

 WORF                              It's all right... do not struggle.

                   Worf holds the man's hand as Riker shoves away a final 
                   console. We reveal the head and torso of Doctor Soran, 
                   one of the survivors from the Lakul (and last seen 
                   in Sickbay aboard the Enterprise-B). Soran has not aged 
                   at all over the years but he does have a permanent 
                   scar on his face from the earlier wound. He blinks a 
                   few times, seems a little dazed.
 RIKER                              I'm Commander William Riker of the
                             Starship Enterprise.

 SORAN                              Soran... Doctor Tolian Soran...

                   Soran puts a hand to his head, still trying to get his 
                   bearings.

 RIKER                              Who attacked you, Doctor?

 SORAN                              I'm not sure... it happened so 
                             fast...

 SECURITY OFFICER                                      (calls out)
                             Commander -- you'd better take a 
                             look at this.

                   Riker and Worf move to the ladder as Beverly begins to 
                   scan Soran...

 53 NEW ANGLE - UPPER DECK 53 
                   Riker and Worf move over to the two Security Guards who 
                   are kneeling over a dead body which is obscured from 
                   view. One guard turns over the body, revealing a 
                   ROMULAN SOLDIER. Worf looks at him in disgust.

 WORF                              Romulan.

                   Riker and Worf exchange a look. OFF their reactions...

 54 INT. DATA'S QUARTERS 54 
                   Data is sitting in a chair, petting SPOT THE CAT. 
                   Geordi is standing next to him.

 DATA                             Is she still angry?

 GEORDI                             No... but I'd stay out of Sickbay 
                            for a while if I were you. I 
                            still don't know why you dropped 
                            her in the water.

 DATA                             I was attempting to... get in the

                            would be humorous.

                   Data frowns. troubled by this recent experience. He 
                   puts Spot down and moves to a bulkhead. He activates 
                   a control panel and a small compartment slides OPEN,
                   revealing a small COMPUTER CHIP  which is suspended in 
                   a glass and metal framework. Data looks at the chip 
                   for a beat and Geordi moves to him in concern.

 GEORDI                             Data... you're not thinking about 
                            using that thing are you?

 DATA                             It has occurred to me on several 
                            occasions. But I believe this may 
                            be the appropriate time.

 GEORDI                             Wait a minute. I thought you've 
                            always been afraid it would 
                            overload your neural net.

 DATA                             That is true. However, I believe 
                            my growth as an artificial 
                            life form has reached an impasse. 
                            For thirty-four years I have 
                            endeavored to become more "human" -
                            to grow beyond my original 
                            programming. And yet I am still 
                            unable to grasp such a simple 
                            concept as humor.

                            This emotion chip is the only 
                            answer.

                   Geordi considers a moment, looks at the chip...
                   and reluctantly has to agree.

 GEORDI                             All right...

                   Data sits down and La Forge moves to stand behind him.

 GEORDI                             But at the first sign of trouble, 
                            I'm going to deactivate it. 
                            agreed?

 DATA                             Agreed.

                   Geordi works on Data's head for a moment, and then
                   OPENS a panel on Data's head, revealing the blinking

                   Riker is standing next to Picard, who has his back turned 
                   and is staring out the window. Picard seems distracted 
                   during the scene, his mind clearly elsewhere as Riker 
                   finishes his report.

 RIKER                             We found two dead Romulans aboard 
                            the station. We're analyzing 
                            their equipment to see if we can 
                            determine what ship they came 
                            from.

                   Picard nods absently.

 PICARD                             There's still no indication of why 
                            they attacked the station?

 RIKER                             We think they were looking for 
                            something -- they practically tore 
                            the place apart.

 PICARD                             Hmm...

                            Inform Starfleet Command. This 
                            could indicate a new Romulan 
                            threat in this sector.

 RIKER                             You want me to contact Starfleet?

 PICARD                             Is there a problem?

 RIKER                             No, sir.

 PICARD                             Thank you, Number One.

                   Picard keeps his back turned, looking out the window. 
                   Riker hesitates, awkward.

 RIKER                             There is something else, Captain. 
                            One of the scientists. a Doctor
                            Soran... has insisted on speaking 
                            with you. 
                                     (beat) 
                            I told him you were busy, sir, but 
                            he said it was absolutely 
                            imperative that he speak with you 
                            right away.

 PICARD                             Understood. That will be all.

 RIKER                             Sir... is there anything wrong?

 PICARD                             No. Thank you.

                   A beat, then Riker turns and EXITS. Off Picard's

                   language subtly altered. He is looking at the world 
                   through new eyes. Geordi is following him closely,

                                     (re: liquid)
                            This is a new concoction I 
                            picked up on Forcas Three. Trust me, 
                            you're going to love it.

                   She pours two glasses of the liquid. Data takes one 
                   and sniffs it, then takes a drink. Geordi watches him 
                   closely. Data frowns.

 GEORDI                             Well...?

 DATA                             I believe the beverage has 
                            provoked an emotional response.

 GEORDI                             Really? What do you feel?

 DATA                             I am uncertain. I have had little 
                            experience with emotions... I am 
                            unable to articulate the 
                            sensation.

 GUINAN                             Emotions?

 GEORDI                             I'll explain later...

                   Data finishes the drink... concentrates, tries to make 
                   sense of the rush of feelings. His expression is one 
                   of disgust.

 GUINAN                                       (to Geordi)
                            I don't think he likes it.

 DATA                                      (excited)
                            Yes. That is it. I hate it.

 GEORDI                             Data, I think the chip is 
                            working...

                   Data looks at Geordi with a big smile on his face.

 DATA                             Yes. I hate this! It is 
                            revolting!

                   Beat.

 GUINAN                             Another round?

 DATA                             Please.

                   In the b.g., we see Picard ENTER Ten Forward.

 57 FOLLOW PICARD 57 
                   as he walks through Ten Forward and heads toward a 
                   table by the windows. Soran is sitting at the table, 
                   staring out at the stars, lost in thought. His 
                   observatory uniform is distinctive, and sets him apart 
                   from everyone else in the room. Picard walks up to the 
                   table.

 PICARD                             Doctor Soran...?

 SORAN                             Yes, yes, Captain -- thank you for 
                            coming.

                   The men shake hands and Picard sits down. Soran is an 
                   imposing physical presence, but at the moment he seems 
                   very much the eccentric scientists consumed with his 
                   work. Picard waves away a waiter.

 PICARD                             Nothing for me. 
                                     (brusque, to Soran) 
                            I understand there's something 
                            urgent you need to discuss with 
                            me.

 SORAN                             Yes. I need to return to the 
                            observatory immediately. I must 
                            continue a critical experiment I 
                            was running on the Amargosa star.
                    Picard's reaction is a little impatient -- this doesn't 
                   sound that imperative to him.

 PICARD                             Doctor... we're still conducting 
                            an investigation into the attack. 
                            Once we've completed our work, 
                            we'll be happy to allow you and 
                            your fellow scientists back aboard 
                            the observatory. Until then --

 SORAN                             The timing is very important on my 
                            experiment -- if it is not
                            completed within the next twelve 
                            hours, years of research will be 
                            lost.

 PICARD                             We're doing the best we can. Now 
                            if you'll excuse me...

                   Picard moves to stand, but Soran reaches out and gently 
                   but firmly grabs him by the arm. The unexpected 
                   physical contact and the change of intensity in Soran's 
                   face stops Picard in his tracks.

 SORAN                                      (cryptically)
                            They say time is the fire in 
                            which we burn... and right now, 
                            Captain, my time is running out. 
                                     (beat) 
                            We leave so many things unfinished 
                            in our lives -- I'm sure you can 
                            understand.

                   For some reason, Soran's words have struck a deep chord 
                   within Picard.

                   He looks away from Soran's compelling gaze and thinks 
                   for a long moment. When he finally speaks, his voice 
                   is barely above a whisper.
 PICARD                             I'll see what I can do...

                   Picard walks away without a word before Soran can 
                   thank him. Soran looks after him with relief, then 
                   pulls out an ANTIQUE POCKET WATCH and opens it. He 
                   looks at the watch for a long moment. then snaps it 
                   closed and head for the opposite exit from the one 
                   Picard took. FOLLOW Soran across Ten Forward...until 
                   he suddenly stops in shock at something he sees...

 58 SORAN'S POV 58 
                   of Guinan, who is now back at the bar.

 59 RESUME SORAN 59 
                   A dark look crosses his face -- he is disturbed by the 
                   sight of Guinan. He quickly turns and EXITS.

 60 ON GUINAN 60 
                   she begins to sense something, as though someone is 
                   watching her. She turns, looks in the direction where 
                   Soran was just standing, but there's no one there now. 
                   She shakes off the feeling and goes back to work.

 61 INT. ENGINEERING 61 
                   A short time later. A Romulan tricorder is connected 
                   to some diagnostic equipment near a console. Worf is 
                   talking to Riker.

                   Worf activates a MONITOR which shows a complex diagram 
                   of sensor information.

 WORF                             One of the dead Romulans had a 
                            tricorder. We analyzed its sensor 
                            logs and found they were scanning 
                            for signature particles of a 
                            compound called trilithium.

 RIKER                             Trilithium?

 WORF                             An experimental compound the 
                            Romulans have been working on. In 
                            theory, a trilithium-based 
                            explosive would be thousands of 
                            times more powerful than an 
                            anti-matter weapon. But they never 
                            found a way to stabilize it.
 RIKER                             Why were they looking for it on a 
                            Federation observatory? It doesn't
                            make any sense.

                   Riker considers.

 RIKER                                      (cont'd)
                            Have Geordi and Data go over with 
                            the next Away Team...  tell them to 
                            scan the observatory for 
                            trilithium.

 WORF                             Aye, sir.

 CUT TO: 
 62 INT. OBSERVATORY OPS 62 
                   The station is still a wreck. Geordi and Data are 
                   scanning the room with tricorders.

 GEORDI                                      (off tricorder)
                            There's no sign of any trilithium 
                            in here.

                   Geordi continues to scan... then suddenly Data lets out 
                   a quiet GIGGLE. Geordi stops and turns to look at him.
                   Data giggles louder.

 DATA                                      (laughing, to himself)
                            I get it. I get it.

 GEORDI                             You get what?

                   Data laughs again.

 DATA                             When you said to Commander 
                            Riker...
                                     (imitating Geordi's voice) 
                            "The clown can stay, but the 
                            Ferengi in the gorilla suit has to 
                            go."

                   Geordi looks blankly at him for a moment.

 GEORDI                             What?

 DATA                             During the Farpoint mission. We 
                            were on the Bridge and you told a 
                            joke. That was the punch line.

 GEORDI                             The Farpoint mission? Data, that 
                            was seven years ago.

 DATA                             I know. I just got it. 
                                     (laughs) 
                            It was very funny.

 GEORDI                             Thanks.

                   Geordi indicates a corridor. They EXIT in that 
                   direction...

 63 INT. OBSERVATORY CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS 63 
                   A short corridor connecting the Ops Center with other 
                   compartments. Geordi suddenly stops in front of what 
                   appears to be a standard bulkhead.

 GEORDI                             Wait a minute... there's a hidden 
                            doorway here. I can see the 
                            joint of the metal with my VISOR.

                   Geordi runs his finger in a vertical line along what 
                   appears to be a smooth bulkhead.

 DATA                                     (off tricorder)
                            There appears to be a dampening 
                            field in operation. I cannot scan 
                            beyond the bulkhead.

                   Geordi puts his tricorder away and begins looking for 
                   a way to open the door.

 GEORDI                             I don't see a control panel...or 
                            an access port.

 DATA                                      (off tricorder)
                            It appears to be a magnetically 
                            sealed.

                   Data steps forward and OPENS a small panel on wrist 
                   and makes a quick adjustment to the circuitry within.

 DATA                             I believe I can reverse the 
                            polarity by attenuating my axial 
                            servo.

                   Data completes his adjustment and then moves his wrist 
                   over the door panel.

 DATA                                      (joking)
                            "Open sesame."

                   There is a HUMMING sound followed by a loud CLICK. The 
                   door slides open.

 DATA                                      (smiles)
                            You could say I have a... magnetic 
                            personality.

                   Geordi reacts to the bad pun with a grimace. They EXIT 
                   to.

 64 INT. OBSERVATORY PROBE ROOM - CONTINUOUS 64 
                   A small room with several probes stacked in holding 
                   racks. Geordi and Data scan.

 GEORDI                             I'm still not picking up anything. 
                            Someone went to a lot of trouble 
                            to shield this room.

                   They put their tricorders away and begin looking around 
                   the room. Data continues to snicker and giggle as he 
                   tries not to laugh at jokes his mind conjures up. 
                   Geordi begins inspecting the probes... finally stops
                   at one probe which has SEVERAL ODD DEVICES attached to 
                   the side.

 GEORDI                             Data, take a look at this. 
                                     (Data comes over) 
                            You ever seen a solar probe with 
                            this kind of configuration?

                   Data uses the tricorder as if it were a puppet as he 
                   opens and closes it like a mouth.

 DATA                                      (making tricorder "talk")
                            No, Geordi. I have not. It is 
                            most unusual.
                    Data giggles and Geordi reacts with the irritation of 
                   someone listening to a very bad comedian.
 GEORDI                             Just help me get this panel open.

                   Data helps Geordi as they try to open a panel on the 
                   casing of the probe. They open the panel and Geordi
                   looks inside.he reacts to something.

 GEORDI                             Whoa. my VISOR'S picking up 
                            something in the theta band...it 
                            could be a trilithium signature.

                   Data suddenly start LAUGHING. Geordi turns in 
                   irritation.

 GEORDI                             Data, this isn't the time...

                            I am sorry... but I cannot stop 
                            myself... I think something is 
                            wrong...

                   Data's laughter escalates into hysteria... then Data 
                   begins to JERK and SHAKE and goes into a bizarre 
                   "emotional seizure." A rush of EMOTIONS race across 
                   his face. anger, passion, shock... a kaleidoscopic 
                   blur of reactions contort his features. Then it stops 
                   and he FALLS to the ground.

 GEORDI                             Data!

                   Geordi rushes to him. Data has a look of surprise on 
                   his face as he blinks a few times. He sits up.

 GEORDI                             Data, are you all right?

 DATA                             I believe the emotional chip has 
                            overloaded my positronic relays.

 GEORDI                             We better get you back to the 
                            Ship.

                            La Forge to Enterprise.

                   There's no response. Geordi frowns for a beat, then we 
                   hear Soran's voice.

 SORAN                             Is there a problem, gentlemen?

                   standing in the room. Geordi didn't hear him come in.

 GEORDI                             Oh... Doctor... yeah, as a matter 
                            of fact, there is. There's a 
                            damping field in here blocking 
                            our com signal. 
                                     (re: Data) 
                            Will you give me a hand?

                   Over the above dialogue, Soran glances over at the 
                   solar probe Geordi was inspecting. He notes the opened 
                   panel and a disturbed look crosses his face. 

                   Soran looks back at Geordi.

 SORAN                             I'd be happy to.

                   Soran moves toward them. and then without warning, he 
                   punches Geordi in the face, KNOCKING the VISOR across 
                   the room. He whirls around and points a phaser at 
                   Data, who suddenly looks fearful.

 DATA                             Please don't hurt me.

 CUT TO: 
 66 INT. PICARD'S QUARTERS 66 
                   Picard is standing at the replicator.

 PICARD                             Tea. Earl Grey. Hot.

                   The cup of tea APPEARS in the replicator and at the 
                   same moment, the door CHIMES.

 PICARD                             Come.

                   Troi ENTERS. Picard would rather not be bothered right 
                   now, but he is polite as always.

 PICARD                             Counselor. What can I do for you?

 TROI                             Actually... I'm here to see if 
                            there's anything I can do for you.

 PICARD                             Well... I appreciate your concern, 
                            but I'd rather not discuss it 
                            right now, thank you.
                    But Troi won't be brushed away so easily.

 TROI                             I'm afraid I can't just leave it 
                            at that. The commanding officer 
                            of this ship is clearly distraught 
                            about something. As ship's 
                            Counselor, it's my duty to --

 PICARD                             As ship's counselor, it's your 
                            duty to know not only when you're 
                            needed... but also when you're 
                            not.

 TROI                             You can't fool an empath, Captain. 
                            I know exactly when I'm needed.

                   Picard is really not in the mood for this. His tone 
                   hardens.

 PICARD                             Well, with all due respect to your 
                            Betazoid senses, I prefer to be 
                            alone right now.

 TROI                             Very well. I suppose I could make 
                            out my weekly report to Starfleet
                            Command without your input. 
                                     (beat) 
                            "Admiral Lusby... regarding the 
                            unusual behavior of Jean-Luc 
                            Picard: I find him increasingly 
                            Irritable... remote... and 
                            uncooperative. I recommend forced 
                            shore leave at a Starbase facility 
                            in order to --"

 PICARD                             All right, all right. You've made 
                            your point.

                   Troi takes a seat and patiently waits. Picard gets 
                   up.moves around the room for a moment...and stops. 
                   He speaks in a flat, unemotional tone of voice.

 PICARD                             The message I received...
                                     (beat) 
                            My brother... and his son -- my 
                            nephew -- burned to death in a 
                            fire.

                   Troi reacts, genuinely surprised.
 TROI                             Captain, I'm sorry. 
                                     (beat) 
                            I know there were a lot of 
                            unresolved conflicts between you 
                            and your brother.

 PICARD                             What I can't get out of my mind is 
                            the image of Rene -- my nephew. 
                            I just can't believe he's gone...

                   He trails off.

 TROI                             It's only natural to feel a 
                            heightened sense of tragedy when 
                            a child dies...
                                     (sensing more) 
                            But it goes deeper than that, 
                            doesn't it? I can sense that Rene 
                            meant a great deal to you.

 PICARD                             In a way, he was as close as I 
                            ever came to having a child of my 
                            own.

                   Troi eyes an open photo album on the table. She reaches 
                   over and flips through the pages for a moment. There 
                   are many photos inside... from many periods in time
                   including one of Picard's brother standing next to his 
                   young son. This is the Picard family album.

 TROI                             Your family history is very 
                            important to you, isn't it?

 PICARD                                      (nods)
                            Ever since I was a little boy, I 
                            remember hearing about the family 
                            line. The Picards that fought at 
                            Trafalgar... the Picard's that 
                            settled the first Martian colony. 
                            When my brother married and had a 
                            son...

                   Picard hesitates -- this is difficult for him.

 TROI                             ... You felt it was no longer your 
                            responsibility to carry on the 
                            family line.

 PICARD                                      (nods)
                            My brother had shouldered that 
                            burden... allowing me to pursue my 
                            own selfish needs...

 TROI                             There's nothing selfish about 
                            pursuing your own life... your own 
                            career.

                   Picard moves to the window, stares outside. A shadow 
                   crosses his face. He's getting to the heart of the 
                   matter.

 PICARD                             You know, Counselor... I'm not 
                            getting any younger. For some 
                            time now, I've been aware that 
                            there are fewer days ahead than 
                            there are behind...
                                     (beat) 
                            But I always took comfort in the 
                            fact that when I was gone, my
                            family would continue. But now...

                   Picard moves back to the photo album, open it to the 
                   last page, an then flips through the remaining pages --
                   they are blank.

 PICARD                             I've had brushes with death...
                            more than I care to contemplate. 
                            I always accepted it as a 
                            calculated risk that goes along 
                            with wearing this uniform. 
                                     (beat) 
                            But now... the idea of death has 
                            a terrible sense of finality to 
                            it.

                   He looks at her.

 PICARD                             I'm the last Picard.

                   A quiet beat as Troi considers him.

 TROI                             Captain, perhaps we --

                   Suddenly, a BLINDING BURST OF LIGHT  from outside the 
                   windows washes into the room. Troi and Picard rush to 
                   the window and shield their eyes against the glare.

                   getting DARKER by the second... more flaming debris 
                   is being ejected into space.

 PICARD                             Report.

 RIKER                             A quantum implosion has occurred 
                            within the Amargosa star. All
                            nuclear fusion is breaking down.

 PICARD                             How is that possible?

 WORF                             Sensor records show a solar probe 
                            was launched from the observatory 
                            a few moments ago.

 RIKER                             The star's going to collapse in a 
                            matter of minutes.

                   Something beeps on Worf's console.

 WORF                             Sir, the implosion has produced 
                            a level twelve shock wave.

 TROI                                      (shocked)
                            Level twelve? That'll destroy 
                            everything in this system.

                            No, sir. They are not aboard.

 PICARD                             How long until the shock wave hits 
                            the observatory?

 WORF                             Four minutes, forty seconds.

                   Picard looks at Riker, who then quickly heads for the 
                   turbolift.

 RIKER                             Mister Worf.

 70 EXT. SPACE- THE STAR (VFX-I) 70 
                   The star is almost entirely dark. Radiating out from the

                   door suddenly opens. Soran whirls around and FIRES his 
                   phaser at Riker and Worf. They dive for cover just 
                   outside the room. (NOTE: The probe Geordi examined 
                   earlier is now gone.)

 RIKER                                      (to Worf)

                   Worf dodges another phaser blast and sees Geordi lying 
                   unconscious on the deck. Data is nowhere to be seen.

                   As before. ENSIGN HAYES is at Tactical. An ALARM 
                   suddenly BEEPS on the Tactical console.

 HAYES                                      (urgent)
                            Sir. A Klingon Bird of Prey is 
                            decloaking off the port bow.

                   Shocked reactions.

 PICARD                             What?

 73 EXT. SPACE (VFX-I) 73 
                   as an old-style Klingon Bird of Prey decloaks near the 
                   observatory.

 74 INT. OBSERVATORY PROBE ROOM (VFX-P) 74 
                   Soran is continuing to SHOOT at Riker and Worf. Riker 
                   suddenly notices something off-camera.

 74A RIKER'S POV 74A 
                   Data is huddled in a corner of the room, cowering in 
                   fear.

 74B NEW ANGLE (VFX-P) 74B 
                   The firefight continues.

 RIKER                             Data! See if you can get to 
                            Geordi!

                   Data looks up at him with a terrified look on his face.

 DATA                             I... cannot, sir. I believe I 
                            Am... afraid.

                   Suddenly Soran's communicator BEEPS. Soran reaches 
                   down and grabs the unconscious Geordi by the collar and 
                   the two of them DEMATERIALIZE. (Soran has the VISOR in
                   his hand.) Riker, Data and Worf react.

                   The Enterprise warps away just as the shock wave 
                   reaches the observatory and vaporizes it in a fiery 
 EXPLOSION. 
 CUT TO: 
 78 INT. KLINGON BIRD OF PREY - BRIDGE 78 
                   On a monitor where we can see a graphic depiction of 
                   the darkening star and shock wave. MOVE TO REVEAL

                   We are the inside an old Klingon ship - it's beaten up and 
                   patched in several places, obviously not a first-line 
                   model. Watching the Viewscreen are LURSA and B'ETOR, 
                   two powerful-looking Klingon women... They are sisters. 
                   aggressive... seductive... and very dangerous. Several N.D. 
                   male Klingons man the various stations.

                   The sisters stare at the image of the destroyed sun in 
                   awe.

 B'ETOR                             Toh-pak-cha... 
                            (Glorious...)

 LURSA                             HoS qorDu... 
                            (A great power...)

                   Soran now ENTERS the Bridge. His expression is dark 
                   and angry. He is clearly not a prisoner here and he 
                   strides up to the sisters.

 B'ETOR                                      (excited, to Soran)
                            You've done it, Soran.

                   But without warning, Soran HITS B'Etor squarely in the 
                   jaw, knocking her back over a console. Several 
                   Klingons leap to their feet, drawing their weapons...
                   but B'Etor holds up a hand as she gets to one knee.

 B'ETOR                             Wait!

                   She dabs a trickle of blood at the corner of her 
                   mouth... her expression is angry and threatening.

 B'ETOR                             I hope for your sake that you are 
                            initiating a mating ritual.
 SORAN                             You got careless. The Romulans 
                            came looking for their missing 
                            trilithium.

 B'ETOR                             Impossible. We left no survivors 
                            on their outpost.

                   B'Etor has now gotten to her feet in the b.g.

 SORAN                             They knew it was aboard the 
                            observatory. If the Enterprise 
                            hadn't intervened, they would have 
                            found it.

 LURSA                             But they didn't find it... and now 
                            we have a weapon of unlimited 
                            power.

 SORAN                             I have the weapon, Lursa. And if 
                            you ever want me to give it to 
                            you, I advise you to be a little 
                            more careful in the future.

                   B'Etor grabs Soran and holds a wicked-looking knife to 
                   his throat.

 B'ETOR                             Perhaps we are tired of waiting.

                   Soran is unfazed by this threat.

 SORAN                             Without my research... the
                            trilithium is worthless... as are 
                            your plans to reconquer the 
                            Klingon Empire.

                   Lursa reaches out and calmly pushes her sister's knife 
                   away.

 SORAN                             Set course for the Veridian 
                            system. Maximum warp.

                   A KLINGON GUARD ENTERS dragging the unconscious Geordi.

 KLINGON GUARD                             What shall I do with this?

                   Soran moves toward Geordi, a grim look on his face.
 SORAN                             Bring him with me. I need some 
                            answers from Mr. La Forge.

                   Soran EXITS.

                   Riker and Worf are on the move down the corridor.

 WORF                             I have spoken to the Klingon High 
                            Council, sir. They identified the 
                            Bird of Prey as belonging to the 
                            Duras sisters.

 RIKER                                     (surprised)
                            Lursa and B'Etor...? This doesn't 
                            make any sense. A renowned 
                            stellar physicist somehow uses a 
                            trilithium probe to destroy a 
                            star, kidnaps Geordi... and 
                            escapes with a pair of Klingon 
                            renegades... Why? What the hell's 
                            going on?

                   They EXIT to...

 81 INT. SICKBAY 81 
                   Worf and Riker ENTER. Beverly is closing a panel on 
                   the back of Data's head. He is sitting on a bio-bed, 
                   scanning himself with a tricorder.

 RIKER                             How is he?

 BEVERLY                             It looks like a power surge fused 
                            the emotional chip into his neural
                            net.

 WORF                             Will that be a danger to him?

 BEVERLY                             I don't think so. The chip still 
                            seems to be working. I'd feel 
                            better if I could take a closer
                            look, but I can't remove it 
                            without completely dismantling his 
                            cerebral conduit.

 RIKER                                      (to Data)
                            Looks like you're stuck with 
                            emotions for a while. How do you 
                            feel?

 DATA                             I am quite... preoccupied with 
                            concern about Geordi.

 RIKER                             We all are, Data. But we're going 
                            to get him back.

 DATA                             I hope so, sir.

                   Data's expression is still one of concern. Beverly 
                   pulls Riker aside.

 BEVERLY                             Wil, I checked into Doctor Soran's 
                            background.

                   Beverly activates the wall monitor and a picture of 
                   Doctor Soran along with some biographical information 
                   appears.

 BEVERLY                             He's an El-Aurian... over three 
                            hundred years old. He lost his 
                            entire family when the Borg 
                            destroyed his world. Soran 
                            escaped with a handful of other 
                            refugees aboard a ship called the 
                            Lakul. The ship was destroyed by 
                            some kind of energy ribbon, but 
                            Soran and forty-six others were 
                            rescued by the Enterprise-B.

 RIKER                                      (reacts)
                            That was the mission where James 
                            Kirk was killed.

 BEVERLY                             I checked the passenger manifest 
                            of the Lakul... guess who else was 
                            on board?

                   She hits a control and suddenly Guinan's face appears 
                   on the screen. Riker reacts to the image...

 CUT TO: 
 82 INT. GUINAN'S QUARTERS 82 
                   Close on Guinan as she looks up, surprised.

 GUINAN                             Soran? That's a name I haven't 
                            heard in a long time.

                   MOVE TO REVEAL Guinan's Quarters, which are unlike any
                   of the others on the Enterprise. None of the standard 
                   furniture, consoles or decoration are present. The 
                   floor is made of tile, not carpet... the walls are 
                   draped in exotic fabric. The lighting is moody and 
                   subdued.

                   Picard is standing before Guinan, who is sitting cross-
                   legged on the floor. They talk to each other with an 
                   easy familiarity... two old friends who know each 
                   other well.

 PICARD                             Do you remember him?

 GUINAN                             Oh yes. I remember everyone who 
                            was on the Lakul... every face.
                            even the ones who didn't make 
                            it...

                   Guinan stands and begins to move about the room...
                   she's clearly troubled by the memories. She hesitates, 
                   looks off into the middle-distance for a few moments. 
                   Picard moves to her.

 PICARD                             Guinan. It's important that you 
                            tell me what you know. We think 
                            Soran's developed a weapon... a 
                            terrible weapon. It might give 
                            him enough power to --

 GUINAN                             Soran doesn't care about power or 
                            weapons. All he cares about is 
                            getting back to the Nexus.

 PICARD                             What's the "Nexus"?

                   Guinan moves to a table and begins to shift around some 
                   exotic-looking alien artifacts... distracting 
                   herself... this is difficult for her to discuss.

 GUINAN                             It's a place I've tried very hard 
                            to forget...

                   She makes the decision to plunge ahead.

 GUINAN                             That ribbon isn't just some random 
                            energy phenomenon traveling 
                            through space... it's a doorway. 
                            It leads to another place... the 
                            Nexus. It doesn't exist in our 
                            Universe... and it doesn't play by 
                            the same rules either.

 PICARD                             What happened to you?

 GUINAN                             I can't remember very much... what 
                            it looked like or how long I was
                            there... but I do remember how it 
                            felt...

                   She turns to him and her face is filled with some kind 
                   of awe at the memory.

 GUINAN                             It was like being inside... joy. 
                            As if joy was a real thing that I
                            could wrap around myself. I've 
                            never been so content...

                   A long beat as Picard absorbs her words.

 PICARD                             But then you were beamed away...

                   Guinan shows a rare burst of anger.

 GUINAN                             I was pulled away. I didn't want 
                            to leave; none of us did. I felt 
                            like I'd left a part of myself 
                            behind. All I could think about 
                            was getting back... I didn't care 
                            what I had to do.

                   Guinan moves to a window and looks out at the stars.

 GUINAN                             It took a long time, but 
                            eventually I learned to live with 
                            it. And I began to realize that 
                            my experience in the Nexus had 
                            changed me...
                                     (beat)
                            I knew things about people...
                            about events...about time...

 PICARD                             Your "sixth sense"... I've always 
                            wondered where it came from...
                                     (beat) 
                            And what about Soran?

 GUINAN                             Soran may still be obsessed with 
                            getting back. And if he is, he'll 
                            do anything to find that doorway 
                            again.

 PICARD                             But why destroy a star...? 
                                     (beat) 
                            Thank you, Guinan.

                   He heads for the door.

 GUINAN                             Let someone else do it, Jean-Luc.

                   Picard stops, looks at her.

 GUINAN                             Let them send another starship. 
                            Don't get near the ribbon. If you 
                            go into that Nexus, you're not 
                            going to care about Soran or the 
                            Enterprise or me. All you're 
                            going to care about is how it 
                            feels to be there.
                                    (beat) 
                            And you're never going to come 
                            back.

                   Picard weighs her words... sees the warning in her 
                   eyes... and carefully backs away and EXITS.

 CUT TO: 
 83 INT. KLINGON BIRD OF PREY - QUARTERS (VFX-P) 83 
                   A dimly-lit room somewhere in the bowels of the Klingon 
                   ship. Like every other room on this decrepit ship, the 
                   room looks well-worn and ill-maintained. Soran is 
                   seated behind a table, holding the VISOR. A PADD and 
                   Soran's pocket watch sit on the table. Geordi is 
                   sitting in a chair across from him -- his shirt has 
                   been removed. He looks very tense.
 SORAN                                      (re: VISOR)
                            A remarkable piece of equipment...
                            but a little inelegant, wouldn't 
                            you say? 
                                     (beat) 
                            Have you ever considered a 
                            prosthesis that would make you 
                            look a little more... normal?

 GEORDI                             What's normal?

 SORAN                             Normal is what everyone else is...
                            and what you are not.

 GEORDI                             What do you want?

                   Soran takes a moment.

 SORAN                             As you may or may not be aware, I 
                            am an El-Aurian. Some people call 
                            us a race of "listeners". We 
                            listen. 
                                     (beat) 
                            Right now, Mr. La Forge, you 
                            have my undivided attention. I 
                            want to listen to everything you 
                            know about trilithium. and me.

                   Geordi thinks.

 GEORDI                             Trilithium is an experimental 
                            compound developed by the 
                            Romulans. I think it's a 
                            derivative of --

                   Soran picks up the PADD from the desk and activates it. 
                   Suddenly something small, with sharp edges, can be 
                   seen MOVING just underneath Geordi's skin near his 
                   chest. Geordi moves his hand to the spot, but then the 
                   protrusion is suddenly gone.

 SORAN                             I don't want a science lecture. 
                            You were on that observatory 
                            looking for trilithium... why?

 GEORDI                             I was ordered to by the Captain.

                   On the PADD in Soran's hand, we can now see an interior 
                   graphic of Geordi's body sitting in the chair. The 
                   graphic is interactive, moving as Geordi moves. 
                   A BLINKING DOT represents the movement of the probe 
                   inside his body. Right now, the dot is in the middle 
                   of his chest.

 SORAN                             Let's try to move beyond the usual 
                            prisoner-interrogator banter, 
                            shall we? You have information, 
                            and I need it. 
                                     (beat) 
                            Did the Captain explain his orders 
                            to you? Did he say why you were 
                            searching for trilithium?

 GEORDI                             No.

 SORAN                             What about... Guinan? What has 
                            she told you about me?

 GEORDI                             Guinan? I don't know what you're 
                            talking about...

                   On the PADD, we now see the dot has moved to a position 
                   next to Geordi's heart. Soran looks up at Geordi.

 SORAN                             My instincts tell me you're lying. 
                            And I know that can't be easy for
                            you... 
                                     (off PADD) 
                            I can see you have a good heart.

                   Soran taps a control on the PADD. Suddenly Geordi
                   grabs his chest in pain. Soran watches Geordi for a 
                   few seconds, then taps the PADD again. Geordi gasps 
                   and starts to breathe.

 SORAN                             Oh... I forgot to tell you. While 
                            you were unconscious, I injected 
                            a nano-probe into your 
                            bloodstream. It's been navigating 
                            your cardiovascular system... and 
                            right now I've attached it to your 
                            left ventricle. 
                                     (smiles) 
                            A little trick I picked up 
                            from the Borg.

 GEORDI                                      (gasping)
                            Yeah... they're full of great 
                            ideas.

 SORAN                             I just stopped your heart for five 
                            seconds. It felt like an 
                            eternity, didn't it? Did you know 
                            that you can stop the human heart 
                            for up to ten minutes before the 
                            onset of brain damage?

 GEORDI                             No... I didn't know that...

 SORAN                             We learn something new about 
                            ourselves every day. 
                                     (beat) 
                            Now. Maybe I didn't make myself 
                            clear. It is very important that 
                            you tell me exactly what Captain 
                            Picard knows.

 GEORDI                             I told you everything... you might 
                            as well just kill me right now...

                   Soran's features soften as he smiles slightly. For a 
                   moment, he looks genuinely compassionate -- and it's 
                   a disturbing contrast to his usual dark intensity.

 SORAN                             I'm not a killer, Mr. La Forge. 
                                     (beat) 
                            Let's try thirty seconds.

                   Soran taps a control on the PADD. Geordi gasps and 
                   strains against an unimaginable pain.

                   Soran picks up his pocket watch and opens the cover...
                   sits back in his chair, watching the seconds tick
                   away...

 CUT TO: 
 84 INT. STELLAR CARTOGRAPHY (VFX-P) 84 
                   A room filled with exotic-looking devices, sensors and 
                   computers which handle the enormous task of tracking 
                   the ship's position in space. 

                   The monitors around the room display various diagrams 
                   of the ENERGY RIBBON (as seen in the beginning of the 
                   film).

                   Data is sitting at a computer console which has a great 
                   deal of complex information on the screen. Picard is 
                   standing next to him. Throughout the following, Data 
                   seems distracted and preoccupied.
 DATA                             According to our information, the 
                            ribbon is a conflux of temporal 
                            energy which travels through our 
                            galaxy every thirty-nine point one 
                            years

 PICARD                             When is it expected back?

                   Data doesn't answer right away.

 PICARD                             Data?

 DATA                             Sorry, Captain. The Ribbon has 
                            already entered the galaxy. It 
                            will pass through this sector in 
                            approximately thirty-one hours.

                   Picard moves about the room... he's frustrated... 
                   tired... but determined to find out what's going on.

 PICARD                             Guinan said Soran was trying to 
                            get back to the ribbon... if 
                            that's true, then there must be 
                            some connection with the Amargosa 
                            star.

 DATA                             The star's destruction has had 
                            numerous astro-physical effects 
                            within this sector. However, none 
                            of them appear to have a 
                            connection to the energy ribbon.

 PICARD                             Give me a list of those effects. 
                            I want to know every single thing 
                            which has been altered or 
                            changed... no matter how 
                            insignificant...

 DATA                             It will take a few moments for the 
                            computer to compile the 
                            information.

                   Data works the computer and then the computer begins to 
                   work. Data sighs -- his expression becomes downcast 
                   and gloomy. He sits down and puts his head in his 
                   hands. Picard finally has to say something.

 PICARD                             Data, are you all right?

 DATA                             No, sir. I am finding it 
                            difficult to concentrate... I 
                            believe I am overwhelmed with 
                            feelings of... remorse and regret 
                            concerning my actions on the 
                            observatory.

 PICARD                             What do you mean?

 DATA                             I wanted to save Geordi... I 
                            tried. but I experienced 
                            something I did not expect. 
                                     (beat) 
                            I believe it was fear.

                   Picard regards him sympathetically.

 PICARD                             Fear is a very difficult emotion 
                            to overcome. It's something we 
                            all have to learn to deal with.

 DATA                             But I did not deal with it, sir. 
                            I let it prevent me from helping 
                            my friend. 
                                     (beat) 
                            Does that make me a coward?

 PICARD                             No. And what you must try to 
                            avoid is becoming consumed by 
                            another emotion which I believe 
                            you're beginning to experience...
                            guilt.

 DATA                                      (considers)
                            Guilt. It is a most unpleasant 
                            feeling.

                   The computer finishes its calculations and the console 
                   BEEPS. Data works the console. Information appears on 
                   screen.

 DATA                             According to our current 
                            information, the destruction of 
                            the Amargosa star has had the 
                            following effects in this sector: 
                            gamma emissions have increased by
                            five percent... the starship 
                            Bozeman was forced to make a
                            course correction... a research
                            project on Gorik Four was 
                            halted due to increased neutrino 
                            particles... ambient magnetic 
                            fields have decreased by --

 PICARD                             Wait. The Bozeman... why did it 
                            change course?

 DATA                                      (matter of fact)
                            The destruction of the Amargosa 
                            star has altered the gravitational
                            forces throughout the sector. Any 
                            ship passing through this region 
                            will have to make a minor course 
                            correction.

                   Picard is starting to get an idea... he's onto 
                   something here. He moves to a large table in the 
                   center of the room.

 PICARD                                      (musing)
                            A minor course correction...

                            Where is the ribbon now?

 84B ANGLE (VFX-P) 84B 
                   Data moves to the table to work. after a few beats, 
                   an elaborate map of the galaxy springs up on the 
                   ceiling of the room. A BLINKING DOT shows the position 
                   of the ribbon.

 DATA                             This is its current position.

 PICARD                             Can you project its course?

                   Data hesitates... still obsessed with his own emotional 
                   turmoil. Picard finally has to lay down the law.

 PICARD                                      (firm)
                            Data. I have nothing but sympathy 
                            for what you're going through. 
                            But right now, I need your full 
                            attention on the task at hand.  
                            If you can't provide it... then I'll 
                            have to relieve you of duty until 
                            Doctor Crusher can remove this.
                            emotion chip of yours. I'm sorry, 
                            but you leave me no other choice.

                   This snaps Data back... he considers this for a long 
                   moment, then looks  determined.

 DATA                             I do not wish to remove the chip, 
                            sir. Although these emotions are
                            proving difficult to deal with...
                            I cannot imagine going back to a 
                            life without them. I have taken 
                            an important step toward becoming 
                            truly human. If I were to turn 
                            back now...
                                     (beat) 
                            I would like to continue in my 
                            duties, sir.

                   Picard smiles at him.

 PICARD                             Courage is an emotion too, Data.

                            Now... can you project the course
                            of the ribbon?

 DATA                             I believe so.

                   Data works the console. A RED LINE moves to form an 
                   arc through the star field. Picard examines the display 
                   for a moment and nods... he's excited, on to 
                   something...

                   Data works and the display now ZOOMS into a single 
                   SECTOR. The RED LINE cuts through the sector.

 PICARD                             Where was the Amargosa star?

                   Data works. A STAR is highlighted near the red line.

 PICARD                             Now... you said the gravitational
                            forces in this sector have been 
                            altered... could that also affect 
                            the course of the ribbon?

 DATA                                      (thinks)
                            I believe so.

                   The red line representing the course of the ribbon now 
                   shifts to the right -- AWAY from the Amargosa star's 
                   position. Picard is beginning to realize what's going on.

 PICARD                             That's what Soran's doing... he's 
                            changing its course. 
                                     (beat) 
                            But why? Why try to alter its 
                            path... why not simply fly into it 
                            with a ship?

                   Data thinks for a moment.

 DATA                             Our records show that every ship 
                            which has approached the ribbon 
                            has either been destroyed or 
                            severely damaged.

                   Picard thinks about this... then has a flash of 
                   insight.

 PICARD                             He can't go to the ribbon... so 
                            he's trying to make the ribbon 
                            come to him.

                            Data, is it going to pass near any 
                            M-Class planets?

 DATA                                      (works)
                            Yes, sir. There are two in the 
                            Veridian system.

 84E ANGLE (VFX-P) 84E 
                   The display ZOOMS IN on a star very close to the 
                   ribbon's path. We now see a SOLAR SYSTEM with a single 
                   star and FOUR PLANETS. The RED LINE moves directly 
                   through the system -- it passes very close to the third
                   planet. Picard eyes that planet and points to it.

 PICARD                             It's very close to Veridian 
                            Three... but not close enough...

                   Picard's mind is going a mile a minute. He suddenly 
                   has a horrible realization.

 PICARD                             Data, what would happen to the 
                            ribbon's path if he destroyed the
                            Veridian star itself?

 84F ANGLE (VFX-P) 84F 
                   Data works. On the display, the Veridian star suddenly 
                   DARKENS and GOES OUT. The RED LINE shifts slightly 
                   until it makes an exact INTERSECTION WITH THE THIRD 
                   PLANET. They both react to this sight. they're both 
                   aware of just how serious this is.

 PICARD                             That's where he's going.

 DATA                             It should be noted, sir, that the 
                            collapse of the Veridian star 
                            would produce a shock wave similar 
                            to the one we observed at 
                            Amargosa.

 PICARD                                      (grim)
                            And destroy every planet in the 
                            system.

                   Picard eyes the graphic with a sense of dread.

 PICARD                             Are any of them inhabited?

                   determination in his every move.

 RIKER                             Maybe they're not out there.

 PICARD                             They're just trying to decide

                            the planet's ionosphere for an 
                            accurate reading.

                   Worf turns to Picard.

 WORF                             Sir, according to my calculations, 
                            a solar probe launched from either
                            the Klingon ship or the planet's 
                            surface will take eleven seconds 
                            to reach the star. 
                                     (beat) 
                            However, since we do not know the 
                            exact point of origin, it will 
                            take us between eight and fifteen 
                            seconds to lock our weapons onto 
                            it.

                   They exchange a grim look.

 RIKER                                      (quiet, to Picard)
                            That's a pretty big margin of 
                            error.

 PICARD                             Too big. How long until the 
                            ribbon arrives?

 DATA                             Approximately forty-seven minutes, 
                            sir.

 PICARD                                      (disturbed)
                            I have to find a way to get to 
                            Soran...

                   An alarm goes off on Worf's console.

 WORF                             Captain, Klingon vessel decloaking 
                            directly ahead.

 88A ANGLE (VFX-I) 88A 
                   On the view screen, the Bird of Prey decloaks.

 WORF                             They are hailing.

 PICARD                             On screen.

 88B ANGLE (VFX-P) 88B 
                   On the view screen, Lursa and B'Etor APPEAR.

 LURSA                             Captain. What an unexpected 
                            pleasure.

 PICARD                             Lursa, I want to talk to Soran.

 LURSA                             I'm afraid the Doctor is no longer 
                            aboard our ship.

 PICARD                             Then I'll beam down to his 
                            location. Just give us his 
                            coordinates.

 B'ETOR                             The Doctor values his privacy. He 
                            would be quite... upset if an 
                            Away Team interrupted him.

 PICARD                             Very well... I'll beam to your 
                            ship and you can transport me to 
                            Soran...

 RIKER                                      (urgent)
                            Sir, you can't trust them. 
                            They'll kill you just like they 
                            Killed Geordi.

                   Lursa and B'Etor exchange a glance.

 LURSA                                      (innocent)
                            We did not kill your Engineer. 
                            He's been... our guest.

 RIKER                             Then return him.

 B'ETOR                             In exchange for what?

 PICARD                             Me... If you let me speak to 
                            Soran.

                   The two sisters appear to consider this for a moment.

 B'ETOR                                      (to Lursa)
                            The Captain would make a much more 
                            valuable hostage.

 LURSA                                      (to Picard)
                            We'll consider it a prisoner 
                            exchange.

 PICARD                             Agreed.

                   The transmission ENDS. Picard heads for the Turbolift.
 PICARD                             Number One, you have the Bridge. 
                            Have Doctor Crusher meet me in
                            Transporter Room Three.

                   As Picard EXITS...

                   Picard stands on the platform. Crusher and NURSE OGAWA 
                   stand nearby. The TRANSPORTER CHIEF works his console.

 CHIEF                             Receiving the coordinates, Captain.

 PICARD                             Energize.

                   Picard DEMATERIALIZES -- and at the same instant, 
                   Geordi MATERIALIZES. Beverly and Ogawa rush to his 
                   aide, pull out their tricorders and scan him. Geordi
                   is conscious, and he's wearing his VISOR.

 CUT TO: 
 90 EXT. MOUNTAINTOP - DAY (VFX-P) 90                    A large plateau ringed with trees and underbrush. A 
                   single ROCK FACE juts upward, forming a backdrop for the 
                   plateau. Against the rock face, a large SCAFFOLDING has 
                   been erected -- planks and beams forming a complex 
                   structure -- ladders connect each level. It leads to 
                   a narrow ledge a dozen meters above.

                   Picard MATERIALIZES on the plateau. (NOTE: Picard's 
                   combadge is gone and he is unarmed.) A moment as he 
                   looks around. strange animals and birds can be heard. 

                   He turns and sees Soran standing nearby, calmly looking 
                   at his pocket watch. Soran puts the watch away.

 SORAN                             You must think I'm quite the 
                            madman.

 PICARD                             The thought had crossed my mind...

 SORAN                             The only possible reason you're 
                            here is because you're not 
                            entirely confident you can shoot 
                            down my probe after all. So 
                            you've come to dissuade me from 
                            my horrific plan. 
                                     (beat) 
                            Good luck.

                   Soran turns his back on Picard and walks away.

 90A ANGLE (VFX-P) 90A 
                   Picard takes a step to follow him and then is JOLTED
                   backward by a large FORCEFIELD which briefly flashes 
                   into view. The field completely surrounds the plateau, 
                   enclosing Soran and the scaffolding, with Picard on the 
                   outside. OFF Picard's surprise...

 LURSA                             Put it through over here.

                   Lursa and B'Etor move to one of the consoles with a 
                   large monitor. The screen shows STATIC for a few 
                   seconds, then clears to a distorted view of a CEILING
                   on the ENTERPRISE -- this is GEORDI'S POV. (NOTE: The 
                   POV is slightly fritzed, but free of the usual VISOR
                   effects.)

 LURSA                             It's working...

 B'ETOR                             Where is he?

                   Suddenly, Crusher's face looms large in the picture, as 
                   if she's leaning over Geordi. She smiles and starts 
                   talking. We can see her lips move, but we can't hear 
                   what she's saying.

 BEVERLY                                      (silent)
                            Don't worry, there's been no

                   Lursa and B'Etor pull back in surprise at the image.

                            you're going to be fine.

 GEORDI                             Thanks, Doc.

                   Picard is walking the perimeter of the invisible 
                   forcefield, looking for some way in. Soran is 
                   concentrating on his PADD as Picard tries to engage him 
                   on some level.

 PICARD                             You don't need to do this, 
                            Soran... I'm sure we could find 
                            another way to get you into this 
                            Nexus.

 93A ANGLE (VFX-P) 93A 
                   Soran gets up and works his control PADD. Suddenly a 
                   probe LAUNCHER DECLOAKS  in the middle of the plateau. 
                   The launcher is a cylindrical apparatus the size of a 
                   small car. 

                   Soran goes to the launcher, steps onto it and begins 
                   working the control panel.

 SORAN                                      (calm, distracted)
                            I've spent eighty years looking 
                            for another way, Captain. This is 
                            the only one. 
                                     (beat) 
                            Of course, you could always come 
                            with me. You fancy yourself an 
                            explorer. Here's a chance to 
                            explore something no human has 
                            ever experienced.

 PICARD                             Not if it means killing over two 
                            hundred million people. 
                                     (beat, then with 
                                      meaning) 
                            I wonder... did your wife Leandra 
                            know that she married a man who 
                            was capable of mass murder?

                   This has touched a nerve in Soran... something dark 
                   and ugly flickers across his face.

 PICARD                                      (continuing; pressing on)
                            When you tucked your children into 
                            bed... do you suppose they ever
                            suspected that their father would 
                            one day kill millions as casually 
                            as he kissed them goodnight?

                   Soran looks up at Picard... and for a moment we can see 
                   that Picard has really gotten to him here... then he 
                   finally smiles a smile that doesn't quite reach his 
                   eyes.

 SORAN                             Nice try.

 B'ETOR                             Then when is he going to

                   The POV shows Geordi's view as he stops in front of  
                   a mirror... wipes away the steam and reveals his own

                   frustration...

                   Soran is working intently on the Launcher's Control 
                   Panel. Picard is still walking the perimeter of the 
                   Forcefield. he's also still trying to engage Soran, 
                   find some way to get to him.
 PICARD                             What you're about to do is no 
                            different from when the Borg 
                            destroyed your world.

                   Soran continues to work... keeps his voice calm and 
                   conversational.

 SORAN                             You're right. And there was a 
                            time when I wouldn't have hurt 
                            anyone. Then the Borg came... and 
                            they showed me that if there is 
                            one constant in this universe, 
                            it's death. 
                                     (beat) 
                            Afterwards, I began to realize 
                            that none of it mattered. We're 
                            all going to die anyway. It's 
                            only a question of how and when. 
                            You will too, Captain. You might 
                            contract a fatal disease... you 
                            might die in battle...

                   Soran now turns and fixes Picard with a penetrating 
                   look.

 SORAN                             ... or burn to death in a fire.

                   Picard freezes at this. Soran steps off the launcher 
                   with a confident look... he moves closer to where 
                   Picard is standing.

 SORAN                             You looked surprised. But you 
                            shouldn't be. I've been to the 
                            Nexus, Captain. I know things 
                            about people. 
                                     (beat) 
                            Aren't you beginning to feel time 
                            gaining on you? It's like a 
                            predator. It's stalking you. You 
                            can try to outrun it with 
                            doctors... medicines.new 
                            technologies... but in the end, 
                            time is going to hunt you down...
                            and make the kill.

                   This strikes home with Picard's own recent concerns...
                   he struggles for a moment.

 PICARD                             We're all. mortal, Soran. It's 
                            one of the truths of our 
                            existence.

 SORAN                             What if I told you I found a new 
                            truth...

 PICARD                             The Nexus.

 SORAN                             Time has no meaning there. The 
                            predator has no teeth.

                   Soran glances up at the sky expectantly, then turns 
                   away from Picard and goes back to work on the Launcher. 
                   OFF Picard's disturbed expression...

                   Picard continues to walk around the perimeter of the 
                   forcefield. He sees something on the ground -- a 
                   GNARLED ROOT from a large nearby tree. The root is 
                   poking out of the ground, leaving a small arch through 
                   which daylight can be seen. Picard's mind begins 
                   racing... he glances at Soran and then picks up a 
                   pebble and, while keeping his eye on the root, he tosses 
                   the pebble into the air, where it HITS the forcefield. 

                   -- The forcefield FLASHES on briefly and Picard can see 
                      that the bottom border of the field follows the contour 
                      of the root. But it does not extend underneath the arch. 

                   -- Soran turns at the sound of the crackling field.

 SORAN                             Careful, Captain. That's a fifty 
                            gigawatt forcefield. I wouldn't 
                            want to see you get hurt.

 PICARD                             Thank you.

                   Soran returns to working on the Launcher. but Picard 
                   looks back down at the root... then walks away, 
                   planning his next move.

                   rounds a corner and enters Engineering.

                   Geordi is talking to an engineer named FARRELL, N.D.s 
                   working in b.g. Mid-conversation.

 FARRELL                             I'd like to run a Level Three

 GEORDI                             Okay, let's do it.

                   They both move to consoles...

                   As before. On the screen, we can now see several of the 
                   monitors in Engineering. On the left side of the 
                   screen is the large cutaway view of the Enterprise. 
                   Lursa suddenly reacts to something on the screen.

 LURSA                             That's it!

                   for a moment and then FREEZES. On the screen, we can 
                   see several of the monitors in Engineering. On the 
                   left side of the screen is the large cutaway view of

                   The sisters exchange an excited glance, then move 
                   toward the command area.

 B'ETOR                                      (calls out)

 WORF                             I do not see how. The plasma coil

                            Yes! If we sent a low-level ionic
                            pulse, it might reset the coil and 
                            engage the cloaking systems.

 WORF                                      (onto the idea)
                            As their cloak begins to engage, 
                            their shields will drop.

 RIKER                             Right. And they'll be vulnerable 
                            for at least two seconds.

                   Data goes to work.

 RIKER                             Worf, prepare a spread of photon

                            the instant they begin to cloak.

 WORF                             Aye, sir.

 RIKER                             We're only going to get one shot

                            Don't you have anything better to 
                            do?

                   Picard doesn't respond. Soran goes back to work.

                   Picard waits a moment, then takes aim and TOSSES
                   another pebble toward the root. This time, the pebble 
                   bounces underneath the arch and rolls onto the plateau -
                   inside the forcefield. Picard keeps his expression
                   neutral, but he's found a way in.

                   a unique and urgent ALARM is heard throughout the ship.

                   Soran is finishing his work on the launcher. On one of

                   graphics and numbers ticking by -- obviously a 
                   countdown in progress. Soran finishes and turns off 
                   the control panel. He steps down and looks over at 
                   Picard, who is standing near the forcefield.

 SORAN                             Now, if you'll excuse me, Captain, 
                            I have an appointment with

                   toward the top of the rock face. Picard watches him

                   Picard has dropped to the ground and is on his back -
                   he's trying to wriggle underneath the root. It's not 
                   easy. he knows there's not much room between the 
                   ground and the invisible field. he just gets his head

                   wrapped presents are clustered beneath the Christmas 
                   tree. There are FIVE CHILDREN standing and sitting in 
                   the room, all looking at Picard with bright, smiling 
                   faces, waiting for him to say something.

                   Picard stares at the scene for a moment, unsure how to 
                   react. Then we hear the woman's voice again, and we 
                   move to reveal an attractive WOMAN in her forties 
                   standing next to Picard.

 WOMAN                              Go on... say something. They're 
                             waiting.

                   Picard is stunned.

 PICARD                              I... don't know what to say...

                   One of the children, a young GIRL, speaks up.

 GIRL                              Say Merry Christmas, Papa!

 PICARD                                      (in a daze)
                             Merry... Christmas...

                   The children break out into applause. The woman kisses 
                   him on the cheek, then steers him to a large, 
                   overstuffed chair. Picard sits down and the 
                   children starts handing out presents with much laughter 
                   and chatting.

 CHILDREN                              This one's for you... where's 
                             mine?... I hope this is the book 
                             I asked for... take this one to 
                             Papa...

                   As the activity swirls around him, Picard begins to 
                   feel an immense  sense of satisfaction and happiness. 
                   It's like a drug -- an overwhelming feeling of joy and 
                   contentment fills Picard. It's a wondrous experience. 
                   He settles back in the chair and a smile spreads across 
                   his face. For reasons he cannot name and does not even 
                   want to understand at the moment, he is very, very 
                   happy.
 GIRL                                      (to Picard)
                             Isn't the tree beautiful, Papa?

                   Picard answers as if it were the most natural thing in 
                   the world.

 PICARD                              Oh yes... yes, it's astonishingly 
                             beautiful. All of it.

                   All of the children now crowd around the chair with a 
                   single large gift and hand it to Picard. One of the 
                   younger boys speaks up.

 YOUNG BOY                              This is from all of us.

 PICARD                              Thank you... I can't imagine what 
                             it is.

                   Picard tears open the box and pulls out a 19th century 
                   SEXTANT - an old-fashioned nautical navigational 
                   instrument. It's a beautiful piece with polished and 
                   gleaming brass.

 YOUNG BOY                                      (excited)
                             It's a sack-tent!

                   Picard eyes it with delight.

 PICARD                              You mean a sextant. And it's a 
                             handsome one at that... from about 
                             eighteen twenty, I'd say. 
                             Wherever did you find it?

 GIRL                              It's a secret.

 PICARD                                      (smiles)
                             Oh, a secret... well, that makes 
                             it a doubly special gift. Thank 
                             you... thank you all...

                   The children react with pleasure. They cluster around 
                   him, showering him with hugs and kisses.

 CHILDREN                              Merry Christmas, Papa... I love 
                             You, Father... etc.

                   Picard is covered in a blanket of love and affection. 
                   The children pull back and return to their own 
                   presents. There is a swirl of activity and commotion 
                   as a warm and heartfelt Christmas morning is played 
                   out.

 WOMAN                                      (to Picard)
                             I'll go get dinner ready.
                             they'll be starving in a minute.

                   Picard nods as the woman EXITS the room. He looks 
                   around the scene, utterly happy, utterly content.

                   The children continue to chatter and laugh among 
                   themselves as Picard's eye falls on the glorious 
                   Christmas tree. He can't help but smile as he looks 
                   over the ornaments and decorations...

 156 PICARD'S POV 156 
                   of the sparkling lights and ornaments -- a swirl of 
                   color and light.

 157 PICARD 157 
                   His eye is caught by something in particular on the 
                   tree. He leans forward slightly and stares at it.

 158 PICARD'S POV (VFX-P) 158 
                   His eye has been caught by an ORNAMENT near the 
                   top of the tree. It is a large and beautiful glass 
                   ball with a tiny LIGHT at the center in the shape of a 
                   star. As Picard watches, the star suddenly GOES OUT...
                   and it radiates a SHIMMERING LIGHT EFFECT that expands 
                   outward into the glass sphere.

                   It's a startling and beautiful ornament whose effect is 
                   reminiscent of the star going out, as seen earlier in the 
                   movie. But this is just coincidence. this is the way 
                   the ornament was designed and it's simply one of many 
                   ornaments on the tree.

 159 PICARD 159 
                   reacts. The image of the ornament has touched a nerve 
                   within him somewhere. It has reminded him of something 
                   he'd nearly forgotten - a discordant note in an 
                   otherwise wondrous and magical scene. He frowns, the 
                   reverie momentarily disrupted. But he tries to push it 
                   aside, not wanting the spell to be broken. He stands 
                   and turns away from the tree and looks out a nearby 
                   window -- it's snowing and the beautiful image of snow 
                   soothes him for a moment. Then he reacts to something.

 160 PICARD'S POV (VFX-P) 160                    reflected on the pane of glass is the image of the 
                   ornament -- it's still blinking. Picard now realizes 
                   that this image is not going to go away... he can't 
                   hide from it.

 PICARD                              No... this isn't right... this 
                             can't be real...

 GUINAN'S VOICE                              It's as real as you want it to be.

                   Picard turns to see

 161 GUINAN (VFX-P) 161 
                   standing before him. She is wearing the same outfit 
                   seen in the beginning of the movie on the Enterprise-B. 
                   As they talk, the children and the woman continue to 
                   move about their business as if Picard and Guinan 
                   aren't there.

                   Picard is stunned.

 PICARD                              Guinan... what's going on? Where 
                             am I?

 GUINAN                              You're in the Nexus.

                   Picard looks around.

 PICARD                              This... is the Nexus?

 GUINAN                              For you. This is where you wanted 
                             to be...

 PICARD                              But I never had a wife, children, 
                             a home like this...

 GUINAN                              Enjoy them, Jean-Luc...

                   Picard tries to make sense of it- he focuses on 
                   Guinan.

 PICARD                              Guinan, what are you doing here? 
                             I thought you were on the 
                             Enterprise.
 GUINAN                              I am on the Enterprise...I am 
                             also here. 
                                     (off his puzzled look) 
                             Think of me as... an "echo" of the 
                             person you know... a part of her
                             she left behind...

 PICARD                              Left behind...?

 GUINAN                              When the Enterprise-B beamed us 
                             off the Lakul, we were partially 
                             in the Nexus. The transporters 
                             locked on to us... but somehow 
                             everyone left a part of themselves 
                             behind.

 PICARD                              Soran...?

 GUINAN                              All of us.

 PICARD                              Where is he now?

 GUINAN                              Wherever he wanted to be...

                   Guinan smiles at him.

 BOY'S VOICE                              Papa, help me build my castle!

                   Picard glances over at the boy, who is building a play 
                   castle out of the 24th-century equivalent of "Lego". 
                   For a moment, Picard is tempted to drift back to the 
                   warm embrace of the fantasy...

 PICARD                                      (to boy)
                             In a few minutes...

                   Picard looks around at the children... the lure to stay 
                   here becoming more powerful.

 PICARD                                      (continuing, awed, to 
                                      Guinan)
                             These are my children... my 
                             children...

 GUINAN                                      (smiles)
                             Yeah. They're great, aren't they? 
                             You can go back and see them 
                             born... go forward and see your 
                             grandchildren... time has no
                             meaning here.

 WOMAN'S VOICE                              Dinner's ready! Let's go!

                   There's a general rush toward the adjacent dining room. 
                   The youngest boy looks at Picard, goes over to him and 
                   takes his hand.

 BOY                              Papa... are you coming?

                   Picard looks down into the face of his child. His 
                   heart swells, the temptation to stay here and live this 
                   out is profound. Almost in a trance, he takes a few 
                   steps with the child toward the dining room... His eye 
                   is caught again by the unusual ornament on the tree for a 
                   moment... torn between the two images. and then, in 
                   one of the most difficult moments of his life, he bends 
                   down to the child...

 PICARD                              Go on... go on without me...

                   The boy looks at him quizzically for a moment, then 
                   obeys his father and dashes off toward the dining room 
                   to join the others. Picard straightens up and tries to 
                   steel his voice.

 PICARD                              Guinan... can I leave the Nexus?

 GUINAN                              Why would you want to leave?

 PICARD                                      (insistent)
                             Can I?

 GUINAN                              Yes... where would you go?

 PICARD                              I don't understand.

 GUINAN                              I told you, time has no meaning 
                             here. If you leave, you can go 
                             anywhere... any time.

                   Picard realizes the opportunity before him.
 PICARD                              I know exactly where I want to 
                             go... and when. Back to that 
                             mountaintop on Veridian Three...
                             before Soran put out the star. I 
                             have to stop him.

 GUINAN                              What makes you think things will 
                             be any different this time?

 PICARD                              You're right. I'll need help. 
                                     (beat) 
                             Guinan, will you come back with 
                             me? Together, we could --

 GUINAN                              I can't leave. I'm already there, 
                             remember?

                   Picard looks crestfallen for a moment. Guinan gives 
                   him an enigmatic smile.

 GUINAN                              I know just the guy.

                   Suddenly there's the cry of a HAWK from offscreen. 
                   Picard turns at the sound --

 162 EXT. KIRK'S HOME - DAY 162 
                   Picard finds himself standing outside a rustic, but
                   Architecturally striking house with spectacular views 
                   in the Canadian Rockies. A hawk is circling overhead, 
                   making the crying sound that Picard heard. The air is
                   cold, frigid -- Picard can see his breath. Picard is 
                   just starting to adjust to this sudden change in 
                   location when he hears the sound of wood being CHOPPED
                   from around the corner of the house. Picard moves to 
                   look around the corner and sees -

                   James T. Kirk. He's still in his uniform and looks 
                   exactly as he did the last time we saw him aboard the  
                   Enterprise-B at the beginning of the film. He is 
                   vigorously chopping wood with an axe. He's enjoying 
                   himself, lost in the sheer pleasure of the manual
                   labor. He's never felt this good in his life. There's 
                   no trace of back pain or any other ailment. Picard 
                   recognizes the famous Captain - as would any 24
                   Century Starfleet officer.

 PICARD                              James Kirk.

                   Kirk pauses, looks up at the strange man before him. 
                   His expression is wondrous, almost child-like. Like in    
                   Picard's Christmas sequence, Kirk is immersed in the 
                   sensual feeling of the Nexus. It's like a dream that's
                   over-powered him.

 KIRK                              Beautiful day, isn't it?

 PICARD                              Yes... yes, it is.

                   Kirk points to a nearby log on the woodpile.

 KIRK                              Do you mind?

                   It takes Picard a beat before he realizes that Kirk 
                   wants him to put the log on the chopping block for him.

 PICARD                              Oh.

                   Picard places the log on the block and Kirk gives it a 
                   vigorous chop with the axe.

 PICARD                              Captain, do you realize what --

                   But Kirk interrupts as he sees something o.c.

 KIRK                              Wait a second. I think 
                             something's burning.

                   Picard follows his look to see SMOKE billowing out of 
                   one of the windows of the house. Kirk rushes into the 
                   house, and Picard follows...

 163 INT. KIRK'S HOME- KITCHEN - DAY - CONTINUOUS 163 
                   Kirk rushes in. The kitchen's decor is 19th century 
                   with a few 23rd Century touches -- copper pans and an 
                   antique stove mixed comfortably with computer consoles 
                   and Starfleet paraphernalia. Picard hesitates in the 
                   doorway -- a little unsure about rushing into some 
                   stranger's house.

                   Kirk yanks a burning frying pan of food off the stove. 
                   It's very hot -- he quickly sets it down near the sink, 
                   waves the smoke away with his hand. 

 KIRK                              Looks like someone was cooking 
                             eggs... 
                                     (to Picard) 
                             Come on in, it's all right. This 
                             is my house -- or at least it used 
                             to be, I sold it years ago.

                   Picard comes in and tries to orient Kirk to what's 
                   going on.

 PICARD                              I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the 
                             starship Enterprise.

                   Before Kirk can react to this remark, an antique CLOCK
                   on a shelf CHIMES as it strikes the hour. Kirk moves 
                   to the shelf and looks at the clock in surprise and 
                   wonder -- he is entranced by this experience, beginning 
                   to connect with things and memories from his past.

 KIRK                              This clock... I gave this clock to 
                             Bones...

 PICARD                                      (pressing on)
                             I'm from what you would consider 
                             the future... the twenty-fourth
                             century.

                   Kirk hears what Picard is saying, but like Picard in 
                   his fantasy, he is more interested in the sights and 
                   sounds around him. A dog barks from o.c. They both 
                   look as a large black dog bounds into the room and greets 
                   Kirk with enthusiasm.

 KIRK                                      (affectionately)
                             Jake! Jake, you miserable old 
                             Mutt... How can you be here? 
                                     (to Picard)
                             He's been dead seven years.

                   Kirk is still looking around the kitchen when suddenly we 
                   hear a WOMAN'S VOICE from somewhere upstairs that 
                   stops Kirk in his tracks. As she speaks, we can see 
                   the shock on Kirk's face.

 ANTONIA'S VOICE                              Come on, Jim, I'm starving. How 
                             long are you going to be rattling 
                             around that kitchen?

                   A beat.

 KIRK                                      (amazed)
                             That's Antonia...

                   Kirk looks at the food on the stove. He's beginning to 
                   realize something.

 KIRK                              Wait a minute...

                   Kirk glances at Picard.

 KIRK                              The future... what are you 
                             talking about? This is the 
                             past...

                   Kirk moves to a drawer and opens it. Inside is a 
                   HORSESHOE with a tiny red bow tied to it. This 
                   confirms things for Kirk. He picks up the horseshoe.

 KIRK                              This is nine years ago... the day 
                             I told her I was going back to
                             Starfleet...

                   Kirk is swept up in the moment, overwhelmed by 
                   memories, sensations, feelings. He goes back to the 
                   frying pan and looks at the contents with a sudden 
                   burst of recognition.

 KIRK                              These were Ktarian eggs -- her 
                             favorite.I was cooking them to 
                             soften the blow... 
                                     (re: horseshoe) 
                             And I gave her this.

                   Picard steps in.

 PICARD                              I know how real this must seem to 
                             you, but it's not. This isn't 
                             Really your house. We've both   
                             been caught up in some sort of 
                             temporal nexus.

                   But Kirk's mind is clearly elsewhere... he's being 
                   swept away by the emotion of the moment... realizing the
                   opportunity he suddenly has.

 KIRK                              Dill weed.

                   Kirk indicates a shelf, as if asking Picard to go to 
                   it.

 KIRK                              There's a bottle of dill weed on 
                             the second shelf to the left, 
                             right behind the nutmeg.

                   Kirk moves to the stove and tosses out the ruined eggs. 
                   He cracks open two new eggs on the skillet and begins  
                   preparing a breakfast. Picard waits for a moment, then 
                   goes to the shelf, grabs the dill weed and hands it 
                   to Kirk.

 PICARD                              How long have you been here?

                   Kirk takes the bottle and uses it to season the eggs.

 KIRK                              I don't know. I was on the 
                             Enterprise-B... in the deflector 
                             control room... keep stirring 
                             these, will you?

                   Kirk moves to a cabinet and begins putting plates on a    
                   breakfast tray. Picard is getting a little impatient, 
                   but stirs the eggs anyway.

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             The bulkhead in front of me 
                             Disappeared... then I was out 
                             there chopping wood. 
                                     (back to stove) 
                             Thanks.

                   Kirk takes the pan of eggs back from Picard.

 PICARD                              History records that you died 
                             saving the Enterprise-B from an 
                             energy ribbon eighty years ago...

                   But Picard's words mean almost nothing to Kirk. He is  
                   Thoroughly enjoying himself and Picard is almost a
                   distraction. Kirk begins serving the eggs onto the 
                   plates and grabs a small vase of flowers to put on the
                   tray.

 KIRK                                      (amused)
                             So you're telling me this is the 
                             twenty-fourth century... and I'm 
                             dead?
 PICARD                              Not exactly. As I said, this is 
                             some kind of...

 KIRK                              Temporal nexus... yeah, I heard you. 
                                     (frowns at tray) 
                             Something's missing...

                   Then he remembers and turns to look at a nearby toaster -- 
                   as if on cue, two slices of toast pop out. Kirk grins 
                   and puts the toast on the plates. Kirk picks up the 
                   tray and heads for the door.

 PICARD                              Captain, I need your help. I want 
                             you to leave the Nexus with me.

                   Kirk goes out of the kitchen and Picard follows...

 164 INT. KIRK'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS 164 
                   Kirk and Picard both on the move. Kirk heading for a 
                   staircase.

 PICARD                              We have to go back to a planet 
                             called Veridian III and stop a 
                             man from destroying a star. There 
                             are millions of lives at stake.

                   Kirk tries to keep it light, hoping this man will go 
                   away.

 KIRK                              You said history considers me 
                             dead. Who am I to argue with 
                             history?

 PICARD                              You're a Starfleet Officer and you 
                             have a duty to --

 KIRK                                      (hard)
                             I don't need to be lectured by 
                             you. I was out saving the galaxy 
                             when your grandfather was still in 
                             diapers. And frankly, I think the 
                             galaxy owes me one 
                                     (beat) 
                             I was like you once... so worried 
                             about duty and obligations that I 
                             couldn't see anything past this 
                             uniform. And in the end, what did 
                             it get me? Nothing. Not this 
                             time.

                   Kirk brushes past Picard and stops at the foot of the 
                   stairs.

 KIRK                                      (looking up the stairs)
                             I'm going to walk up these stairs, 
                             march into that bedroom and tell
                             Antonia that I want to marry her.

                   Kirk begins to climb the stairs.

 KIRK                               This time things are going to be 
                              different.

                   He goes through a bedroom door and closes it behind 
                   him. Picard glances around the room in frustration, 
                   then gets a determined look on his face and marches up 
                   the stairs after Kirk, grasps the doorknob, opens it 
                   and steps through the door into

 165 INT. BARN - DAY - CONTINUOUS 165 
                   Picard suddenly finds himself standing in the doorway 
                   of a wooden barn. Straw on the floor... farm 
                   implements on the walls... sunlight streaming in 
                   through the slats. There are stalls in the barn with 
                   a few horses visible. 

                   Kirk is standing a short distance away -- he looks 
                   surprised as well... and he is no longer holding the
                   tray of food.

 PICARD                                      (re: barn)
                             This doesn't look like your 
                             bedroom.

                   Kirk looks around for a moment, the pieces starting to 
                   fall into place. He smiles with a growing 
                   realization...

 KIRK                              No... no, it's not. It's better.

 PICARD                              Better?

 KIRK                              This is my uncle's barn in Iowa...

                   He points to a horse with a saddle on it.

 KIRK                                      (re: horse)
                             I took that horse out for a ride 
                             seven years ago... on a spring 
                             day.

                   Kirk moves to the barn door and opens it revealing a  
                   beautiful spring day.
 KIRK                              Just like this. If I'm right, 
                             this is the day I met Antonia.

                   He turns to Picard.

 KIRK                              This Nexus of yours is very 
                             clever. I can start all over 
                             again -- do things right from day 
                             one.

                   Kirk grabs the horse, swings up onto the saddle, and 
                   rides out of the barn, filled with excitement. Picard 
                   watches him for a moment, then looks at one of the 
                   other horses in the barn. he makes a decision and
                   then moves toward a saddle hanging on the wall...

                   Kirk is riding his horse hard over the countryside --
                   and across a stream... through a thicket of trees... and 
                   finally out onto a rolling plain. There is a large 
                   RAVINE up ahead. Kirk sees it and smiles tightly. He 
                   spurs his horse faster toward the ravine... The horse 
                   is tearing along... comes up to the edge of the 
                   precipice, and makes a daring leap to the other side.
                    Horse and rider land together and Kirk spurs the horse 
                   on. But as he rides, we begin to see a change come 
                   over him -- a look of doubt crosses his face. 
                   Something's not right. He slows the horse to a trot...
                   and then to a complete stop. He sits there for a 
                   moment and frowns. turns and looks back at the 
                   ravine, which is now a fair distance away. Something 
                   about that jump is nagging at him...

                   He turns his horse around and then digs in his heels. 
                   The horse breaks into a gallop, racing back toward the  
                   ravine. 

                   Kirk grips the reins tight in his hands and then the 
                   horse makes the LEAP across yet again.

                   This time when Kirk lands, he brings his horse to an   
                   immediate stop. We can see on his face that something 
                   is very wrong. He turns and stares at the ravine with 
                   a mixture of shock and sadness on his face.

                   In the distance, Picard can be seen approaching on a 
                   horse of his own. He stops next to Kirk. There is a 
                   long, quiet moment as the two men sit there side by 
                   side. Kirk is introspective as he sorts through his
                   feelings...

 KIRK                                      (re: ravine)
                             I must have made this jump fifty 
                             times. and every time it scared 
                             the hell out of me. But not this 
                             time.
                                     (beat) 
                             Because... it's not real.

                   A quiet beat. Kirk turns and looks toward a particular 
                   hill in the distance, shading his eyes against the 
                   bright sun. Picard follows his gaze and we can now see 
                   the distant figure of a WOMAN walking her horse.
 PICARD                                      (re: woman)
                             Antonia?

 KIRK                                      (nods)
                             She's not real either, is she? 
                             Nothing here is... nothing here 
                             matters...

                   All euphoria is now gone from Kirk -- It's a moment of 
                   self-revelation. He glances around.

 KIRK                              It's kinda like... orbital 
                             skydiving. Exciting for a few 
                             minutes... but in the end, you 
                             haven't really done anything...
                             you haven't made a difference...

                   Kirk takes a beat, then looks at Picard. And in a way, 
                   he's truly seeing him for the first time.

 KIRK                              Captain of the Enterprise, huh?

 PICARD                              That's right.

 KIRK                              Close to retirement?

 PICARD                              I hadn't planned on it.

                   There is a passion and a fervor in Kirk that we haven't 
                   seen until now.

 KIRK                              Well, let me tell you something - 
                             don't. Don't let them promote 
                             you... don't let them transfer 
                             you... don't let anything take you 
                             off the Bridge of that ship... 
                                     (beat) 
                             Because while you're there, you 
                             can make a difference.

                   The two captains face each other for a moment. Picard 
                   hears what Kirk is saying but also knows that's not the 
                   whole story. Picard gives him a direct look, and there 
                   is something in Picard's eyes -- a glint of resolve and  
                   determination.

 PICARD                              You don't need to be on the Bridge 
                             of a starship. Come with me. 
                             Help me stop Soran. 
                                     (beat) 
                             Make a difference again.

                   A long, silent beat as Kirk considers Picard. And slowly,  
                   unexpectedly, a smile spreads across his face.

 KIRK                              How can I argue with the Captain 
                             of the Enterprise? 
                                     (a beat)
                             What was the name of that 
                             Planet... Veridian III?

 PICARD                              That's right.

 KIRK                              I take it the odds are against us,
                             and the situation is grim?

 PICARD                              You could say that.

 KIRK                                      (musing)
                             Of course, if Spock were here, 
                             he'd say I was being an 
                             irrational, illogical human for 
                             wanting to go on a mission like 
                             that...

                   And for the first time, we can see the twinkle in his 
                   eye that tells us Jim Kirk is back.

 KIRK                              Sounds like fun.

                   The two men turn and walk away from Antonia.and as 
                   they walk, a ROAR OF COLOR AND SOUND WASHES OUT THE
                   SCREEN, as seen before.

 FADE TO RED 
 FADE IN: 
 167 EXT. MOUNTAINTOP - DAY (VFX-P) 167 
                   Soran is standing in front of the forcefield, facing 
                   Picard.

 SORAN                              Now, if you'll excuse me, Captain, 
                             I have an appointment with 
                             Eternity and I don't want to be 
                             late.

                   We realize we are watching the same events play out 
                   again.

                   Soran turns and begins to climb up the scaffolding 
                   toward the top of the rock face. Picard drops to the 
                   ground on his back and begins to wriggle underneath 
                   the forcefield. Picard accidentally TOUCHES the 
                   field...

 167A SORAN (VFX-P) 167A 
                   turns at the sound of the field, sees Picard, and then 
                   draws his weapon. Soran quickly FIRES at Picard.

 167B THE GROUND (VFX-P) 167B 
                   is BLASTED APART, creating a cloud of dirt and debris, 
                   obscuring Picard and the whole area momentarily.

                    -- Soran jumps down one level, his disruptor still in his  
                       hand, ready just in case Picard somehow survived. 

                   Soran peers through the cloud of dust and debris.
                     -- The dust CLEARS... but Picard is gone along with
                       several feet of the ground where he was crawling.

 167C SORAN (VFX-I) 167C 
                   Soran glances up at the sky and sees the ENERGY RIBBON,
                   then begins to climb the scaffolding. Suddenly a BOOT
                   kicks him in the head.

 168 REVEAL KIRK 168 
                   who is attacking Soran in Picard's place. The two men 
                   begin to fight.

 169 NEW ANGLE (VFX-P) 169 
                   as Picard rushes to the probe launcher and steps up 
                   onto the control platform and desperately begins trying 
                   to shut down the launcher...

                   The following happens very quickly:

                   -- Kirk fights with Soran, hand-to-hand, brutal.

                   -- Picard works the control panel, trying to make sense 
                      of it all. It won't respond. The control panel is 
                      bizarre and confusing -- many different screens and 
                      alien graphics. The alien countdown graphics continues 
                      to race by.

 169A THE SKY (VFX-I) 169A 
                   the distant energy ribbon can be seen getting closer...

 169B THE MOUNTAINTOP 169B 
                   Soran tries to pull his disruptor, but Kirk knocks it 
                   to the ground. There's a struggle for the weapon...

                   -- Picard looks helplessly at the control panel. 
                      Nothing he does has any effect. He keeps hitting 
                      buttons...looking for other control panels, anything 
                      to affect the launcher.

 169C ANGLE (VFX-P) 169C 
                   Suddenly, Picard touches one particular control and the 
                   screen CHANGES to an image of the Veridian SUN, held in 
                   the center of the alien CROSS-HAIR.

 169D PICARD (VFX-P) 169D 
                   begins working the control panel... desperate... he 
                   looks at the screen... hits a control. Suddenly the 
                   probe CLOAKS. Picard reacts at his mistake. Picard is 
                   left standing on an invisible platform three feet in 
                   the air -- a bizarre sight. Picard isn't sure what to 
                   do -- he can feel the console, but he can't see any of 
                   the controls.

                   -- Kirk punches Soran and sends him flying backward. 
                      Soran lands heavily on the ground, unconscious. Kirk 
                      stands over him, breathing heavily. He holds his back 
                      in pain -- that old back pain from the beginning of the
                      movie.

 PICARD                                      (desperate)
                             Kirk -- there's a control PADD in 
                             his right pocket!

 169E KIRK (VFX-P) 169E                    sees Picard standing in mid-air and then reaches down, 
                   pulls the control PADD out of Soran's pocket. He 
                   begins working it...

 170 CLOSE ON SORAN 170                    His eyes open... he sees what Kirk is doing... looks 
                   around quickly... sees the disruptor lying a few feet 
                   away, just beyond his reach...

 171 THE PROBE LAUNCHER (VFX-P) 171 
                   Decloaks. Picard goes back to working on the controls.

 171A KIRK (VFX-P) 171A 
                   he smiles.

 KIRK                              The twenty-fourth century isn't so 
                             tough.

                   Without warning, Kirk is BLASTED forward, shot from 
                   behind. Reveal Soran on the ground with the disruptor 
                   in his hand. He gets up, whirls around, points the 
                   weapon at Picard.

 172 MOUNTAINTOP - WIDE 172 
                   The probe is suddenly LAUNCHED in a roar of flame. 
                   Soran freezes. His eyes follow the probe as it arcs 
                   into the sky. The two men watch the probe as it heads 
                   toward the sun...

 172A THE PROBE (VFX-I) 172A 
                   makes a sweeping turn to the right and arcs back down 
                   toward the planet. Soran watches in horror as the 
                   probe crashes harmlessly into the distant jungle. We 
                   hear a muffled explosion.

 172B SORAN (VFX-I) 172B 
                   can't believe his dreams have been shattered. He looks 
                   into the sky and sees the distant ribbon streaking 
                   overhead. The disruptor falls from his hand as he 
                   rushes to the top of the scaffolding.
 173 PICARD 173 
                   moves to Kirk, checks his pulse. The Captain's eyes 
                   flutter -- he's still holding on, but he's badly 
                   wounded.

 174 SORAN (VFX-I) 174 
                   is standing on the rock ledge. He reaches up toward 
                   the sky as if trying to grab the Ribbon with his bare
                   hands...but the ribbon passes by and disappears.

 SORAN                              No...

                   His look of shock turns to fury and madness. He turns 
                   to Picard.

 SORAN YOU!! 
 174B NEW ANGLE (VFX-P) 174B 
                   He jumps down a few levels and then DIVES off the 
                   scaffolding at Picard. But Picard is quicker. He 
                   GRABS the disruptor and FIRES -- the BLAST CATCHES
 SORAN IN MID-AIR . 
                   Soran drops to the ground a short distance away. Dead. 
                   The pocket watch has been shattered.

 175 PICARD 175 
                   turns back to Kirk, cradles the dying man's head in his 
                   lap. Kirk's eyes flick open, and he takes a ragged 
                   breath.

 KIRK                              Nice shot.

                   Kirk coughs. His eyes flutter. He's fading fast.

 PICARD                              I'll find a way to contact the 
                             Enterprise. You're going to be 
                             all right.

 KIRK                              Did we do it? Did we make a 
                             Difference...?

 PICARD                              Yes. 
                                     (beat) 
                             Thank you.

 KIRK                              Least I could do...for a Captain 
                             of the Enterprise.

                   Kirk coughs again

 PICARD                              Try to hang on.
                    Kirk looks up at the sky. the sunlight is warm on his 
                   face. A quiet moment... then, with a last smile on his 
                   face

 KIRK                              It was fun.

                   Kirk dies.

                   Hold te scene for a long moment, the two men in the 
                   quiet clearing.

 DISSOLVE TO: 
 176 EXT. MOUNTAINTOP - SUNSET 176

                   as he places a stone on a large pile of other stones. 
                   MOVE TO REVEAL that Picard is placing the final few 
                   rocks on Kirk's grave.

                   He reaches into a pocket and pulls out Kirk's command
                   insignia pin. He carefully places it on the grave...
                   and stands there silently for a few moments.

                   A distant WHINE of engines can be heard. Picard looks 
                   up into the sky...

 177 PICARD'S POV (VFX-I) 177 
                   An Enterprise SHUTTLECRAFT is flying through the sky 
                   toward the mountaintop.

 178 EXT. MOUNTAINTOP - SUNSET 178 
                   The shuttle has just landed, and the door OPENS as 
                   Picard enters the clearing. Worf, Geordi and N.D. 
                   security guards jump out to meet him.

 WORF                              Captain, are you all right?

 PICARD                              Yes.

 LA FORGE                              What about Doctor Soran?

 PICARD                              You needn't worry about the Doctor 
                             anymore.

                   Picard moves toward the shuttle... then stops as he 
                   notices that the shuttle is damaged. Picard turns and 
                   notices for the first time that La Forge has a bandage on 
                   his face and Worf's uniform is torn.

 PICARD                              Was there a problem with the 
                             Klingons?

                   Worf and La Forge exchange a look.

 GEORDI                              You could say that...

                   A hive of activity -- Crewmembers moving about, 
                   carrying personal effects, equipment, etc. Some 
                   wounded people being carried on stretchers...

                   The corridor is lit by emergency beacons and a HATCH
                   has been opened at one end of the Corridor leading to 
                   the exterior of the ship. Daylight and jungle can be

 PICARD (V.O.)                                      (continuing)
                             Our casualties were light. but
                             unfortunately the Enterprise

 OGAWA                              That should be the last of the wounded,

                             Save that stretcher...

 OGAWA                              Is there another patient?

                   Data and Troi are looking through rubble in a different 
                   section of the ship with tricorders. Troi reacts to 
                   something on the tricorder.

 TROI                              Over here, Data! I think I've 
                             found something.

                   He picks up the cat and holds it close, stroking its 
                   fur. The cat purrs happily.

 DATA                              I am very happy to find you, Spot.

                   Troi smiles.

 TROI                              Another family reunited.

                   Troi is surprised and touched at the sight.

 TROI                              Data... are you all right?

 DATA                              I am not sure, Counselor. I am

 TROI                              No, Data... I think it's working 
                             perfectly.

 183 INT. READY ROOM - DAY 183 
                   Picard and Riker are sifting through the rubble of what 
                   once was the Ready Room, looking for something...

                   Riker sees something in the rubble.

 RIKER                              Is this it?

                   Riker holds up the family photo album seen earlier.

 PICARD                                      (relieved)
                             Yes, Number One. Thank you.

                   He takes the album... brushes off the dust and flips 
                   through the pages for a moment. Riker looks around the  
                   wrecked room.

 RIKER                              I'm going to miss this ship. She 
                             went before her time.

                   Picard has been rejuvenated by his experience... given 
                   a new perspective on the issues of life and death.

 PICARD                              It's not how many years you've 
                             lived, Wil... but how you've lived 
                             them.

                             Someone once told me that time is 
                             a predator that stalks us all our 
                             lives. But maybe time is also a 
                             companion who goes with us on 
                             our journey, and reminds us to 
                             cherish the moments of our 
                             lives... because they will never

                   A quiet moment... Riker finally smiles.

 RIKER                              Speak for yourself, sir. I kinda 
                             planned on living forever.

                   Picard smiles back at him and the two men EXIT to...

 184 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - DAY (VFX-P) 184 
                   Riker and Picard ENTER from the Ready Room. They look 
                   around the wrecked Bridge for a moment. Riker glances 
                   at the captain's chair.

 RIKER                              I always thought I'd have a crack 
                             at this chair one day.

 PICARD                              You may still... somehow I doubt 
                             this will be the last ship to 
                             carry the name Enterprise.

                   A beat, then Picard hits his combadge.

 PICARD                                      (continuing, to com)
                             Picard to Farragut. Two to beam 
                             up.

 FADE IN: 
 1 EXT. SPACE (VFX-I) 1 
                   A vast and sparkling starfield. A pinpoint of LIGHT 
                   appears and starts moving toward the camera... a small 
                   and distant cylindrical object tumbling end over end, 
                   but we can't determine exactly what it is yet...

 2 EXT. WHEATFIELD - DAY 2 
                   A vast and undulating sea of wheat. We become aware 
                   that there are two HEADS sticking out of the stalks of 
                   wheat: two men are standing and looking up at the 
                   sky. As we move towards them,  we begin to hear their
                   conversation...and we can see that the two men are 
                   SCOTTY and CHEKOV, dressed in civilian clothing.

 CHEKOV                                      (points to sky)
                             There he is -- there, to the 
                             South!

 SCOTTY                                      (peers upward)
                             What are ye, blind? That's a 
                             bird.

                   As they stare up at the sky...

 3 EXT. SPACE (VFX-I) 3 
                   The cylinder tumbling through space is now closer, and 
                   we can now see that it is a BOTTLE of some sort, and it 
                   is tumbling directly toward the camera...

 4 EXT. WHEATFIELD- DAY 4 
                   As before, Chekov and Scotty staring at the sky.

 SCOTTY                                      (concerned)
                             Repelling the Crystalline 
                             Trench... rafting down lava 
                             flows... orbital skydiving. it's 
                             like the man is running a bloody 
                             decathlon across the galaxy.

                   Suddenly we hear a double SONIC BOOM.

 CHEKOV                                      (re: sound)
                             That should be him now. I think 
                             he's just crossed the sound 
                             barrier.

                   They shield their eyes against the sun and look up.

                   The bottle gets CLOSER...

 6 EXT. WHEATFIELD - DAY 6 
                   A man in a high-tech body harness and parachute LANDS 
                   in the wheat flat on his back. His body-suit is 
                   charred, scorched, wisps of smoke still curling off of
                   it. There are small thrusters attached to his backpack 
                   and boots. Scotty and Chekov move to him. The man 
                   removes his helmet. Revealing that it is KIRK. He 
                   smiles broadly, like a child who has just come off a
                   roller-coaster.

 KIRK                              Right on target! I jump out over 
                             the Arabian Peninsula... and I end 
                             up here, right on the dime.

                   Kirk gets to his feet.

 CHEKOV                              Actually, Captain, your precise 
                             target area was thirty-five 
                             meters...
                                     (points)
                             That way.
 KIRK                              Thanks for pointing that out.

                   Kirk starts to pull off his suit, reacts to a sudden 
                   pain in his back.

 KIRK                              Oh...

 SCOTTY                              I've warned ye about that back of 
                             yours. You should have a doctor 
                             take a look at it.

                   Kirk waves him away, and continues to remove his 
                   harness.

 6A EXT. SPACE (VFX-I) 6A 
                   The tumbling bottle rushes past, and we can now see 
                   that it is a CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE - Dom Perignon, 2265. 
                   Follow the bottle as it tumbles through space...

 6B EXT. WHEATFIELD - DAY 6B                    Kirk, Scotty and Chekov as before.

 KIRK                              Tomorrow I want to make a tri-
                             elliptical jump. That's where you 
                             jump out over Northern China, and 
                             make three complete orbits before 
                             you start re-entry...

 CHEKOV                              Captain. Perhaps you have 
                             forgotten that tomorrow is the 
                             christening ceremony.

                   This strikes a nerve with Kirk -- we see a flash of
                   hesitation and irritation cross his face.

 KIRK                              I'm not going.
                                     (beat) 
                             Scotty, help me with this chute.

 SCOTTY                              What do you mean, you're not 
                             going? We promised.

 KIRK                              When I retired, I swore I'd never 
                             set foot on a starship again, and 
                             I meant it.

 CHEKOV                              Captain...

 KIRK                                      (firm)
                             I don't want to hear anymore about 
                             it. I'm not going, and that's 
                             final.

 7 EXT. SPACE (VFX-I) 7 
                   The champagne bottle SMASHES onto the bow of a 
                   Federation starship(Excelsior class) sitting in its 
                   dock in orbit around Earth.

 7A EXT. SPACE (VFX-I) 7A 
                   FOLLOW the shards of glass from the bottle as they 
                   spread over the ship...revealing the name on the hull: 
 U.S.S. ENTERPRISE NCC-1701-B. 
 8 ANGLE ON SPACEDOCK WINDOW 8 
                   A large picture window overlooking the starship in its 
                   berth. The window is filled with people in Starfleet 
                   uniforms, applauding the christening of the ship (but 
                   we hear nothing).

 8A INT. SPACEDOCK OBSERVATION ROOM (VFX-I) 8A                    The people are still applauding and we can see that 
                   they are looking out over the ship in its berth.

 8B EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE-B IN SPACEDOCK (VFX-I) 8B 
                   The great ship sits in spacedock.

 9 INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE 9 
                   CLOSE ON A SET OF TURBOLIFT DOORS as they slide open to 
                   reveal Kirk, Scotty and Chekov. A bright light shines 
                   into their faces and they react. MOVE TO REVEAL -
                   that the bright light is coming from a futuristic
                   CAMERA with a small bank of lights attached to it. The 
                   camera is a holographic recorder with two lenses and is 
                   worn on an operator's head. There are four JOURNALISTS 
                   clustered in front of the Turbolift -- one associated 
                   with the camera, the others using PADDS to make 
                   notations.

                   Also clustered around the door are the BRIDGE CREW of 
                   the Enterprise-B. Everyone is APPLAUDING as Kirk and 
                   the others blink under the bright lights and ENTER the
                   Bridge.

 JOURNALISTS                                      (overlapping)
                             Captain Kirk, how does it feel 
                             to be back on the Enterprise 
                             Bridge... Captain, can I have a 
                             Minute... Captain Scott, do you 
                             have any comment on... Commander
                             Chekov... etc.

                   CAPTAIN JOHN HARRIMAN pushes through the crowd.

 HARRIMAN                              Excuse me, excuse me...there will 
                             be plenty of time for questions
                             later...

                   The journalists edge away, and the cameraman moves to 
                   get a good angle.

 HARRIMAN                                      (continuing, to all)
                             I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd 
                             like to welcome you all aboard.

 KIRK                              It's our pleasure.

                   Harriman is young, confident, eager -- this is his 
                   first command and he takes it very seriously.

 HARRIMAN                              I just want you to know how 
                             excited we all are to have a group 
                             of living legends with us on our 
                             maiden voyage. 
                                     (beat) 
                             I remember reading about your 
                             missions when I was in grade 
                             school.

                   The original Enterprise officers all stop and give him 
                   a look. Harriman looks a little embarrassed -- he 
                   didn't mean to insult them. But Kirk gives him a
                   little smile, lets it roll off. 
 KIRK                              Well... may we have a look around?

 HARRIMAN                              Please... please.

                   Chekov sees someone in the background, calls out to 
                   her.

 CHEKOV                              Demora!

                   Chekov moves off.

 JOURNALIST                                      (breezy)
                             So, Captain... this is the first 
                             Starship Enterprise in thirty 
                             years without James T. Kirk in 
                             command. How do you feel about 
                             that?

                   The Journalist has unknowingly touched a nerve. Kirk's 
                   eyes flash for a moment -- the longer he's on this 
                   Bridge, the more he realizes he doesn't feel good about 
                   it at all. He tries to shrug it off with a smile.
 KIRK                              Just fine. I'm glad to be here to 
                             send her on her way...

                   He tries to move away from the Journalist, who dogs 
                   him.

 JOURNALIST                              What have you been doing since you 
                             retired?

 KIRK                              I've been... keeping busy.

                   At this point, Chekov approaches with a young, (mid-
                   twenties) attractive, Asian female Ensign named DEMORA.

 CHEKOV                                      (to Kirk)
                             Excuse me, Captain. I'd like you 
                             to meet the Helmsman of the
                             Enterprise-B. Ensign Demora Sulu --
                             Captain James Kirk.

 DEMORA                              It's a pleasure to meet you, sir. 
                             My father's told me some...
                             interesting stories about you.

                   Kirk is shocked. For a long moment, he stares at her 
                   in amazement.

 KIRK                              Your father... Hikaru Sulu is your 
                             father?

 DEMORA                              Yes, sir.

 CHEKOV                              You met her once before, but she 
                             was...

                   Chekov holds out his hand and indicates a very short 
                   height.

 KIRK                              But that wasn't so long ago... it 
                             couldn't have been more than...

 CHEKOV                              Twelve years, sir.

 KIRK                              Yes... well... congratulations, 
                             Ensign. It wouldn't be the 
                             Enterprise without a Sulu at the 
                             helm.

 DEMORA                              Thank you, sir. 
                                      (to Chekov) 
                             Let me show you the new inertial 
                             guidance system.

                   Demora and Chekov move off and Kirk looks after them 
                   for a long beat. The expression on his face changes 
                   from shock to sadness... Something is clearly 
                   bothering him. 

                   Scotty moves over to Kirk, with a smile on his face.

 SCOTTY                                      (to Kirk)
                             Damn fine ship if you ask me...

                   But Kirk's mind is still on Demora. He watches her as 
                   she moves to the Helmsman's position.

 KIRK                              You know, Scotty... it amazes me.

 SCOTTY                              And what would that be, sir?

 KIRK                              Sulu. When did he find the time 
                             for a family?

 SCOTTY                              It's like you always said -- if 
                             something's important enough, you 
                             make the time.

                   Kirk nods absently. Scotty realizes something...

 SCOTTY                              So... that's why you've been 
                             running around the galaxy like an
                             eighteen-year-old. Finding 
                             retirement a little lonely, are we?

                   Kirk gives him a look.

 KIRK                              With that kind of tact, I'm glad 
                             you're an engineer and not a
                             psychiatrist.

                   Harriman interrupts.

 HARRIMAN                              Excuse me, gentlemen... if you'll 
                             take your seats.

 KIRK                              Oh... of course.

 10 NEW ANGLE 10 
                   Revealing that three CHAIRS have been neatly arranged 
                   to one side.

                   Scotty, Kirk and Chekov all take their seats. The 
                   Journalists take positions on the opposite side of the 
                   Bridge. Harriman moves to the command chair and the 
                   rest of the Bridge crew go to their stations.

 HARRIMAN                                      (to all)
                             Prepare to leave spacedock. Aft 
                             thrusters ahead one quarter, port 
                             and starboard at station keeping. 
                                     (beat) 
                             Captain Kirk, I'd be honored if 
                             you would give the order to get 
                             underway.

 KIRK                              No... no. Thank you.

 HARRIMAN                              Please, I insist.

                   All eyes on Kirk -- he has little choice. He stands 
                   uncomfortably. There is a moment of anticipation.

 KIRK                                      (to all)
                             Take us out.

                   Everyone breaks into APPLAUSE. Kirk sits down in 
                   acute embarrassment and  annoyance.

 CHEKOV                                      (sotto)
                             Very good, sir.

 SCOTTY                                      (sotto)
                             Brought a tear to my eye.

 CUT TO: 11 EXT. SPACE- ENTERPRISE-B (VFX-I) 11 
                   The great ship majestically LEAVES the dock, and heads 
                   out into open space, passing DIRECTLY OVERHEAD.

 12 INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE 12 
                   A short time later. Harriman turns to his guests.

 HARRIMAN                              Well... we've just cleared the 
                             asteroid belt. Our course will 
                             take us out beyond Pluto and then 
                             back to spacedock. Just a quick 
                             run around the block. 
                                     (beat) 
                             If we have time, we'll conduct a 
                             few tests of the warp --

                   Suddenly the communications console starts to BEEP. 
                   The COM OFFICER hits a few commands in response.

 COM OFFICER                                      (to Harriman)
                             We're picking up a distress call, 
                             Captain.

                   This grabs everyone's attention.

 HARRIMAN                              On speakers.

                   We hear the voice of a crewmember who sounds panicked 
                   and urgent.

 COM VOICE                                      (fritzed)
                             This is the transport ship Lakul. 
                             We're caught in some kind of
                             energy distortion. We can't break 
                             free... need immediate help... 
                             It' tearing us --

                   The voice is drowned out by STATIC. The SCIENCE 
                   OFFICER checks something on his console. The 
                   Journalist with the Holo-camera turns on his light and 
                   pans it around to capture the action.

 SCIENCE OFFICER                              The Lakul is one of two ships 
                             transporting El-Aurian refugees to 
                             Earth.

                   Harriman blinks a couple of times, surprised at this 
                   unexpected turn of  events. Kirk watches him intently. 
                   Harriman clears his throat, then turns to Demora.

 HARRIMAN                              Can you locate them?

 DEMORA                              The ships are bearing at three one
                             zero mark two one five. Distance:
                             Three light years.

 HARRIMAN                              Signal the closest starship. 
                             We're in no condition to mount a 
                             rescue... We don't even have a 
                             full crew aboard.

                   The NAVIGATOR checks his console.

 NAVIGATOR                              We're the only one in range, sir.

                   The Holo-camera light is shined on Harriman as he 
                   shifts in his seat, hesitant to take the plunge. Kirk 
                   is drumming his fingers impatiently on his leg. 
                   Finally, Harriman takes a breath and straightens his 
                   jacket a bit.

 HARRIMAN                              Well, then... I guess it's up to 
                             us. 
                                      (to Demora) 
                             Helm, lay in an intercept course 
                             and engage at maximum warp.

                   Kirk fidgets in his chair, itching to get in on the 
                   action - his instincts taking over. Scotty shoots him 
                   a side-long glance.

 SCOTTY                              Is there something wrong with your 
                             chair, Captain?

                   Kirk gives him a look.

 13 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE-B (VFX-I) 13 
                   The ship snaps into warp.
 14 INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE 14 
                   A few minutes later. Demora is watching her console.

 DEMORA                              We're within visual range of the 
                             energy distortion, Captain.

 HARRIMAN                              On screen.

 15 INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (VFX-I) 15 
                   Which now shows a HUGE RIBBON OF CRACKLING ENERGY 
                   directly ahead of the Enterprise-B. 

                   Everyone reacts to the bizarre sight.

 CHEKOV                              What the hell is that?

 DEMORA                                      (off console)
                             I've found the transport ships.

 15A INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (VFX-I) 15A 
                   The Viewscreen now shows TWO TRANSPORT SHIPS trapped 
                   like insects in the violent torrent of energy. The 
                   ships are being buffeted and thrown about by large 
                   TENDRILS of CRACKLING ENERGY.

 DEMORA                                      (cont'd)
                             Their hulls are starting to buckle 
                             under the stress -- they won't 
                             survive much longer.

                   The ship suddenly SHAKES. The Navigator works his 
                   console.

 NAVIGATOR                              We're encountering severe 
                             gravimetric distortions from the 
                             energy ribbon.

 HARRIMAN                              We'll have to keep our distance...
                             we don't want to get pulled in
                             too...

                   Harriman frowns at the screen, trying to figure out 
                   what to do. Kirk can barely contain himself -- to him 
                   the answer is obvious. He blurts out the answer --

 KIRK                              Tractor beam...

                   Scotty quickly elbows him in the side -- this isn't 
                   Kirk's ship. Kirk shuts up.  Harriman glances at Kirk.

 HARRIMAN                              We don't have a tractor beam.

 KIRK                              You left spacedock without a 
                             tractor beam?

 HARRIMAN                              It won't be installed until 
                             Tuesday. 
                                     (beat) 
                             Ensign Sulu... try generating a 
                             subspace field around the ships. 
                             That might break them free.

 DEMORA                              Aye, sir.

                   When Kirk hears this order, he shakes his head slightly 
                   and mouths the word "no" under his breath. He knows 
                   that won't work.

 DEMORA                                      (continuing; shakes her 
                                      head)
                             There's too much quantum 
                             interference, Captain.

                   Harriman frowns again, trying to come up with another
                   solution, but it isn't easy -- it's his first day in 
                   command; his ship is under-manned and ill-prepared. 
                   It's a nightmare come true. Kirk is itching to get in 
                   On this, his fingers digging into the arms of his chair --
                   but he restrains himself.

 HARRIMAN                              What about... venting plasma from 
                             the warp nacelles? That might 
                             disrupt the ribbon's hold on the 
                             ships.

 NAVIGATOR                              Aye, sir.. releasing drive 
                             plasma...

                   A tense beat. Harriman glances over at the 
                   journalists, then glances over at Kirk. Kirk gives him 
                   a pained smile, trying to be encouraging even though he 
                   knows this is not the right course of action.

 NAVIGATOR                                      (continuing)
                             It's not having any effect, sir. 
                             I think --
 DEMORA                              Sir! The starboard vessel's hull 
                             is collapsing --
 15B INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (VFX-I) 15B 
                   Suddenly the right-hand ship on the screen is engulfed 
                   by a fiery TENDRIL of energy and it EXPLODES. The 
                   other ship continues to be thrown about and buffeted. 
                   Everyone reacts with shock on the Bridge.

 CHEKOV                              How many people were aboard 
                             that ship?

 DEMORA                              Two hundred sixty-five.

                   Harriman pales at the sight... seems shell-shocked by 
                   the destruction of the ship. He's overwhelmed now, at 
                   a genuine loss as to what to do next.

 DEMORA                                      (urgent)
                             The Lakul's hull integrity is down 
                             to twelve percent, sir.

                   Harriman looks over at Kirk, who has remained quiet 
                   during this entire sequence only through great effort 
                   and out of deference to the young Captain. This is a 
                   delicate moment -- Harriman doesn't want to look 
                   incapable, but at the same time, he needs help.

 HARRIMAN                              Captain Kirk... I would appreciate 
                             any... suggestions you might have.

                   Kirk is out of his chair like a cork out of a bottle. 
                   He moves down to stand next to Harriman.

 KIRK                                      (sotto)
                             First -- move us within 
                             transporter range and beam those 
                             people to the Enterprise.

                   Harriman looks at him with surprise.

 HARRIMAN                              What about the gravimetric 
                             distortions? They'll tear us 
                             apart...

 KIRK                                      (gently)
                             Risk is part of the game if you 
                             want to sit in that chair.

                   Kirk gives him a supportive look. Harriman buckles 
                   down and grimly looks at the image on the screen.

 HARRIMAN                              Helm, close to within transporter 
                             range.

                   Kirk glances at the Cameraman, who's still shining the 
                   light on them  all.

 KIRK                              And second -- turn that damned 
                             thing off.

                   The cameraman turns OFF the light.

 CUT TO: 
 16 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE-B (VFX-I) 16 
                   The ship edges in yet closer to the crackling ribbon. 
                   The tendrils from the ribbon lash out at the ship, just 
                   missing it.

 17 INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE 17 
                   As before.

 DEMORA                              We're within range, sir.

 HARRIMAN                                      (to lieutenant)
                             Beam them directly to Sickbay.

 CHEKOV                                      (concerned)
                             How big's your medical staff?

 HARRIMAN                                      (embarrassed)
                             The medical staff... doesn't
                             arrive until Tuesday.

                   Chekov turns to the two journalists.

 CHEKOV                              You and you. You've just become 
                             nurses. Let's go.

                   Chekov and the journalists EXIT to the turbolift.
 DEMORA                              Main Engineering reports 
                             fluctuations in the warp plasma 
                             relays.

 SCOTTY                              By-pass the relays and go to 
                             auxiliary systems.

                   The LIEUTENANT is having problems at the aft console.

 LIEUTENANT                              Sir, I'm having trouble locking 
                             onto them. They appear to be...
                             in some sort of... temporal flux.

                   Kirk turns to Scotty.

 KIRK                              Scotty?

                   Scotty quickly moves to look at the Transporter 
                   console.

 SCOTTY                              What the hell...

                   Kirk moves to him.

 SCOTTY                              Their life signs are... are
                             phasing in and out of our 
                             space-time continuum.

 KIRK                              Phasing? To where?

                   Scotty begins to work.

 NAVIGATOR                              Sir! Their hull's collapsing!

 18 EXT. SPACE- THE LAKUL (VFX-I) 18 
                   The ship is destroyed by an energy tendril.

 19 INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE 19 
                   All eyes on Scotty.

 SCOTTY                              I got forty-seven of them...
                                     (beat, grim) 
                             ... out of one hundred fifty.

                   Suddenly the ship is rocked violently. KLAXONS and 
                   alarms start to wail and the lights FLICKER on and off. 
                   BULKHEAD EXPLODES, sending metal fragments screaming 
                   across the Bridge and KILLING the Navigator. Scotty 
                   quickly takes over the dead man's console.

 KIRK                              Report!

 DEMORA                              We're caught in a gravimetric 
                             field emanating from the trailing 
                             edge of the ribbon.

 HARRIMAN                              All engines, full reverse!

              20   EXT. SPACE- ENTERPRISE-B & RIBBON (VFX-I)                   20

                   The ship is turning sideways into the WAKE of the
                   ribbon, but cannot break away. It is clearly being 
                   pulled along, out of control. Tendrils leap up from the
                   ribbon, lashing against the ship.

 21 INT. ENTERPRISE-B- SICKBAY 21 
                   The room is filled with the SURVIVORS of the Lakul. 
                   They are all members of the EL-AURIAAN  race -- humanoid 
                   and dressed in distinctive clothing. The survivors are 
                   in various states of shock. Many sit on the floor, 
                   staring into middle distance. some lie on tables, 
                   unconscious. others are mumbling incoherently to 
                   themselves. Chekov and the Journalists are moving from 
                   person to person trying to get control of the 
                   situation as the ship is ROCKED and FLUNG about. 
                   Chekov has a tricorder.

 SURVIVORS                                      (incoherent, overlapping)
                             The colors are touching me... I'm 
                             caught in the glass... Help me...
                             I can see the seconds... Over 
                             here... etc

 CHEKOV                              It will be all right. We're going 
                             to take care of you.

                   He looks at the tricorder.

 CHEKOV                                      (off tricorder)
                             Only minor injuries so far...
                                     (beat) 
                             But it looks like they're all
                             suffering from some kind of
                             neural shock.

                   One Journalist moves past a man sitting on a bio-bed 
                   with a dazed look on his face. He has a nasty-looking 
                   wound on one side of his face. (We will later learn 
                   that this man is named DOCTOR SORAN.)

                   The journalist is about to turn away when suddenly 
                   Soran GRABS him roughly -- clearly a man of great 
                   Strength -- and pulls him close. Soran's eyes are 
                   suddenly wild, crazed.

 SORAN                              Why...why?

 JOURNALIST                              It's all right... you're safe...
                             you're on the Enterprise.

 SORAN                              No... I have to go... I have to 
                             get back... You don't understand! 
                             Let me go!

                   Soran begins to attack the journalist, but before he 
                   can do any real damage, Chekov injects Soran with a 
                   hypospray and Soran falls unconscious.

 JOURNALIST                              What was he talking about?

                   Suddenly a WOMAN with her back toward us stumbles 
                   nearby. Chekov quickly grabs her arm and catches her 
                   before she falls.

 CHEKOV                              Easy there...

                   The woman turns around and we see her face for the 
                   first time -- it's GUINAN. She seems dazed and 
                   confused. Chekov smiles at her warmly.

 CHEKOV                              It's going to be okay. Here, just 
                             lie down.

                   As he guides Guinan onto a table...

 SCOTTY                              Engines not responding!

                   Harriman is gripping the arms of his chair with one 
                   hand. His face pales.

 HARRIMAN                                      (quiet)
                             I didn't expect to die my first 
                             day on the job.

                   Kirk tries to buck up the young captain.

 KIRK                                      (sotto)
                             The first thing you learn as 
                             Captain is how to cheat death. 
                                     (beat, then louder) 
                             Scotty?

 SCOTTY                                      (outraged)
                             There's just no way to disrupt a 
                             gravimetric field of this 
                             magnitude!

 DEMORA                              Hull integrity failing.

                   Kirk looks at Scotty expectantly for a moment.

 SCOTTY                                      (continuing)
                             But I do have a theory...

 KIRK                              I thought you might.

 SCOTTY                              An anti-matter discharge directly 
                             ahead... it might disrupt the 
                             field long enough for us to break 
                             away.

 KIRK                              A photon torpedo?

 SCOTTY                              Aye.

 KIRK                                      (quickly, to Demora)
                             Load torpedo bays, prepare to fire 
                             on my command.

                   Demora turns to him.

 DEMORA                              Captain... we don't have any 
                             torpedoes.

                   Kirk glances at Harriman.

 KIRK                              Don't tell me... Tuesday.

                   Harriman nods, a little embarrassed. The SHAKING gets 
                   worse.

 SCOTTY                              Captain, it may be possible to 
                             simulate a torpedo blast using a
                             resonance burst from the main 
                             deflector dish.

 KIRK                                      (onto the idea)
                             Where are the deflector relays?

 DEMORA                              Deck fifteen, section twenty-one
                             alpha

 HARRIMAN                                      (to Kirk)
                             I'll go. You have the Bridge.

                   Harriman heads for the turbolift, and there is a moment 
                   as Kirk is sorely tempted to take command of the ship 
                   and sit in the Captain's chair one more time. But he 
                   pulls himself back before Harriman can exit.

 KIRK                              No... a Captain's place is on the 
                             Bridge of his ship. 
                                     (beat) 
                             I'll take care of it.

                   Harriman nods in acknowledgement. Kirk heads for the 
                   turbolift.

 KIRK                                      (on the move, to Scotty)
                             Keep her together until I get 
                             back.

 SCOTTY                                      (matter of fact)
                             I always do.

                   Kirk smiles as the turbolift doors slide shut...

 25 INT. ENTERPRISE-B - DEFLECTOR ROOM (CONTINUOUS) 25 
                   A small control room with a few consoles. Kirk rushes 
                   in and rips off one of the large wall panels. He 
                   quickly begins to re-route cabling and circuitry...

 26 INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE 26 
                   As before. The ship is SHAKING badly.

 SCOTTY                              Captain, I don't know how much 
                             longer I can hold her together!

                   Kirk finishes working and slams the wall panel closed.

 KIRK                              That's it. Go!

 28 INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE 28 
                   As before.

                             Activate main deflector.

                   Demora works the console.

 29 EXT. SPACE- ENTERPRISE-B (VFX-I) 29 
                   A large BURST 0F ENERGY leaps out of the main deflector 
                   dish and EXPLODES in front of the ship. There is an 
                   immediate reaction within the Energy Ribbon, which 
                   roils and fluctuates in response.

 30 INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE 30 
                   As before.

 SCOTTY                              We're breaking free.

 31 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE-B (VFX-I) 31 
                   The ship now begins to turn away from the crackling 
                   ribbon. But just as it's turning, one final TENDRIL of 
                   energy suddenly leaps out and hits the ship.

                   The ship is ROCKED so hard that everyone is knocked off 
                   their feet. Gradually, the SHAKING STOPS. Demora 
                   scrambles back into position.

 DEMORA                              We're clear.
                    Everyone reacts with relief.

 HARRIMAN                                      (excited, to com)
                             You did it, Kirk!

                             There's some buckling on the

                             Captain Kirk, please respond.

                   Still no response. Scotty's face falls.

 SCOTTY                                      (continuing, to Demora)
                             Have Chekov meet me on deck
                             fifteen.

                   Harriman, very concerned, gets up and follows Scotty. 
                   They EXIT to the Turbolift.

 CUT TO: 
 34 INT. ENTERPRISE-B - CORRIDOR 34 
                   Scotty and Harriman head down the Corridor. They round
                   a bend... and then stop short. They react to 
                   something ahead of them...

 35 NEW ANGLE (VFX-P) 35 
                   Revealing that the corridor ahead of them is GONE. A 
                   jagged hole has been ripped in the ship and OPEN SPACE 
                   can be seen beyond the twisted metal. 

                   A FORCEFIELD flickers on and off, holding the vacuum of 
                   space at bay.

                   Scotty and Harriman look at the awesome sight for a 
                   moment. Chekov comes running up the Corridor behind 
                   them. He stops and reacts.

 CHEKOV                              My God...

                             Was anyone in there?

                   A long silent beat as Scotty looks out into space.

 SCOTTY                              Aye.

 36 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE-B (VFX-I) 36 
                   A huge chunk has been ripped out of the Engineering 
                   section, looking like an open wound. Scotty, Chekov,
                   and Harriman can be seen standing inside the small 
                   Corridor, looking out into space...

 37 INT. ENTERPRISE-B- BRIDGE 37 
                   A short time later. Scotty, Harriman and Chekov are 
                   listening to Demora, who is working the Helm console.

 DEMORA                              I've checked the entire ship and 
                             the surrounding space. there's 
                             no sign of him.

                   A silent moment. Chekov looks to Scotty, hoping to 
                   hear some sort of miracle. Scotty takes a moment
                   looks at the empty command chair. Then he shakes his 
                   head. A long beat as everyone is forced to accept this
                   terrible truth.

 SCOTTY                                      (quiet)
                             Just a quick... run around the 
                             block.

 CHEKOV                              I never thought it would end like 
                             this...

 SCOTTY                              All things must end, Mr. Chekov.

                   Harriman finally breaks the stillness of the Bridge.

 HARRIMAN                              Let's go home.

                   Harriman steps down to the Captain's chair and takes 
                   command of his ship.

                   Scotty and Chekov exchange a final look. Off the 
                   reactions of these two friends who've just lost someone 
                   very dear to them both...

 40 EXT. SAILING VESSEL - DAY 40 
                   A nineteenth-century three-masted sailing vessel (about 
                   the size of a frigate) is hove-to and sitting in the 
                   water gently rocking. Across the stern of the ship, we 
                   can see the name ENTERPRISE picked out in gold letters.

 41 ON THE MAIN DECK 41 
                   Where PICARD and RIKER are standing before the 
                   assembled crew of the ship. Everyone is dressed in 
                   full-dress naval uniforms of the period, complete with 
                   cocked hats, epaulettes, etc. The crew is standing at 
                   attention... the wind whistles through the rigging...
                   the timbers creak...

                   Picard grimly looks over his crew... then finally  he
                   nods to Riker.

 RIKER                              Bring out the prisoner!

                   A drummer begins a long DRUM ROLL.

 42 ON A HATCH 42 
                   as WORF is brought on deck by TROI and GEORDI. Worf is 
                   shackled by hand and leg irons. Troi and Geordi hold 
                   him by either arm and shove him toward the Captain. 
                   The drum roll STOPS. Picard moves to Worf and peers at 
                   him closely.
 PICARD                              Mister Worf... I always knew this 
                             day would come. Are you prepared 
                             to face the charges?

                   Worf doesn't answer and Troi jabs him in the side.

 TROI                              Answer him!

 WORF                              I am prepared.

                   Picard looks to Riker, who then pulls out a large, 
                   rolled piece of parchment. He opens the scroll and 
                   begins to read from it. In the b.g. Geordi removes 
                   Worf's shackles.

 RIKER                              "We, the officers and crew of the 
                             U.S.S. Enterprise, being of sound 
                             mind and judgment, hereby make 
                             the following charges against 
                             Lieutenant Worf: One. That he did 
                             knowingly and willfully perform 
                             above and beyond the call of duty 
                             on countless occasions. Two. 
                             That he has been a good and solid 
                             officer on this ship for one score 
                             less twelve years. And Three. 
                             Most seriously... that he has 
                             earned the respect and admiration 
                             of the entire crew."

                   Riker puts away the scroll

 PICARD                              There can be only one punishment 
                             for such crimes...

                             I hereby promote you to the rank 
                             of Lieutenant Commander, with all 
                             the rights and privileges thereto. 
                             And may God have mercy on your 
                             soul.

                   Everyone ROARS in APPROVAL. Picard smiles at Worf and
                   shakes his hand.

 PICARD                                      (cont'd)
                             Congratulations, Commander.

 WORF                                      (smiles)
                             Thank you, sir.

                   Picard continues to smile at him for a moment...then 
                   Riker steps in.

 RIKER                              Extend the plank!!

                   Worf's face registers surprise as everyone GRABS HIM
                   and hauls him toward the side, where a long plank is 
                   being pushed out over the water.

 CREWMEMBERS                              Into the sea with him... feed him 
                             to the sharks... walk the 
                             plank... etc.

                   Picard gives Riker a questioning look.

 PICARD                              Don't you think you're taking this 
                             a little too far, Number One?

 RIKER                              When we went to ancient Rome for 
                             Deanna's promotion, we threw her 
                             to the lions, remember?

                   Picard shrugs it off... it's not exactly his cup of 
                   tea, but he'll go along with it.

                   Worf is hustled to the rail where BEVERLY is waiting 
                   patiently by the plank, holding a long PIKE. Worf is 
                   put on the plank and Crusher prods him with the pike 
                   until Worf is nearly at the end.

                   Worf finally stops and turns around.

 WORF                                      (a shout)
 WAIT!! 
                   Everyone falls silent a moment. Worf looks over 
                   the side at the water below.

 WORF                                      (a little embarrassed)
                             I can't swim.

 LA FORGE                                      (calmly, to Worf)
                             The Holodeck safety program is 
                             engaged... The computer won't let 
                             you drown.

 BEVERLY                              But the sharks are quite 
                             convincing.

                   Beverly prods him with the pike and Worf FALLS INTO THE
                   SEA  with a huge SPLASH . Everyone LAUGHS and CHEERS. 
                   Reveal DATA, who is standing near the side rail, 
                   looking a little confused at the reaction.

 DATA                                      (to Beverly)
                             Doctor, I must confess I am 
                             uncertain as to why pushing 
                             someone into freezing, shark-
                             infested water is amusing.
 BEVERLY                              It's all done in good fun, Data. 
                             Get in the spirit of things.

 DATA                              Ah.

                   Data thinks a moment, then he LIFTS Beverly with one 
                   hand and hold her over the rail.

 BEVERLY                              Data...Data -- !

                   Data lets go and Beverly PLUMMETS into the ocean. Data 
                   looks around -- no one is laughing. They all look a 
                   little surprised.

 GEORDI                              Data. that wasn't funny.

                   Data is puzzled by the reaction of the crowd... he's 
                   more confused than ever.

 43 PICARD AND RIKER 43 
                   are standing on the quarterdeck as a very wet Beverly 
                   comes up on deck.

 PICARD                              Well, now that we're all aboard...
                                     (beat, then smiles) 
                             Number One, bring the ship before 
                             the wind. 
                                     (savoring the moment) 
                             Let's see what's out there.

 RIKER                              Aye, aye, sir. 
                                     (to Troi) 
                             Take the wheel, Commander.

                   Troi takes the ship's wheel.

 RIKER                                      (shouts)
                             All hands make sail! Raise up 
                             tacks and stand by the braces!

                   The crew springs into action... rushing to their places 
                   aloft and on deck... grabbing ropes and lines...
                   starting to unfurl the sails... trimming the 
                   yardarms... getting the ship ready to sail.

 46 PICARD AND RIKER 46 
                   Picard is drinking in the scene with a look of great 
                   satisfaction and  contentment.

 PICARD                              Imagine what it was like, Will. No 
                             engines... no computers... just 
                             the wind, the sea and the stars to 
                             guide you.

 RIKER                              Bad food, brutal discipline... 
                                     (beat) 
                             No women.

                   But Picard won't let Riker rain on his parade -- he's 
                   thoroughly enjoying himself.

 COM VOICE                              Bridge to Captain Picard.

 PICARD                              Picard here.

 COM VOICE                              There is a personal message for 
                             you from Earth.

 PICARD                                      (annoyed)
                             Put it through down here. 
                                     (to Riker) 
                             But the best thing about a life at 
                             sea was that they couldn't get to 
                             you.

                   Picard walks toward the bow.

 PICARD                                      (to com)
                             Computer, arch.

 46A ANGLE (VFX-P) 46A 
                   A U-shaped ARCH with several computer panels visible 
                   appears on the forecastle. It's a strange sight to see 
                   a piece of the 24th century on the deck of this ship. 
                   Picard goes to the arch and activates one of the 
                   monitors and waits for the transmission to appear.

 46B NEW ANGLE (VFX-P) 46B 
                   A text message APPEARS and he starts to read it. After 
                   a moment, he reacts with shock and dismay to something 
                   on the screen.

 47 ON TROI 47 
                   whose attention has been drawn to Picard, at the arch. 
                   She reacts with concern at the expression on his face.

 TROI                                       (to crewmember)
                             Here. Take the wheel.

                   Troi moves toward the bow.

 48 ON PICARD (VFX-P) 48 
                   whose face is now ashen with shock. Clearly he has 
                   just read something on the screen which is very 
                   disturbing. 

                   He stares into the middle distance for a moment. Troi 
                   moves to him.

 TROI                                      (quiet)
                             Captain, are you all right?

 PICARD                              Yes. Fine. If you'll excuse 
                             me...

                   He turns OFF the screen.

 PICARD                              Computer, exit.

 48A ANGLE (VFX-P) 48A 
                   The Holodeck DOORS APPEAR within the Arch. Picard is 
                   clearly distracted as he EXITS to the Corridor. Troi 
                   looks after him with concern.

 49 NEW ANGLE 49 
                   Favoring Riker. He takes a couple of steps toward 
                   Worf.

 RIKER                              Set the royals and the studding 
                             sails, Mister Worf.

                   Worf looks at him blankly for a moment.

 WORF                              The Royal... studs...?

 RIKER                                      (smiles, points aloft)
                             You see the top yardarm, now look 
                             to the --

                   Suddenly a com voice interrupts.

 COM VOICE                              Bridge to Commander Riker.

 RIKER                              Riker here.

 COM VOICE                              We're picking up a distress call 
                             from the Amargosa observatory, 
                             sir. They say they're under 
                             attack.

 RIKER                                       (to all)
                             Red Alert! All hands to 
                             Battle stations! Captain Picard to 
                             the Bridge.

                   Everyone on the ship reacts, and there is a general 
                   rush to the bow of the ship...

 CUT TO: 
 50 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE-D (VFX-I) 50 
                   The great ship at impulse. We FOLLOW it and then see 
                   ahead of the ship, a small SOLAR OBSERVATORY with a 
                   complex optical array. The observatory bears scorch 
                   marks and other signs of recent battle. (In the b.g.
                   a YELLOW SUN can be seen.)

 51 INT. BRIDGE (VFX-I) 51                    Picard in command. Riker, Troi, Worf and Data at their 
                   stations They didn't have time to change, so they are 
                   all still dressed in their costumes from the ceremony. 
                   The ship is at Red Alert. The image of the burnt-out 
                   observatory is on the VIEWSCREEN.

 RIKER                              It looks like we're too late...

 WORF                                      (off console)
                             There are no other ships in the 
                             system.

 DATA                              Sensors show five life signs 
                             aboard the station, Captain.

 RIKER                              The station complement was 
                             nineteen.

                   A grim beat. Picard gets up and starts heading for the 
                   Ready Room - his attitude is dismissive, almost 
                   irritated that this has interrupted some deeper concern 
                   of his.

 PICARD                              Secure from Red Alert. Number 
                             One, begin an investigation. I'll 
                             be in my Ready Room.

                   Troi and Riker exchange a surprised look.

 RIKER                              Sir?

 PICARD                                      (hard)
                             Make it so.

                   Picard EXITS. An awkward beat. What's wrong with the 
                   Captain? But they have their orders. 

                   As Riker and  Worf head for the EXIT...

 CUT TO: 
 52 INT. OBSERVATORY - OPS CENTER (VFX-P) 52 
                   The station is a SMOKING RUIN -- consoles flickering, 
                   lights dim, damage everywhere. Only a few minutes have 
                   passed since they were attacked. Riker, Worf, Beverly
                   and two SECURITY GUARDS MATERIALIZE. They're all back 
                   in uniform, holding phasers and palm beacons. Worf has 
                   a tricorder and Beverly has a medical kit. The room is 
                   cramped, there are fallen bulk-heads and blown-out 
                   consoles. The debris makes it difficult to get a clear 
                   view of the room.

 WORF                              These blast patterns are 
                             consistent with type-three 
                             disruptors.

 RIKER                              Well, that narrows it to Klingon, 
                             Breen or Romulan.

                   Beverly follows her tricorder readings.

 BEVERLY                              I'm picking up life signs... about 
                             twenty meters ahead.

 WORF                              That rules out Klingons.

                   Riker gives him a look.

 WORF                              They would not have left anyone 
                             alive.

 BEVERLY                              Over here.

                   They pick their way carefully through the carnage of 
                   the station...and come to the body of a Starfleet 
                   Science Officer. He has taken a disruptor blast to the 
                   back and there is a nasty-looking scorch mark on his 
                   uniform. Beverly immediately takes some devices out of 
                   her medical kit and begins to treat him.

 RIKER                              Worf, you're with me. Paskall, 
                             you and Mendez search the upper 
                             deck.

                   The Security Guards climb a nearby ladder while Riker 
                   and Worf head down a dimly-lit corridor. Riker stops 
                   at two bodies in the hall, checks them over -- but 
                   they're dead. There is a sudden banging from the far 
                   corner of the room. Worf and Riker quickly move to a 
                   collapsed bulkhead.

 WORF                              Under here...

                   They both grab hold of a large metal plate, pull it 
                   aside and begin to dig through the debris. Finally, a 
                   HAND can be seen grasping about from within the pile of 
                   rubble. Riker and Worf work faster. Worf grabs the 
                   man's hand.

 WORF                              It's all right... do not struggle.

                   Worf holds the man's hand as Riker shoves away a final 
                   console. We reveal the head and torso of Doctor Soran, 
                   one of the survivors from the Lakul (and last seen 
                   in Sickbay aboard the Enterprise-B). Soran has not aged 
                   at all over the years but he does have a permanent 
                   scar on his face from the earlier wound. He blinks a 
                   few times, seems a little dazed.
 RIKER                              I'm Commander William Riker of the
                             Starship Enterprise.

 SORAN                              Soran... Doctor Tolian Soran...

                   Soran puts a hand to his head, still trying to get his 
                   bearings.

 RIKER                              Who attacked you, Doctor?

 SORAN                              I'm not sure... it happened so 
                             fast...

 SECURITY OFFICER                                      (calls out)
                             Commander -- you'd better take a 
                             look at this.

                   Riker and Worf move to the ladder as Beverly begins to 
                   scan Soran...

 53 NEW ANGLE - UPPER DECK 53 
                   Riker and Worf move over to the two Security Guards who 
                   are kneeling over a dead body which is obscured from 
                   view. One guard turns over the body, revealing a 
                   ROMULAN SOLDIER. Worf looks at him in disgust.

 WORF                              Romulan.

                   Riker and Worf exchange a look. OFF their reactions...

 54 INT. DATA'S QUARTERS 54 
                   Data is sitting in a chair, petting SPOT THE CAT. 
                   Geordi is standing next to him.

 DATA                             Is she still angry?

 GEORDI                             No... but I'd stay out of Sickbay 
                            for a while if I were you. I 
                            still don't know why you dropped 
                            her in the water.

 DATA                             I was attempting to... get in the 
                            spirit of things. I thought it 
                            would be humorous.

                   Data frowns. troubled by this recent experience. He 
                   puts Spot down and moves to a bulkhead. He activates 
                   a control panel and a small compartment slides OPEN,
                   revealing a small COMPUTER CHIP  which is suspended in 
                   a glass and metal framework. Data looks at the chip 
                   for a beat and Geordi moves to him in concern.

 GEORDI                             Data... you're not thinking about 
                            using that thing are you?

 DATA                             It has occurred to me on several 
                            occasions. But I believe this may 
                            be the appropriate time.

 GEORDI                             Wait a minute. I thought you've 
                            always been afraid it would 
                            overload your neural net.

 DATA                             That is true. However, I believe 
                            my growth as an artificial 
                            life form has reached an impasse. 
                            For thirty-four years I have 
                            endeavored to become more "human" -
                            to grow beyond my original 
                            programming. And yet I am still 
                            unable to grasp such a simple 
                            concept as humor. 
                                     (re: chip)
                            This emotion chip is the only 
                            answer.

                   Geordi considers a moment, looks at the chip...
                   and reluctantly has to agree.

 GEORDI                             All right...

                   Data sits down and La Forge moves to stand behind him.

 GEORDI                             But at the first sign of trouble, 
                            I'm going to deactivate it. 
                            agreed?

 DATA                             Agreed.

                   Geordi works on Data's head for a moment, and then
                   OPENS a panel on Data's head, revealing the blinking 
                   circuitry within.

 55 INT. READY ROOM 55 
                   Riker is standing next to Picard, who has his back turned 
                   and is staring out the window. Picard seems distracted 
                   during the scene, his mind clearly elsewhere as Riker 
                   finishes his report.

 RIKER                             We found two dead Romulans aboard 
                            the station. We're analyzing 
                            their equipment to see if we can 
                            determine what ship they came 
                            from.

                   Picard nods absently.

 PICARD                             There's still no indication of why 
                            they attacked the station?

 RIKER                             We think they were looking for 
                            something -- they practically tore 
                            the place apart.

 PICARD                             Hmm... 
                                     (beat) 
                            Inform Starfleet Command. This 
                            could indicate a new Romulan 
                            threat in this sector.

 RIKER                             You want me to contact Starfleet?

 PICARD                             Is there a problem?

 RIKER                             No, sir.

 PICARD                             Thank you, Number One.

                   Picard keeps his back turned, looking out the window. 
                   Riker hesitates, awkward.

 RIKER                             There is something else, Captain. 
                            One of the scientists. a Doctor
                            Soran... has insisted on speaking 
                            with you. 
                                     (beat) 
                            I told him you were busy, sir, but 
                            he said it was absolutely 
                            imperative that he speak with you 
                            right away.

 PICARD                             Understood. That will be all.

 RIKER                             Sir... is there anything wrong?

 PICARD                             No. Thank you.

                   A beat, then Riker turns and EXITS. Off Picard's 
                   unreadable face...

 CUT TO: 56 INT. TEN FORWARD 56 
                   The room is bustling with patrons and activity. Data 
                   ENTERS with an odd look on his face...his body 
                   language subtly altered. He is looking at the world 
                   through new eyes. Geordi is following him closely, 
                   watching his every move. They move to the bar. Guinan 
                   comes over -- she has not aged at all since the 
                   Enterprise-B. She sets down an exotic-looking container 
                   full of dark liquid.

 GUINAN                             You two just volunteered to be my 
                            first victims. 
                                     (re: liquid)
                            This is a new concoction I 
                            picked up on Forcas Three. Trust me, 
                            you're going to love it.

                   She pours two glasses of the liquid. Data takes one 
                   and sniffs it, then takes a drink. Geordi watches him 
                   closely. Data frowns.

 GEORDI                             Well...?

 DATA                             I believe the beverage has 
                            provoked an emotional response.

 GEORDI                             Really? What do you feel?

 DATA                             I am uncertain. I have had little 
                            experience with emotions... I am 
                            unable to articulate the 
                            sensation.

 GUINAN                             Emotions?

 GEORDI                             I'll explain later...

                   Data finishes the drink... concentrates, tries to make 
                   sense of the rush of feelings. His expression is one 
                   of disgust.

 GUINAN                                       (to Geordi)
                            I don't think he likes it.

 DATA                                      (excited)
                            Yes. That is it. I hate it.

 GEORDI                             Data, I think the chip is 
                            working...

                   Data looks at Geordi with a big smile on his face.

 DATA                             Yes. I hate this! It is 
                            revolting!

                   Beat.

 GUINAN                             Another round?

 DATA                             Please.

                   In the b.g., we see Picard ENTER Ten Forward.

 57 FOLLOW PICARD 57 
                   as he walks through Ten Forward and heads toward a 
                   table by the windows. Soran is sitting at the table, 
                   staring out at the stars, lost in thought. His 
                   observatory uniform is distinctive, and sets him apart 
                   from everyone else in the room. Picard walks up to the 
                   table.

 PICARD                             Doctor Soran...?

 SORAN                             Yes, yes, Captain -- thank you for 
                            coming.

                   The men shake hands and Picard sits down. Soran is an 
                   imposing physical presence, but at the moment he seems 
                   very much the eccentric scientists consumed with his 
                   work. Picard waves away a waiter.

 PICARD                             Nothing for me. 
                                     (brusque, to Soran) 
                            I understand there's something 
                            urgent you need to discuss with 
                            me.

 SORAN                             Yes. I need to return to the 
                            observatory immediately. I must 
                            continue a critical experiment I 
                            was running on the Amargosa star.
                    Picard's reaction is a little impatient -- this doesn't 
                   sound that imperative to him.

 PICARD                             Doctor... we're still conducting 
                            an investigation into the attack. 
                            Once we've completed our work, 
                            we'll be happy to allow you and 
                            your fellow scientists back aboard 
                            the observatory. Until then --

 SORAN                             The timing is very important on my 
                            experiment -- if it is not
                            completed within the next twelve 
                            hours, years of research will be 
                            lost.

 PICARD                             We're doing the best we can. Now 
                            if you'll excuse me...

                   Picard moves to stand, but Soran reaches out and gently 
                   but firmly grabs him by the arm. The unexpected 
                   physical contact and the change of intensity in Soran's 
                   face stops Picard in his tracks.

 SORAN                                      (cryptically)
                            They say time is the fire in 
                            which we burn... and right now, 
                            Captain, my time is running out. 
                                     (beat) 
                            We leave so many things unfinished 
                            in our lives -- I'm sure you can 
                            understand.

                   For some reason, Soran's words have struck a deep chord 
                   within Picard.

                   He looks away from Soran's compelling gaze and thinks 
                   for a long moment. When he finally speaks, his voice 
                   is barely above a whisper.
 PICARD                             I'll see what I can do...

                   Picard walks away without a word before Soran can 
                   thank him. Soran looks after him with relief, then 
                   pulls out an ANTIQUE POCKET WATCH and opens it. He 
                   looks at the watch for a long moment. then snaps it 
                   closed and head for the opposite exit from the one 
                   Picard took. FOLLOW Soran across Ten Forward...until 
                   he suddenly stops in shock at something he sees...

 58 SORAN'S POV 58

 59 RESUME SORAN 59 
                   A dark look crosses his face -- he is disturbed by the 
                   sight of Guinan. He quickly turns and EXITS.

                   she begins to sense something, as though someone is 
                   watching her. She turns, looks in the direction where 
                   Soran was just standing, but there's no one there now. 
                   She shakes off the feeling and goes back to work.

                   A short time later. A Romulan tricorder is connected 
                   to some diagnostic equipment near a console. Worf is 
                   talking to Riker.

                   Worf activates a MONITOR which shows a complex diagram 
                   of sensor information.

 WORF                             One of the dead Romulans had a 
                            tricorder. We analyzed its sensor 
                            logs and found they were scanning 
                            for signature particles of a 
                            compound called trilithium.

 RIKER                             Trilithium?

 WORF                             An experimental compound the 
                            Romulans have been working on. In 
                            theory, a trilithium-based 
                            explosive would be thousands of 
                            times more powerful than an 
                            anti-matter weapon. But they never 
                            found a way to stabilize it.
 RIKER                             Why were they looking for it on a 
                            Federation observatory? It doesn't
                            make any sense.

                   Riker considers.

 RIKER                                      (cont'd)
                            Have Geordi and Data go over with 
                            the next Away Team...  tell them to 
                            scan the observatory for 
                            trilithium.

 WORF                             Aye, sir.

 CUT TO: 
 62 INT. OBSERVATORY OPS 62 
                   The station is still a wreck. Geordi and Data are 
                   scanning the room with tricorders.

 GEORDI                                      (off tricorder)
                            There's no sign of any trilithium 
                            in here.

                   Geordi continues to scan... then suddenly Data lets out 
                   a quiet GIGGLE. Geordi stops and turns to look at him.
                   Data giggles louder.

 DATA                                      (laughing, to himself)
                            I get it. I get it.

 GEORDI                             You get what?

                   Data laughs again.

 DATA                             When you said to Commander 
                            Riker...
                                     (imitating Geordi's voice) 
                            "The clown can stay, but the 
                            Ferengi in the gorilla suit has to 
                            go."

                   Geordi looks blankly at him for a moment.

 GEORDI                             What?

 DATA                             During the Farpoint mission. We 
                            were on the Bridge and you told a 
                            joke. That was the punch line.

 GEORDI                             The Farpoint mission? Data, that 
                            was seven years ago.

 DATA                             I know. I just got it. 
                                     (laughs) 
                            It was very funny.

 GEORDI                             Thanks.

                   Geordi indicates a corridor. They EXIT in that 
                   direction...

 63 INT. OBSERVATORY CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS 63 
                   A short corridor connecting the Ops Center with other 
                   compartments. Geordi suddenly stops in front of what 
                   appears to be a standard bulkhead.

 GEORDI                             Wait a minute... there's a hidden 
                            doorway here. I can see the 
                            joint of the metal with my VISOR.

                   Geordi runs his finger in a vertical line along what 
                   appears to be a smooth bulkhead.

 DATA                                     (off tricorder)
                            There appears to be a dampening 
                            field in operation. I cannot scan 
                            beyond the bulkhead.

                   Geordi puts his tricorder away and begins looking for 
                   a way to open the door.

 GEORDI                             I don't see a control panel...or 
                            an access port.

 DATA                                      (off tricorder)
                            It appears to be a magnetically 
                            sealed.

                   Data steps forward and OPENS a small panel on wrist 
                   and makes a quick adjustment to the circuitry within.

 DATA                             I believe I can reverse the 
                            polarity by attenuating my axial 
                            servo.

                   Data completes his adjustment and then moves his wrist 
                   over the door panel.

 DATA                                      (joking)
                            "Open sesame."

                   There is a HUMMING sound followed by a loud CLICK. The 
                   door slides open.

 DATA                                      (smiles)
                            You could say I have a... magnetic 
                            personality.

                   Geordi reacts to the bad pun with a grimace. They EXIT 
                   to.

 64 INT. OBSERVATORY PROBE ROOM - CONTINUOUS 64 
                   A small room with several probes stacked in holding 
                   racks. Geordi and Data scan.

 GEORDI                             I'm still not picking up anything. 
                            Someone went to a lot of trouble 
                            to shield this room.

                   They put their tricorders away and begin looking around 
                   the room. Data continues to snicker and giggle as he 
                   tries not to laugh at jokes his mind conjures up. 
                   Geordi begins inspecting the probes... finally stops
                   at one probe which has SEVERAL ODD DEVICES attached to 
                   the side.

 GEORDI                             Data, take a look at this. 
                                     (Data comes over) 
                            You ever seen a solar probe with 
                            this kind of configuration?

                   Data uses the tricorder as if it were a puppet as he 
                   opens and closes it like a mouth.

 DATA                                      (making tricorder "talk")
                            No, Geordi. I have not. It is 
                            most unusual.
                    Data giggles and Geordi reacts with the irritation of 
                   someone listening to a very bad comedian.
 GEORDI                             Just help me get this panel open.

                   Data helps Geordi as they try to open a panel on the 
                   casing of the probe. They open the panel and Geordi
                   looks inside.he reacts to something.

 GEORDI                             Whoa. my VISOR'S picking up 
                            something in the theta band...it 
                            could be a trilithium signature.

                   Data suddenly start LAUGHING. Geordi turns in 
                   irritation.

 GEORDI                             Data, this isn't the time...

 DATA                                      (laughing)
                            I am sorry... but I cannot stop 
                            myself... I think something is 
                            wrong...

 64A ANGLE (VFX-P) 64A 
                   Data's laughter escalates into hysteria... then Data 
                   begins to JERK and SHAKE and goes into a bizarre 
                   "emotional seizure." A rush of EMOTIONS race across 
                   his face. anger, passion, shock... a kaleidoscopic 
                   blur of reactions contort his features. Then it stops 
                   and he FALLS to the ground.

 GEORDI                             Data!

                   Geordi rushes to him. Data has a look of surprise on 
                   his face as he blinks a few times. He sits up.

 GEORDI                             Data, are you all right?

 DATA                             I believe the emotional chip has 
                            overloaded my positronic relays.

 GEORDI                             We better get you back to the 
                            Ship. 
                                     (hits combadge) 
                            La Forge to Enterprise.

                   There's no response. Geordi frowns for a beat, then we 
                   hear Soran's voice.

 SORAN                             Is there a problem, gentlemen?

 65 INCLUDE SORAN 65 
                   standing in the room. Geordi didn't hear him come in.

 GEORDI                             Oh... Doctor... yeah, as a matter 
                            of fact, there is. There's a 
                            damping field in here blocking 
                            our com signal. 
                                     (re: Data) 
                            Will you give me a hand?

                   Over the above dialogue, Soran glances over at the 
                   solar probe Geordi was inspecting. He notes the opened 
                   panel and a disturbed look crosses his face. 

                   Soran looks back at Geordi.

 SORAN                             I'd be happy to.

                   Soran moves toward them. and then without warning, he 
                   punches Geordi in the face, KNOCKING the VISOR across 
                   the room. He whirls around and points a phaser at 
                   Data, who suddenly looks fearful.

 DATA                             Please don't hurt me.

 66 INT. PICARD'S QUARTERS 66 
                   Picard is standing at the replicator.

 PICARD                             Tea. Earl Grey. Hot.

                   The cup of tea APPEARS in the replicator and at the 
                   same moment, the door CHIMES.

 PICARD                             Come.

                   Troi ENTERS. Picard would rather not be bothered right 
                   now, but he is polite as always.

 PICARD                             Counselor. What can I do for you?

 TROI                             Actually... I'm here to see if 
                            there's anything I can do for you.

 PICARD                             Well... I appreciate your concern, 
                            but I'd rather not discuss it 
                            right now, thank you.
                    But Troi won't be brushed away so easily.

 TROI                             I'm afraid I can't just leave it 
                            at that. The commanding officer 
                            of this ship is clearly distraught 
                            about something. As ship's 
                            Counselor, it's my duty to --

 PICARD                             As ship's counselor, it's your 
                            duty to know not only when you're 
                            needed... but also when you're 
                            not.

 TROI                             You can't fool an empath, Captain. 
                            I know exactly when I'm needed.

                   Picard is really not in the mood for this. His tone 
                   hardens.

 PICARD                             Well, with all due respect to your 
                            Betazoid senses, I prefer to be 
                            alone right now.

 TROI                             Very well. I suppose I could make 
                            out my weekly report to Starfleet
                            Command without your input. 
                                     (beat) 
                            "Admiral Lusby... regarding the 
                            unusual behavior of Jean-Luc

                            Irritable... remote... and 
                            uncooperative. I recommend forced 
                            shore leave at a Starbase facility

 PICARD                             All right, all right. You've made 
                            your point.

                   Troi takes a seat and patiently waits. Picard gets 
                   up.moves around the room for a moment...and stops. 
                   He speaks in a flat, unemotional tone of voice.

 PICARD                             The message I received...
                                     (beat) 
                            My brother... and his son -- my 
                            nephew -- burned to death in a 
                            fire.

                   Troi reacts, genuinely surprised.
 TROI                             Captain, I'm sorry. 
                                     (beat) 
                            I know there were a lot of 
                            unresolved conflicts between you 
                            and your brother.

 PICARD                             What I can't get out of my mind is 
                            the image of Rene -- my nephew. 
                            I just can't believe he's gone...

                   He trails off.

 TROI                             It's only natural to feel a 
                            heightened sense of tragedy when 
                            a child dies...
                                     (sensing more) 
                            But it goes deeper than that, 
                            doesn't it? I can sense that Rene 
                            meant a great deal to you.

 PICARD                             In a way, he was as close as I 
                            ever came to having a child of my 
                            own.

                   Troi eyes an open photo album on the table. She reaches 
                   over and flips through the pages for a moment. There 
                   are many photos inside... from many periods in time
                   including one of Picard's brother standing next to his 
                   young son. This is the Picard family album.

 TROI                             Your family history is very 
                            important to you, isn't it?

 PICARD                                      (nods)
                            Ever since I was a little boy, I 
                            remember hearing about the family 
                            line. The Picards that fought at 
                            Trafalgar... the Picard's that 
                            settled the first Martian colony. 
                            When my brother married and had a 
                            son...

                   Picard hesitates -- this is difficult for him.

 TROI                             ... You felt it was no longer your 
                            responsibility to carry on the 
                            family line.

 PICARD                                      (nods)
                            My brother had shouldered that 
                            burden... allowing me to pursue my 
                            own selfish needs...

 TROI                             There's nothing selfish about 
                            pursuing your own life... your own 
                            career.

                   Picard moves to the window, stares outside. A shadow 
                   crosses his face. He's getting to the heart of the 
                   matter.

 PICARD                             You know, Counselor... I'm not 
                            getting any younger. For some 
                            time now, I've been aware that 
                            there are fewer days ahead than 
                            there are behind...
                                     (beat) 
                            But I always took comfort in the 
                            fact that when I was gone, my
                            family would continue. But now...

                   Picard moves back to the photo album, open it to the 
                   last page, an then flips through the remaining pages --
                   they are blank.

 PICARD                             I've had brushes with death...
                            more than I care to contemplate. 
                            I always accepted it as a 
                            calculated risk that goes along 
                            with wearing this uniform. 
                                     (beat) 
                            But now... the idea of death has 
                            a terrible sense of finality to 
                            it.

                   He looks at her.

 PICARD                             I'm the last Picard.

                   A quiet beat as Troi considers him.

 TROI                             Captain, perhaps we --

                   Suddenly, a BLINDING BURST OF LIGHT  from outside the 
                   windows washes into the room. Troi and Picard rush to 
                   the window and shield their eyes against the glare.

                   Picard and Troi ENTER from a turbolift. Riker and Worf 
                   at their stations. The star is on the Viewscreen, 
                   getting DARKER by the second... more flaming debris 
                   is being ejected into space.

 PICARD                             Report.

 RIKER                             A quantum implosion has occurred 
                            within the Amargosa star. All
                            nuclear fusion is breaking down.

 PICARD                             How is that possible?

 WORF                             Sensor records show a solar probe 
                            was launched from the observatory 
                            a few moments ago.

 RIKER                             The star's going to collapse in a 
                            matter of minutes.

                   Something beeps on Worf's console.

 WORF                             Sir, the implosion has produced 
                            a level twelve shock wave.

 TROI                                      (shocked)
                            Level twelve? That'll destroy 
                            everything in this system.

 RIKER                                      (to Worf)
                            Did they return to the ship?

 WORF                                      (works)
                            No, sir. They are not aboard.

 PICARD                             How long until the shock wave hits 
                            the observatory?

 WORF                             Four minutes, forty seconds.

                   Picard looks at Riker, who then quickly heads for the 
                   turbolift.

 RIKER                             Mister Worf.

                   Riker and Worf EXIT.

 70 EXT. SPACE- THE STAR (VFX-I) 70 
                   The star is almost entirely dark. Radiating out from the 
                   star is a huge shock wave- a rapidly growing sphere of 
                   energy.

 71 INT. OBSERVATORY PROBE ROOM (VFX-P) 71 
                   Soran is standing at a console watching a graphic 
                   depiction of the star's collapse on a monitor when the 
                   door suddenly opens. Soran whirls around and FIRES his 
                   phaser at Riker and Worf. They dive for cover just 
                   outside the room. (NOTE: The probe Geordi examined 
                   earlier is now gone.)

 RIKER                                      (to Worf)
                            What the hell's he doing?

                   Worf dodges another phaser blast and sees Geordi lying 
                   unconscious on the deck. Data is nowhere to be seen.

 RIKER                                      (yells to Soran)
                            Soran, did you hear that? There's 
                            a level twelve shock wave coming.
                            We've got to get out of here!

                   Soran's only answer is another phaser blast.

 74 INT. OBSERVATORY PROBE ROOM (VFX-P) 74 
                   Soran is continuing to SHOOT at Riker and Worf. Riker 
                   suddenly notices something off-camera.

                   Data is huddled in a corner of the room, cowering in 
                   fear.

                            Geordi!

                   Data looks up at him with a terrified look on his face.

                            Am... afraid.

                   Suddenly Soran's communicator BEEPS. Soran reaches 
                   down and grabs the unconscious Geordi by the collar and 
                   the two of them DEMATERIALIZE. (Soran has the VISOR in

                   On a monitor where we can see a graphic depiction of 
                   the darkening star and shock wave. MOVE TO REVEAL

                   We are the inside an old Klingon ship - it's beaten up and 
                   patched in several places, obviously not a first-line 
                   model. Watching the Viewscreen are LURSA and B'ETOR, 
                   two powerful-looking Klingon women... They are sisters. 
                   aggressive... seductive... and very dangerous. Several N.D. 
                   male Klingons man the various stations.

                   The sisters stare at the image of the destroyed sun in 
                   awe.

 B'ETOR                             Toh-pak-cha... 
                            (Glorious...)

 LURSA                             HoS qorDu... 
                            (A great power...)

                   Soran now ENTERS the Bridge. His expression is dark 
                   and angry. He is clearly not a prisoner here and he 
                   strides up to the sisters.

 B'ETOR                                      (excited, to Soran)
                            You've done it, Soran.

                   But without warning, Soran HITS B'Etor squarely in the 
                   jaw, knocking her back over a console. Several 
                   Klingons leap to their feet, drawing their weapons...
                   but B'Etor holds up a hand as she gets to one knee.

 B'ETOR                             Wait!

                   She dabs a trickle of blood at the corner of her 
                   mouth... her expression is angry and threatening.

 B'ETOR                             I hope for your sake that you are 
                            initiating a mating ritual.
 SORAN                             You got careless. The Romulans 
                            came looking for their missing 
                            trilithium.

 B'ETOR                             Impossible. We left no survivors 
                            on their outpost.

                   B'Etor has now gotten to her feet in the b.g.

 SORAN                             They knew it was aboard the 
                            observatory. If the Enterprise 
                            hadn't intervened, they would have 
                            found it.

 LURSA                             But they didn't find it... and now 
                            we have a weapon of unlimited 
                            power.

 SORAN                             I have the weapon, Lursa. And if 
                            you ever want me to give it to 
                            you, I advise you to be a little 
                            more careful in the future.

                   B'Etor grabs Soran and holds a wicked-looking knife to 
                   his throat.

 B'ETOR                             Perhaps we are tired of waiting.

                   Soran is unfazed by this threat.

 SORAN                             Without my research... the
                            trilithium is worthless... as are 
                            your plans to reconquer the 
                            Klingon Empire.

                   Lursa reaches out and calmly pushes her sister's knife 
                   away.

 SORAN                             Set course for the Veridian

 KLINGON GUARD                             What shall I do with this?

                   Soran moves toward Geordi, a grim look on his face.
 SORAN                             Bring him with me. I need some 
                            answers from Mr. La Forge.

                   Soran EXITS.

 80 INT. CORRIDOR 80 
                   Riker and Worf are on the move down the corridor.

 WORF                             I have spoken to the Klingon High 
                            Council, sir. They identified the 
                            Bird of Prey as belonging to the 
                            Duras sisters.

 RIKER                                     (surprised)
                            Lursa and B'Etor...? This doesn't 
                            make any sense. A renowned 
                            stellar physicist somehow uses a 
                            trilithium probe to destroy a 
                            star, kidnaps Geordi... and 
                            escapes with a pair of Klingon 
                            renegades... Why? What the hell's 
                            going on?

                   They EXIT to...

 81 INT. SICKBAY 81 
                   Worf and Riker ENTER. Beverly is closing a panel on 
                   the back of Data's head. He is sitting on a bio-bed, 
                   scanning himself with a tricorder.

 RIKER                             How is he?

 BEVERLY                             It looks like a power surge fused 
                            the emotional chip into his neural
                            net.

 WORF                             Will that be a danger to him?

 BEVERLY                             I don't think so. The chip still 
                            seems to be working. I'd feel 
                            better if I could take a closer
                            look, but I can't remove it 
                            without completely dismantling his 
                            cerebral conduit.

 RIKER                                      (to Data)
                            Looks like you're stuck with 
                            emotions for a while. How do you 
                            feel?

 DATA                             I am quite... preoccupied with 
                            concern about Geordi.

 RIKER                             We all are, Data. But we're going 
                            to get him back.

 DATA                             I hope so, sir.

                   Data's expression is still one of concern. Beverly 
                   pulls Riker aside.

 BEVERLY                             Wil, I checked into Doctor Soran's 
                            background.

                   Beverly activates the wall monitor and a picture of 
                   Doctor Soran along with some biographical information 
                   appears.

 BEVERLY                             He's an El-Aurian... over three 
                            hundred years old. He lost his 
                            entire family when the Borg 
                            destroyed his world. Soran 
                            escaped with a handful of other 
                            refugees aboard a ship called the 
                            Lakul. The ship was destroyed by 
                            some kind of energy ribbon, but 
                            Soran and forty-six others were 
                            rescued by the Enterprise-B.

 RIKER                                      (reacts)
                            That was the mission where James 
                            Kirk was killed.

 BEVERLY                             I checked the passenger manifest 
                            of the Lakul... guess who else was 
                            on board?

                   She hits a control and suddenly Guinan's face appears 
                   on the screen. Riker reacts to the image...

 CUT TO: 
 82 INT. GUINAN'S QUARTERS 82 
                   Close on Guinan as she looks up, surprised.

 GUINAN                             Soran? That's a name I haven't 
                            heard in a long time.

                   MOVE TO REVEAL Guinan's Quarters, which are unlike any
                   of the others on the Enterprise. None of the standard 
                   furniture, consoles or decoration are present. The 
                   floor is made of tile, not carpet... the walls are 
                   draped in exotic fabric. The lighting is moody and 
                   subdued.

                   Picard is standing before Guinan, who is sitting cross-
                   legged on the floor. They talk to each other with an 
                   easy familiarity... two old friends who know each 
                   other well.

 PICARD                             Do you remember him?

 GUINAN                             Oh yes. I remember everyone who 
                            was on the Lakul... every face.
                            even the ones who didn't make 
                            it...

                   Guinan stands and begins to move about the room...
                   she's clearly troubled by the memories. She hesitates, 
                   looks off into the middle-distance for a few moments. 
                   Picard moves to her.

 PICARD                             Guinan. It's important that you 
                            tell me what you know. We think 
                            Soran's developed a weapon... a 
                            terrible weapon. It might give 
                            him enough power to --

 GUINAN                             Soran doesn't care about power or 
                            weapons. All he cares about is 
                            getting back to the Nexus.

 PICARD                             What's the "Nexus"?

                   Guinan moves to a table and begins to shift around some 
                   exotic-looking alien artifacts... distracting 
                   herself... this is difficult for her to discuss.

 GUINAN                             It's a place I've tried very hard 
                            to forget...

                   She makes the decision to plunge ahead.

 GUINAN                             That ribbon isn't just some random 
                            energy phenomenon traveling 
                            through space... it's a doorway. 
                            It leads to another place... the 
                            Nexus. It doesn't exist in our 
                            Universe... and it doesn't play by 
                            the same rules either.

 PICARD                             What happened to you?

 GUINAN                             I can't remember very much... what 
                            it looked like or how long I was
                            there... but I do remember how it 
                            felt...

                   She turns to him and her face is filled with some kind 
                   of awe at the memory.

 GUINAN                             It was like being inside... joy. 
                            As if joy was a real thing that I
                            could wrap around myself. I've 
                            never been so content...

                   A long beat as Picard absorbs her words.

 PICARD                             But then you were beamed away...

                   Guinan shows a rare burst of anger.

 GUINAN                             I was pulled away. I didn't want 
                            to leave; none of us did. I felt 
                            like I'd left a part of myself 
                            behind. All I could think about 
                            was getting back... I didn't care 
                            what I had to do.

                   Guinan moves to a window and looks out at the stars.

 GUINAN                             It took a long time, but 
                            eventually I learned to live with 
                            it. And I began to realize that 
                            my experience in the Nexus had 
                            changed me...
                                     (beat)
                            I knew things about people...
                            about events...about time...

 PICARD                             Your "sixth sense"... I've always 
                            wondered where it came from...
                                     (beat) 
                            And what about Soran?

 GUINAN                             Soran may still be obsessed with 
                            getting back. And if he is, he'll 
                            do anything to find that doorway 
                            again.

 PICARD                             But why destroy a star...? 
                                     (beat) 
                            Thank you, Guinan.

                   He heads for the door.

 GUINAN                             Let someone else do it, Jean-Luc.

                   Picard stops, looks at her.

 GUINAN                             Let them send another starship. 
                            Don't get near the ribbon. If you 
                            go into that Nexus, you're not 
                            going to care about Soran or the 
                            Enterprise or me. All you're 
                            going to care about is how it 
                            feels to be there.
                                    (beat) 
                            And you're never going to come 
                            back.

                   Picard weighs her words... sees the warning in her 
                   eyes... and carefully backs away and EXITS.

 CUT TO: 
 83 INT. KLINGON BIRD OF PREY - QUARTERS (VFX-P) 83 
                   A dimly-lit room somewhere in the bowels of the Klingon 
                   ship. Like every other room on this decrepit ship, the 
                   room looks well-worn and ill-maintained. Soran is 
                   seated behind a table, holding the VISOR. A PADD and 
                   Soran's pocket watch sit on the table. Geordi is 
                   sitting in a chair across from him -- his shirt has 
                   been removed. He looks very tense.
 SORAN                                      (re: VISOR)
                            A remarkable piece of equipment...
                            but a little inelegant, wouldn't 
                            you say? 
                                     (beat) 
                            Have you ever considered a 
                            prosthesis that would make you 
                            look a little more... normal?

 GEORDI                             What's normal?

 SORAN                             Normal is what everyone else is...
                            and what you are not.

 GEORDI                             What do you want?

                   Soran takes a moment.

 SORAN                             As you may or may not be aware, I 
                            am an El-Aurian. Some people call 
                            us a race of "listeners". We 
                            listen. 
                                     (beat) 
                            Right now, Mr. La Forge, you 
                            have my undivided attention. I 
                            want to listen to everything you 
                            know about trilithium. and me.

                   Geordi thinks.

 GEORDI                             Trilithium is an experimental 
                            compound developed by the 
                            Romulans. I think it's a 
                            derivative of --

                   Soran picks up the PADD from the desk and activates it. 
                   Suddenly something small, with sharp edges, can be 
                   seen MOVING just underneath Geordi's skin near his 
                   chest. Geordi moves his hand to the spot, but then the 
                   protrusion is suddenly gone.

 SORAN                             I don't want a science lecture. 
                            You were on that observatory 
                            looking for trilithium... why?

 GEORDI                             I was ordered to by the Captain.

                   On the PADD in Soran's hand, we can now see an interior 
                   graphic of Geordi's body sitting in the chair. The 
                   graphic is interactive, moving as Geordi moves. 
                   A BLINKING DOT represents the movement of the probe 
                   inside his body. Right now, the dot is in the middle 
                   of his chest.

 SORAN                             Let's try to move beyond the usual 
                            prisoner-interrogator banter, 
                            shall we? You have information, 
                            and I need it. 
                                     (beat) 
                            Did the Captain explain his orders 
                            to you? Did he say why you were 
                            searching for trilithium?

 GEORDI                             No.

 SORAN                             What about... Guinan? What has 
                            she told you about me?

 GEORDI                             Guinan? I don't know what you're 
                            talking about...

                   On the PADD, we now see the dot has moved to a position 
                   next to Geordi's heart. Soran looks up at Geordi.

 SORAN                             My instincts tell me you're lying. 
                            And I know that can't be easy for
                            you... 
                                     (off PADD) 
                            I can see you have a good heart.

                   Soran taps a control on the PADD. Suddenly Geordi
                   grabs his chest in pain. Soran watches Geordi for a 
                   few seconds, then taps the PADD again. Geordi gasps 
                   and starts to breathe.

 SORAN                             Oh... I forgot to tell you. While 
                            you were unconscious, I injected 
                            a nano-probe into your 
                            bloodstream. It's been navigating 
                            your cardiovascular system... and 
                            right now I've attached it to your 
                            left ventricle. 
                                     (smiles) 
                            A little trick I picked up 
                            from the Borg.

 GEORDI                                      (gasping)
                            Yeah... they're full of great 
                            ideas.

 SORAN                             I just stopped your heart for five 
                            seconds. It felt like an 
                            eternity, didn't it? Did you know 
                            that you can stop the human heart 
                            for up to ten minutes before the 
                            onset of brain damage?

 GEORDI                             No... I didn't know that...

 SORAN                             We learn something new about 
                            ourselves every day. 
                                     (beat) 
                            Now. Maybe I didn't make myself 
                            clear. It is very important that 
                            you tell me exactly what Captain 
                            Picard knows.

 GEORDI                             I told you everything... you might 
                            as well just kill me right now...

                   Soran's features soften as he smiles slightly. For a 
                   moment, he looks genuinely compassionate -- and it's 
                   a disturbing contrast to his usual dark intensity.

 SORAN                             I'm not a killer, Mr. La Forge. 
                                     (beat) 
                            Let's try thirty seconds.

                   Soran taps a control on the PADD. Geordi gasps and 
                   strains against an unimaginable pain.

                   Soran picks up his pocket watch and opens the cover...
                   sits back in his chair, watching the seconds tick
                   away...

 CUT TO: 
 84 INT. STELLAR CARTOGRAPHY (VFX-P) 84 
                   A room filled with exotic-looking devices, sensors and 
                   computers which handle the enormous task of tracking 
                   the ship's position in space. 

                   The monitors around the room display various diagrams 
                   of the ENERGY RIBBON (as seen in the beginning of the 
                   film).

                   Data is sitting at a computer console which has a great 
                   deal of complex information on the screen. Picard is 
                   standing next to him. Throughout the following, Data 
                   seems distracted and preoccupied.
 DATA                             According to our information, the 
                            ribbon is a conflux of temporal 
                            energy which travels through our 
                            galaxy every thirty-nine point one 
                            years

 PICARD                             When is it expected back?

                   Data doesn't answer right away.

 PICARD                             Data?

 DATA                             Sorry, Captain. The Ribbon has 
                            already entered the galaxy. It 
                            will pass through this sector in 
                            approximately thirty-one hours.

                   Picard moves about the room... he's frustrated... 
                   tired... but determined to find out what's going on.

 PICARD                             Guinan said Soran was trying to 
                            get back to the ribbon... if 
                            that's true, then there must be 
                            some connection with the Amargosa 
                            star.

 DATA                             The star's destruction has had 
                            numerous astro-physical effects 
                            within this sector. However, none 
                            of them appear to have a 
                            connection to the energy ribbon.

 PICARD                             Give me a list of those effects. 
                            I want to know every single thing 
                            which has been altered or 
                            changed... no matter how 
                            insignificant...

 DATA                             It will take a few moments for the 
                            computer to compile the 
                            information.

                   Data works the computer and then the computer begins to 
                   work. Data sighs -- his expression becomes downcast 
                   and gloomy. He sits down and puts his head in his 
                   hands. Picard finally has to say something.

 PICARD                             Data, are you all right?

 DATA                             No, sir. I am finding it 
                            difficult to concentrate... I 
                            believe I am overwhelmed with 
                            feelings of... remorse and regret 
                            concerning my actions on the 
                            observatory.

 PICARD                             What do you mean?

 DATA                             I wanted to save Geordi... I 
                            tried. but I experienced 
                            something I did not expect. 
                                     (beat) 
                            I believe it was fear.

                   Picard regards him sympathetically.

 PICARD                             Fear is a very difficult emotion 
                            to overcome. It's something we 
                            all have to learn to deal with.

 DATA                             But I did not deal with it, sir. 
                            I let it prevent me from helping 
                            my friend. 
                                     (beat) 
                            Does that make me a coward?

 PICARD                             No. And what you must try to 
                            avoid is becoming consumed by 
                            another emotion which I believe 
                            you're beginning to experience...
                            guilt.

 DATA                                      (considers)
                            Guilt. It is a most unpleasant 
                            feeling.

 84A ANGLE (VFX-P) 84A 
                   The computer finishes its calculations and the console 
                   BEEPS. Data works the console. Information appears on 
                   screen.

 DATA                             According to our current 
                            information, the destruction of 
                            the Amargosa star has had the 
                            following effects in this sector: 
                            gamma emissions have increased by
                            five percent... the starship 
                            Bozeman was forced to make a
                            course correction... a research
                            project on Gorik Four was 
                            halted due to increased neutrino 
                            particles... ambient magnetic 
                            fields have decreased by --

 PICARD                             Wait. The Bozeman... why did it 
                            change course?

 DATA                                      (matter of fact)
                            The destruction of the Amargosa 
                            star has altered the gravitational
                            forces throughout the sector. Any 
                            ship passing through this region 
                            will have to make a minor course 
                            correction.

                   Picard is starting to get an idea... he's onto 
                   something here. He moves to a large table in the 
                   center of the room.

 PICARD                                      (musing)
                            A minor course correction...

                            Where is the ribbon now?

 84B ANGLE (VFX-P) 84B 
                   Data moves to the table to work. after a few beats, 
                   an elaborate map of the galaxy springs up on the 
                   ceiling of the room. A BLINKING DOT shows the position 
                   of the ribbon.

 DATA                             This is its current position.

 PICARD                             Can you project its course?

                   Data hesitates... still obsessed with his own emotional 
                   turmoil. Picard finally has to lay down the law.

 PICARD                                      (firm)
                            Data. I have nothing but sympathy 
                            for what you're going through. 
                            But right now, I need your full 
                            attention on the task at hand.  
                            If you can't provide it... then I'll 
                            have to relieve you of duty until 
                            Doctor Crusher can remove this.
                            emotion chip of yours. I'm sorry, 
                            but you leave me no other choice.

                   This snaps Data back... he considers this for a long 
                   moment, then looks  determined.

 DATA                             I do not wish to remove the chip, 
                            sir. Although these emotions are
                            proving difficult to deal with...
                            I cannot imagine going back to a 
                            life without them. I have taken 
                            an important step toward becoming 
                            truly human. If I were to turn 
                            back now...
                                     (beat) 
                            I would like to continue in my 
                            duties, sir.

                   Picard smiles at him.

 PICARD                             Courage is an emotion too, Data. 
                                     (beat) 
                            Now... can you project the course
                            of the ribbon?

 DATA                             I believe so.

                   Data works the console. A RED LINE moves to form an 
                   arc through the star field. Picard examines the display 
                   for a moment and nods... he's excited, on to 
                   something...

 PICARD                             Enhance grid A-nine.

                   Data works and the display now ZOOMS into a single

 PICARD                             Where was the Amargosa star?

                   Data works. A STAR is highlighted near the red line.

 PICARD                             Now... you said the gravitational
                            forces in this sector have been 
                            altered... could that also affect 
                            the course of the ribbon?

 DATA                                      (thinks)
                            I believe so.

                   position. Picard is beginning to realize what's going on.

 PICARD                             That's what Soran's doing... he's 
                            changing its course.

                            with a ship?

                   Data thinks for a moment.

 DATA                             Our records show that every ship

                            has either been destroyed or 
                            severely damaged.

                   Picard thinks about this... then has a flash of 
                   insight.

 PICARD                             He can't go to the ribbon... so 
                            he's trying to make the ribbon 
                            come to him.
                                     (beat) 
                            Data, is it going to pass near any 
                            M-Class planets?

 DATA                                      (works)
                            Yes, sir. There are two in the 
                            Veridian system.

 84E ANGLE (VFX-P) 84E 
                   The display ZOOMS IN on a star very close to the 
                   ribbon's path. We now see a SOLAR SYSTEM with a single 
                   star and FOUR PLANETS. The RED LINE moves directly 
                   through the system -- it passes very close to the third
                   planet. Picard eyes that planet and points to it.

 PICARD                             It's very close to Veridian 
                            Three... but not close enough...

                   Picard's mind is going a mile a minute. He suddenly 
                   has a horrible realization.

 PICARD                             Data, what would happen to the 
                            ribbon's path if he destroyed the
                            Veridian star itself?

 84F ANGLE (VFX-P) 84F 
                   Data works. On the display, the Veridian star suddenly 
                   DARKENS and GOES OUT. The RED LINE shifts slightly 
                   until it makes an exact INTERSECTION WITH THE THIRD 
                   PLANET. They both react to this sight. they're both 
                   aware of just how serious this is.

 PICARD                             That's where he's going.

 DATA                             It should be noted, sir, that the 
                            collapse of the Veridian star 
                            would produce a shock wave similar 
                            to the one we observed at 
                            Amargosa.

 PICARD                                      (grim)
                            And destroy every planet in the 
                            system.

                   Picard eyes the graphic with a sense of dread.

 PICARD                             Are any of them inhabited?

 DATA                             Veridian Three is uninhabited.
                            but Veridian Four supports a pre-
                            industrial humanoid society.

 PICARD                             Population?

 DATA                             Approximately two hundred thirty 
                            million.

                   A grim beat.

 WORF'S COM VOICE                             Worf here, sir.

                   Picard heads for the exit, a sense of urgency and 
                   determination in his every move.

 PICARD                             Red Alert, Mister Worf. Set a 
                            course for the Veridian system,

 LURSA                             Did you get anything from the 
                            human?

 SORAN                             No. His heart just isn't in it.

 KLINGON HELM                                      (off console)
                            We have entered orbit of Veridian 
                            Three.

 SORAN                             Prepare to transport me to the 
                            surface.

 B'ETOR                             Wait. When do we get our payment?

                   Soran hands B'Etor a small computer CHIP.

 SORAN                             This contains all the information 
                            you'll need to build a trilithium

                            I'm safely to the surface, I'll 
                            transmit the decryption sequence

 KLINGON HELM                             They are hailing us.

 B'ETOR                             Du'cha (On speakers.)

                   The Helm works. We hear PICARD'S COM VOICE.

 PICARD'S COM VOICE                             Klingon vessel. We know what 
                            you're doing, and we will destroy 
                            any probe launched toward the 
                            Veridian star.

                   Soran's expression darkens.

 B'ETOR                             What do we do?

                   Soran checks his watch.

 SORAN                             There's no time for this. 
                            Eliminate them.

 B'ETOR                                      (reacts)
                            That is a Galaxy class Starship. 
                            We are no match for them.

                   Soran thinks for a moment... then  he gets an idea. He 
                   pulls Geordi's VISOR out of a pocket. He eyes it with 
                   intent.

 SORAN                             I think it's time we gave Mister 
                            La Forge his sight back.

                   Off Lursa and B'Etor's curiosity...

 CUT TO: 
 87 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (VFX-I) 87 
                   nearing Veridian Three. The planet's STAR is visible.
 88 INT. BRIDGE 88 
                   Picard is pacing. Riker, Data, Worf, Troi, N.D.s at 
                   their stations. The ship is at Red Alert. Data's mood 
                   has improved. He's making an effort to keep a positive 
                   outlook... to stay upbeat.

 RIKER                             Maybe they're not out there.

 PICARD                             They're just trying to decide 
                            whether a twenty year-old Klingon 
                            Bird of Prey is any match for the 
                            Federation flagship.

 TROI                             Or perhaps they're on the 
                            surface...

 PICARD                             Mister Data, scan the planet for 
                            life forms.

                   Data smiles, delighted at the request.

 DATA                             I was hoping you would ask me to 
                            do that, Captain. I just love to 
                            scan for life forms.

                   As Data works, he breaks into a merry little song.

 DATA                                      (sings)
                            "Life forms... tiny little 
                            life forms... where are the 
                            life forms --"

 PICARD                             Commander.

 DATA                             Sorry, sir. 
                                     (works) 
                            There is too much interference in 
                            the planet's ionosphere for an 
                            accurate reading.

                   Worf turns to Picard.

 WORF                             Sir, according to my calculations, 
                            a solar probe launched from either
                            the Klingon ship or the planet's 
                            surface will take eleven seconds 
                            to reach the star. 
                                     (beat) 
                            However, since we do not know the 
                            exact point of origin, it will 
                            take us between eight and fifteen 
                            seconds to lock our weapons onto 
                            it.

                   They exchange a grim look.

 RIKER                                      (quiet, to Picard)
                            That's a pretty big margin of 
                            error.

 PICARD                             Too big. How long until the 
                            ribbon arrives?

 DATA                             Approximately forty-seven minutes, 
                            sir.

 PICARD                                      (disturbed)
                            I have to find a way to get to 
                            Soran...

                   An alarm goes off on Worf's console.

 WORF                             Captain, Klingon vessel decloaking

 PICARD                             On screen.

 88B ANGLE (VFX-P) 88B 
                   On the view screen, Lursa and B'Etor APPEAR.

 LURSA                             Captain. What an unexpected 
                            pleasure.

 PICARD                             Lursa, I want to talk to Soran.

 LURSA                             I'm afraid the Doctor is no longer 
                            aboard our ship.

 PICARD                             Then I'll beam down to his 
                            location. Just give us his 
                            coordinates.

 B'ETOR                             The Doctor values his privacy. He 
                            would be quite... upset if an 
                            Away Team interrupted him.

 PICARD                             Very well... I'll beam to your 
                            ship and you can transport me to 
                            Soran...

 RIKER                                      (urgent)
                            Sir, you can't trust them. 
                            They'll kill you just like they 
                            Killed Geordi.

                   Lursa and B'Etor exchange a glance.

 LURSA                                      (innocent)
                            We did not kill your Engineer. 
                            He's been... our guest.

 RIKER                             Then return him.

 B'ETOR                             In exchange for what?

 PICARD                             Me... If you let me speak to 
                            Soran.

                   The two sisters appear to consider this for a moment.

 B'ETOR                                      (to Lursa)
                            The Captain would make a much more 
                            valuable hostage.

 LURSA                                      (to Picard)
                            We'll consider it a prisoner 
                            exchange.

 PICARD                             Agreed.

                   The transmission ENDS. Picard heads for the Turbolift.
 PICARD                             Number One, you have the Bridge.

                   As Picard EXITS...

 89 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (VFX-P) 89 
                   Picard stands on the platform. Crusher and NURSE OGAWA 
                   stand nearby. The TRANSPORTER CHIEF works his console.

 PICARD                             Energize.

                   Picard DEMATERIALIZES -- and at the same instant, 
                   Geordi MATERIALIZES. Beverly and Ogawa rush to his 
                   aide, pull out their tricorders and scan him. Geordi
                   is conscious, and he's wearing his VISOR.

 CUT TO: 
 90 EXT. MOUNTAINTOP - DAY (VFX-P) 90                    A large plateau ringed with trees and underbrush. A 
                   single ROCK FACE juts upward, forming a backdrop for the 
                   plateau. Against the rock face, a large SCAFFOLDING has 
                   been erected -- planks and beams forming a complex 
                   structure -- ladders connect each level. It leads to 
                   a narrow ledge a dozen meters above.

                   Picard MATERIALIZES on the plateau. (NOTE: Picard's 
                   combadge is gone and he is unarmed.) A moment as he 
                   looks around. strange animals and birds can be heard. 

                   He turns and sees Soran standing nearby, calmly looking 
                   at his pocket watch. Soran puts the watch away.

 SORAN                             You must think I'm quite the 
                            madman.

 PICARD                             The thought had crossed my mind...

 SORAN                             The only possible reason you're 
                            here is because you're not 
                            entirely confident you can shoot 
                            down my probe after all. So 
                            you've come to dissuade me from 
                            my horrific plan. 
                                     (beat) 
                            Good luck.

                   Soran turns his back on Picard and walks away.

                   Picard takes a step to follow him and then is JOLTED
                   backward by a large FORCEFIELD which briefly flashes 
                   into view. The field completely surrounds the plateau, 
                   enclosing Soran and the scaffolding, with Picard on the 
                   outside. OFF Picard's surprise...

                   Suddenly, Crusher's face looms large in the picture, as 
                   if she's leaning over Geordi. She smiles and starts 
                   talking. We can see her lips move, but we can't hear 
                   what she's saying.

                   Picard is walking the perimeter of the invisible

                   concentrating on his PADD as Picard tries to engage him 
                   on some level.

 PICARD                             You don't need to do this, 
                            Soran... I'm sure we could find 
                            another way to get you into this 
                            Nexus.

 93A ANGLE (VFX-P) 93A 
                   Soran gets up and works his control PADD. Suddenly a 
                   probe LAUNCHER DECLOAKS  in the middle of the plateau. 
                   The launcher is a cylindrical apparatus the size of a 
                   small car. 

                   Soran goes to the launcher, steps onto it and begins 
                   working the control panel.

 SORAN                                      (calm, distracted)
                            I've spent eighty years looking 
                            for another way, Captain. This is 
                            the only one. 
                                     (beat) 
                            Of course, you could always come 
                            with me. You fancy yourself an 
                            explorer. Here's a chance to 
                            explore something no human has 
                            ever experienced.

 PICARD                             Not if it means killing over two 
                            hundred million people. 
                                     (beat, then with 
                                      meaning) 
                            I wonder... did your wife Leandra 
                            know that she married a man who 
                            was capable of mass murder?

                   This has touched a nerve in Soran... something dark 
                   and ugly flickers across his face.

 PICARD                                      (continuing; pressing on)
                            When you tucked your children into 
                            bed... do you suppose they ever
                            suspected that their father would 
                            one day kill millions as casually 
                            as he kissed them goodnight?

                   Soran looks up at Picard... and for a moment we can see 
                   that Picard has really gotten to him here... then he 
                   finally smiles a smile that doesn't quite reach his 
                   eyes.

 SORAN                             Nice try.

                   Forcefield. he's also still trying to engage Soran, 
                   find some way to get to him.
 PICARD                             What you're about to do is no 
                            different from when the Borg 
                            destroyed your world.

                   Soran continues to work... keeps his voice calm and 
                   conversational.

 SORAN                             You're right. And there was a 
                            time when I wouldn't have hurt 
                            anyone. Then the Borg came... and 
                            they showed me that if there is 
                            one constant in this universe, 
                            it's death.

                            Afterwards, I began to realize 
                            that none of it mattered. We're 
                            all going to die anyway. It's 
                            only a question of how and when. 
                            You will too, Captain. You might 
                            contract a fatal disease... you 
                            might die in battle...

                   Soran now turns and fixes Picard with a penetrating 
                   look.

 SORAN                             ... or burn to death in a fire.

                   Picard freezes at this. Soran steps off the launcher 
                   with a confident look... he moves closer to where 
                   Picard is standing.

 SORAN                             You looked surprised. But you 
                            shouldn't be. I've been to the 
                            Nexus, Captain. I know things 
                            about people. 
                                     (beat) 
                            Aren't you beginning to feel time 
                            gaining on you? It's like a 
                            predator. It's stalking you. You 
                            can try to outrun it with 
                            doctors... medicines.new 
                            technologies... but in the end, 
                            time is going to hunt you down...
                            and make the kill.

                   This strikes home with Picard's own recent concerns...
                   he struggles for a moment.

 PICARD                             We're all. mortal, Soran. It's 
                            one of the truths of our 
                            existence.

 SORAN                             What if I told you I found a new 
                            truth...

 SORAN                             Time has no meaning there. The 
                            predator has no teeth.

                   Soran glances up at the sky expectantly, then turns 
                   away from Picard and goes back to work on the Launcher.

                   GNARLED ROOT from a large nearby tree. The root is 
                   poking out of the ground, leaving a small arch through 
                   which daylight can be seen. Picard's mind begins

                   the pebble into the air, where it HITS the forcefield.

                   -- Soran turns at the sound of the crackling field.

 SORAN                             Careful, Captain. That's a fifty

 WORF                             I do not see how. The plasma coil 
                            is part of their cloaking

 RIKER                                      (to Data)
                            Could we access the defective coil 
                            and trigger their cloak?

                                     (suddenly enthusiastic) 
                            Yes! If we sent a low-level ionic
                            pulse, it might reset the coil and 
                            engage the cloaking systems.

 WORF                                      (onto the idea)
                            As their cloak begins to engage, 
                            their shields will drop.

 RIKER                             Right. And they'll be vulnerable

 RIKER                             Worf, prepare a spread of photon

                            the instant they begin to cloak.

 WORF                             Aye, sir.

 RIKER                             We're only going to get one shot

                   He glances at Soran, who's absorbed with his work on

                   Picard then surreptitiously TOSSES a pebble toward the

                   looks over his shoulder at Picard, who sits down on a 
                   rock. Soran returns to his work.

                   another pebble toward the root. This time, the pebble 
                   bounces underneath the arch and rolls onto the plateau -

                   easy. he knows there's not much room between the 
                   ground and the invisible field. he just gets his head
                   and shoulders underneath when he accidentally TOUCHES the 
                   field and it CRACKLES violently around him --Picard is 
                   jolted by the shock.

 132A SORAN (VFX-P) 132A 
                   turns at the sound of the field, sees Picard, and then 
                   draws his weapon. Soran quickly fires at Picard.

 132B THE GROUND (VFX-P) 132B 
                   is BLASTED APART, creating a cloud of dirt and smoke, 
                   obscuring Picard  and the whole area momentarily.

                   -- Soran jumps down one level on the scaffolding, his 
                      disruptor still in his hand, ready just in case Picard 
                      somehow survived. Soran peers through the cloud of 
                      dust and debris.

                   -- The dust from the explosion finally CLEARS... but 
                      Picard is gone along with several feet of the ground 
                      where he was crawling.

 132C SORAN (VFX-I) 132C 
                   glances up at the sky and sees the distant ENERGY
                   RIBBON just coming into view. There's no time to look 
                   for Picard. 

                   -- Soran begins to climb the scaffolding.

 143 EXT. MOUNTAINTOP - DAY 143 
                   Soran is climbing up the scaffolding. He gets a couple 
                   of levels up, and then suddenly a BOOT kicks him in the 
                   face. Picard has made it inside the field.

                   A quick fight ensues, during which Picard is knocked a 
                   few levels down on the scaffolding. He LANDS hard --
                   happens to look up into the sky. He sees something.--

 144 PICARD'S POV - THE SKY (VFX-I) 144 
                   The ENERGY RIBBON can be seen in the distant sky 

                   -- a bizarre snake of color streaking across the deep blue 
                      sky. Time is almost up.

 145 RESUME ACTION (VFX-I) 145 
                   -- Picard avoids a vicious kick from Soran, glances 
                      down at the probe launcher, and realizes he's got one 
                      chance. He rolls to his feet, runs toward the probe 
                      launcher.

                   -- There is a THUNDEROUS ROAR as the launcher FIRES THE
                      PROBE into the sky.

                   -- The plateau is suddenly quiet as the probe streaks
                      toward the distant sun and disappears from view. 
                      Picard gets to his knees, stares after the probe, 
                      shocked. He's failed. 

                   -- They watch the sun for a silent moment, waiting...

 146 THE SUN (VFX-I) 146 
                   begins to DARKEN and COLLAPSE, as seen before.

 147 RESUME PLATEAU 147 
                   the scene DARKENS as the sun goes out... and NIGHT 
                   FALLS on the planet.
                    Soran, a look of profound elation on his face, makes 
                   his way to the top of the scaffolding and looks into 
                   the sky.

 148 PICARD (VFX-I) 148 
                   gets to his feet and stares at the onrushing Ribbon,
                   the wind whipping up on the plateau. He backs away at 
                   the sight, coming to a stop with his back against the
                   scaffolding. There's no where to run...

                   suddenly the Ribbon is GONE... and so are Picard and 
                   Soran. The plateau is strangely and utterly SILENT
                   after the passage of the Ribbon... even the birds have 
                   stopped chirping in the trees.

                   As the ENERGY RIBBON rushes past the camera, a HUGE

                   it EXPLODES in a blast of fiery debris.

 CUT TO: 
 151 CLOSE ON PICARD 151 
                   being led through a darkened HALLWAY. He is wearing a 
                   blindfold. Off screen hands tug and pull at him, 
                   leading him forward down the hall. 

                   He's lost and confused, unsure where he is or what's 
                   going on. He tries to resist, but can't... the hands 
                   keep pulling at him...

                   He is finally brought out into a larger room, dark. 
                   The hands release him and he stands alone. He takes a 
                   beat and tries to take control of the situation.

 PICARD                              What's going on? Where am I?

                   Two hands reach into frame from off screen and remove 
                   the blindfold...

 152 PICARD'S POV 152 
                   The blindfold drops, revealing a blurry kaleidoscope of 
                   COLORS and SHAPES...

 153 ON PICARD 153 
                   as he blinks and tries to focus...

 154 PICARD'S POV 154 
                   As the room comes into focus. The first thing we see 
                   is an enormous, gaily decorated CHRISTMAS TREE
                   sparkling with hundreds of lights.

 155 REVEAL THE ROOM 155 
                   A 24th-century FRENCH LIVING ROOM. It is beautifully
                   decorated with lights, ornaments, holly. brightly 
                   wrapped presents are clustered beneath the Christmas 
                   tree. There are FIVE CHILDREN standing and sitting in 
                   the room, all looking at Picard with bright, smiling 
                   faces, waiting for him to say something.

                   Picard stares at the scene for a moment, unsure how to 
                   react. Then we hear the woman's voice again, and we 
                   move to reveal an attractive WOMAN in her forties 
                   standing next to Picard.

 WOMAN                              Go on... say something. They're 
                             waiting.

                   Picard is stunned.

 PICARD                              I... don't know what to say...

                   One of the children, a young GIRL, speaks up.

 GIRL                              Say Merry Christmas, Papa!

 PICARD                                      (in a daze)
                             Merry... Christmas...

                   The children break out into applause. The woman kisses 
                   him on the cheek, then steers him to a large, 
                   overstuffed chair. Picard sits down and the 
                   children starts handing out presents with much laughter 
                   and chatting.

 CHILDREN                              This one's for you... where's 
                             mine?... I hope this is the book 
                             I asked for... take this one to 
                             Papa...

                   As the activity swirls around him, Picard begins to 
                   feel an immense  sense of satisfaction and happiness. 
                   It's like a drug -- an overwhelming feeling of joy and 
                   contentment fills Picard. It's a wondrous experience. 
                   He settles back in the chair and a smile spreads across 
                   his face. For reasons he cannot name and does not even 
                   want to understand at the moment, he is very, very 
                   happy.
 GIRL                                      (to Picard)
                             Isn't the tree beautiful, Papa?

                   Picard answers as if it were the most natural thing in 
                   the world.

 PICARD                              Oh yes... yes, it's astonishingly 
                             beautiful. All of it.

                   All of the children now crowd around the chair with a 
                   single large gift and hand it to Picard. One of the 
                   younger boys speaks up.

 YOUNG BOY                              This is from all of us.

 PICARD                              Thank you... I can't imagine what 
                             it is.

                   Picard tears open the box and pulls out a 19th century 
                   SEXTANT - an old-fashioned nautical navigational 
                   instrument. It's a beautiful piece with polished and 
                   gleaming brass.

 YOUNG BOY                                      (excited)
                             It's a sack-tent!

                   Picard eyes it with delight.

 PICARD                              You mean a sextant. And it's a 
                             handsome one at that... from about 
                             eighteen twenty, I'd say. 
                             Wherever did you find it?

 GIRL                              It's a secret.

 PICARD                                      (smiles)
                             Oh, a secret... well, that makes 
                             it a doubly special gift. Thank 
                             you... thank you all...

                   The children react with pleasure. They cluster around 
                   him, showering him with hugs and kisses.

 CHILDREN                              Merry Christmas, Papa... I love 
                             You, Father... etc.

                   Picard is covered in a blanket of love and affection. 
                   The children pull back and return to their own 
                   presents. There is a swirl of activity and commotion 
                   as a warm and heartfelt Christmas morning is played 
                   out.

 WOMAN                                      (to Picard)
                             I'll go get dinner ready.
                             they'll be starving in a minute.

                   Picard nods as the woman EXITS the room. He looks 
                   around the scene, utterly happy, utterly content.

                   The children continue to chatter and laugh among 
                   themselves as Picard's eye falls on the glorious 
                   Christmas tree. He can't help but smile as he looks 
                   over the ornaments and decorations...

 156 PICARD'S POV 156 
                   of the sparkling lights and ornaments -- a swirl of 
                   color and light.

 157 PICARD 157 
                   His eye is caught by something in particular on the 
                   tree. He leans forward slightly and stares at it.

 158 PICARD'S POV (VFX-P) 158 
                   His eye has been caught by an ORNAMENT near the 
                   top of the tree. It is a large and beautiful glass 
                   ball with a tiny LIGHT at the center in the shape of a 
                   star. As Picard watches, the star suddenly GOES OUT...
                   and it radiates a SHIMMERING LIGHT EFFECT that expands 
                   outward into the glass sphere.

                   It's a startling and beautiful ornament whose effect is 
                   reminiscent of the star going out, as seen earlier in the 
                   movie. But this is just coincidence. this is the way 
                   the ornament was designed and it's simply one of many 
                   ornaments on the tree.

 159 PICARD 159 
                   reacts. The image of the ornament has touched a nerve 
                   within him somewhere. It has reminded him of something 
                   he'd nearly forgotten - a discordant note in an 
                   otherwise wondrous and magical scene. He frowns, the 
                   reverie momentarily disrupted. But he tries to push it 
                   aside, not wanting the spell to be broken. He stands 
                   and turns away from the tree and looks out a nearby 
                   window -- it's snowing and the beautiful image of snow 
                   soothes him for a moment. Then he reacts to something.

 160 PICARD'S POV (VFX-P) 160                    reflected on the pane of glass is the image of the 
                   ornament -- it's still blinking. Picard now realizes 
                   that this image is not going to go away... he can't 
                   hide from it.

 PICARD                              No... this isn't right... this 
                             can't be real...

 GUINAN'S VOICE                              It's as real as you want it to be.

                   Picard turns to see

 161 GUINAN (VFX-P) 161 
                   standing before him. She is wearing the same outfit 
                   seen in the beginning of the movie on the Enterprise-B. 
                   As they talk, the children and the woman continue to 
                   move about their business as if Picard and Guinan 
                   aren't there.

                   Picard is stunned.

 PICARD                              Guinan... what's going on? Where 
                             am I?

 GUINAN                              You're in the Nexus.

                   Picard looks around.

 PICARD                              This... is the Nexus?

 GUINAN                              For you. This is where you wanted 
                             to be...

 PICARD                              But I never had a wife, children, 
                             a home like this...

 GUINAN                              Enjoy them, Jean-Luc...

                   Picard tries to make sense of it- he focuses on 
                   Guinan.

 PICARD                              Guinan, what are you doing here? 
                             I thought you were on the 
                             Enterprise.
 GUINAN                              I am on the Enterprise...I am 
                             also here. 
                                     (off his puzzled look) 
                             Think of me as... an "echo" of the 
                             person you know... a part of her
                             she left behind...

 PICARD                              Left behind...?

 GUINAN                              When the Enterprise-B beamed us 
                             off the Lakul, we were partially 
                             in the Nexus. The transporters 
                             locked on to us... but somehow 
                             everyone left a part of themselves 
                             behind.

 PICARD                              Soran...?

 GUINAN                              All of us.

 PICARD                              Where is he now?

 GUINAN                              Wherever he wanted to be...

                   Guinan smiles at him.

 BOY'S VOICE                              Papa, help me build my castle!

                   Picard glances over at the boy, who is building a play 
                   castle out of the 24th-century equivalent of "Lego". 
                   For a moment, Picard is tempted to drift back to the 
                   warm embrace of the fantasy...

 PICARD                                      (to boy)
                             In a few minutes...

                   Picard looks around at the children... the lure to stay 
                   here becoming more powerful.

 PICARD                                      (continuing, awed, to 
                                      Guinan)
                             These are my children... my 
                             children...

 GUINAN                                      (smiles)
                             Yeah. They're great, aren't they? 
                             You can go back and see them 
                             born... go forward and see your 
                             grandchildren... time has no
                             meaning here.

 WOMAN'S VOICE                              Dinner's ready! Let's go!

                   There's a general rush toward the adjacent dining room. 
                   The youngest boy looks at Picard, goes over to him and 
                   takes his hand.

 BOY                              Papa... are you coming?

                   Picard looks down into the face of his child. His 
                   heart swells, the temptation to stay here and live this 
                   out is profound. Almost in a trance, he takes a few 
                   steps with the child toward the dining room... His eye 
                   is caught again by the unusual ornament on the tree for a 
                   moment... torn between the two images. and then, in 
                   one of the most difficult moments of his life, he bends 
                   down to the child...

 PICARD                              Go on... go on without me...

                   The boy looks at him quizzically for a moment, then 
                   obeys his father and dashes off toward the dining room 
                   to join the others. Picard straightens up and tries to 
                   steel his voice.

 PICARD                              Guinan... can I leave the Nexus?

 GUINAN                              Why would you want to leave?

 PICARD                                      (insistent)
                             Can I?

 GUINAN                              Yes... where would you go?

 PICARD                              I don't understand.

 GUINAN                              I told you, time has no meaning 
                             here. If you leave, you can go 
                             anywhere... any time.

                   Picard realizes the opportunity before him.
 PICARD                              I know exactly where I want to 
                             go... and when. Back to that 
                             mountaintop on Veridian Three...
                             before Soran put out the star. I 
                             have to stop him.

 GUINAN                              What makes you think things will 
                             be any different this time?

 PICARD                              You're right. I'll need help. 
                                     (beat) 
                             Guinan, will you come back with 
                             me? Together, we could --

 GUINAN                              I can't leave. I'm already there, 
                             remember?

                   Picard looks crestfallen for a moment. Guinan gives 
                   him an enigmatic smile.

 GUINAN                              I know just the guy.

                   Suddenly there's the cry of a HAWK from offscreen. 
                   Picard turns at the sound --

 162 EXT. KIRK'S HOME - DAY 162 
                   Picard finds himself standing outside a rustic, but
                   Architecturally striking house with spectacular views 
                   in the Canadian Rockies. A hawk is circling overhead, 
                   making the crying sound that Picard heard. The air is
                   cold, frigid -- Picard can see his breath. Picard is 
                   just starting to adjust to this sudden change in 
                   location when he hears the sound of wood being CHOPPED
                   from around the corner of the house. Picard moves to 
                   look around the corner and sees -

                   James T. Kirk. He's still in his uniform and looks 
                   exactly as he did the last time we saw him aboard the  
                   Enterprise-B at the beginning of the film. He is 
                   vigorously chopping wood with an axe. He's enjoying 
                   himself, lost in the sheer pleasure of the manual
                   labor. He's never felt this good in his life. There's 
                   no trace of back pain or any other ailment. Picard 
                   recognizes the famous Captain - as would any 24
                   Century Starfleet officer.

 PICARD                              James Kirk.

                   Kirk pauses, looks up at the strange man before him. 
                   His expression is wondrous, almost child-like. Like in    
                   Picard's Christmas sequence, Kirk is immersed in the 
                   sensual feeling of the Nexus. It's like a dream that's
                   over-powered him.

 KIRK                              Beautiful day, isn't it?

 PICARD                              Yes... yes, it is.

                   Kirk points to a nearby log on the woodpile.

 KIRK                              Do you mind?

                   It takes Picard a beat before he realizes that Kirk 
                   wants him to put the log on the chopping block for him.

 PICARD                              Oh.

                   Picard places the log on the block and Kirk gives it a 
                   vigorous chop with the axe.

 PICARD                              Captain, do you realize what --

                   But Kirk interrupts as he sees something o.c.

 KIRK                              Wait a second. I think 
                             something's burning.

                   Picard follows his look to see SMOKE billowing out of 
                   one of the windows of the house. Kirk rushes into the 
                   house, and Picard follows...

 163 INT. KIRK'S HOME- KITCHEN - DAY - CONTINUOUS 163 
                   Kirk rushes in. The kitchen's decor is 19th century 
                   with a few 23rd Century touches -- copper pans and an 
                   antique stove mixed comfortably with computer consoles 
                   and Starfleet paraphernalia. Picard hesitates in the 
                   doorway -- a little unsure about rushing into some 
                   stranger's house.

                   Kirk yanks a burning frying pan of food off the stove. 
                   It's very hot -- he quickly sets it down near the sink, 
                   waves the smoke away with his hand. 

 KIRK                              Looks like someone was cooking 
                             eggs... 
                                     (to Picard) 
                             Come on in, it's all right. This 
                             is my house -- or at least it used 
                             to be, I sold it years ago.

                   Picard comes in and tries to orient Kirk to what's 
                   going on.

 PICARD                              I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the 
                             starship Enterprise.

                   Before Kirk can react to this remark, an antique CLOCK
                   on a shelf CHIMES as it strikes the hour. Kirk moves 
                   to the shelf and looks at the clock in surprise and 
                   wonder -- he is entranced by this experience, beginning 
                   to connect with things and memories from his past.

 KIRK                              This clock... I gave this clock to 
                             Bones...

 PICARD                                      (pressing on)
                             I'm from what you would consider 
                             the future... the twenty-fourth
                             century.

                   Kirk hears what Picard is saying, but like Picard in 
                   his fantasy, he is more interested in the sights and 
                   sounds around him. A dog barks from o.c. They both 
                   look as a large black dog bounds into the room and greets 
                   Kirk with enthusiasm.

 KIRK                                      (affectionately)
                             Jake! Jake, you miserable old 
                             Mutt... How can you be here? 
                                     (to Picard)
                             He's been dead seven years.

                   Kirk is still looking around the kitchen when suddenly we 
                   hear a WOMAN'S VOICE from somewhere upstairs that 
                   stops Kirk in his tracks. As she speaks, we can see 
                   the shock on Kirk's face.

 ANTONIA'S VOICE                              Come on, Jim, I'm starving. How 
                             long are you going to be rattling 
                             around that kitchen?

                   A beat.

 KIRK                                      (amazed)
                             That's Antonia...

                   Kirk looks at the food on the stove. He's beginning to 
                   realize something.

 KIRK                              Wait a minute...

                   Kirk glances at Picard.

 KIRK                              The future... what are you 
                             talking about? This is the 
                             past...

                   Kirk moves to a drawer and opens it. Inside is a 
                   HORSESHOE with a tiny red bow tied to it. This 
                   confirms things for Kirk. He picks up the horseshoe.

 KIRK                              This is nine years ago... the day 
                             I told her I was going back to
                             Starfleet...

                   Kirk is swept up in the moment, overwhelmed by 
                   memories, sensations, feelings. He goes back to the 
                   frying pan and looks at the contents with a sudden 
                   burst of recognition.

 KIRK                              These were Ktarian eggs -- her 
                             favorite.I was cooking them to 
                             soften the blow... 
                                     (re: horseshoe) 
                             And I gave her this.

                   Picard steps in.

 PICARD                              I know how real this must seem to 
                             you, but it's not. This isn't 
                             Really your house. We've both   
                             been caught up in some sort of 
                             temporal nexus.

                   But Kirk's mind is clearly elsewhere... he's being 
                   swept away by the emotion of the moment... realizing the
                   opportunity he suddenly has.

 KIRK                              Dill weed.

                   Kirk indicates a shelf, as if asking Picard to go to 
                   it.

 KIRK                              There's a bottle of dill weed on 
                             the second shelf to the left, 
                             right behind the nutmeg.

                   Kirk moves to the stove and tosses out the ruined eggs. 
                   He cracks open two new eggs on the skillet and begins  
                   preparing a breakfast. Picard waits for a moment, then 
                   goes to the shelf, grabs the dill weed and hands it 
                   to Kirk.

 PICARD                              How long have you been here?

                   Kirk takes the bottle and uses it to season the eggs.

 KIRK                              I don't know. I was on the 
                             Enterprise-B... in the deflector 
                             control room... keep stirring 
                             these, will you?

                   Kirk moves to a cabinet and begins putting plates on a    
                   breakfast tray. Picard is getting a little impatient, 
                   but stirs the eggs anyway.

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             The bulkhead in front of me 
                             Disappeared... then I was out 
                             there chopping wood. 
                                     (back to stove) 
                             Thanks.

                   Kirk takes the pan of eggs back from Picard.

 PICARD                              History records that you died 
                             saving the Enterprise-B from an 
                             energy ribbon eighty years ago...

                   But Picard's words mean almost nothing to Kirk. He is  
                   Thoroughly enjoying himself and Picard is almost a
                   distraction. Kirk begins serving the eggs onto the 
                   plates and grabs a small vase of flowers to put on the
                   tray.

 KIRK                                      (amused)
                             So you're telling me this is the 
                             twenty-fourth century... and I'm 
                             dead?
 PICARD                              Not exactly. As I said, this is 
                             some kind of...

 KIRK                              Temporal nexus... yeah, I heard you. 
                                     (frowns at tray) 
                             Something's missing...

                   Then he remembers and turns to look at a nearby toaster -- 
                   as if on cue, two slices of toast pop out. Kirk grins 
                   and puts the toast on the plates. Kirk picks up the 
                   tray and heads for the door.

 PICARD                              Captain, I need your help. I want 
                             you to leave the Nexus with me.

                   Kirk goes out of the kitchen and Picard follows...

 164 INT. KIRK'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS 164 
                   Kirk and Picard both on the move. Kirk heading for a 
                   staircase.

 PICARD                              We have to go back to a planet 
                             called Veridian III and stop a 
                             man from destroying a star. There 
                             are millions of lives at stake.

                   Kirk tries to keep it light, hoping this man will go 
                   away.

 KIRK                              You said history considers me 
                             dead. Who am I to argue with 
                             history?

 PICARD                              You're a Starfleet Officer and you 
                             have a duty to --

 KIRK                                      (hard)
                             I don't need to be lectured by 
                             you. I was out saving the galaxy 
                             when your grandfather was still in 
                             diapers. And frankly, I think the 
                             galaxy owes me one 
                                     (beat) 
                             I was like you once... so worried 
                             about duty and obligations that I 
                             couldn't see anything past this 
                             uniform. And in the end, what did 
                             it get me? Nothing. Not this 
                             time.

                   Kirk brushes past Picard and stops at the foot of the 
                   stairs.

 KIRK                                      (looking up the stairs)
                             I'm going to walk up these stairs, 
                             march into that bedroom and tell
                             Antonia that I want to marry her.

                   Kirk begins to climb the stairs.

 KIRK                               This time things are going to be 
                              different.

                   He goes through a bedroom door and closes it behind 
                   him. Picard glances around the room in frustration, 
                   then gets a determined look on his face and marches up 
                   the stairs after Kirk, grasps the doorknob, opens it 
                   and steps through the door into

 165 INT. BARN - DAY - CONTINUOUS 165 
                   Picard suddenly finds himself standing in the doorway 
                   of a wooden barn. Straw on the floor... farm 
                   implements on the walls... sunlight streaming in 
                   through the slats. There are stalls in the barn with 
                   a few horses visible. 

                   Kirk is standing a short distance away -- he looks 
                   surprised as well... and he is no longer holding the
                   tray of food.

 PICARD                                      (re: barn)
                             This doesn't look like your 
                             bedroom.

                   Kirk looks around for a moment, the pieces starting to 
                   fall into place. He smiles with a growing 
                   realization...

 KIRK                              No... no, it's not. It's better.

 PICARD                              Better?

 KIRK                              This is my uncle's barn in Iowa...

                   He points to a horse with a saddle on it.

 KIRK                                      (re: horse)
                             I took that horse out for a ride 
                             seven years ago... on a spring 
                             day.

                   Kirk moves to the barn door and opens it revealing a  
                   beautiful spring day.
 KIRK                              Just like this. If I'm right, 
                             this is the day I met Antonia.

                   He turns to Picard.

 KIRK                              This Nexus of yours is very 
                             clever. I can start all over 
                             again -- do things right from day 
                             one.

                   Kirk grabs the horse, swings up onto the saddle, and 
                   rides out of the barn, filled with excitement. Picard 
                   watches him for a moment, then looks at one of the 
                   other horses in the barn. he makes a decision and
                   then moves toward a saddle hanging on the wall...
 CUT TO: 
 166 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY (VFX-P) 166 
                   Kirk is riding his horse hard over the countryside --
                   and across a stream... through a thicket of trees... and 
                   finally out onto a rolling plain. There is a large 
                   RAVINE up ahead. Kirk sees it and smiles tightly. He 
                   spurs his horse faster toward the ravine... The horse 
                   is tearing along... comes up to the edge of the 
                   precipice, and makes a daring leap to the other side.
                    Horse and rider land together and Kirk spurs the horse 
                   on. But as he rides, we begin to see a change come 
                   over him -- a look of doubt crosses his face. 
                   Something's not right. He slows the horse to a trot...
                   and then to a complete stop. He sits there for a 
                   moment and frowns. turns and looks back at the 
                   ravine, which is now a fair distance away. Something 
                   about that jump is nagging at him...

                   He turns his horse around and then digs in his heels. 
                   The horse breaks into a gallop, racing back toward the  
                   ravine. 

                   Kirk grips the reins tight in his hands and then the 
                   horse makes the LEAP across yet again.

                   This time when Kirk lands, he brings his horse to an   
                   immediate stop. We can see on his face that something 
                   is very wrong. He turns and stares at the ravine with 
                   a mixture of shock and sadness on his face.

                   In the distance, Picard can be seen approaching on a 
                   horse of his own. He stops next to Kirk. There is a 
                   long, quiet moment as the two men sit there side by 
                   side. Kirk is introspective as he sorts through his
                   feelings...

 KIRK                                      (re: ravine)
                             I must have made this jump fifty 
                             times. and every time it scared 
                             the hell out of me. But not this 
                             time.
                                     (beat) 
                             Because... it's not real.

                   A quiet beat. Kirk turns and looks toward a particular 
                   hill in the distance, shading his eyes against the 
                   bright sun. Picard follows his gaze and we can now see 
                   the distant figure of a WOMAN walking her horse.
 PICARD                                      (re: woman)
                             Antonia?

 KIRK                                      (nods)
                             She's not real either, is she? 
                             Nothing here is... nothing here 
                             matters...

                   All euphoria is now gone from Kirk -- It's a moment of 
                   self-revelation. He glances around.

 KIRK                              It's kinda like... orbital 
                             skydiving. Exciting for a few 
                             minutes... but in the end, you 
                             haven't really done anything...
                             you haven't made a difference...

                   Kirk takes a beat, then looks at Picard. And in a way, 
                   he's truly seeing him for the first time.

 KIRK                              Captain of the Enterprise, huh?

 PICARD                              That's right.

 KIRK                              Close to retirement?

 PICARD                              I hadn't planned on it.

                   There is a passion and a fervor in Kirk that we haven't 
                   seen until now.

 KIRK                              Well, let me tell you something - 
                             don't. Don't let them promote 
                             you... don't let them transfer 
                             you... don't let anything take you 
                             off the Bridge of that ship... 
                                     (beat) 
                             Because while you're there, you 
                             can make a difference.

                   The two captains face each other for a moment. Picard 
                   hears what Kirk is saying but also knows that's not the 
                   whole story. Picard gives him a direct look, and there 
                   is something in Picard's eyes -- a glint of resolve and  
                   determination.

 PICARD                              You don't need to be on the Bridge 
                             of a starship. Come with me. 
                             Help me stop Soran. 
                                     (beat) 
                             Make a difference again.

                   A long, silent beat as Kirk considers Picard. And slowly,  
                   unexpectedly, a smile spreads across his face.

 KIRK                              How can I argue with the Captain 
                             of the Enterprise? 
                                     (a beat)
                             What was the name of that 
                             Planet... Veridian III?

 PICARD                              That's right.

 KIRK                              I take it the odds are against us,
                             and the situation is grim?

 PICARD                              You could say that.

 KIRK                                      (musing)
                             Of course, if Spock were here, 
                             he'd say I was being an 
                             irrational, illogical human for 
                             wanting to go on a mission like 
                             that...

                   And for the first time, we can see the twinkle in his 
                   eye that tells us Jim Kirk is back.

 KIRK                              Sounds like fun.

                   The two men turn and walk away from Antonia.and as 
                   they walk, a ROAR OF COLOR AND SOUND WASHES OUT THE
                   SCREEN, as seen before.

 FADE TO RED 
 FADE IN: 
 167 EXT. MOUNTAINTOP - DAY (VFX-P) 167 
                   Soran is standing in front of the forcefield, facing 
                   Picard.

 SORAN                              Now, if you'll excuse me, Captain, 
                             I have an appointment with 
                             Eternity and I don't want to be 
                             late.

                   We realize we are watching the same events play out 
                   again.

                   Soran turns and begins to climb up the scaffolding 
                   toward the top of the rock face. Picard drops to the 
                   ground on his back and begins to wriggle underneath 
                   the forcefield. Picard accidentally TOUCHES the 
                   field...

 167A SORAN (VFX-P) 167A 
                   turns at the sound of the field, sees Picard, and then 
                   draws his weapon. Soran quickly FIRES at Picard.

 167B THE GROUND (VFX-P) 167B 
                   is BLASTED APART, creating a cloud of dirt and debris, 
                   obscuring Picard and the whole area momentarily.

                    -- Soran jumps down one level, his disruptor still in his  
                       hand, ready just in case Picard somehow survived. 

                   Soran peers through the cloud of dust and debris.
                     -- The dust CLEARS... but Picard is gone along with
                       several feet of the ground where he was crawling.

 167C SORAN (VFX-I) 167C 
                   Soran glances up at the sky and sees the ENERGY RIBBON,
                   then begins to climb the scaffolding. Suddenly a BOOT
                   kicks him in the head.

 168 REVEAL KIRK 168 
                   who is attacking Soran in Picard's place. The two men 
                   begin to fight.

 169 NEW ANGLE (VFX-P) 169 
                   as Picard rushes to the probe launcher and steps up 
                   onto the control platform and desperately begins trying 
                   to shut down the launcher...

                   The following happens very quickly:

                   -- Kirk fights with Soran, hand-to-hand, brutal.

                   -- Picard works the control panel, trying to make sense 
                      of it all. It won't respond. The control panel is 
                      bizarre and confusing -- many different screens and 
                      alien graphics. The alien countdown graphics continues 
                      to race by.

 169A THE SKY (VFX-I) 169A 
                   the distant energy ribbon can be seen getting closer...

 169B THE MOUNTAINTOP 169B 
                   Soran tries to pull his disruptor, but Kirk knocks it 
                   to the ground. There's a struggle for the weapon...

                   -- Picard looks helplessly at the control panel. 
                      Nothing he does has any effect. He keeps hitting 
                      buttons...looking for other control panels, anything 
                      to affect the launcher.

 169C ANGLE (VFX-P) 169C 
                   Suddenly, Picard touches one particular control and the 
                   screen CHANGES to an image of the Veridian SUN, held in 
                   the center of the alien CROSS-HAIR.

 169D PICARD (VFX-P) 169D 
                   begins working the control panel... desperate... he 
                   looks at the screen... hits a control. Suddenly the 
                   probe CLOAKS. Picard reacts at his mistake. Picard is 
                   left standing on an invisible platform three feet in 
                   the air -- a bizarre sight. Picard isn't sure what to 
                   do -- he can feel the console, but he can't see any of 
                   the controls.

                   -- Kirk punches Soran and sends him flying backward. 
                      Soran lands heavily on the ground, unconscious. Kirk 
                      stands over him, breathing heavily. He holds his back 
                      in pain -- that old back pain from the beginning of the
                      movie.

 PICARD                                      (desperate)
                             Kirk -- there's a control PADD in 
                             his right pocket!

 169E KIRK (VFX-P) 169E                    sees Picard standing in mid-air and then reaches down, 
                   pulls the control PADD out of Soran's pocket. He 
                   begins working it...

 170 CLOSE ON SORAN 170                    His eyes open... he sees what Kirk is doing... looks 
                   around quickly... sees the disruptor lying a few feet 
                   away, just beyond his reach...

 171 THE PROBE LAUNCHER (VFX-P) 171 
                   Decloaks. Picard goes back to working on the controls.

 171A KIRK (VFX-P) 171A 
                   he smiles.

 KIRK                              The twenty-fourth century isn't so 
                             tough.

                   Without warning, Kirk is BLASTED forward, shot from 
                   behind. Reveal Soran on the ground with the disruptor 
                   in his hand. He gets up, whirls around, points the 
                   weapon at Picard.

 172 MOUNTAINTOP - WIDE 172 
                   The probe is suddenly LAUNCHED in a roar of flame. 
                   Soran freezes. His eyes follow the probe as it arcs 
                   into the sky. The two men watch the probe as it heads 
                   toward the sun...

 172A THE PROBE (VFX-I) 172A 
                   makes a sweeping turn to the right and arcs back down 
                   toward the planet. Soran watches in horror as the 
                   probe crashes harmlessly into the distant jungle. We 
                   hear a muffled explosion.

 172B SORAN (VFX-I) 172B 
                   can't believe his dreams have been shattered. He looks 
                   into the sky and sees the distant ribbon streaking 
                   overhead. The disruptor falls from his hand as he 
                   rushes to the top of the scaffolding.
 173 PICARD 173 
                   moves to Kirk, checks his pulse. The Captain's eyes 
                   flutter -- he's still holding on, but he's badly 
                   wounded.

 174 SORAN (VFX-I) 174 
                   is standing on the rock ledge. He reaches up toward 
                   the sky as if trying to grab the Ribbon with his bare
                   hands...but the ribbon passes by and disappears.

 SORAN                              No...

                   His look of shock turns to fury and madness. He turns 
                   to Picard.

 SORAN YOU!! 
 174B NEW ANGLE (VFX-P) 174B 
                   He jumps down a few levels and then DIVES off the 
                   scaffolding at Picard. But Picard is quicker. He 
                   GRABS the disruptor and FIRES -- the BLAST CATCHES
 SORAN IN MID-AIR . 
                   Soran drops to the ground a short distance away. Dead. 
                   The pocket watch has been shattered.

 175 PICARD 175 
                   turns back to Kirk, cradles the dying man's head in his 
                   lap. Kirk's eyes flick open, and he takes a ragged 
                   breath.

 KIRK                              Nice shot.

                   Kirk coughs. His eyes flutter. He's fading fast.

 PICARD                              I'll find a way to contact the 
                             Enterprise. You're going to be 
                             all right.

 KIRK                              Did we do it? Did we make a 
                             Difference...?

 PICARD                              Yes. 
                                     (beat) 
                             Thank you.

 KIRK                              Least I could do...for a Captain 
                             of the Enterprise.

                   Kirk coughs again

 PICARD                              Try to hang on.
                    Kirk looks up at the sky. the sunlight is warm on his 
                   face. A quiet moment... then, with a last smile on his 
                   face

 KIRK                              It was fun.

                   Kirk dies.

                   Hold te scene for a long moment, the two men in the 
                   quiet clearing.

                   as he places a stone on a large pile of other stones. 
                   MOVE TO REVEAL that Picard is placing the final few 
                   rocks on Kirk's grave.

                   He reaches into a pocket and pulls out Kirk's command
                   insignia pin. He carefully places it on the grave...
                   and stands there silently for a few moments.

                   A distant WHINE of engines can be heard. Picard looks 
                   up into the sky...

 177 PICARD'S POV (VFX-I) 177 
                   An Enterprise SHUTTLECRAFT is flying through the sky 
                   toward the mountaintop.

 178 EXT. MOUNTAINTOP - SUNSET 178 
                   The shuttle has just landed, and the door OPENS as 
                   Picard enters the clearing. Worf, Geordi and N.D. 
                   security guards jump out to meet him.

 WORF                              Captain, are you all right?

 PICARD                              Yes.

 LA FORGE                              What about Doctor Soran?

 PICARD                              You needn't worry about the Doctor 
                             anymore.

                   Picard moves toward the shuttle... then stops as he 
                   notices that the shuttle is damaged. Picard turns and 
                   notices for the first time that La Forge has a bandage on 
                   his face and Worf's uniform is torn.

 PICARD                              Was there a problem with the 
                             Klingons?

                   Worf and La Forge exchange a look.

 GEORDI                              You could say that...

                   something on the tricorder.

 TROI                              Over here, Data! I think I've

 DATA                              I am very happy to find you, Spot.

 TROI                              Data... are you all right?

 DATA                              I am not sure, Counselor. I am

 RIKER                              Is this it?

                   Riker holds up the family photo album seen earlier.

                             Yes, Number One. Thank you.

                   He takes the album... brushes off the dust and flips 
                   through the pages for a moment. Riker looks around the  
                   wrecked room.

 RIKER                              I'm going to miss this ship. She 
                             went before her time.

                   Picard has been rejuvenated by his experience... given 
                   a new perspective on the issues of life and death.

 PICARD                              It's not how many years you've 
                             lived, Wil... but how you've lived 
                             them.
                                     (beat) 
                             Someone once told me that time is 
                             a predator that stalks us all our 
                             lives. But maybe time is also a 
                             companion who goes with us on 
                             our journey, and reminds us to 
                             cherish the moments of our 
                             lives... because they will never 
                             come again. 
                                     (beat) 
                             We are after all. only mortal.

                   A quiet moment... Riker finally smiles.

 RIKER                              Speak for yourself, sir. I kinda 
                             planned on living forever.

                   Picard smiles back at him and the two men EXIT to...

 184 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - DAY (VFX-P) 184 
                   Riker and Picard ENTER from the Ready Room. They look 
                   around the wrecked Bridge for a moment. Riker glances 
                   at the captain's chair.

 RIKER                              I always thought I'd have a crack 
                             at this chair one day.

 PICARD                              You may still... somehow I doubt 
                             this will be the last ship to 
                             carry the name Enterprise.

                   A beat, then Picard hits his combadge.

 PICARD                                      (continuing, to com)
                             Picard to Farragut. Two to beam 
                             up.

                   The two men dematerialize.

 FADE TO BLACK.

FADE IN:

INT.  MEDICAL MONTAGE - DAY

Life.  Glorious in its many forms.  The biological pulse
finding its way heroically through the cold manipulation of
science.

CREDITS as we see a beautiful montage of futuristic medical
technology.  Through a microscope we see cells multiplying
and gene strands exponentially increasing with the vibrancy
of exploding flowers.  We see laser splicing and biological
manipulation on the molecular level.

CREDITS continue as we fade to...

INT.  ROMULAN SENATE CHAMBER - NIGHT

Politics... In a cavernous, shadowy chamber.  Dark figures
lean together and talk seriously.  Their hushed, urgent tones
denote the gravity of their discussion.

We can't make out the words but there is no doubt what they
are talking about.

The three year old HUMAN BOY who stands before them.  The boy
is alone and frightened, lost in the sweeping grandeur of
the massive chamber.

CREDITS continue as we fade to...

EXT.  REMAN HOMEWORLD - NIGHT

Labor...

On a stark, desert planet with monolithic mountains and harsh
crags shooting upward.  The only light in this dark
netherworld comes from the flames that accompany the hellish
mining operations everywhere around us.

The human boy gazes over this desolate vista and then he
looks up for a moment... at the stars.

Then a tall figure leads him firmly into one of the mines.
The boy seems to disappear into this flaming crucible.
CREDITS end as we go to...

EXT.  ROMULUS - SUNSET

The sun is setting on the capital city of the great Romulan
Star Empire, The imperial monoliths and martial towers of
this bustling city glow red as the sun dips below the
horizon.

We slowly move down toward the most imposing building of the
city.  The Romulan Senate chamber.

INT.  ROMULAN SENATE CHAMBER - SUNSET

SENATOR TAL'AURA watches the proceedings with a studied look
of bored indifference.  She glances to the familiar Romulan
crest that dominates one wall of the chamber: a ferocious
bird-of-prey holding two planets, one in either claw.

And then her eyes carefully cross the chamber to...

PRAETOR HIREN -- the head of the Romulan government --
presiding over the Senate from a throne-like chair.  He is a
capable politician in his 50s.

                     SENATOR 1
          ... but if we hesitate we'll lose
          this important source of dilithium.
          A trade agreement is in the best
          interests of the Empire.

                     SENATOR 2
          Praetor, I recommend we dispatch a
          diplomatic mission to Celes II to
          open negotiations.

Senator Tal'Aura grunts slightly at the word "negotiations."
Praetor Hiren glances to her.

                     PRAETOR
          Senator Tal'Aura, you disagree with
          the motion.

                     TAL'AURA
          No, sir.  I would say "negotiation"
          is to be advised.  I support all
          "diplomatic" overtures.  But if you
          will excuse me, Praetor, I have an
          appointment with the Tholian
          ambassador.

The Praetor nods.  Tal'Aura stands and leaves the chamber...
but she had left something behind on her desk.  A small,
silver box with unusual etchings on the surface.

The discussion continues as we focus on the silver box...

                     PRAETOR
          Then I will call for a vote on the
          motion to open trade negotiations
          with Celes II...

The Senator at the desk next to Tal'Aura's glances over.  The
silver box is moving.

The Senator watches, amazed, as the box begins to slowly fold
open.  Then "legs" appear.  The box unfolds like a spider,
standing on its legs.  Then it is still for a moment.  The
Senator looks at it, puzzled.

Suddenly -- a bright beam of green light shoots up from the
spider -- the Senators are stunned -- the beam shoots to the
high domed ceiling of the chamber and then cascades around
the interior of the room, enveloping everything in a glowing
shroud of green energy.  In a way, it is bizarrely beautiful.

And then just as suddenly the light disappears.

A moment of silence.  The Praetor and Senators are baffled.

                     PRAETOR
          Would someone please tell me what
          that was?
               (he turns to a guard)
          Alert security --

A plant behind the Praetor begins to shrivel...

                     PRAETOR
          -- and have them run a --

The Praetor stops suddenly -- as the flesh begins to melt
from his face.

Every bit of organic matter in the chamber decays.  Flesh
melts from bones while the Senators scream in agony.  Every
living thing in the chamber is dead within ten seconds.

A stunning moment of silence as we take in the carnage.  Then
a transporter effect ripples around the spider-weapon.  It
disappears.

And the Romulan Senate is no more.  We fade to...

EXT.  EARTH, ALASKA - PAVILION - DAY

JEAN LUC PICARD, the most beloved and respected Captain in
Starfleet.

His face is resolute and set.  Even stern.  His white dress
uniform is buttoned tightly to the neck.

He looks at us evenly and then utters the word that has been
the watch cry for his entire life as a Starfleet officer.

                     PICARD
          Duty...

He lets the word resonate and then continues.

                     PICARD
          A starship captain's life is filled
          with solemn duty.  I have commanded
          men in battle.  I have negotiated
          peace treaties between implacable
          enemies.  I have represented the
          Federation in first contact with
          twenty-seven alien species.  But
          none of this compares to my solemn
          duty as... Best man.

Uproarious laughter.  We pull back to reveal the wedding
reception of WILL RIKER and DEANNA TROI.

The Enterprise CREW is gathered with invited GUESTS, some
from other "Star Trek" series.  Riker and Deanna sit at the
center of a long table.

                     PICARD
          Now, I know that on an occasion
          such as this: it is expected that I
          be gracious and fulsome with praise
          on the wonders of this blessed
          union... But have you two
          considered what you're doing to?
          This is all a damned
          inconvenience...
               (laughter from the crowd)
          While you're happily settling in on
          the Titan, I'll have to train a new
          first officer; no doubt a stern
          martinet who'll quote the rule book
          at me and never... ever... allow me
          to go on away missions.
               (laughter)
          ... Then there's the matter of my
          new counselor.  Undoubtedly some
          soft-spoken, willowy thing who'll
          be probing into my darkest psyche
          as she nods her head and coos
          sympathetically.  Isn't that right,
          Deanna?

Deanna nods her head and coos sympathetically.  Hearty,
wonderful LAUGHTER!

                     PICARD
          I notice Dr. Crusher laughing along
          with the rest of you.  As most of
          you know, the doctor will also soon
          be leaving the Enterprise, to
          assume command of Starfleet
          Medical.  Again, I'm forced to ask,
          Beverly, have you considered what
          you're doing to little ole' me?!
          I'll probably get some old battle-
          axe of a doctor who'll tell me to
          eat my vegetables and put me on
          report if I don't show up for my
          physical on time!

                     BEVERLY
          It'll serve you right.

Laughter, laughter, laughter!  He looks to Riker and Deanna:

                     PICARD
          Really, it's not too late to
          reconsider.  No?  Very well then...

He smiles and raises his glass, looks at them deeply.

                     PICARD
          Will Riker, you have been my
          trusted right arm for fourteen
          years; you have helped keep my
          course true and steady.  Deanna
          Troi, you have been my conscience
          and best guide, the touchstone to
          the better parts of myself.  You
          are my family.  And in proper
          maritime tradition I wish you full
          sails and a clear horizon... My
          friends, make it so.

They drink.

EXT.  EARTH, ALASKA - PAVILION - LATER

The party guests mingle as a band plays.  We are at a
beautiful open-air pavilion high in the Denali Mountains.
The soaring ranges of Riker's native Alaska can be seen
everywhere around us.

DR. BEVERLY CRUSHER goes to Picard.

                     BEVERLY
               (playfully)
          Sort of like losing a son and
          gaining an empath, isn't it?

                     PICARD
          Please, Beverly, this is hard
          enough.

                     BEVERLY
          If you start tearing up I promise
          to beam you out.  Level one medical
          emergency.  There's no crying in
          Starfleet.

They head off toward Riker and Deanna.

Meanwhile, GEORDI LA FORGE sits with his girlfriend.

                     LEAH
          I've never seen your Captain so
          nostalgic.  Maybe he's getting soft
          in his old age.

                     GEORDI
               (laughs)
          Not likely.  After we installed the
          new Series Four replicators, he
          tried to order his usual tea and
          there was a glitch.  Had us remove
          the whole bunch of them and put the
          old ones back in.

                     LEAH
          There!  Nostalgic about old
          replicators.

                     GEORDI
          He just likes things the way he
          likes them...
               (he looks at her, smiles)
          Of course, so do I.

He kisses her gently as WORF comes to them.  Poor Worf is
still suffering a bit from the bachelor party.  He plops down
beside them, belches.

                     WORF
          Romulan ale should be illegal.

                     GEORDI
          It is, old chum.

                     WORF
          Then it should be more illegal.

He groans and rests his head on the table, acts like he's
going to heave.  Meanwhile, Riker and Deanna are talking to
Picard and Beverly.

                     DEANNA
          Really, Captain, it was a lovely
          toast.

                     PICARD
          The least I could do for you,
          Deanna.  Besides, you know me...
          I'm a talking head.

                     DEANNA
          And you needn't worry.  I'll brief
          your new counselor on everything
          she needs to know.

                     PICARD
          The hell you will.  You know too
          much about me as it is... Now you
          promised there are no speeches
          during the ceremony on Betazed.

                     RIKER
          No, no speeches.  No clothes
          either.
               (winks, mischievously)

Picard looks at him.  Deanna laughs.

Then the band stops playing.  All turn.

DATA stands with the band.

                     DATA
          Ladies and Gentlemen and invited
          Tran gendered species... In my
          study of Terran and Betazoid
          conjugal rites I have discovered it
          is traditional to present the
          "happy couple" with a gift.  Given
          Commander Riker's affection for
          archaic musical forms I have
          elected to present the following as
          my gift in honor of their
          conjugation.

Riker shoots an amused glance to Deanna.  Conjugation?

Data turns to the band leader.

                     DATA
          If you please, Mister Band Leader,
          a-one and a-two and...

The band launches into a jaunty, swing version of the Irving
Berlin standard "Blue Skies."

                     DATA
               (sings)
          "Blue skies, smiling at me, Nothing
          but blue skies do I see.  Blue
          birds, singing a song, Nothing but
          blue birds all day long.  Never saw
          the sun shining so bright, Never
          saw things going so right..."

The crowd is appreciative.  Loves the song.  Except Worf, he
momentarily raises his head from the table.

                     WORF
               (groans)
          Ugghhh... Irving Berlin.

His heads thumps down again, is about ready to BARF!
Meanwhile, Riker is anxious as a kid to join the band:

                     DEANNA
               (smiles)
          All right, go ahead.

Riker eagerly joins the band.  Grabs the trombone and starts
jamming with the orchestra.  The song really swings.

                     PICARD
               (to Deanna)
          May I have this dance?

                     DEANNA
          With pleasure, Captain.

Meanwhile, Geordi leads Leah to the dance floor as well.
Beverly goes to Worf.

                     BEVERLY
          Commander Worf... Do Klingons
          swing?

                     WORF
          I am not a swinger.  I am unwell.

                     BEVERLY
          Don't worry, I'm a doctor.

She pulls him to the dance floor as:

                     BEVERLY
          I'm so glad you made it back to the
          Enterprise before I left.

                     WORF
          I was not suited for the life of
          a... diplomat.

                     BEVERLY
               (wry)
          Who'd have guessed?

They dance.  Picard and Deanna sweep past them.

And we pull up and away as Data continues to sing and the
crew dances.  It is a joyous celebration of these people.

This family.  A family we love.

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - SPACE

The Enterprise streaks through space.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - CREW LOUNGE - NIGHT

Data sits in the empty Crew Lounge.

As always, the android's placid, neutral expression still
somehow manages to convey his wonder, curiosity and
idiosyncratic zest for life.

Picard arrives with a very old bottle of wine.

                     PICARD
          I've been saving this.  Chateau
          Picard 2267.  Batten down the
          hatches...

He carefully uncorks the treasured bottle as:

                     PICARD
          They say a vintner's history is in
          every glass.  The soil he came
          from.  His past as well as his
          hopes for the future.

He pours two glasses of the wine, then raises his glass, a
toast.

                     PICARD
          So... To happy endings.

                     DATA
          To happy endings.

Picard carefully takes a tiny sip, savors the flavor, finally
swallows.  Enjoys it.  Ahhh.

Data mimics Picard.  Taking a tiny sip, savoring the flavor
and finally swallowing.  Ahhh.

                     DATA
          Sir.  I noticed an interesting
          confluence of emotion at the
          wedding.  I am familiar with the
          human concept of tears through
          laughter and its inverse, laughter
          through tears, but I could not help
          wondering about the human capacity
          for expressing both pleasure and
          sadness simultaneously.

                     PICARD
          I understand why it would seem
          confusing.  Certain human rituals --
          like weddings, birthdays or
          funerals evoke strong and very
          complex emotions.  These rites
          carry great weight with us because
          they denote the passage of time.

                     DATA
          And you were particularly aware of
          this feeling because Commander
          Riker will be leaving to assume
          command of the Titan?

                     PICARD
          Will and Deanna joining the Titan.
          Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet
          Medical...

                     DATA
          And this makes you "sad"?

                     PICARD
          Well.  I suppose it does a bit.
          I'm very happy for them, of course,
          but I'm going to miss them.  The
          ship will seem... incomplete
          without them.

                     DATA
          That is because you have a
          familiarity with them.  You can
          predict specific reactions and
          behavior and are comfortable in
          that knowledge.

                     PICARD
          Yes.  And, frankly, I envy them as
          well.  They've made important
          choices; they're going to have
          great challenges ahead of them.
          New worlds to conquer...

He takes another sip of wine.  A beat.

                     PICARD
          Seeing Will and Deanna today made
          me think about some of the choices
          I've made in my own life.  Devoting
          myself to Starfleet... Not marrying
          or having children... All the
          choices that led me here.

A beat.  Data thinks about it.

                     DATA
          The choices I made have led me here
          as well.  This is the only home I
          have ever known.  I cannot foresee
          a reason for leaving.

                     PICARD
          You never know what's over the
          horizon, Data.  Before too long
          you'll be offered a command of your
          own.  Data looks at him; he has
          never really considered this.

                     DATA
          If I were... I believe my memory
          engrams would sense the absence of
          your specific reactions and
          behavior.  I would "miss you."

                     PICARD
               (smiles)
          Now, you make a toast.

                     DATA
          To new worlds...

                     PICARD
          New worlds.  Yes Data, brave new
          worlds...

They drink.

INT.  ROMULAN SENATE - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Flickering braziers dimly illuminate the cold, martial
splendor of a Senate corridor.

COMMANDER DONATRA and COMMANDER SURAN stride through the
corridor.

Suran is an elder Romulan officer, respected and tenacious.
Donatra -- a key figure in this story so pay close attention
to her -- is a mature, beautiful woman... not without a dry
sense of humor.

                     SURAN
          The fleet commanders are nervous.
          They've agreed to remain at their
          given coordinates and await his
          orders.  But they're anxious to
          know what's going on here.

                     DONATRA
          I don't blame them.  We can't keep
          them in the dark forever.

A voice, from the shadows:

                     VICEROY (V.O.)
          But in darkness, there is strength.

Donatra and Suran stop.

And the VICEROY steps from the shadows...

He is a terrifying sight  A powerful, monstrous alien
creature; a tall, ashen-skinned ectomorph who bears a
disturbing resemblance to the original Nosferatu.  He is
vampiric and lethal.  He is a Reman.

                     VICEROY
          Don't you agree?

He leads them along the corridor.

INT.  SENATE CHAMBER - NIGHT

We observe the Romulan crest, an imposing bird-of-prey
clutching a planet in either claw, not unlike the KAOS emblem
from "Get Smart," that dominates a wall.  As we hear:

                     SHINZON (V.O.)
          Consider it  The great symbol of
          the Empire... But the bird-of-prey
          holds planets.  Romulus, Remus.
          Their destinies conjoined...

And then we see him... SHINZON!

He is a dynamic young human in his twenties.  Very handsome
with pale, almost white skin and shining, golden hair.  He
wears a striking Reman military uniform.

He stands in the center of the eerily deserted chamber.  The
entire floor is a large star chart.

                     SHINZON
          Yet for generations one of those
          planets has been without a voice.
          We will be silent no longer.

Senator Tal'Aura (the female Senator who planted the weapon
in the Senate chamber earlier) and two other ROMULAN
COMMANDERS sit.

Cadres of Shinzon's fearsome REMAN WARRIORS stand around the
chamber.  They are his sinister children of the night.  Even
more chilling now in the flickering torch light.  It's like
something out of Tim Burton.

Donatra and Suran enter the chamber with Shinzon's Viceroy.

                     SHINZON
          Join us, Commanders.  Now what's
          the disposition of the fleet?

                     SURAN
          They're holding position.

                     SHINZON
          And?

                     SURAN
               (bows his head)
          They will obey, Praetor.

                     SHINZON
          It's imperative we retain their
          allegiance or our great mission
          will be strangled before it can
          truly draw breath.

                     DONATRA
          They support your intentions, sir.
          But they require evidence of
          your... sincerity.

Shinzon looks at her.  A quick beat.  Shinzon decides to
respond with benevolence.  He smiles.

                     SHINZON
          And they'll have it.
               (he begins to pace over
                the star chart)
          Tell the fleet that the days of
          negotiation and diplomacy are over.
          The Almighty Federation will fall
          before us.  As I promised you.

He stands on the area of the map that denotes the Neutral
Zone between the Romulan Empire and the Federation.

                     SHINZON
          The time we have dreamed of is at
          hand.  The time... of conquest.
               (sinister laugh)

He carefully steps into the area of the map marked with the
Federation symbol.  He looks down at the star chart.

                     SHINZON
          Cut off the dragon's head and it
          cannot strike back.

A beat.  Donatra watches him carefully.  Something in his
quiet words disturbs her.

                     SURAN
          How many Warbirds will you need?

                     SHINZON
          None.

They look at him, stunned.

                     SURAN
          Praetor.  You have the whole fleet
          at your disposal.  They supported
          the coup, they'll follow you.

                     SHINZON
          The Scimitar will serve my needs.

                     SURAN
          But surely --

                     SHINZON
          I came this far alone...
               (he looks at his Reman
                warriors)
          We came this far alone.  We require
          no assistance from the fleet.  Now
          leave me to my thoughts.

The Commanders and Senator Tal'Aura rise and leave.  Shinzon
looks to his Viceroy.

                     SHINZON
          Are we prepared?

                     VICEROY
          Yes, Praetor.

A beat.

                     SHINZON
          So many years for this moment.
               (he looks up at his
                Viceroy, smiles)
          Bring him to me.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - DAY

The bridge crew are at their stations.  Picard is not on the
bridge.

                     WORF
               (grumbles)
          I won't do it.

                     DEANNA
          It's tradition,Worf.  You of all
          people should appreciate that!
               (whispers)
          Besides, I've already seen it.

                     WORF
          A warrior does not appear without
          his clothing.  It leaves him...
          vulnerable.

                     RIKER
          I don't think we're going to see
          much combat on Betazed.

                     DEANNA
          Don't be too sure.  Mother will be
          there.

Worf groans.  Picard emerges from his Ready Room as:

                     WORF
          I won't do it.

                     PICARD
          Won't do what, Mister Worf?

                     WORF
          Captain.  I think it is
          inappropriate for a Starfleet
          officer to appear...
               (hates the word)
          ... naked.

                     PICARD
          Come now, a big, strapping fellow
          like you?  What are you afraid of?

Deanna laughs.  Then a readout on Worf's console attracts his
attention:

                     WORF
          I'm picking up an unusual
          electromagnetic signature from the
          Kolarin system.

                     PICARD
          What sort of signature?

Worf looks up.  Glances at Data.

                     WORF
          Positronic.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - LATER

Geordi is at the Engineering station with Picard, Riker and
Data.

                     GEORDI
          It's very faint but I've isolated
          it to the third planet in the
          Kolarin system.

                     PICARD
          What do we know about the planet?

                     GEORDI
          Uncharted.  We'll have to get
          closer for a more detailed scan.

                     PICARD
               (to Data)
          Theories?

                     DATA
          Since positronic signatures have
          only been known to emanate from
          androids such as myself, it is
          logical to theorize that there is
          an android such as myself on
          Kolarus III.

                     GEORDI
          How many of you did Dr. Soong make?

                     DATA
          I thought only me, myself and Lore.

                     RIKER
               (looking at star chart)
          Diverting to the Kolarin system
          takes us awfully close to the
          Romulan Neutral Zone.

                     PICARD
               (looking at star chart)
          Still well on our side...

Picard glances at Data, recognizes the android's deep desire
to explore this possible connection to others like himself.

                     PICARD
          I think it's worth a look.  Don't
          worry, Number One, we'll get you to
          Betazed with time to spare.

                     RIKER
          Thank you, sir...

                     PICARD
               (to all, especially Worf)
          Where we will all honor the
          Betazoid traditions.  No cold feet,
          or any other parts of our anatomy.
          Now, if you'll excuse me.  I'll be
          in the gym.

He goes.

                     RIKER
               (to Helm Officer)
          Mister Branson, set course for the
          Kolarin system.  Warp Five --
               (Deanna shoots him a
                glance)
          -- Warp Seven.

                     HELM OFFICER (MISTER BRANSON)
          Plotted and laid in, sir.

                     RIKER
          Engage.

                     DEANNA
          You better believe you're engaged!

Meanwhile, Geordi and Data remain at the Engineering Station,
studying the displays.

                     GEORDI
          What do you think, Data, a long-
          lost relative?

Data doesn't respond, but the curiosity on his face is
apparent.

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - OVER KOLARUS III - SPACE

The Enterprise is in orbit around the uncharted planet.  In
the distance we can see the distorting violence of an ion
storm.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE

Kolarus III is on the viewscreen, the ion storm raging beyond
it.

                     GEORDI
          I read six distinct positronic
          signatures, spread out over a few
          kilometers on the surface.

                     PICARD
          What do we know about the
          population?

                     DATA
          Isolated pockets of humanoids.  It
          appears to be a pre-warp
          civilization at an early stage of
          industrial development.

                     GEORDI
          Captain, I don't recommend
          transporting, that ion storm
          doesn't look very neighborly.  It
          could head this way without much
          warning.

                     PICARD
          Understood.  Data, Worf, you're
          with me.

Picard, Data and Worf start heading toward the turbolift.

                     RIKER
               (stands, protesting)
          Captain, I hope I don't have to
          remind you --

                     PICARD
          I appreciate your concern, Number
          One, but I've been itching to try
          out the Argo.

                     RIKER
          Sir --

                     PICARD
          Captain's prerogative, Will.
          There's no foreseeable danger...
          and your wife would never forgive
          me if anything happened to you.

He steps into the turbolift with the Data and Worf.

                     PICARD
          You have the bridge, Mister Troi!

The turbolift doors slide shut.

The bridge crew heartily enjoys Riker's momentary demotion to
house husband.

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - OVER KOLARUS III - DAY

The shuttlebay doors slide open and the transport vehicle
Argo emerges.

The Argo is larger than a regular shuttle with a particularly
large cargo area at the back.

EXT.  KOLARUS III - DAY

The Argo lands on the planet.  It is primarily a desert
environment with some canyons and mountains.  Like Death
Valley, blazing heat waves shimmer in the distance.  The
shuttle sits silently for a moment.  We wonder at the delay,
then...

The rear cargo doors slide open and Picard, Data and Worf
roar out on a 24th Century equivalent of a military jeep!

Picard drives, Data beside him.  Worf stands in the back at a
mounted phaser canon.  It is a muscular, exciting vehicle; a
Starfleet version of the jeep from old television series "The
Rat Patrol."

Picard screeches to a stop.  Data and Worf lurch.  A cloud of
dust momentarily obscures them.  Data quickly monitors the
positronic signatures with a tricorder:

                     DATA
          The closest signature is two
          kilometers to the west... that
          direction, sir.

                     PICARD
          Thank you, Data.
               (he smiles)
          Let's see what she can do.

He roars off in a cloud of dust!

Picard clearly enjoys driving.  He roars over the desert
terrain at breakneck speed, having a hell of a good time.
His comrades don't exactly appreciate his free-spirited
driving panache.

Worf clings on to the mounted phaser canon for dear life.
Data steadies himself by grasping onto the rollbar

                     DATA
          I will always be baffled by the
          human predilection for piloting
          vehicles at unsafe velocities.

Picard smiles and drives a little faster.

                     DATA
               (monitoring with
                tricorder)
          Over that rise, sir... half a
          kilometer.

They continue on.  Before long they can see something on the
level desert floor before them.  They approach and stop to
discover...

An android arm.  The fingers patiently drumming the ground.

                     DATA
          It appears to be...
               (he scans with his
                tricorder)
          ... an arm.

                     WORF
               (suspicious)
          Why is it moving?

                     DATA
          Like me, it has been designed with
          modular power sources.

                     PICARD
          Mister Worf, if you please.

Worf climbs from the jeep and carefully approaches the arm.
Gingerly picks it up.  The arm responds to being picked up,
the hand starts feeling around in the air like something from
a horror movie.  Worf shudders.

He returns to the jeep.  Quickly sets the arm down in the
rear cargo area.

                     DATA
          The next signature is one kilometer
          to the south.

Picard starts the jeep in motion.

Time passes as they continue on... coming across another
arm... a leg... a torso... another leg... various
disassembled components of a Data-like android!

EXT.  JEEP - KOLARUS III - CANYON - DAY

Worf stands uneasily amidst the moving body parts.  There is
only one component missing: the head.  Picard steers the jeep
into a canyon.  Stops.  Data scans with his tricorder,
pointing it up into the gently sloping hills that form the
sides of the canyon.

                     DATA
          The final signature is
          approximately 300 meters up that
          incline.

                     PICARD
          Mister Worf, accompany Data please.

                     WORF
               (uneasy)
          To find the head, sir?

                     PICARD
               (amused)
          If you don't mind.

Worf and Data climb up into the hills in pursuit of the final
piece as Picard opens the jeep's hood and checks the engine.

EXT.  KOLARUS III - HILLS - DAY

Worf and Data climb as Data scans and indicates the
direction:

                     DATA
          Ten meters...

Worf pulls his phaser, ready.

                     DATA
          I think it unlikely you will need
          your phaser to recover the cranial
          unit.  Of course, it could bite
          you.

Then they see it.

Data's head.  Or the spitting image anyway.  Lying inert in
the dust before them.

                     WORF
          It's you.

                     DATA
          The resemblance is... striking.

Then the head's eyes suddenly pop open.  It looks up at them
with a sort of blank, childlike wonder.

                     HEAD
          Why am I looking at me?

                     DATA
          You are not looking at yourself.
          You are looking at me.

                     HEAD
               (looking at Worf)
          You do not look like me.

                     WORF
          No.

                     DATA
               (to head)
          I would like to pick you up now.
          May I do that?

                     HEAD
               (to Worf)
          You have a pretty shirt.

                     WORF
          Thank you.

Data gently picks up the head.  Looks at it.  The two
identical faces gaze at each other.

                     DATA
          Fascinating...

Then BLAM! -- a boulder near them explodes.  Worf and Data
spin to see...

A nomadic tribe of desert ALIENS swarming toward them firing
primitive plasma weapons --

Data and Worf race back down the canyon, toward the jeep --
some open-field running and a bit of phaser action -- Worf
firing to distract and slow the aliens, not kill them --
through all of this the head is chattering away blandly:

                     HEAD
          I have two arms and ten fingers.
          Do you know where my arms are?  I
          cannot see where we are going.
          Where are we going?
               (Etc... like Threepio in
                "Empire" when he's
                strapped to Chewbacca's
                back.)

The action continues.  Then Data finds himself almost
surrounded --

                     DATA
          Commander!

Worf turns -- Data throws the head to Worf like a football, a
perfect spiral -- the head is still chattering away -- Worf
catches it --

                     WORF
          STOP TALKING!

The head abruptly stops talking.

Data, hands free now, quickly incapacitates the aliens around
him with a dazzling demonstration of his superior strength
and agility.

Meanwhile, Worf tucks the head under his arm and sprints like
a master running back -- evading aliens and occasionally
firing his phaser --

They are closer to the jeep now -- but they are in trouble --
the swarm of aliens almost overtaking them -- !

When a thundering BLAST sends up a shower of debris, stopping
the aliens -- Picard is standing in the rear of the jeep,
firing the phaser canon.

Data and Worf climb into the jeep as Picard leaps into the
front seat and roars off --

INT./ EXT.  JEEP - KOLARUS III - FOLLOWING

Worf, standing at the phaser canon, quickly hands the head to
Data in the front seat:

                     WORF
          If you wouldn't mind.

                     DATA
          Thank you.

The head looks up at Picard.

                     HEAD
          You have a shiny head.

Picard glances at the head.

                     DATA
          He is very observant.

                     PICARD
          I can see that.

                      WORF
          Captain!

Picard turns to see that they are being pursued!  The aliens
are racing after them in crude desert-terrain vehicles --

                     PICARD
               (to Data)
          Shall we try some "unsafe
          velocities?"

He floors it -- racing across the desert landscape.

Worf fires the mounted phaser canon -- blasting away at the
aliens, not killing them, just stopping them -- a few
dramatic crashes as the alien vehicles overturn --

Meanwhile:

                     HEAD
               (to Picard)
          You have a red shirt.

                     DATA
               (to head)
          This is not an appropriate time for
          a conversation.

                     HEAD
          Why?

                     DATA
          Because the captain has to
          concentrate on piloting the
          vehicle.

                     HEAD
          Why?

                     PICARD
          Data!

                     DATA
          Sorry, sir.

They continue to speed over the landscape -- bouncing and
flying over natural rises in the terrain -- trying to evade
their pursuers --

Picard puts the pedal to the metal and races through the
alien vehicles -- weaving in and out, avoiding their fire --
Worf blasts away with the phaser cannon -- an exhilarating
adventure --

Finally they are within sight of the Argo -- but they see it
is surrounded by more of the aliens!

                     PICARD
          Mister Data.  Let's make like the
          wind.

Data punches some buttons on a dashboard console -- and the
Argo LIFTS OFF by remote control --

Data uses the console to swing the Argo around and lower the
rear cargo doors -- it hovers over the surface --

Picard floors the jeep -- using a natural rise in the terrain
as a ramp -- the jeep FLIES THROUGH THE AIR -- over the
aliens -- and into the cargo bay --

INT.  ARGO - CARGO BAY - FOLLOWING

Picard slams on the brakes -- the jeep screeches to a stop as
the doors shut and the Argo shoots into the air.

Picard climbs from the jeep.  He nonchalantly rubs a bit of
dirt from the hood and then disappears into the main cabin.

Data and Worf remain in the jeep for a beat, stunned.

                     WORF
               (smiles)
          He must have Klingon blood.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - ENGINEERING LAB - DAY

Beverly gazes at the android head.  It gazes back at her.

                     BEVERLY
          I think you have nicer eyes.

We pull back to reveal she is speaking to Data.  Data stands
with Picard, Riker and Geordi.

                     DATA
          Our eyes are identical, Doctor.

The android is in a framework rig that holds the various body
parts in place.  The parts are not yet assembled

                     RIKER
          Geordi?

                     GEORDI
               (at work analyzing the
                torso section)
          Well, he seems to have the same
          internal mechanics as Data but not
          as much positronic development.
          The neural pathways aren't nearly
          as sophisticated.  I'd say he's a
          prototype.  Something Dr. Soong
          created before Data.

                     DATA
               (to head)
          Do you have a name, sir?

                     HEAD
          I am the B-9.

                     PICARD
          Be-nign.  Dr. Soong's penchant for
          whimsical names seems to have no
          end.

                     HEAD
               (to Riker)
          You have a fuzzy face.

                     PICARD
               (trying to ignore the
                head)
          Keep me informed, Number One, and,
          please, put him back together.

He goes.  Geordi and Data begin to reassemble the B-9 piece
by piece like the Tin Man as:

                     DATA
          Can you tell me how you came to be
          on the planet where we found you?

                     B-9
               (blandly)
          I was taken from my homeworld by
          people called the "PakJeds." They
          are fat.  They traded me to a ship
          belonging to the "Bolians." The
          "Bolians" are blue.  They put me in
          a seat and asked me questions.
          Then they were attacked by another
          ship...

Time passes...

And still the B-9 is yammering blandly away.  He is more
fully assembled   By this time Beverly is thoroughly bored.

                     B-9
          Then people called the
          Delviciansans picked me up.  They
          have long teeth.  They asked if I
          do anything to help them.  I told
          them I could do whatever they
          wanted.  They asked me to clean out
          the matrix manifolds.  I told them
          I did not know what an Matrix
          manifold looks like.

                     BEVERLY
          Excuse me.  I have some diagnostics
          to run on some medical scanner
          things.

She quickly exits.

                     B-9
          And after they showed me the
          "engine manifolds." Then they
          showed me something called a
          "plasma mop"

Time passes...

And still the B-9 is yammering away.  He is almost completely
assembled by now.  Riker is bored out of his mind.

                     B-9
          ... then the "Cardassians" put me
          into something called a "garbage
          chute" and I went out into space
          again --

                     WORF (V.O.) (ON COMM)
          Worf to Commander Riker.  I have
          the tactical manifests ready, sir.

                     RIKER
               (quickly tapping his comm
                badge)
          Worf!  Wonderful!  I'll be right
          there!...
               (he stands)
          Duty calls, gentlemen.  Carry on.

He escapes.

                     B-9
          Fuzzy face is gone.

                     DATA
          Yes, please continue.

                     B-9
          I was in space for a long time.
          Then a ship belonging to the
          "Talosians" picked me up.  They
          asked me where I came from.  I told
          them people called the "Pakleds"
          took me from my homeworld.  They
          are fat...

Geordi groans.

Time passes...

And still the B-9 is yammering away.  By this time Geordi is
slumped in a chair and only Data is listening.  The B-9 is
fully assembled.

                     B-9
          Then I opened my eyes and saw you.

A beat.  The B-9 is finally done with his tale...

                     DATA
          Do you know who I am?

                     B-9
          You are me.

                     DATA
          No.  My name is Data... I am your
          brother.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - CREW LOUNGE - NIGHT

Riker and Deanna are having dinner with Worf.

                     DEANNA
               (to Worf)
          ... and after the ceremony on
          Betazed, three entire weeks for our
          honeymoon.

                     RIKER
          We're going sailing on the Opal
          Sea.  We've booked an old-fashioned
          solar catamaran.  Just us and the
          sun and the waves.

                     WORF
          It seems a very... soft honeymoon.

                     DEANNA
               (amused)
          It's meant to be relaxing.

                     WORF
          A Klingon honeymoon begins with the
          Kholamar desert march where the
          couple bonds in endurance trials.
          If they survive the challenge they
          move on to the Fire Caves of
          Fek'lhr to face the demons of
          Gre'thor.

                     RIKER
          Well, that sounds relaxing too.

                     WORF
          It is... invigorating.

They see Data enter the lounge, carefully leading the B-9.

                     RIKER
          So they've got him up and running.

                     WORF
          He's a very unusual android

                     RIKER
               (smiles)
          Runs in the family.

They watch as Data leads the B-9 to a table.  Data instructs
him to sit.  The B-9 sits and stares forward placidly.  Data
shows him how use a napkin.

A note of concern passes over Deanna's face as she watches
Data and the B-9.

There is something strangely poignant in the twin androids.
One a bundle of curiosity and intelligence; the other
somewhat like a slow, simple child.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - READY ROOM - NIGHT

Picard is at his replicator unit.

                     PICARD
          Earl Grey, hot.

A cup of tea appears.  He takes it as the door chime sounds.

                     PICARD
          Come.
               (Deanna enters)
          Counselor.

                     DEANNA
          Do you have a moment, sir?

                     PICARD
          Of course, sit down.

He sits at his desk  She sits across from him.

                     DEANNA
          It's about Data  I've watched him
          with the B-9 and I'm troubled.
          Data's desire for a "family" is
          very strong.  I'm afraid he may be
          investing too much in the B-9.

                     PICARD
          You're speaking of emotional
          investment?

                     DEANNA
          The B-9 is like a slow child, sir.
          And Data, in his own way, has
          assumed the position of a parent or
          guardian.  I'm afraid he has
          expectations based on his own
          experiences.  He'll be disappointed
          when the B-9 cannot meet those
          expectations.

                     PICARD
          As much as we care for him,
          Deanna... we have to remember that
          Data isn't capable of
          disappointment.

                     DEANNA
          I don't believe that, sir.  We've
          shared many disappointing journeys.

A quiet beat.

                     PICARD
          I'm going to miss you.

                     DEANNA
          And I you.

They are interrupted by a comm signal:

                     RIKER (V.O.) (ON COMM)
          Captain, you have an Alpha Priority
          communication from Starfleet
          Command.

                     PICARD
          Acknowledged...
               (Deanna stands)
          ... I'll talk to Data

                     DEANNA
          Thank you, sir.

She goes.  Picard activates his desktop viewscreen.

ADMIRAL KATHRYN JANEWAY appears on Picard's monitor.  Janeway
is the former captain of Voyager.  Her new rank fits her
well, she has lost none of her dry humor and down-to-earth
charm which made her a household name and beloved cult
figure.

                     PICARD
          Admiral Janeway.  Good to see you.

                     JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          Jean Luc... How'd you like a trip
          to Romulus?  All expenses paid?

                     PICARD
               (smiles)
          With or without the rest of the
          fleet?

                     JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          A diplomatic mission.  We've been
          invited, believe it or not.  Seems
          there's been some kind of internal
          political shakeup.  The new
          Praetor, someone called Shinzon,
          has requested a Federation envoy.

                     PICARD
          New Praetor?

                     JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          There's more... as always.  He's
          Reman.
               (Picard is surprised)
          Believe me, we don't understand it
          either.  You're the closest ship so
          I want you to high tail it over
          there and hear what he has to say.
          Get the lay of the land, If the
          Empire becomes unstable, it could
          mean trouble for the entire
          quadrant.

                     PICARD
          Understood.

                     JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEEN)
          We're sending you all the
          intelligence we have, but it's not
          much.  I don't need to tell you to
          watch your back, Jean Luc.

                     PICARD
          Not with the Romulans.

                     JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
               (smiles wryly)
          The Son'a, the Borg, the Romulans,
          the evil Soran and that pesky
          Nexus.  You seem to get all the
          easy assignments!

                     PICARD
          Just lucky, Admiral.

                     JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          Let's hope that luck holds.
          Janeway out.

The transmission ends.

Picard sits for a moment, intrigued.  Then he goes to the
bridge

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard goes to his command chair:

                     PICARD
               (to Helm)
          Lay in a new course... Take us to
          Romulus.  Warp eight.

The crew is shocked.

                     HELM OFFICER
          Aye aye, sir.  Course plotted and
          laid in...

                     RIKER
          Romulus?

                     PICARD
          I'm afraid the Opal Sea will have
          to wait, Number One... Engage.

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - SPACE

And the Enterprise jumps to high warp -- disappearing in a
flash of dazzling light.  Yes!

INT.  ENTERPRISE - OBSERVATION LOUNGE - DAY

Data conducts a briefing for the senior officers.  Monitors
currently show an image of Romulus and Remus in orbit around
their sun.

                     DATA
          As you can see the habitable half
          of Remus is always in darkness
          because, like Mercury, one side
          always faces the sun.  Due to the
          extreme temperatures on that half
          of their world, the Remans live on
          the dark side of the planet.

Various grainy and unclear new images appear to illustrate
Data's words:

                     DATA
          Almost nothing is known about the
          Reman homeworld, although
          intelligence scans have proven the
          existence of dilithium mining and
          heavy weapons construction.

Very obscure images of Remans appear, the crew can barely
make out the monstrous figures:

                     DATA
          The Remans themselves are
          considered an undesirable caste in
          the hierarchy of the Empire.

                     RIKER
          But they also have the reputation
          of being formidable warriors.  In
          the Dominion War, Reman forces were
          used as assault troops in the most
          violent encounters.

                     PICARD
               (grim)
          Cannon fodder.

                     GEORDI
          Then how did a Reman get to be
          Praetor?  I don't get it.

                     RIKER
          We have to assume he had Romulan
          collaborators.

                     PICARD
          A coup d'etat?

                     RIKER
          The Praetor's power has always been
          the Romulan fleet.  They must be
          behind him.

Picard considers this.

                     PICARD
               (to Data)
          What have you learned about
          Shinzon?

The images end.  There are no images of Shinzon.

                     DATA
          Starfleet intelligence was only
          able to provide a partial account
          of his military record.  We can
          infer he is relatively young and a
          capable commander.  He fought
          seventeen major engagements in the
          war.  All successful.  Beyond that,
          we know nothing.

                     PICARD
          Well... it seems we're truly
          sailing into the unknown.  Keep at
          it.  Anything you can give me would
          be appreciated.  Dismissed.

The meeting breaks up.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - ENGINEERING LAB - DAY

The B-9 stares placidly forward.

We pull back and discover that computer conduits connect the
B-9's head to Data's head.  Geordi monitors the connection.

                     DATA
          At present he serves no useful
          function.  Dr. Soong created us to
          become active and useful members of
          society.  I do not believe he would
          have wanted the B-9 to live out his
          life in his present state.

                     GEORDI
          I can't believe the Captain went
          along with a memory download.

                     DATA
          Captain Picard agrees that the B-9
          was probably designed with the same
          self-actualization parameters as
          myself.  If my memory engrams are
          successfully integrated into his
          positronic matrix, he should have
          all my abilities.

                     GEORDI
          He'd have all your memories too.
          You feel comfortable with that?

                     DATA
          I feel nothing, Geordi.  It is my
          belief that with my memory engrams
          he will be able to function as a
          more complete individual.

                     GEORDI
          An individual more like you, you
          mean.

                     DATA
          Yes.

                     GEORDI
          Maybe he's not supposed to be like
          you.  Maybe he's supposed to be
          just like he is.

Geordi completes his work

                     GEORDI
          Okay... we're done.

Geordi removes the computer connections from between their
heads.  He carefully closes the panel in Data's head as:

                     DATA
               (to B-9)
          Do you know where you are?

                     B-9
          I am in a room with lights.

He looks blankly at the console lights.

                     DATA
          Can you remember our father?

                     B-9
          No.

Data glances to Geordi.

                     DATA
          Do you know the name of the Captain
          of this vessel?

                     B-9
          No.

                     DATA
          Is that your final answer?

                     GEORDI
               (to B-9)
          Do you know my name?

                     B-9
          You have a soft voice.

                     GEORDI
               (gently)
          Data, he's assimilating a lot of
          programming.  Remember, he's a
          prototype, a lot less sophisticated
          than you are.  We just don't know
          if his matrix will be able to
          adapt.  Or if he'll be able to
          retain anything.  We should give
          him some time.

Data has been studying some circuitry in the B-9's neck.

                     DATA
          What purpose does this serve?

                     GEORDI
               (also examining circuitry)
          It seems to be a redundant memory
          port.  Maybe it's for provisional
          memory storage in case his neural
          pathways overload?

                     DATA
          Dr. Soong must have found it
          unnecessary in later versions.

                     GEORDI
          It's possible the extra memory port
          is interfering with the engram
          processing.  Mind if I keep him
          here and run some diagnostics?

                     DATA
          No, I do not mind.

Data looks at the B-9 with a sort of sadness.

                     DATA
          But I believe he will prove
          incapable of performing higher
          functions.

                     GEORDI
          Don't give up hope, Data.  I know,
          I know, you're not capable of hope.

                     DATA
               (looking at B-9)
          I am not.

Data stands.  The B-9 stands to follow.

                     DATA
          No, remain with Commander La Forge.
          He is going to try to make you
          well.

The B-9 sits.  Data goes.  Geordi watches him go.

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - OVER ROMULUS - SPACE

The Enterprise is in orbit around Romulus.  Remus can be seen
in the distance.

                     PICARD (V.O.)
          Captain's Log.  Stardate 47844.9.
          The Enterprise has arrived at
          Romulus and is waiting at the
          designated coordinates.  All our
          hails have gone unanswered.  We've
          been waiting for seventeen hours.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The crew is tense.  Silence.

Worf, at tactical, slowly stretches his neck.  Trying to
release the tension.  It cracks.  Deanna jumps a bit.

                     RIKER
          Why don't they answer our hails?

                     PICARD
          It's an old psychological strategy,
          Number One.  To put him in a
          position of dominance and make us
          uneasy.

                     RIKER
          It's working.

                     PICARD
               (to Deanna)
          Counselor?

                     DEANNA
          They're out there, sir.

Picard stands and walks to the viewscreen.  He gazes at
Romulus below and the black infinity of space beyond.
They're out there, Waiting.

                     WORF
          Sir,  I recommend we raise shields.

                     PICARD
          Not yet, Mister Worf.

                     RIKER
          Captain, with all due respect to
          diplomatic protocols -- the
          Federation Council's not sitting
          out here, we are.

                     PICARD
          Patience.  Diplomacy is a very
          exacting occupation.  We can wait.

                     DATA
          Captain...

And on the viewscreen.

Shinzon's magnificent Reman Warbird, the SCIMITAR, decloaks
directly before the Enterprise.

EXT.  OVER ROMULUS - SPACE

Our first sight of this incredible ship is absolutely
breathtaking.

Shinzon's vessel combines the clean lines of the traditional
Romulan Warbird with unique weaponry and styling.  It is
huge, easily twice as large as the Enterprise.  And it is
aggressive.  Awesome in its power.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The crew gapes at the huge ship on the viewscreen.

                     RIKER
               (slowly rising from his
                chair)
          My God...

                     WORF
               (tense)
          Should I raise shields?

                     PICARD
          No!

                     WORF
          Captain -- !

                     PICARD
               (firm)
          Tactical analysis, Mister Worf.

                     WORF
               (quickly analyzing
                tactical display)
          Fifty-two disruptor banks, twenty-
          seven photon torpedo bays, primary
          and secondary phased shields.

                     RIKER
          She's not out for a pleasure
          cruise.

                     PICARD
               (grim)
          She's a predator.

                     WORF
          We're being hailed.

                     PICARD
          On screen.

And the image on the viewscreen transforms to:

Shinzon's Viceroy.

He stands on the Scimitar's bridge.  The bridge is as unique
as the rest of Shinzon's ship.  Instead of the usual
mechanical clutter, this bridge is designed with an almost
Asian simplicity.  Like the rest of Reman design, it is spare
and elegant.

Since the Remans are more comfortable in the darkness, most
of the light comes from the three steadily pulsing warp core
relays which dramatically soar up through the floor of the
bridge.

The crew gazes at the bridge and the monstrous features of
the viceroy.

                     VICEROY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          Enterprise.  We are the Reman
          Warbird Scimitar.

                     PICARD
          Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to --

                     VICEROY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          I am not Shinzon.  I am his
          Viceroy.  We are sending transport
          coordinates.

The transmission ends abruptly.  The Scimitar reappears on
the viewscreen.

                     RIKER
          Not very chatty.

                     PICARD
          Away team.  Transporter room four.

Picard, Riker, Deanna, Worf and Data head toward the
turbolift, energized now that the endless waiting is over.

INT.  SCIMITAR - OBSERVATION LOUNGE - NIGHT

The away team materializes in the most striking location on
Shinzon's ship: a large observation lounge.

It is a huge, empty chamber.  No furniture.  A simple Reman
mat on the floor is the only decoration.  At the very top of
the room there is a large, etched glass dome.

It is very dark.

They turn when Shinzon speaks from the shadows:

                     SHINZON (V.O.)
          I hope you'll forgive the
          darkness... we're not comfortable
          in the light.

                     PICARD
          Praetor Shinzon?

Shinzon moves toward them a bit, becoming slightly more
illuminated, the low light shining off his golden hair.

The crew cannot see him clearly in the dim light but it is
evident he is human.  Assuming that he was Reman, they're
surprised by this realization.

Shinzon just stares at Picard through the darkness for a
moment.

                     SHINZON
          Captain Picard... Jean Luc
          Picard... I don't mean to stare,
          it's just -- well, you can't
          imagine how long I've been waiting
          for this moment.  I always imagined
          you taller, isn't that odd?
               (to Data)
          You may scan me without subterfuge,
          Commander Data.

Data scans him with a tricorder as:

                     PICARD
          And you're not as we imagined you.

                     SHINZON
          No?

                     WORF
          You are human.

                     SHINZON
          Commander Worf.
               (he speaks in Klingon)
          I greet you as a valiant warrior...
          and as my brother.

                     WORF
               (terse, in Klingon)
          I'll save my greetings for a better
          brother.

Shinzon laughs, maniacally.

                     PICARD
          Why have you asked for our presence
          here?

Shinzon does not answer.  He is staring deeply at Deanna,
moans softly.

                     PICARD
          Praetor?

                     SHINZON
               (quietly)
          I've never met a human woman.

He slowly moves toward her, still hidden in the shadows.

                     DEANNA
          I'm only half human.

                     SHINZON
          Deanna Troi of Betazed.  Empathic
          and telepathic abilities, ship's
          counselor.  All of this I knew...
          But I didn't know you were so
          beautiful.

                     RIKER
          You seem very familiar with our
          personnel.

Shinzon moves even closer to Deanna, not taking his eyes from
her.

                     SHINZON
          I am, Commander Riker...
               (to Deanna)
          ... May I touch your hair?

                     PICARD
               (firm)
          Praetor, we've come to Romulus on a
          matter we were -- assured was of
          great importance.  If you have
          anything to say to us as
          representatives of the Federation,
          I suggest you do so now.

Shinzon continues to stare at Deanna.  It is strangely
seductive.  Almost disquieting in its intensity.  Deanna
handles it with grace, her level gaze never leaving his.

                     SHINZON
               (softly)
          On the world I come from there's no
          light.  No sun.  Beauty isn't
          important.  I see now there's a
          world elsewhere.

                     PICARD
          Praetor Shinzon.  We're not here to
          discuss your lack of a social life.

                     SHINZON
               (turning back to Picard)
          Yes, I'm sorry, Captain.
               (he smiles)
          There's so much we have to talk
          about.

                     PICARD
          I would be interested to know what
          we are talking about.

                     SHINZON
          Unity, Captain!  Tearing down the
          walls between us to recognize we
          are one people.  Federation and
          Romulan.  Human and Vulcan and
          Klingon and Reman.  I'm speaking of
          the thing that makes us the same.
          We want peace.

Picard and the others are stunned.

                     SHINZON
          I want to end the centuries of
          mistrust.  I want to be your ally,
          not your enemy.  As a first step I
          propose we eliminate the Neutral
          Zone and begin a free and open
          exchange of goods and ideas.

                     PICARD
          And the Senate supports you?

                     SHINZON
               (dry)
          I have dissolved the Senate.

A beat.

                     SHINZON
          Right now, you're thinking this all
          sounds too good to be true?

                     PICARD
          Yes.

                     SHINZON
          And you're wondering why the
          Scimitar is so well armed.  Is this
          the ship of a peacemaker?  Or a
          predator?
               (Picard is startled at
                Shinzon's choice of
                words)
          ... But you're also thinking the
          chance for peace is too promising
          to ignore.  Above all, you're
          trying to decide if you can trust
          me.

                     PICARD
          Yes.

                     SHINZON
          Then perhaps the time has come to
          add some illumination to our
          discussion.  Computer, raise
          lighting four levels.

Lights shoot up around the room.

For the first time the crew can see Shinzon clearly.  Picard
actually gasps when he sees Shinzon's face.  The rest of the
crew doesn't understand his reaction.

                     SHINZON
          Allow me to tell you a story that I
          hope will clarify my position.
          When I was very young I was
          stricken with an odd disease.  I
          developed a hyper-sensitivity to
          sound.  The slightest whisper
          caused me agony...

Picard watches him carefully.  Wary and strangely intense.

                     SHINZON
          No one knew what to do.  Finally I
          was taken to a doctor who had some
          experience with Terran illnesses
          and I was finally diagnosed with
          Shalaft's syndrome.  Do you know of
          it, Captain?

                     PICARD
          You know I do.

The crew is dumbfounded at Picard's unusual reaction.

                     SHINZON
          Then you know it's a very rare
          syndrome.  Genetic.  All the male
          members of my family had it.
          Eventually I was treated.  Now I
          can hear as well as you can,
          Captain.

He steps toward Picard who holds his ground.

                     SHINZON
          I can see as well as you can.  I
          can feel everything you feel.
               (He stops right before
                Picard)
          In fact, I feel exactly what you
          feel.  Don't I, Jean Luc?

Picard stares at him with a mixture of realization and
curiosity.  It is as if Picard is looking into a strange,
remembered mirror: Shinzon's face is nearly identical to his
at that age.

                     SHINZON
          Do you trust me now?

A beat.

                     PICARD
          We need to talk, just you and I.

                     SHINZON
          Come to dinner on Romulus tomorrow.
          Just the two of us.  Or just the
          one of us.

                     PICARD
          You know I need to verify this.

                     SHINZON
          I know.

The crew is utterly confused.  Their confusion turns to
outright shock when Shinzon calmly pulls out a Reman knife
and cuts his arm, drawing a little blood.  He hands the knife
to Data.

                     SHINZON
          Tomorrow then, Captain.  We have so
          much to discuss.

Picard touches his communicator pin:

                     PICARD
          Picard to Enterprise.  Five to beam
          out.

They dematerialize, the shimmering glow illuminating
Shinzon's features.  Picard's eyes never leave Shinzon as
the transporter effect ripples around him.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - SICKBAY - DAY

Beverly stands with Picard, Riker and Deanna.  The Reman
knife is under a protonmicroscope and other medical readouts
and analysis are visible.

                     BEVERLY
          There's no doubt, Captain.  Right
          down to your regressive strain of
          Shalaft's Syndrome.  He's a clone.

A beat as the confirmation sinks in.

                     PICARD
          When was he... created?

                     BEVERLY
          About twenty-five years ago.  They
          probably used a hair follicle or
          skin cell.

                     PICARD
               (touching head)
          I think a skin cell's the more
          likely of the two.

                     RIKER
          Why?

                     PICARD
          Believe me, Number One; I'm going
          to find out.  Contact Starfleet
          Command and inform them of the
          situation.  I need to know where
          the hell he came from.  Deanna.

He goes, Deanna following.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - CORRIDOR - FOLLOWING

                     DEANNA
          I would say he's been trained to
          resist telepathy.  What I could
          sense of his emotions were erratic,
          very hard to follow.

                     PICARD
          Is he sincere about wanting peace?

                     DEANNA
          I don't know.
               (she stops him)
          Sir, the strongest sense I had was
          that he's more than curious about
          you.  He very much wants to know
          you.
               (she looks at him deeply)
          The same way you want to know him.

                     PICARD
          How could I not?

                     DEANNA
          Captain, don't assume he's anything
          like you are.  You should resist
          the urge to think you know him.

                     PICARD
          I not only know him, Deanna, I am
          him... and he is me!

He goes.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - RIKER AND DEANNA'S CABIN - NIGHT

Riker is hard at work over a series of padds.  He has been
working for hours.

                     DEANNA
          Will, you need to rest.
               (he continues to work)
          As ship's counselor, I'm
          recommending you get me sleep.

Riker tosses a padd on the desk.  Rubs his eyes.  Looks up
her.

                     RIKER
          Some honeymoon.

She smiles and goes to him.

                     DEANNA
          We have time.
               (she kisses him)
          Come to bed.

She pulls him up.

                     RIKER
          Imzadi, what am I going to do with
          you?

They kiss deeply.  She pulls him across the room and they
fall into the bed.

It is passionate, erotic.  Her arms undulate around him
sensually... her fingers snake through his hair, but
something is wrong.  Riker's hair is now blond.

She starts back, her eyes growing wide.

Riker is gone.  She is now embracing Shinzon!

                     SHINZON
          Imzadi.  This is so good.

                     DEANNA
          No!

He caresses her face...

                     SHINZON
          He can never know you as I know
          you... He can never touch you as I
          touch you.

                     DEANNA
          This isn't real.

                     SHINZON
          Can you feel my hands... are they
          real?  Can you feel my lips, my
          loins?

He kisses her neck -- but when he raises his head again.  It
is the monstrous Viceroy!  Holding her.  Caressing her.  She
is frozen in horror.  But is it the Viceroy at all?

Shinzon's voice seems to come from the Viceroy's lips:

                     SHINZON (V.O.)
          I'm with you, Imzadi...

And then it is Shinzon again, kissing her:

                     SHINZON
          I'll always be with you now.  Now
          and forever...

                     DEANNA
          You sick bastard!

She pushes him away...

                     RIKER
          Deanna?!  What's with the name
          calling?

It is Riker.  She stares at him, then clings to him
desperately.

EXT.  ROMULAN SENATE - DAY

The Byzantine splendors of the Senate loom before us.

INT.  ROMULAN SENATE CHAMBER - DAY

Heavy drapes are drawn against any hint of the sun.  Shinzon
is in conference with the Romulan Commanders and Senator
Tal'Aura.  Commander Donatra watches him closely.

Commander Suran is angry, pacing.  Shinzon stands.  His
Viceroy lurks in a corner.

                     SURAN
          ... then I don't understand the
          reason for the delay!

                     SHINZON
          You don't have to understand.

                     SURAN
          And bringing the Enterprise here?!
          What possible purpose could that
          serve?!

                     SHINZON
          I have a purpose.

                     SURAN
          Then perhaps you will enlighten us?

                     SHINZON
               (snaps)
          Silence, Romulan!

A tense beat.  Shinzon regains his composure.

                     SHINZON
          You must learn patience, Commander.
          Do you know where I learned it?  In
          the dilithium mines of Remus.
          Spend eighteen hours every day
          under the lash of a Romulan guard's
          whip and you'll soon understand
          patience.

                     SURAN
               (carefully bows his head)
          Praetor.

                     SHINZON
          Now go.  I have some personal
          business.

Suran and the others go.

Donatra turns just as she is leaving the chamber, she sees
the Viceroy going to Shinzon.  And then do something odd.
The Viceroy puts his hand on Shinzon's chest, leans very
close and talks to him quietly.  This is an ancient form of
Reman telepathic medical diagnosis.

This strange sight perplexes Donatra.  The doors close,
blocking her view...

INT.  SENATE - CORRIDOR - FOLLOWING

We go with Donatra and the other Romulans.  Donatra speaks
quietly to Suran:

                     DONATRA
          How long before he has us in the
          dilithium mines?

INT.  ENTERPRISE - DATA'S CABIN - DAY

The B-9 sits placidly in a chair, staring forward.

Then, as if a switch was thrown, he moves.  He quickly rises
and goes to a computer console.  He efficiently starts
punching in commands at an amazing velocity.

INT.  ROMULAN SENATE CHAMBER - NIGHT

Picard and Shinzon sit alone in a corner of the sweeping
Senate chamber.  The remains of dinner before them.

                     SHINZON
          And when I was ready they were
          going to replace you with me, an
          exact biological duplicate.  Put a
          Romulan agent at the heart of
          Starfleet to influence your command
          structure.  It was a bold plan.

                     PICARD
          What happened?

                     SHINZON
          As happens so frequently here on
          Romulus, a new government came to
          power.  They decided to abandon the
          plan -- frankly, I think they were
          afraid I'd be discovered and it
          would lead to war.  They weren't
          ready for that.

Picard pours a glass of Romulan ale.

                     SHINZON
          Romulan ale -- I'm surprised.  I
          can't stand it.

                     PICARD
               (smiles)
          You'll acquire a taste for it.

A beat.  They look at each other.

                     SHINZON
          It's not quite the face you
          remember.

                     PICARD
          Not quite.  I envy the hairline.

                     SHINZON
          A lifetime of violence will do
          that.  My nose was broken four
          times.  And my jaw... But so much
          is the same.  The eyes, you
          recognize the eyes.

                     PICARD
          Yes.  The eyes have it.

                     SHINZON
          Our eyes reflect our lives, don't
          they?  Yours are so confident.

                     PICARD
          How did you end up on Remus?

                     SHINZON
          They sent me there to die.  How
          could a mere human survive the
          dilithium mines?  It was...
               (he can't find the words)
          ... I was a slave.  And a monster.
          The only thing the Romulan guards
          hated more than the Remans was me.
          But one man took pity on me: the
          man who became my Viceroy.  He
          taught me how to survive.  And in
          that dark place, where there was
          nothing of myself, I found my Reman
          brothers.  They showed me the only
          kindness I ever knew.

A beat.  He glances to the Romulan crest on the wall.

                     SHINZON
          For thousands of years the Romulan
          Senate has met in this chamber and
          dictated the fate of its sister-
          planet... But the time has come for
          us to live as equals.

                     PICARD
          You're doing this to liberate the
          Remans?

                     SHINZON
          No race should be a slave to
          another.

Picard is impressed with Shinzon's quiet words.

                     SHINZON
          You don't trust me.

                     PICARD
          I have no reason to.

                     SHINZON
          Of course you do.  If you had lived
          my life and experienced the
          suffering of my people... you'd be
          sitting where I am now.  At least I
          hope you would.

                     PICARD
          And if you had lived my life you
          would understand that there is a
          great responsibility in
          representing the Federation.  I
          can't let my personal feelings
          unduly influence my decisions.

                     SHINZON
          All I have is my personal feelings.
          I wasn't raised with the ideals of
          the Federation.  But I'm trying to
          understand them now.  To live up to
          them   To live up to you.

A beat.

                     SHINZON
          I want to know where I come from.
          The Remans gave me a future.  You
          can tell me about my past.

                     PICARD
          There's so much, and so much of it
          is dull...

                     SHINZON
          Were we always explorers?

                     PlCARD
          No.  I was the first Picard to
          leave Earth.  It caused quite a
          stir, In fact.  But I had spent my
          whole life...

                     SHINZON
               (finishing the sentence)
          Looking up at the stars.

                     PICARD
          Yes.

                     SHINZON
          And you dreamed about what was up
          there.  About...

                     PICARD
               (finishing the sentence)
          New worlds.

A beat.

They both reach for a carafe of water at the exact same
instant.  Stop.

                     PICARD
          After you, Praetor.

                     SHINZON
               (smiles)
          Age before rank, Jean Luc.

Picard smiles, pours a glass.

                     PICARD
          So I'm not as tall as you expected?

                     SHINZON
          I always hoped I would hit two
          meters.

                     PICARD
          With a full head of hair.

                     SHINZON
               (smiles)
          There is that.

A quiet beat.

                     PICARD
          Shinzon... I'm trying to believe
          you.

                     SHINZON
          I know.

                     PICARD
          If there's one ideal the Federation
          holds most dear it's that all men,
          all races, can be united.  From the
          first time the Vulcans came to
          Earth we've sought a future of
          peace.  Nothing would make me more
          proud than to take your hand in
          friendship.  In time.  When trust
          has been earned.

                     SHINZON
          I'm honored to think I might
          someday speak with such eloquence.

A beat.

                     SHINZON
          In time, Jean Luc.

                     PICARD
          In time.

INT.  SENATE CHAMBER - LATER

Picard is gone.  Shinzon sits, thinking.  His Viceroy enters.

                     VICEROY
          This is a mistake.

                     SHINZON
          He's gentler than I thought.  And
          he has a sense of humor.

                     VICEROY
               (stern)
          Don't forget our mission, Shinzon.
          We should act.  Now.  Time is
          running out.

                     SHINZON
               (snaps)
          My time.  I'll spend it how I
          choose.

A tense beat.

                     SHINZON
          We'll return to the Scimitar.
          Prepare yourself for the bonding.

INT.  ENTERPRISE  BRIDGE - NIGHT

Picard emerges from the turbolift.  Data, Worf and Geordi
wait at the bridge engineering station.

                     WORF
          Sir, we've had an unauthorized
          access into the main computer.

                     PICARD
          Who was it?

                     GEORDI
          It's going to take some time to
          find out -- the data stream was
          rerouted through substations all
          over the ship.

                     PICARD
          What programs were accessed?

                     GEORDI
          That's what I don't get -- it's
          mostly basic stellar cartography:
          star charts; communications
          protocols; some uplinks from colony
          tracking stations.  It's not even
          restricted material.

                     PICARD
               (to Worf)
          Set up a security program to detect
          any unusual data stream rerouting.
          If it happens again, we want to be
          ready.

                     GEORDI
               (grim)
          There's something else.  I was
          reviewing the sensor logs...
               (he refers to some
                readouts on his console)
          When the Scimitar decloaked there
          was a momentary spike in the
          tertiary EM band -- there -- You're
          not going to believe this but it's
          Thalaron.

Picard is shocked.

INT.  SICKBAY - NIGHT

Picard stands, concerned, with Beverly, Geordi and Data.
Monitors showing Thalaron research are visible.

                     PICARD
          ... I thought Thalaron radiation
          was theoretical.

                     GEORDI
          Which is why our initial scans
          didn't pick it up.  But he's got
          it, Captain.

                     PICARD
          As I remember, Thalaron research
          was banned in the Federation
          because of its bioqenic properties.

                     BEVERLY
          It has the ability to consume
          organic material at the subatomic
          level.  I can't overestimate the
          danger of Thalaron radiation, Jean
          Luc.  A microscopic amount could
          kill every living thing on this
          ship in a matter of seconds.

                     PICARD
          Understood.  Keep on it.  I need to
          know what he has and how to
          neutralize any threat.  Give me
          options.

Picard goes.  Data thinks for a moment.

                     DATA
          Doctor, will you excuse us for a
          moment?  Geordi, please come with
          me.

He and Geordi head out.  Beverly returns to some medical
displays showing Thalaron research, her expression deeply
concerned.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - PICARD'S CABIN - NIGHT

Picard is sitting at his desk, flipping through an old photo
album.  He stops and stares at one of the pictures deeply
troubled.  We finally see the photo: Young Jean Luc Picard.
A serious, unsmiling cadet at Starfleet Academy.  The face
before him bears a disturbing resemblance to Shinzon.

The door comm chirps.

                     PICARD
          Come...
               (Beverly enters)
          ... Beverly, come in.

                     BEVERLY
          You're working late.

She sits, notes the picture of Young Jean Luc.

                     PICARD
          Remember him?

                     BEVERLY
          He was a bit proud as I recall.

                     PICARD
          He was a damn fool.  Selfish and
          ambitious.  Very much in need of
          seasoning.

                     BEVERLY
          He turned out all right.

He rises, goes to a window, gazes at the Scimitar in the
distance.  A beat.

                     PICARD
          I so wanted to believe Shinzon.
          But the Thalaron radiation can't be
          explained away.  Whatever he's
          after, it's not peace.

                     BEVERLY
          Is he very much like you were?

                     PICARD
          Yes.

Data interrupts on comm:

                     DATA (V.O.) (ON COMM)
          Data to Captain Picard.  Geordi and
          I have identified the source of the
          unauthorized computer access.  And,
          I believe, we have also discovered
          an opportunity to gain a tactical
          advantage.

                     PICARD
               (to comm)
          On my way...

                     BEVERLY
               (stands)
          Jean Luc -- whatever you were --
          right now you're the man you've
          made yourself.  He's someone else.

                     PICARD
          I wish I could believe that,
          Doctor.

He goes.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - TURBOLIFT - MORNING

Deanna is alone on the turbolift.  Then a voice makes her
spin:

                     SHINZON (V.O.)
          Imzadi...

Shinzon stands across from her.

                     DEANNA
          You're not here.

                     SHINZON
               (moving to her)
          Very logical, Deanna... But your
          heart doesn't constrain itself to
          mere logic.
               (he caresses her)
          ... Your heart longs to discover
          me.  To know me...
               (he kisses her)
          ... To leave all of this behind and
          be with me.

He pushes her against the wall, with passion and almost
violence.

                     DEANNA
          No...

                     SHINZON
          I can feel your desire, Deanna...

She forces herself to concentrate... to resist
telepathically... it is a mighty effort... this Romulan is
hot.  And the world around her appears to be changing...
bending...

And she is momentarily in a cabin on the Scimitar.  Although
entirely a telepathic experience, it is as if she has
actually traveled.

She sees Shinzon kneeling over a small flame, she realizes
she is looking through the Viceroy's eyes.

On the Scimitar, Shinzon looks up at the Viceroy/Deanna:

                     SHINZON
          I can feel your hunger to know the
          Reman ways... the old ways.

Then the world changes again...

Deanna is on the turbolift.  Shinzon is pressed against her,
whispering:

                     SHINZON
          Don't fear what you desire...

She forces him away from her and --

She is alone.  She sinks to her knees.  Overcome with
emotion.

INT.  SCIMITAR - VICEROY'S CABIN - FOLLOWING

The Viceroy, in a kind of trace, kneels before a small flame.
Shinzon kneels across from him.  The Viceroy raises his head.

                     VICEROY
          The bond is broken.

                     SHINZON
          Find her again.

                     VICEROY
          No -- this is wasting time.

                     SHINZON
          Do as I tell you!

A Reman officer interrupts on comm:

                     REMAN OFFICER (V.O.)
          Praetor, we've received the
          transponder signal.

                     SHINZON
               (to comm)
          On my way.

He begins to go -- but suddenly stops, a wave of illness
overtaking him.

The Viceroy puts his hand on Shinzon's chest.  A strange
moment as the Viceroy shuts his eyes and feels Shinzon's
chest.  His mind... probing.

Then the Viceroy looks up at him, grim.

                     VICEROY
          It's accelerating.  You have no
          more time for games.

                     SHINZON
          Have the doctors prepare.  I'll be
          on the bridge.

He goes.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - DAY

Shinzon stands with some REMAN ENGINEERS.

                     SHINZON
          Transport.

An Engineer activates a transporter and the B-9 materializes!

                     SHINZON
          Welcome home.
               (to Engineers)
          Begin the download.

Reman engineers go to the B-9 and open the panel in his neck,
begin connecting computer conduits to the extra memory port
we saw earlier.

(Note: Although the audience will not know it yet, this is
actually Data pretending to be the B-9.)

Shinzon goes to a replicator unit and orders:

                     SHINZON
          Tea, hot.

A cup of tea appears.  He takes it and sips as he watches his
Engineers connecting the conduits to the B-9.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - SICKBAY - DAY

Beverly is scanning Deanna.  Picard and Riker watch,
concerned.

                     BEVERLY
          Aside from slightly elevated
          adrenalin and serotonin levels,
          you're completely normal.

                     PICARD
               (gently)
          Can you describe it, Deanna?

She looks at Picard, tears in her eyes.

                     DEANNA
          It was... a violation.

Riker takes her hand.

                     DEANNA
               (with difficulty)
          Shinzon's Viceroy seems to have the
          ability to reach into my thoughts.
          I've become a liability... I
          request to be relieved of my
          duties.

                     PICARD
          Permission denied.  If you can
          possibly endure any more of these
          assaults.  I need you at my side.
          Now more than ever I...

But before the words are out of his mouth... he begins to
dematerialize!

                     RIKER
               (to comm)
          Worf!  Raise Shields !

But Picard is gone.

EXT.  OVER ROMULUS - SPACE

The Scimitar cloaks.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIG - NIGHT

Picard stands in the Reman brig.  His communicator pin has
been removed.

Beyond the security force field a ghoulish medical apparatus
is being prepared.  A metal chair with laser scalpels, IV
tubes and hyposprays connected to it.  Reman doctors work
over the mysterious chair.

Shinzon enters with the B-9 following.  Shinzon stands on the
other side of the force field.

Picard notices something immediately.  Tiny veins are now
visible on Shinzon's face; the faintest sign of an intricate
spider-web pattern of pale blue veins.

                     SHINZON
          Hello, Jean Luc.

                     PICARD
          Why am I here?

                     SHINZON
          I was lonely...
               (he realizes Picard is
                staring at the veins on
                his face)
          Perhaps I'm not aging as well as
          you did.

He nods to a guard.  The guard deactivates the force field.
A Reman doctor enters and raises a hypospray toward Picard.

                     PICARD
               (resists)
          What are you doing?

                     SHINZON
          I need a sample of your blood.
          What do your Borg friends say?
          Resistance is futile.
               (maniacal laugh)

The Doctor takes a quick sample of Picard's blood as Picard
glances to the B-9.

                     SHINZON
          Yes.  The bait you couldn't refuse.
          I learned there might be an
          existing prototype from a
          Cardassian historian, then went to
          a great deal of trouble to find it
          and scatter it about on Kolarus
          III.  I knew it would pique your
          curiosity and conveniently make the
          Enterprise the closest ship to
          Romulus when I contacted Starfleet.

The Reman doctor leaves the cell.  The force field is
reactivated.  The doctor goes to the mysterious medical
apparatus and analyzes Picard's blood.  As:

                     PICARD
          All of this so you could capture
          me?

                     SHINZON
          Don't be so vain.  After we found
          it, we made a few modifications.
          An extra memory port, a hidden
          transponder.  Perhaps your eyes
          will be a bit less confident when
          you learn I've gained access to
          Starfleet's communications
          protocols.  I now know the location
          of your entire fleet...
               (to B-9)
          ... You may go.

                     B-9
          Where?

                     SHINZON
          Out of my sight.

The B-9 obediently leaves the room as:

                     SHINZON
          Maybe I'll train it to do little
          tricks for me like your robot does.
          Or maybe I'll snap its ugly head
          off.

                     PICARD
          What's this all about?

                     SHINZON
          It's about destiny, Picard.  About
          a Reman outcast who --

                     PICARD
          You're not Reman.

                     SHINZON
          And I'm not quite human.  So what
          am I?  What do you see?
               (he peers at Picard
                deeply)
          Do you see a life you might have
          led?  Lost youth never to be
          recaptured?

                     PICARD
          I see a young man trying
          desperately to deny who he is.

                     SHINZON
          I see an old man, set in his ways,
          afraid to live without a uniform to
          prop him up and a Starfleet
          regulation to tell him what to do.
          I see the man I will never be.

                     PICARD
          I won't defend my life to you.

                     SHINZON
          My life is meaningless as long as
          you're alive.  What am I while you
          exist?  A shadow?  An enigma?

                     PICARD
               (stern)
          If your issues are with me... This
          has nothing to do with my ship and
          nothing to do with the Federation.

                     SHINZON
          Oh, but it does.  We will no longer
          bow like slaves before anyone.  Not
          the Romulans and not your mighty
          Federation.  We're a race bred for
          war.  For conquest.

                     PICARD
          Think about what you're doing,
          Shinzon.  Are you ready to plunge
          the entire quadrant into war to
          satisfy your own personal demons?

                     SHINZON
          It amazes me how little you know
          yourself.

                     PICARD
          I'm incapable of such an act, and
          so are you.

                     SHINZON
          I think the facts speak for
          themselves.  The same noble Picard
          blood runs in our veins.  Had you
          lived my life, you'd be doing
          exactly as I am.  Look in the
          mirror, and see yourself.

Shinzon looks at him deeply.

                     SHINZON
          Consider that, Captain.  I can
          think of no greater torment for
          you.

He turns to go.

                     PICARD
          It's a mirror for you as well...

Shinzon turns back to him.

A beat.  Picard gazes at him evenly.

Picard's probing gaze makes Shinzon a bit uneasy.  He glances
to the ghoulish medical preparations.

                     SHINZON
          Not for long, Captain.
               (back to Picard)
          I'm afraid you won't survive to
          witness the victory of the echo
          over the voice.

He goes.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - NIGHT

The ship is on Red Alert.  Worf stands at tactical, muscles
coiled, hungry for action.

                     WORF
          No response to our hails.

Geordi is hard at work at the Science station.  Riker stands
over him:

                     GEORDI
               (frustrated)
          His cloak is perfect... no tachyon
          emissions, no residual antiprotons.

                     RIKER
          Keep at it, Geordi.  Find a way in.

Beverly arrives on the bridge, urgent.  She carries a medical
padd.

                     BEVERLY
          Will, I need to talk to you.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIG - NIGHT

Picard stands in his cell, peering at the edges of the
security force field, trying to spot any weakness.

Then the B-9 enters the brig, he holds a Reman disruptor
weapon.

                     B-9
               (to Reman guard)
          I am to take the prisoner to the
          Praetor.

The Reman Guard deactivates the force field.

                     B-9
          If you resist, I will incapacitate
          you.

He leads Picard out.

INT.  SCIMITAR - CORRIDORS - FOLLOWING

The B-9 leads Picard through the dark corridors, holding the
disruptor on him steadily.  All the Remans they pass glare at
Picard with undisguised loathing.

The Viceroy approaches.  Stops before them.

                     VICEROY
               (to B-9)
          Where are you taking him?

                     B-9
          Praetor Shinzon wants him on the
          bridge.

The Viceroy turns his malevolent gaze on Picard.

                     VICEROY
          So, human... you've met your better
          self!

                     PICARD
          What are you doing to Counsellor
          Troi?

                     VICEROY
          I'm preparing her for Shinzon... To
          sooth him as she soothes you.  To
          stand at his side as she does at
          yours.

                     PICARD
          That will never happen.

                     VICEROY
          Listen to him, android.  Such a
          small and weak creature.  Yet he
          roars so valiantly...
               (he raises one taloned
                claw and puts a sharp
                fingernail on Picard's
                chest)
          It would take me but an instant to
          tear that valiant heart from your
          chest.

                     PICARD
          There'll be another after me.  And
          another after that.  You'll find
          we're a resilient species.

                     VICEROY
          I look forward to the sport.
               (to the B-9, harshly)
          Take him.

The B-9 prods Picard's back roughly with the disruptor.
Picard grimaces in pain

                     B-9
          Move.

The Viceroy continues away down the corridor.  The B-9 leads
Picard along.

                     PICARD
               (whispers)
          Be careful of over-playing your
          part, Commander!

And the audience now realizes it is Data pretending to be the
B-9 and rejoices.

                     DATA
          Sorry, sir.  I thought it added a
          touch of reality to the
          performance.

They are silent as they pass a few Reman guards.  Then:

                     DATA
          My mission was a success, sir.  I
          have discovered the source of the
          Thalaron radiation.

                     PICARD
          Good work.  The download?

                     DATA
          He believes he has our
          communications protocols.  But they
          will give him inaccurate locations
          for all Starfleet vessels.

Data assumes the B-9's posture again as they pass some some
Reman Warriors.

                     DATA
          Move, puny human animal.

They pass the Warriors.

                     PICARD
          A bit less florid, Data.

                     DATA
          Aye, sir... This way.

He leads Picard down the corridor.

INT.  SCIMITAR - GENERATION CHAMBER - NIGHT

Data leads Picard into a massive chamber that soars up like a
cathedral.  It is the size of a small town.

The whole, cavernous chamber pulses with glowing green light.

                     DATA
          This entire ship is, essentially, a
          flying Thalaron generator.
               (he points up)
          All its power relays lead to that
          device.

High above them, at the very top of the chamber, is a
gigantic version of the spider-weapon we saw kill all the
Romulan Senators before.  It is breathtaking.

                     PICARD
          A weapon.

                     DATA
          It would appear so.

Data rotates his left hand and then slides it forward,
exposing a hidden compartment in his wrist.  He removes a
small, silver disc.  This is a cool new piece of Federation
technology called an ETU.  (Emergency Transport Unit.)

                     DATA
          Geordi equipped me with the
          prototype for the Emergency
          Transport Unit.  I recommend you
          use it to return to the Enterprise.

                     PICARD
          It'll only work for one of us.

                     DATA
          Yes, sir.

                     PICARD
          We'll find a way off together.
          Recommendations?

                     DATA
          There is a shuttlebay 948 meters
          from our current location.

Data inserts the ETU back into his wrist and they leave the
chamber.

INT.  SCIMITAR BRIDGE - NIGHT

The Viceroy arrives on the bridge, stops.

                     VICEROY
          Where's Picard?

Shinzon looks at him, confused.

INT.  SCIMITAR - CORRIDORS - NIGHT

Security alert klaxons suddenly begin to howl and harsh Reman
commands are broadcast through the corridors.

                     DATA
          This way, sir!

They sprint down the twisting, dark corridors -- Reman
warriors suddenly appear before them! -- Data fires the
disruptor as Picard launches himself into them --

A fight -- Picard uses a dazzlinq series of Starfleet hand-
to-hand maneuvers -- he dramatically subdues the Remans.

More Reman warriors appear down the corridor.  Picard grabs a
disruptor.

And instantly spins to fire a blazing disruptor.  A battle
breaks out in the corridor -- the energy beams and explosions
illuminating the violent fire fight in strobe-like bursts.

They run to another corridor and finally arrive at the
shuttlebay door -- it does not open.

                     DATA
               (looking at door security
                panel)
          It seems to have an encrypted
          security system.

Reman warriors are closing in on them.

Data tosses his disruptor to Picard -- Picard catches it and
instantly spins and fires -- he uses both disruptors to fire
down both ends of the corridor like a Western sheriff --
keeping the Remans at bay --

As Data uses both hands to punch numbers into the shuttlebay
door security panel at an amazing rate --

                     PICARD
          Alacrity would be appreciated,
          Commander.

                     DATA
          They are trying to override the
          access codes.  Reman is really a
          most complex language with
          pictographs representing certain
          verb roots and --

                     PICARD
          While I find that fascinating,
          Data, we really need that Goddamned
          door open!

The shuttlebay door slides open.

Picard lays down a blistering barrage of cover fire as he and
Data duck into the shuttlebay.

INT.  SCIMITAR - SHUTTLEBAY - FOLLOWING

When the door closes behind them, Picard turns and fires a
disruptor blast -- sealing the door mechanism.

They turn to face...

A fleet of very small shuttles.  They are uniquely designed.
Extremely compact and stream-lined.  A disruptor turret on
each.

They move toward one as:

                     DATA
          According to the ship's manifest
          they are Scorpion-class attack
          fliers.

They quickly climb a Scorpion.

INT.  SCORPION COCKPIT - SHUTTLEBAY - FOLLOWING

The cockpit of the Scorpion is cramped.  Picard climbs into
the pilot's position.  Data assumes the gunner's position.

They see disruptor fire trying to burn through the door to
the shuttlebay -- Picard powers up the Scorpion as:

                     PICARD
               (trying to figure out the
                controls)
          What do you imagine this is?

                     DATA
          Port thrusters, sir.  Would you
          like me to drive?

Picard shoots him a look and presses some controls.  The
Scorpion lifts off.  Hovers a few feet over the deck.  Picard
elegantly swings it around toward the large shuttlebay
external doors as:

                     PICARD
          Can you open the shuttlebay doors?

                     DATA
               (working controls)
          Affirmative, sir.  Negative, sir.
          They have instigated security
          overrides and erected a force field
          around the external portals.

                     PICARD
          Well then... only one way to go.

He swings the Scorpion around again so it is facing the doors
they came through, the doors back into the ship.

Data is dubious.

                     DATA
          Do you think this is a wise course
          of action?

                     PICARD
          We're about to find out... Power up
          disruptors and fire on my mark.

                     DATA
          Ready, Captain.

                     PICARD
          Fire!

And the Scorpion's forward disruptors fire!  The doors into
the ship explode!  Picard powers forward!

INT.  SCIMITAR CORRIDORS - FOLLOWING

And the Scorpion shoots into the corridor, past the stunned
Remans.  Picard banks sharply -- careens off the far side of
the corridor but keeps control.

The Scorpion zooms down the corridor.

INT.  SCORPION COCKPIT - SCIMITAR - FOLLOWING

Picard is concentrating intensely -- it is like trying to
control the world's fastest roller coaster.

INT.  SCIMITAR - CORRIDORS - FOLLOWING

The Scorpion banks around a corner --it zigs and zags through
the ship at breakneck speed --

INT.  SCIMITAR - OBSERVATION LOUNGE - NIGHT

The doors to the observation lounge EXPLODE in.

The Scorpion SHOOTS into the room and up --

A disruptor blast SHATTERS the etched glass dome at the top
of the room --

And the Scorpion ZOOMS triumphantly into space!

EXT.  OVER ROMULUS - SPACE

The Scorpion seems to appear from nowhere -- slicing through
the cloak of invisibility around the Scimitar --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The crew sees the Scorpion appear on the viewscreen.

                     RIKER
          Worf!  Lock on transporters!

INT.  SCIMITAR BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon sees the Scorpion as well.

                     SHINZON
          Tractor beam!  Now!

EXT.  OVER ROMULUS - SPACE

But they are too late -- the Scorpion dematerializes --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - CARGO BAY - FOLLOWING

And materializes in one of the Enterprise's cargo bays.
Picard and Data climb out --

                     PICARD
               (to comm)
          Number One, emergency warp!

EXT.  OVER ROMULUS - FOLLOWING

The Enterprise dramatically powers forward and up -- rolling
over in a great arc going into warp while still upside down.
It disappears in a blaze of light.  Fade to...

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - NIGHT

Shinzon sits in his command chair as the ship streaks through
space.  He speaks on viewscreen with his Romulan
collaborators.  His face is even more finely veined now.

                     SHINZON
          The Enterprise is immaterial!  They
          won't make it back to Federation
          space.

                     SURAN (ON VIEWSCREEN)
               (angry)
          This has gone far enough!

                     SHINZON
          I thought we discussed patience,
          Commander.

                     SURAN (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          And mine is wearing thin, young
          man!  We supported you because you
          promised action.  And yet you delay
          and you waste your time playing
          games with Picard while --

Shinzon stands and briskly pulls down his uniform tunic 
exactly as we've seen Picard do a thousand times.

                     SHINZON
          Commander Suran, the games are
          over.  In two days the Federation
          will be crippled beyond repair.
          Does that satisfy you?

                     SURAN (ON VIEWSCREEN)
               (grim)
          For the moment.

                     SHINZON
               (brutal)
          And when I return... you and I
          shall have a little talk about
          showing proper respect!

INT.  ROMULAN SENATE - CHAMBER - FOLLOWING

The viewscreen picture of Shinzon snaps out.  The Romulan sit
for a silent beat.

                     DONATRA
          Does anyone in this room harbor any
          illusions about what he means by
          "showing proper respect"?

                     TAL'AURA
          What's happening to his face?

                     SURAN
          I want opinions.  He is clearly out
          of his mind.

                     SURAN
          But can he complete his mission?

                     DONATRA
          Should he?

They look at her.

                     DONATRA
          Are you prepared to have your hands
          drenched in blood?  He'll show them
          no mercy.  And his sins will mark
          us all for generations.  Is that
          what you truly want, Romulans?

A beat.

                     DONATRA
          I think you should consider that
          question now -- or else you may
          have a lifetime to think about it
          in the dilithium mines.

She turns and stalks out.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - READY ROOM - NIGHT

Beverly sits with Picard and Riker.

                     BEVERLY
          The more I studied his DNA the more
          confusing it got.  Finally I could
          only come to one conclusion...
          Shinzon was created with temporal
          RNA sequencing.  He was designed so
          that at a certain point his aging
          process could be accelerated to
          reach your age more quickly, so he
          could replace you.

                     PICARD
          But the Romulans abandoned the
          plan...

                     BEVERLY
          As a result the temporal sequencing
          was never activated.  Remember, he
          was supposed to replace you at
          nearly your current age.  He was
          engineered to skip thirty years of
          life.  But since the RNA sequencing
          was never activated, his cellular
          structure has started to break
          down.  He's dying.

                     PICARD
          Dying?

                     RIKER
          He wasn't designed to live a
          complete, human life span.

                     PlCARD
          Can anything be done for him?

                     BEVERLY
          Not without a complete
          myelodysplastic infusion from the
          only donor with compatible DNA.
          But that would mean draining all
          your blood.

                     RIKER
          That's why he went to all that
          trouble to capture you.

                     PlCARD
          How long does he have?

                     BEVERLY
          I can't be sure but the rate of
          decay seems to be accelerating.

Picard considers this.

                     PICARD
          Then he'll come for me as a donor.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - DATA'S CABIN - NIGHT

Data stands before the B-9.

The B-9 has been deactivated, he stands lifeless and
immobile.  Data gazes deeply into his double's identical
features.  Then he opens a panel in the B-9's neck and uses a
small instrument to activate the android's head.

The B-9's eyes spring to life.  He looks at Data.

                     B-9
          Brother.  I cannot move.

                     DATA
          No, I have only activated your
          cognitive and communication
          subroutines.

                     B-9
          Why?

                     DATA
          Because you are dangerous.

                     B-9
          Why?

                     DATA
          You have been programmed to gather
          information that can be used
          against this ship.

                     B-9
          I do not understand.

                     DATA
          I know.

A beat.

                     DATA
          Do you know anything about
          Shinzon's plans against the
          Federation?

                     B-9
          No.

                     DATA
          Do you have any knowledge of the
          tactical abilities of his ship?

                     B-9
          No.  Can I move now?

                     DATA
          No.  I must deactivate you.

                     B-9
          For how long?

                     DATA
          Indefinitely.

                     B-9
          How long is that?

A beat.  Data gazes at the B-9 deeply.

                     DATA
          A long time, brother.

Data reaches forward and deactivates his brother.

The B-9's eyes lose the spark of life.  He stands, frozen.
Data stands before him.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - OBSERVATION LOUNGE - NIGHT

Picard is gathered with his senior officers.

A computer display illustrates Geordi's words about the power
of Shinzon's weapon.  We see a chilling graphic of the
Biogenic Pulse beam spreading around a ship, then a whole
planet.

                     GEORDI
          It's called a Cascading Biogenic
          Pulse.  The unique properties of
          Thalaron radiation allow the energy
          beam to expand almost without
          limits.  Depending on the radiant
          intensity it could encompass a
          ship... or a planet.

                     PICARD
               (thinking)
          And that's exactly what he's going
          to do.

                     RIKER
          Sir?

                     PICARD
          His hatred of the Federation is
          apparent.  He would have built a
          weapon of that scope for one
          reason.  He is going after Earth.

                     RIKER
          Oh boy.  Destroy humanity and the
          Federation is crippled...

                     PICARD
          And the Romulans invade.

                     DEANNA
          How can you be certain?

                     PICARD
          I know how he thinks.

A beat.

                     RIKER
               (to Geordi)
          And there's no way to penetrate his
          cloak?

                     GEORDI
          No, sir.

                     RIKER
               (frustrated)
          He could pass within 10 meters of
          every ship in Starfleet and they'd
          never know.

                     BEVERLY
          But we do have one advantage.
               (to Picard)
          He needs your blood to live.  He
          might come after you first.

                     PICARD
          I'm counting on it... We've been
          ordered to head to sector 3274.
          Starfleet is diverting the fleet to
          meet us there.

                     RIKER
          Strength in numbers?

                     PICARD
          We can only hope so.

A beat as he looks at them gravely.

                     PICARD
          He can't be allowed to use that
          weapon.  All other concerns are
          secondary.  Do you understand me?

Riker knows exactly what Picard is saying: the Enterprise is
expendable.

                     RIKER
          Yes, sir.

Picard stands.  Presses a comm button.

                     PICARD
          All hands.  Battle stations.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - VARIOUS ANGLES

We see a montage of the Enterprise preparing for battle.

Crew members assume battle stations.  Weapons locker ring
open and Security Officers hand out sidearms and phaser
rifles.

Geordi and his Engineers establish emergency force field
around the warp core.

Riker and Worf brief officers on tactical plans...

Data works at the bridge Science Station, analyzing data on
Shinzon's ship.

Picard walks through the corridors, he stops to talk with
apprehensive young ensign.

As we hear:

                     PICARD (V.O.)
          Captain's Personal Log.
          Supplemental.  We're heading toward
          Federation space at maximum warp.
          The crew has responded with the
          dedication I've come to expect of
          them.  And like a thousand other
          commanders on a thousand other
          battlefields throughout history, I
          wait for the dawn.

The montage ends as...

INT.  ENTERPRISE - SICKBAY - NIGHT

Picard enters sickbay.

Dr. Crusher and her medical staff are hard at work.  They
position anti-grav gurneys and ready medical supplies.
Security officers are handing out phasers.

Picard watches the grim preparations.  Beverly goes to him,
bolstering her phaser.

                     PICARD
               (quietly)
          To seek out new life and new

               (gently)
          That was another time.

                     PICARD
          How far we've come.  Let me know if
          you need anything.

He starts to go --

                     BEVERLY
          Jean Luc...
               (he stops)
          ... He is not you.

A beat.

                     PICARD
          What makes us who we are, Doctor?
          Can you tell me that?

She watches him go.

INT.  SCIMITAR BRIDGE - NIGHT

Shinzon sits in his command chair, lined with veins now.
His Viceroy again has his hand pressed to Shinzon's chest.

                     SHINZON
          How long?

                     VICEROY
          A matter of hours now --

Shinzon shoves him away.  Stands.

                     VICEROY
          If you don't begin the procedure
          soon you'll never make it back to
          Romulus.  You shouldn't have
          delayed.  You should have killed
          Picard the moment --

Shinzon slams his command chair in fury.  The Viceroy watches
him carefully.

A beat.  Shinzon regains his composure.  He sits again in his
command chair.

                     SHINZON
          How long until we reach the Rift?

                     VICEROY
               (checks a console)
          Seven minutes.

Shinzon leans back, satisfied.  And looks at the viewscreen.

The image on the viewscreen is shocking.

The Enterprise only a few hundred yards away.

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - SPACE

The Enterprise zooms through space.

Completely unaware of the predator directly above it.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - ASTROMETRICS - NIGHT

Data is at work in Astrometry.  Cartographic projections of
star systems ebb and flow on a large screen before him.
Picard enters.

                     PICARD
          Show me our current position.

The images before them quickly change to show another sector
and a blip representing the Enterprise.

                     PICARD
          How long until we reach the fleet?

                     DATA
          At our current velocity we will
          arrive at sector 3274 in
          approximately 40 minutes.

The images before them change to show sector 3274.  We see
blips denoting Starfleet ships moving into position.
Picard gazes at the projection of stars before them for a
moment.

                     PICARD
               (quietly)
          "For now we see but through a glass
          darkly..."  He said he's a mirror.

                     DATA
          Of you?

                     PICARD
          Yes.

                     DATA
          I do not agree.  Although you share
          the same genetic structure, the
          events of your life have created
          unique individual.

                     PICARD
          But so much is the same.  On a
          biological level he is... and I
          will not accept the idea that there
          is nothing I can do.  I have a
          responsibility to try to make a
          human connection with him.

                     DATA
          He would deny a "human" connection
          is possible.  He considers himself
          entirely Reman.

                     PICARD
          He may have already rejected my
          humanity, but you also have a twin.

                     DATA
          No, sir, it is not possible.  The
          B-9 is physically identical to me,
          although his neural pathways are
          not as advanced.  But even if they
          were, he would not be me.

                     PICARD
          How can you be sure?

                     DATA
          I aspire, sir.  To be better than I
          am.  The B-9 does not.  Nor does
          Shinzon.

A beat.

                     PICARD
          We'll never know what Shinzon might
          have been.  Had he stood where I
          did as a child?  And looked up at
          the stars.

Picard's words linger in the air for a moment.

Then the projections before them sputter with static for a
moment.  Flickering.

                     DATA
               (working controls)
          We are passing through the Bassen
          Rift.  The projections will return
          when we have cleared it.

                     PICARD
          It's interfering with our uplink
          from Starfleet cartography?

                     DATA
          Yes, sir.  The Rift effects all
          long-range communications --

                     PICARD
                (urgent, to comm)
          Commander Riker, evasive maneuvers!

Too late.

The ship QUAKES -- a photon torpedo blast -- the Enterprise
is under attack!

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

Disruptor beams appear from nowhere -- streaking through
space -- slamming into the Enterprise's warp drive.  The
Enterprise recoils, dangerously dropping out of warp in a
furious lurch.

The Bassen Rift is a strange area of electromagnetic
distortion.  Energy patterns crackle through space.

INT.  SCIMITAR BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon sits in his command chair.  The viewscreen shows the
Enterprise before him.

                     SHINZON
          Target weapons systems and shields.
          I don't want the Enterprise
          destroyed.

On the viewscreen, we see disruptor blasts streaking from the
Scimitar -- slicing into the Enterprise.

                     SHINZON
          Can you learn to see in the dark,
          Captain?

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard and Data emerge from the turbolift as the ship
ROCKS --

                     PICARD
          Report.

                     RIKER
          He's firing through his cloak.  We
          can't get a lock.

                     GEORDI
               (at engineering station)
          He disabled our warp drive with his
          first shot.  We've only got
          impulse.

                     WORF
          Long range communication is
          impossible as long as we're in the
          rift --

The ship SHUDDERS again --

                     PICARD
          Worf, prepare a full phaser spread,
          zero elevation.  All banks on my
          mark.  Scan for shield impacts and
          stand by photon torpedoes.

                     WORF
          Aye, sir

The ship ROCKS again.

                     PICARD
          Fire!

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The Enterprise fires her phasers simultaneously -- the energy
beams shoot into space --

And the Scimitar's shape is momentarily illuminated as one of
its shields is hit.

Photon torpedoes immediately shoot from the Enterprise -- but
pass harmlessly through the area where the Scimitar's shields
were momentarily illuminated.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

                     SHINZON
          You're too slow, old man.
               (entering commands in his
                chair console)
          Attack pattern Shinzon Theta.

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The invisible Warbird makes a dramatic run straight over the
Enterprise -- firing steadily down as it sweeps past it; is a
brutal, close range assault --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The bridge SHAKES violently under the ruthless attack--

                     DATA
          We are losing dorsal shields --

                     PICARD
          Full axis rotation to port!  Fire
          all ventral phasers!

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The Enterprise instantly complies -- Rolling completely over
to the left, firing phasers up as Shinzon's invisible ship
streaks above it --

A few lucky phaser shots from the bottom of the Enterprise --
now shooting upward -- manage to momentarily illuminate the
bottom shields of the Scimitar as it sweeps past above.

INT.  ENTERPRISE BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

                     WORF
          Minimal damage to the Scimitar.

          Counselor Troi, report to the
          bridge.

                     RIKER
          Unless we can disable his cloak
          we're just going to be firing in
          the dark.

                     PlCARD
          Agreed.

                     WORF
          Sir, we're being hailed.

                     PICARD
          On screen.

Shinzon appears on the viewscreen.  He is on the bridge of
the Scimitar.

                     SHINZON (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          Captain Picard, will you join me in
          your Ready Room?

INT.  ENTERPRISE - READY ROOM

Picard stands in his Ready Room.  A flickering light shimmers
across the room.  And a perfect holographic representation of
Shinzon appears before him.

                     SHINZON
          You can't trace my holographic
          emitters, Captain.  So don't
          bother.  And you can't contact
          Starfleet.  We're quite alone.

                     PICARD
          We are.

                     SHINZON
          It's just the two of us now, Jean
          Luc, as it should be... Your ship
          and mine... You and me.

                     PICARD
          Why are you here?

                     SHINZON
          To accept your surrender.  I can
          clearly destroy you at any time.
          Lower your shields and allow me to
          transport you to my ship.

                     PICARD
          And what of the Enterprise?

                     SHINZON
          I have little interest in your
          quaint vessel, Captain.  If the
          Enterprise will withdraw to a
          distance of one hundred light
          years, it will not be harmed.

                     PICARD
          You know that's not possible.

                     SHINZON
          I know... you'll all gladly die to
          save your home world.

                     PICARD
               (intense)
          Look at me, Shinzon!  Do you feel
          the blood pumping inside you?  Your
          hands, your eyes, your nature, are
          the same as mine.  Buried deep
          inside you beneath the years of
          pain and anger is a capacity you've
          forgotten.  It's the one way our
          mirror can reflect the two of us
          exactly because it's the very thing
          that truly defines us.  To be human
          is to try to make yourself better
          than you are.

Picard looks at him deeply, relentlessly refusing to give up.

                     PICARD
          I know you as well as I know
          myself, Shinzon.  There was a time
          you looked at the stars and dreamed
          of what might be.

                     SHINZON
               (quietly)
          Long ago.

                     PICARD
          Not so long.

                     SHINZON
          Childish dreams, Captain.  Lost in
          the dilithium mines of Remus.  I'm
          what you see now.

                     PICARD
          I see more than what you are.

Picard steps toward him.

                     PICARD
          I see what you could be.

Shinzon slowly backs away as Picard continues to move toward
him relentlessly.

                     PICARD
          The man who is Jean Luc Picard and
          Shinzon of Remus won't exterminate
          the population of an entire planet!
          He is better than that!

                     SHINZON
               (desperate)
          He is what his life has made him!

Shinzon is in turmoil.  Picard senses this.  He proceeds
quietly:

                     PICARD
          And what will he do with that life?

Shinzon looks at him, questioning.

                     PICARD
          If I were to beam to your ship...
          let you complete your medical
          procedure, give you a full life...
          what would you do with the time?

Shinzon doesn't respond.

                     PICARD
          You once asked me about your past.
          Your history.  When I was your age,
          I burned with ambition.  I was very
          proud and my pride often hurt
          people.  I made every wrong choice
          a young man can... But one thing
          saved me... I had a father who
          believed in me.  Who took the time
          to teach me a better way.  You have
          the same father.

                     SHINZON
          Yes.

                     PICARD
          So if I gave you my life, what
          would you do with it?  Would you
          spend the years in a blaze of
          hatred as you are now?  Or could
          you change?  Could you try to
          remember a mother's touch you never
          felt?  A father's words you never
          heard?  Could you do that?

                     SHINZON
               (quietly)
          I don't know.

                     PICARD
          But you want to.

Shinzon doesn't respond.  But Picard knows he has made a
connection.  For this brief moment reconciliation is
possible.  He proceeds quietly:

                     PICARD
          Let me tell you about our father.

Shinzon looks at him with an aching sadness.  What might have
been.

                     SHINZON
          That's your life... not mine.

                     PICARD
          Please.

                     SHINZON
          It's too late.

                     PICARD
          You can still make a choice!  Make
          the right one now!

                     SHINZON
          I have no choices!  I can't fight
          what I am!

Shinzon backs away, unable to fight his nature:

                     SHINZON
          I'll show you my true nature.  Your
          nature.  And as Earth dies --
          remember that I'm forever Shinzon
          of Remus!  And my voice will echo
          through time long after yours has
          faded to a dim memory.

Shinzon ends the transmission and his holographic image
flickers and fades away.

Picard stands alone, drained.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon strides quickly to his command chair, barking to his
Viceroy:

                     SHINZON
          Disable their weapons!

But before the Viceroy can move the Scimitar suddenly ROCKS
-- attacked from somewhere!  Shinzon is stunned.

                     SHINZON
          Report!

                     REMAN OFFICER
          Two ships decloaking, sir!
          Romulan!

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard strides to his command chair as two Romulan Warbirds
appear on the viewscreen.  Deanna is now on the bridge.

                     RIKER
          Believe it or not, I think the
          cavalry has arrived.

                     WORF
          We're being hailed.

                     PICARD
          On screen.

On the viewscreen: Commander Donatra shimmers into view.

                     DONATRA (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          Captain Picard, Commander Donatra
          of the Warbird Valdore.  Might we
          be of assistance?

                     PICARD
          Your timing is impeccable,
          Commander.

                     DONATRA (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          The Empire considers this a matter
          of internal security.  We regret
          you've become involved.

                     PICARD
          When this is over, I owe you a
          drink.

On the viewscreen, the Valdore ROCKS from a disruptor blast.

                     DONATRA (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          Romulan ale, Captain.  Let's get to
          work.  Valdore out.

The transmission ends.

                     PICARD
               (to Worf)
          You heard the lady.  Get to work.
          Move your ass!

(The Romulan Warbirds must remain decloaked to fire weapons
and are visible throughout the battle.)

Although Shinzon's ship is still cloaked, the steady barrage
of triangulated phaser and disruptor fire from the Enterprise
and the two Romulan vessels illuminate its shields with
impacts.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

                     PICARD

                     WORF
          Aye, sir.

The Enterprise ROCKS from a photon torpedo impact --

                     DATA

          Keep our bow to the Scimitar.
          Auxiliary power to forward shields.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon sits quite calmly in his command chair.

                     SHINZON
          Target the flanking Warbird.  All
          forward disruptor banks on my mark.

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

It is a chaos of starships as the Enterprise and the two
Warbirds fire steadily -- illuminating the Scimitar's
shields.

The ships sweep around one another, maneuvering for position,
firing constantly.  The battlefield seems impossibly crowded
as the four vessels evade and attack; as phaser and disruptor
beams criss-cross space.

Then the Scimitar unleashes a devastating volley... all her
forward disruptor banks fire at once --

They literally cut one of the Romulan ships in half -- a huge
EXPLOSION -- debris SHOOTS across space and SLAMS VIOLENTLY
off the Enterprise's forward shields -- !

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The ship ROCKS dangerously!

                     DATA
          Forward shields are down to ten
          percent.

                     RIKER
               (to Helm)
          Bring us about!

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The Enterprise quickly turns about -- firing her aft phasers,
as the Valdore sweeps toward Shinzon's ship, firing --

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

                     SHINZON
          Let her pursue -- drop cloak on the
          aft port quadrant and prepare for
          full emergency stop.

                     VICEROY
               (startled)
          What?!

                     SHINZON
          You heard me.

INT.  VALDORE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Donatra leans forward in her command chair, looking at
viewscreen.  She sees part of the Scimitar's rear cloakning
fall away --

                     DONATRA
          She's losing her cloak!  Stand by
          all forward disruptor banks!

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

                     VICEROY
          She's almost on us.

                     SHINZON
          Not yet.

On the viewscreen  we see the Valdore in pursuit, gaining.
The Reman crew is getting nervous.

                     VICEROY
          Praetor...

                     SHINZON
          FULL STOP AND FIRE !

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The Scimitar LURCHES to a stop!  Too fast for the Valdore to
respond in time -- it flies over the Scimitar --

And the Scimitar fires!

A devastating volley of photon torpedoes rip into the
underbelly and aft of the Valdore as it streaks past --

The Valdore careens out of control and then slows to a stop.
It floats dead in space.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

                     SHINZON
          Restore the aft cloak.and bring us
          about.

He leans back in his command chair, ready for the final
battle.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

A bloody Commander Donatra is talking to Picard on
viewscreen.  Her bridge is in ruins.

                     DONATRA (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          I'm afraid that drink will have to
          wait, Captain.

                     PICARD
          Do you have life support?

                     DONATRA (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          For the moment.  But we're dead in
          the water.

                     PICARD
          Understood --

Then the ship ROCKS --

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The invisible Scimitar sweeps past for a particularly brutal
assault -- disruptor blasts streak along the Enterprise's
hull -- a huge, ripping series of explosions tear away
several decks of the Enterprise --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

                     DATA
          We have lost structural integrity
          on decks twelve through seventeen,
          sections four through ten.

                     GEORDI
          Emergency force fields are holding.

                     RIKER
          Evacuate those decks and reroute
          field power to forward shields.

Deanna goes to Picard:

                     DEANNA
          Captain -- I might have a way to
          find them.

                     PICARD
          Counselor?

                     DEANNA
          The one thing he may have forgotten
          in the course of battle: me.

                     PICARD
          Make it so.

She quickly goes to Worf at tactical.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - NIGHT

Shinzon is entering tactical commands in his chair console.

                     SHINZON
          Prepare a lateral run -- all
          starboard disruptors.

Then the viceroy suddenly stiffens, alarm in his eyes --

                     VICEROY
          No!

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Deanna concentrates furiously, eyes closed.  She stands with
Worf, her hand slowly moving his over the photon torpedo
targeting display.

It is a wrenching experience as she probes with her thoughts.

                     DEANNA
          He's resisting me.

She is in pain.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The Viceroy concentrates, trying to block her probing
thoughts.

                     SHINZON
          What is it?!  Focus on your job!!!

                     VICEROY
          She is here.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Deanna continues to move Worf's hand over the targeting
display.  She is sweating, panting for breath, concentrating
fiercely.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The Viceroy resists her -- their psyches lock in battle.
Deanna appears in the Viceroy's mind, she glares at him.

                     DEANNA
          Remember me?

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Her eyes snap open --

                     DEANNA
          NOW!

Worf instantly fires a full volley of photon torpedoes.

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

A full spread of photon torpedoes shoot through space.

And connect!  A series of devastating impacts -- and the
Scimitar's cloak fails!

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard stands quickly.

                     PICARD
          Savage them!

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

And the Enterprise attacks!

It fires all weapons simultaneously -- phasers and photon
torpedoes slam into the Scimitar!  Shinzon's ship responds
quickly -- maneuvering for position and returning fire!

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The bridge has been damaged, sparks sputter through the
darkness and debris litters the deck.

Shinzon eyes reflect a growing sense of desperation.

                     SHINZON
               (spinning to his Viceroy)
          Prepare a boarding party -- BRING
          ME PICARD!

The viceroy strides out as Shinzon spins to another officer.

                     SHINZON
          Get the cloak back!  And target
          shield coordinates beta three.  All
          disruptors.  Fire!

On the viewscreen, we see disruptor beams focusing on a tiny
part of the Enterprise's lower shields, slamming into them.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - NIGHT

                     DATA
          Captain, we have lost ventral
          shielding on deck twenty nine.

                     PICARD
          Divert power and compensate --

An alarm klaxon suddenly rings through the bridge.

                     WORF
          Intruder alert!

                     RIKER
          Let's go.

Riker and Worf quickly head toward the turbolift as:

                     WORF
               (to comm)
          Security detail to deck twenty
          nine.

Data immediately assumes Worf's position at tactical.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - LOWER DECKS - NIGHT

Riker and Worf stride with a SECURITY DETAIL through the
cramped lower decks.

A sudden disruptor blast stops them cold!  The Viceroy and
his invasion force of a dozen Reman Warriors are down the
corridor!

The Enterprise crew returns fire.  It is a blazing phaser
battle, Worf leading his men with Klingon courage.  They
steadily advance in the face of the blistering disruptor
fire --

They are getting the upper hand when Riker sees the Viceroy
escape into a Jefferies tube --

                     RIKER
          Worf.

Worf instantly dives into the corridor -- landing hard and
sliding forward on his stomach all the while firing a steady
burst from his phaser rifle.

Riker uses the cover to dive after the Viceroy, following him
into the dark Jefferies tube, intent on destroying the man
who has been tormenting his wife --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The Scimitar sweeps into view on the viewscreen -- filling
the screen -- and launches a ferocious volley of photon
torpedoes.

A huge EXPLOSION as the viewscreen and some of the forward
bridge are BLOWN APART -- the Helm Officer is SUCKED INTO
SPACE before a flickering emergency force field springs into
position --

Deanna races to assume the helm --

Picard can now see his enemy directly through the gaping hole
in the ship's hull -- he sees the Scimitar banking for
another attack run as part of the ship disappears --

                     GEORDI
          He's getting his cloak back.  We
          have exhausted our compliment of
          photon torpedoes.  Phaser banks are
          down to four percent.

                     PICARD
          What if we target all phasers in a
          concentrated attack?

                     DATA
          The Scimitar's shields are still at
          seventy percent.  It would make no
          difference, sir.

Picard thinks.

                     DEANNA
          They're stopping...

Through the hole in the hull, Picard sees the Scimitar slowly
turning.  Slowly advancing.  They see another part of the
Scimitar disappear, the cloak returning.

                     GEORDI
          What's he doing?

                     PICARD
               (grim)
          He wants to look me in the eye.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - JEFFERIES TUBE - FOLLOWING

Below decks, Riker stalks the Viceroy through a labyrinthine
series of access tunnels.  It is like a scene from ALIEN.

The flickering half-light and red emergency strobes of the
crippled ship make this an ominous sequence.  The Viceroy is
in his element, used to the perpetual night of the Reman
Homeworld, he can see in the dark.

Riker moves through the darkness, hunting for the Viceroy.
He stops, phaser ready.  He peers into the dark tunnel ahead
of him.  Sees nothing.  We tilt up and see...

The Viceroy clinging to the ceiling directly above Riker!
Hidden in the darkness.  The Viceroy attacks! -- diving down
on Riker -- his lethal Reman knife slashing through the
darkness --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard stands... watching the Scimitar maneuver into
position.  Large parts of it are now cloaked.

It stops.  Only a few hundred yards from the Enterprise, its
great prow almost filling the gaping hole at the front of the
bridge.

Picard thinks, his mind racing.  Then it comes to him in a
flash:

                     PICARD
          He thinks he knows exactly what I'm
          going to do...

                     GEORDI
          Sir?

                     PICARD
          We've got him!

He sits in his command chair and begins quickly entering
command instructions in his chair console.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon, supremely confident, leans back in his command
chair.

                     SHINZON
          Open a channel.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard is still entering commands in his chair console.

                     DATA
          We are being hailed.

                     PICARD
          Deanna, stand by.
               (to Data)
          Open a channel.

                     SHINZON (V.O.)
          I hope you're still alive, Jean
          Luc.

                     PICARD
          I am.

                     SHINZON (V.O.)
          Don't you think it's time to
          surrender?  I'll have my cloak back
          in a matter of minutes and your
          poor ship is shot to pieces.  Why
          should the rest of your crew have
          to die?

Picard continues to enter command codes -- transmits them to
Deanna at helm -- she receives the commands, nods.  All of
this as Picard buys some time:

                     PICARD
          I never told you about my first
          Academy evaluation, did I?  I
          received very high marks for my
          studies.  But I was found lacking
          in certain other areas.
          Personality traits, you might say.
          In particular I was thought to be
          extremely...
               (he glares up at the prow
                of the Scimitar)
          ... over-confident.

Picard indicates for Data to end the communication.  Then:

                     PICARD
               (quickly)
          Geordi, put 211 power to the
          engines.  Take it from life support
          if you have to -- everything you
          can give me.

                     GEORDI
          Aye, sir.

                     PICARD
          Deanna, on my mark.

                     GEORDI
          Ready, sir!

Picard leans forward in his chair:

                     PICARD
               (on comm)
          All hands, brace for impact!
               (to Deanna)
          ENGAGE.

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The Enterprise powers forward in a final thrust -- !

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon sees it coming -- utterly shocked -- bolts up --

                     SHINZON
          HARD TO PORT !

Too late.

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

A massive COLLISION as the Enterprise SLAMS into the Scimitar
-- as it SMASHES and GRINDS into Shinzon's ship --

The Scimitar REELS --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Everyone goes FLYING!

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The two great ships are now locked together, slowly rotating
in space.

The forward part of the Enterprise's saucer is enmeshed in
Shinzon's ship; two scorpions with their claws locked.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon stands in the ruins of his bridge.  Many of his
bridge crew are now dead.

                     SHINZON
          Divert all power to engines.  Full
          reverse!

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

Every part of the Enterprise ROCKS -- a great lurch as the
Scimitar begins to tear itself free -- backing away -- a
deafening shriek of metal -- both ships are being torn to
pieces in the process -- but it is working -- the Scimitar
is ripping free, wrenching itself loose.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - JEFFERIES TUBES - FOLLOWING

The Jefferies tube SHUDDERS as the Scimitar continues to tear
itself free -- Riker and the Viceroy careen through the tube.
The Viceroy recovers quickly and coils for a final attack.
Riker sees that an access plate has been loosened in the
collision -- he desperately rips it away -- knowing the
relays behind will provide him with the advantage he needs --

Bright light strobes from the relays and the Viceroy is
momentarily blinded -- Riker uses this opportunity to attack!
He dives forward -- slamming into the Viceroy -- they both
tumble into a long, vertical access tunnel -- they fall!

Riker shoots out a hand and grabs a ladder -- the Viceroy,
grabs onto Riker, his talons digging into his uniform -- a
long drop below them!

Riker forces the Viceroy's head back -- away from him -- a
brutal struggle --

Riker glares at him.

                     RIKER
          Don't worry -- Hell is dark.

Riker uses every ounce of strength he has left -- pushes the
Viceroy off him --

The Viceroy falls down the long tunnel -- to his death.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The whole Enterprise bridge QUAKES as the Scimitar continues
to pull itself free --

Picard stands, steadying himself on his command chair.

                     PICARD
          Data, I need you.

Data joins Picard as:

                     PICARD
          Computer.  Auto-destruct sequence
          Omega.  Zero time delay.  Recognize
          voice pattern Jean Luc Picard.
          Authorization Alpha Alpha Three
          Zero Five --

                     COMPUTER (V.O.)
          Auto-destruct is off-line.

Then the ship gives a final LURCH.  The Scimitar is free.

An eerie moment of silence after the explosive tearing and
grinding.

Picard watches through the gaping hole in the hull as the
Scimitar backs away.  Another section of the Scimitar
disappears.  Shinzon almost has his cloak back.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon stares at the Enterprise.

A wave of sickness overcomes him for a moment, he doubles
over.  We actually see more veins appearing on his face.
Time is running out.

                     SHINZON
          Target disruptors.  Destroy them.

                     REMAN OFFICER
          Disruptors are off-line, sir.

A beat.  Shinzon looks up.

                     SHINZON
          Deploy the weapon.  Kill everything
          on that ship.  Then set a course
          for Earth.

                     REMAN OFFICER
          What about Picard?

                     SHINZON
          Our greater goal is more important,
          brother.

                     REMAN OFFICER
          But, Praetor, you won't survive
          without him...

Shinzon gazes at the Enterprise on the viewscreen.

                     SHINZON
          Some ideals are worth dying for,
          aren't they, Jean Luc?

EXT.  RIFT - SPACE

The entire Scimitar slowly begins to unfold.  Like a gigantic
version of the small spider-weapon we saw kill the Romulan
Senators before, legs appear and hoist up a savage weapon.
The Cascading Pulse.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard and the others watch the monstrous Cascading Pulse
weapon slowly deploying.

                     PICARD
          How long until he can fire?

                     GEORDI
          The targeting sequence should take
          about four minutes.

                     DEANNA
          But how can he?  He'll kill you.

                     PICARD
          This isn't about me anymore.

Picard's face is set, resolute.  He knows what he must do.
Picard grabs a phaser rifle from a weapons locker as...

                     PICARD
          Prepare for a site-to-site
          transport.

                     GEORDI
               (concerned)
          Sir, we won't be able to bring you
          back.  It's a one way trip.
          Captain, I don't know if the
          transporter --

                     PICARD
          That's an order, Commander.

                     DATA
          Sir, allow me to go.  You are
          needed here.

                     PICARD
          Negative.

                     DATA
          Sir...

Deanna takes Data's arm.  Looks at him.  She knows this is
something Picard must do himself.

                     DEANNA
          Let him go.

Picard powers up the phaser rifle as:

                     PICARD
               (to Data)
          You have the bridge, Commander.
          Use all available power to move
          away from the Scimitar.
               (to Geordi)
          Now, Mister La Forge.

                     GEORDI
          Aye, sir.

Geordi nervously works some controls on his console and
Picard dematerializes.  Then the transporter panel explodes
in a shower of sparks.

                     GEORDI
          That's it.  Transporters are down.

Data thinks for a moment.  Then:

                     DATA
          Counsellor Troi, please assume
          command.  Geordi, if you will come
          with me.

He heads toward the turbolift, Geordi following.

INT.  SCIMITAR - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Several Remen warriors in the corridor turn and fire.  Riker
returns fire, a series of lightning fast pulses from his
phaser rifle.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - FORWARD CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Data and Geordi stand in a long corridor.  The far end of the
corridor opens to space.  An emergency force field is in
place at the end of the corridor.

Geordi operates a tricorder and another force field flickers
on around him.

Data looks toward the end of the corridor, readying himself.

                     DATA
          What is our approximate distance?

                     GEORDI
               (scans with tricorder)
          400 meters.

                     DATA
          Thank you.

Data backs up a little more   He looks at Geordi again.
Deeply.

                     DATA
          Thank you, Geordi.  Deactivate the
          field.

Geordi operates his tricorder and the force field at the end
of the corridor snaps off --

The void of space fills the corridor and Data takes a running
start -- he races down the long corridor and leaps --

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

-- into space.

He floats toward the Scimitar, his momentum carrying him.
Carrying him too far!

He is going to miss the Scimitar -- almost past it now!  He
thrusts out a hand --

And just misses a piece of dangling wreckage!  Data is
floating helplessly through space.  Doomed.  Then he SLAMS
into an invisible piece of the partially cloaked on the ship!

He grabs onto the invisible part of the ship and pulls
himself up to the hull.  He rips open an access panel with
his superior strength and climbs inside.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - NIGHT

Shinzon stands, his eyes glued to the Enterprise on the
viewscreen.

We see a monitor showing that the Cascading Pulse weapon is
locked on the Enterprise.

Most of the light on the shattered bridge now comes from the
three steadily pulsing warp core relays which soar up through
the floor.

                     COMPUTER (V.O)
          Forty-seven.  Forty six...

Suddenly -- a MASSIVE BLAST as the doors to the bridge
explode in.  Shinzon spins to see --

Picard framed in the doorway, phaser rifle ready.

Picard instantly fires for the Cascading Pulse control -- but
Shinzon dives to cover it -- the phaser blast hits Shinzon in
the chest -- he recoils, slamming to the deck, stunned.

The few remaining Remans on the bridge spin to Picard, firing
disruptors -- Picard dives for cover and battles them with
his phaser rifle --

He succeeds in stunning the Remans but a final disruptor
blast knocks Picard to the deck -- the phaser rifle spins
away --

                     COMPUTER (V.O.)
          Twenty nine... Twenty eight...

Shinzon pulls himself up and races to snatch up a disruptor
from a fallen comrade --

As Picard leaps up, grabbing a piece of wreckage, a long
metal rod -- Picard thrusts it forward like a spear --

Impaling Shinzon.

A stunned moment of silence as Shinzon gazes at Picard,
almost with a look of disbelief.  Blood spews from his mouth
as he lets out a tormented cry.

And then, amazingly, Shinzon forces himself forward --
pushing Picard back against a wall -- Shinzon slowly walks
toward Picard, forcing himself down the length of the spear
-- the spear point explodes through Shinzon's back -- the
weight of Shinzon's body is pinning Picard against the wall
-- time is running out --

                     COMPUTER (V.O.)
          Eighteen... Seventeen...

Shinzon forces himself down the spear:

                     SHINZON
          I'm glad we're together now -- our
          destiny is complete.

He finally thrusts himself down the whole spear and clasps
his dying hands firmly around Picard's throat --

                     COMPUTER (V.O.)
          Ten...Nine...

Data sprints to the bridge --

He instantly tears open his wrist and pulls out the small,
silver disc we saw earlier -- the Emergency Transport Unit --
he slaps it on Picard's shoulder.  A final look between
them --
                     COMPUTER (V.O.)
          Seven..  Six...

Data activates the ETU -- Picard dematerializes.

Data looks at the space where Picard was and says simply:

                     DATA
          Goodbye.

Then he spins and pulls out his phaser --

And fires point-blank into the Scimitar's warp core relays --
the bridge explodes -- Data is incinerated --

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The Scimitar BLASTS APART in a massive flash --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard re-materializes.

He sees the brilliant flash from the explosion through the
gaping hole in the front of the bridge.

Deanna sits at helm, her face a mask of pain.  Geordi stands
on the upper rear deck, head down.

A long beat as Picard just stands on his ruined bridge, the
thousand-yard stare of a combat veteran in his eyes.

Riker emerges from the turbolift.  Goes to Picard.

                     RIKER
          Sir?

Picard doesn't answer, he just stares forward.  Deanna goes
to Riker.

                     DEANNA
          Data.

Riker looks toward the glowing debris field in the distance.
He puts an arm around Deanna.

Silence.

                     GEORDI
          Sir, we're being hailed.

                     PICARD
          On screen...
               (he remembers there is no
                longer a viewscreen)
          ... Open a channel.

                     DONATRA (V.O.)
          This is Commander Donatra of the
          Valdore.  We're dispatching
          shuttles with medical personnel and
          supplies.

                     PICARD
          Thank you, Commander.

The transmission ends.

                     PICARD
               (flat)
          Geordi... prepare the shuttlebay
          for arrivals.  They don't know our
          procedures so just... open the
          doors.

                     GEORDI
          I'll take care of it, sir.

                     PICARD
          Number One.
               (a beat)
          You have the bridge.

He turns and heads toward his Ready Room.

The others watch him go with great sadness.

When the Ready Room doors close behind Picard, Deanna finally
allows herself to cry.  Riker holds her closely.  Slow fade
to...

INT.  ENTERPRISE - CREW LOUNGE - NIGHT

Hours later.  The senior crew is solemnly gathered in the
shattered remains of the crew lounge.  Picard, Riker, Deanna,
Beverly, Worf, Geordi.

They wear their dress uniforms.

Picard goes to each of them.  He carries a small, metal box.
They each take something from the box.

At first we, don't quite see what they are doing.  Then we
realize they are affixing black bars to the collars of their
uniforms.

Mourning bands.

Picard pours six glasses of his precious Chateau Picard.
Each takes a glass.

Picard raises his glass.

                     PICARD
          To absent friends... o family.

They toast Data.  Slow fade to...

INT.  ENTERPRISE - PICARD'S CABIN - NIGHT

Picard sits at his desk, speaking quietly to someone we do
not see.

                     PICARD
          I don't know if all this has made
          sense to you, but I wanted you to
          know what kind of man he was.  In
          his quest to be more like us, he
          helped show us what it means to be
          human.

We see it is the now re-activated B-9 sitting across from
him.

                     B-9
          My brother was not a human.

                     PICARD
          No, he wasn't... But his wonder and
          his curiosity about every facet of
          human life helped all of us see the
          best parts of ourselves.  He
          embraced change... because he
          always wanted to be more than he
          was.

                     B-9
          I do not understand.

                     PICARD
          Well, I hope someday you will.

Worf interrupts on comm:

                     WORF (V.O.) (ON COMM)
          Captain, the Hemingway has arrived
          to tow us to spacedock.

                     PICARD
          On my way.  Please notify Commander
          Riker...
               (he stands, prepares to
                go)
          ... We'll talk later?

The B-9 does not respond.  He is looking rather blankly at
the padd on Picard's desk.

Picard begins to leave when a sound stops him... humming.  He
turns back to the B-9.

The B-9 is still looking blankly at the padd... but he's
humming lightly to himself... then he begins to sing, very
softly...

                     B-9
          "Blue skies, smiling at me, Nothing
          but blue skies do I see."

Then the B-9 is silent.

Picard watches him for a moment; great emotion playing over
his features, and then goes.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Picard and Riker head toward a turbolift... making their way
past the debris littering the corridor.

                     PICARD
          I'm sorry you won't be here for the
          re-fit, but I know the Titan needs
          you immediately.

Riker does not respond.

Picard stops, looks at Riker deeply.

                     PICARD
          The Titan's a fine ship, Will.  And
          she's getting a captain worthy of
          her.

                     RIKER
          She's the most beautiful ship I've
          ever seen.
               (he touches a wall of the
                corridor)
          ... But she's not the Enterprise.

                     PICARD
          I promise you in time, she'll
          become your home... If I could
          offer you one piece of advice?

                     RIKER
          Anything.

                     PICARD
          When your first officer insists
          that you can't go on away
          missions... Ignore him --

                     RIKER
               (smiles)
          I intend to.

A moment.

                     RIKER
               (with difficulty)
          Serving with you has been an honor.

                     PICARD
          The honor was mine.  Captain Riker.

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - SPACEDOCK - OVER EARTH

A few weeks later.  The Enterprise is enclosed in the great
womb of a spacedock.  The ship is being rebuilt.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - NIGHT

A fresh-faced young officer, COMMANDER MARTIN MADDEN, paces
nervously outside Picard's Ready Room.  Bracing himself
before entering.

Behind him we can see technicians working everywhere around
the bridge, trying to rebuild it.  Worf is talking to a young
officer at tactical and Geordi is working at the engineering
station.  We also see new command chairs being installed.

(Although we do not see it in this scene, the gaping hole at
the front of the bridge has not yet been repaired.)

A young Andorian woman, the new OPS OFFICER, smiles at
Madden's nervousness.  Her antennae twitch slightly in
amusement.  He sees her.

                     MADDEN
          So... what's the old man like?

                     OPS OFFICER
          Why don't you go in and find out?

Commander Madden prepares himself.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - READY ROOM - FOLLOWING

Picard is talking to Beverly on viewscreen.  She is in her
new office at Starfleet Medical.

                     BEVERLY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          You can't imagine them, Jean Luc.
          They're kids!  All with advance
          degrees in xenobiology and out to
          conquer every disease in the
          quadrant.

                     PICARD
               (smiles)
          Reminds me of a young doctor I used
          to know...

                     BEVERLY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          They're running me ragged.  Nothing
          but questions day and night... I
          love it!  Come to dinner and I'll
          tell you all about it.  There's a
          Bajoran band at the officer's mess.

                     PICARD
          Not tonight, I have work here.

                     BEVERLY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          Soon then.  I'll save the last
          dance for you.

Commander Madden enters quickly -- he did not use the door
chime so Picard is surprised.

                     MADDEN
          Commander Martin Madden reporting
          for duty, sir.

Picard stands, they shake hands as:

                     PICARD
          Welcome aboard, Commander.  I hope,
          your transfer didn't come as too
          much of a surprise.

                     MADDEN
          I was... honored, sir.

                     PICARD
          I needed you immediately to help
          oversee the re-fit...
               (gathering up some padds
                from his desk)
          ... Your service record on the
          Talos is exemplary, but there are a
          few things I would like to discuss
          with you regarding my requirements
          for a First Officer.  Shall we say
          dinner in my quarters at 1900
          hours?

                     MADDEN
          Very good, sir.

Picard heads toward the door, carrying a few padds.

                     PICARD
          Commander, I don't know how they
          did it on the Talos, but we have
          door chimes on the Enterprise.  We
          use them.

                     MADDEN
          Yes, sir.  Sorry, sir.

Picard goes to the bridge, Madden following...

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

They emerge to the bridge as Worf is arguing with the cocky
young ENSIGN busy installing Picard's new high-tech command
chair.

                     WORF
          You don't understand the Captain --
          there should be no changes until we
          have discussed the modifications
          with him.

Picard goes to them:

                     PICARD
          What's this?

                     WORF
               (grumbles)
          Your new chair, sir.

                     ENSIGN
          It's the Mark Seven, Captain.
          State-of-the-art ergonomics...
          command interfaces with --

                     WORF
          I told him you're comfortable with
          your old chair.

                     PICARD
          Let's give it a try.

He settles into his new command chair.  Looks around for a
beat at his new bridge crew.  Fresh-faced kids.  A new
generation to teach and nurture.  He smiles.

                     PICARD
          Feels good.

Worf and Geordi exchange a look, surprised.

                     ENSIGN
               (points)
          Try that button, sir.

Picard presses a button on the chair and -- zip -- metal
restraints fly into position around his waist and shoulders.
Seatbelts!  Picard is surprised.

A beat.

Then Picard smiles.

                     PICARD
          It's about time.

He presses the button again and the restraints zip back into
the body of the chair.  He is delighted.  He turns to Madden:

                     PICARD
          Commander, please sit down...

Madden sits in the First Officer's chair, Picard shares a
padd with him.

                     PICARD
          ... We've received our first
          assignment.  We're going to be
          exploring the Denab system.  It
          should be exciting.  It's a
          place... where no one has gone
          before.

And we cut to --

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - SPACEDOCK - OVER EARTH - FOLLOWING

Through the hole in the hull we see Picard talking to Madden.
Picard at work, at peace.  Where he is meant to be.

We slowly pull back from Picard and the Enterprise.  As we
hear the B-9's soft tones.  Gentle.  Hopeful.

                     B-9 (V.O.)
          "Never saw the sun shining so
          bright, Never saw things going so
          right.  Noticing the days hurrying
          by, When you're in love, my how
          they fly.  Blue days, all of them
          gone, Nothing but blue skies from
          now on."

We revolve away from the Enterprise and Earth toward the
stars.  Then ZOOM forward into the cosmos as the rousing
"Next Generation" theme explodes over END CREDITS.

                                                FADE OUT.

                          John Logan

































FADE IN:

INT.  MEDICAL MONTAGE - DAY

Life.  Glorious in its many forms.  The biological pulse
finding its way heroically through the cold manipulation of
science.

CREDITS as we see a beautiful montage of futuristic medical
technology.  Through a microscope we see cells multiplying
and gene strands exponentially increasing with the vibrancy
of exploding flowers.  We see laser splicing and biological
manipulation on the molecular level.

CREDITS continue as we fade to...

INT.  ROMULAN SENATE CHAMBER - NIGHT

Politics... In a cavernous, shadowy chamber.  Dark figures
lean together and talk seriously.  Their hushed, urgent tones
denote the gravity of their discussion.

We can't make out the words but there is no doubt what they
are talking about.

The three year old HUMAN BOY who stands before them.  The boy
is alone and frightened, lost in the sweeping grandeur of
the massive chamber.

CREDITS continue as we fade to...

EXT.  REMAN HOMEWORLD - NIGHT

Labor...

On a stark, desert planet with monolithic mountains and harsh
crags shooting upward.  The only light in this dark
netherworld comes from the flames that accompany the hellish
mining operations everywhere around us.

The human boy gazes over this desolate vista and then he
looks up for a moment... at the stars.

Then a tall figure leads him firmly into one of the mines.
The boy seems to disappear into this flaming crucible.
CREDITS end as we go to...

EXT.  ROMULUS - SUNSET

The sun is setting on the capital city of the great Romulan
Star Empire, The imperial monoliths and martial towers of
this bustling city glow red as the sun dips below the
horizon.

We slowly move down toward the most imposing building of the
city.  The Romulan Senate chamber.

INT.  ROMULAN SENATE CHAMBER - SUNSET

SENATOR TAL'AURA watches the proceedings with a studied look
of bored indifference.  She glances to the familiar Romulan
crest that dominates one wall of the chamber: a ferocious
bird-of-prey holding two planets, one in either claw.

And then her eyes carefully cross the chamber to...

PRAETOR HIREN -- the head of the Romulan government --
presiding over the Senate from a throne-like chair.  He is a
capable politician in his 50s.

                     SENATOR 1
          ... but if we hesitate we'll lose
          this important source of dilithium.
          A trade agreement is in the best
          interests of the Empire.

                     SENATOR 2
          Praetor, I recommend we dispatch a
          diplomatic mission to Celes II to
          open negotiations.

Senator Tal'Aura grunts slightly at the word "negotiations."
Praetor Hiren glances to her.

                     PRAETOR
          Senator Tal'Aura, you disagree with
          the motion.

                     TAL'AURA
          No, sir.  I would say "negotiation"
          is to be advised.  I support all
          "diplomatic" overtures.  But if you
          will excuse me, Praetor, I have an
          appointment with the Tholian
          ambassador.

The Praetor nods.  Tal'Aura stands and leaves the chamber...
but she had left something behind on her desk.  A small,
silver box with unusual etchings on the surface.

The discussion continues as we focus on the silver box...

                     PRAETOR
          Then I will call for a vote on the
          motion to open trade negotiations
          with Celes II...

The Senator at the desk next to Tal'Aura's glances over.  The
silver box is moving.

The Senator watches, amazed, as the box begins to slowly fold
open.  Then "legs" appear.  The box unfolds like a spider,
standing on its legs.  Then it is still for a moment.  The
Senator looks at it, puzzled.

Suddenly -- a bright beam of green light shoots up from the
spider -- the Senators are stunned -- the beam shoots to the
high domed ceiling of the chamber and then cascades around
the interior of the room, enveloping everything in a glowing
shroud of green energy.  In a way, it is bizarrely beautiful.

And then just as suddenly the light disappears.

A moment of silence.  The Praetor and Senators are baffled.

                     PRAETOR
          Would someone please tell me what
          that was?
               (he turns to a guard)
          Alert security --

A plant behind the Praetor begins to shrivel...

                     PRAETOR
          -- and have them run a --

The Praetor stops suddenly -- as the flesh begins to melt
from his face.

Every bit of organic matter in the chamber decays.  Flesh
melts from bones while the Senators scream in agony.  Every
living thing in the chamber is dead within ten seconds.

A stunning moment of silence as we take in the carnage.  Then
a transporter effect ripples around the spider-weapon.  It
disappears.

And the Romulan Senate is no more.  We fade to...

EXT.  EARTH, ALASKA - PAVILION - DAY

JEAN LUC PICARD, the most beloved and respected Captain in
Starfleet.

His face is resolute and set.  Even stern.  His white dress
uniform is buttoned tightly to the neck.

He looks at us evenly and then utters the word that has been
the watch cry for his entire life as a Starfleet officer.

                     PICARD
          Duty...

He lets the word resonate and then continues.

                     PICARD
          A starship captain's life is filled
          with solemn duty.  I have commanded
          men in battle.  I have negotiated
          peace treaties between implacable
          enemies.  I have represented the
          Federation in first contact with
          twenty-seven alien species.  But
          none of this compares to my solemn
          duty as... Best man.

Uproarious laughter.  We pull back to reveal the wedding
reception of WILL RIKER and DEANNA TROI.

The Enterprise CREW is gathered with invited GUESTS, some
from other "Star Trek" series.  Riker and Deanna sit at the
center of a long table.

                     PICARD
          Now, I know that on an occasion
          such as this: it is expected that I
          be gracious and fulsome with praise
          on the wonders of this blessed
          union... But have you two
          considered what you're doing to?
          This is all a damned
          inconvenience...
               (laughter from the crowd)
          While you're happily settling in on
          the Titan, I'll have to train a new
          first officer; no doubt a stern
          martinet who'll quote the rule book
          at me and never... ever... allow me
          to go on away missions.
               (laughter)
          ... Then there's the matter of my
          new counselor.  Undoubtedly some
          soft-spoken, willowy thing who'll
          be probing into my darkest psyche
          as she nods her head and coos
          sympathetically.  Isn't that right,
          Deanna?

Deanna nods her head and coos sympathetically.  Hearty,
wonderful LAUGHTER!

                     PICARD
          I notice Dr. Crusher laughing along
          with the rest of you.  As most of
          you know, the doctor will also soon
          be leaving the Enterprise, to
          assume command of Starfleet
          Medical.  Again, I'm forced to ask,
          Beverly, have you considered what
          you're doing to little ole' me?!
          I'll probably get some old battle-
          axe of a doctor who'll tell me to
          eat my vegetables and put me on
          report if I don't show up for my
          physical on time!

                     BEVERLY
          It'll serve you right.

Laughter, laughter, laughter!  He looks to Riker and Deanna:

                     PICARD
          Really, it's not too late to
          reconsider.  No?  Very well then...

He smiles and raises his glass, looks at them deeply.

                     PICARD
          Will Riker, you have been my
          trusted right arm for fourteen
          years; you have helped keep my
          course true and steady.  Deanna
          Troi, you have been my conscience
          and best guide, the touchstone to
          the better parts of myself.  You
          are my family.  And in proper
          maritime tradition I wish you full
          sails and a clear horizon... My
          friends, make it so.

They drink.

EXT.  EARTH, ALASKA - PAVILION - LATER

The party guests mingle as a band plays.  We are at a
beautiful open-air pavilion high in the Denali Mountains.
The soaring ranges of Riker's native Alaska can be seen
everywhere around us.

DR. BEVERLY CRUSHER goes to Picard.

                     BEVERLY
               (playfully)
          Sort of like losing a son and
          gaining an empath, isn't it?

                     PICARD
          Please, Beverly, this is hard
          enough.

                     BEVERLY
          If you start tearing up I promise
          to beam you out.  Level one medical
          emergency.  There's no crying in
          Starfleet.

They head off toward Riker and Deanna.

Meanwhile, GEORDI LA FORGE sits with his girlfriend.

                     LEAH
          I've never seen your Captain so
          nostalgic.  Maybe he's getting soft
          in his old age.

                     GEORDI
               (laughs)
          Not likely.  After we installed the
          new Series Four replicators, he
          tried to order his usual tea and
          there was a glitch.  Had us remove
          the whole bunch of them and put the
          old ones back in.

                     LEAH
          There!  Nostalgic about old
          replicators.

                     GEORDI
          He just likes things the way he
          likes them...
               (he looks at her, smiles)
          Of course, so do I.

He kisses her gently as WORF comes to them.  Poor Worf is
still suffering a bit from the bachelor party.  He plops down
beside them, belches.

                     WORF
          Romulan ale should be illegal.

                     GEORDI
          It is, old chum.

                     WORF
          Then it should be more illegal.

He groans and rests his head on the table, acts like he's
going to heave.  Meanwhile, Riker and Deanna are talking to
Picard and Beverly.

                     DEANNA
          Really, Captain, it was a lovely
          toast.

                     PICARD
          The least I could do for you,
          Deanna.  Besides, you know me...
          I'm a talking head.

                     DEANNA
          And you needn't worry.  I'll brief
          your new counselor on everything
          she needs to know.

                     PICARD
          The hell you will.  You know too
          much about me as it is... Now you
          promised there are no speeches
          during the ceremony on Betazed.

                     RIKER
          No, no speeches.  No clothes
          either.
               (winks, mischievously)

Picard looks at him.  Deanna laughs.

Then the band stops playing.  All turn.

DATA stands with the band.

                     DATA
          Ladies and Gentlemen and invited
          Tran gendered species... In my
          study of Terran and Betazoid
          conjugal rites I have discovered it
          is traditional to present the
          "happy couple" with a gift.  Given
          Commander Riker's affection for
          archaic musical forms I have
          elected to present the following as
          my gift in honor of their
          conjugation.

Riker shoots an amused glance to Deanna.  Conjugation?

Data turns to the band leader.

                     DATA
          If you please, Mister Band Leader,
          a-one and a-two and...

The band launches into a jaunty, swing version of the Irving
Berlin standard "Blue Skies."

                     DATA
               (sings)
          "Blue skies, smiling at me, Nothing
          but blue skies do I see.  Blue
          birds, singing a song, Nothing but
          blue birds all day long.  Never saw
          the sun shining so bright, Never
          saw things going so right..."

The crowd is appreciative.  Loves the song.  Except Worf, he
momentarily raises his head from the table.

                     WORF
               (groans)
          Ugghhh... Irving Berlin.

His heads thumps down again, is about ready to BARF!
Meanwhile, Riker is anxious as a kid to join the band:

                     DEANNA
               (smiles)
          All right, go ahead.

Riker eagerly joins the band.  Grabs the trombone and starts
jamming with the orchestra.  The song really swings.

                     PICARD
               (to Deanna)
          May I have this dance?

                     DEANNA
          With pleasure, Captain.

Meanwhile, Geordi leads Leah to the dance floor as well.
Beverly goes to Worf.

                     BEVERLY
          Commander Worf... Do Klingons
          swing?

                     WORF
          I am not a swinger.  I am unwell.

                     BEVERLY
          Don't worry, I'm a doctor.

She pulls him to the dance floor as:

                     BEVERLY
          I'm so glad you made it back to the
          Enterprise before I left.

                     WORF
          I was not suited for the life of
          a... diplomat.

                     BEVERLY
               (wry)
          Who'd have guessed?

They dance.  Picard and Deanna sweep past them.

And we pull up and away as Data continues to sing and the
crew dances.  It is a joyous celebration of these people.

This family.  A family we love.

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - SPACE

The Enterprise streaks through space.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - CREW LOUNGE - NIGHT

Data sits in the empty Crew Lounge.

As always, the android's placid, neutral expression still
somehow manages to convey his wonder, curiosity and
idiosyncratic zest for life.

Picard arrives with a very old bottle of wine.

                     PICARD
          I've been saving this.  Chateau
          Picard 2267.  Batten down the
          hatches...

He carefully uncorks the treasured bottle as:

                     PICARD
          They say a vintner's history is in
          every glass.  The soil he came
          from.  His past as well as his
          hopes for the future.

He pours two glasses of the wine, then raises his glass, a
toast.

                     PICARD
          So... To happy endings.

                     DATA
          To happy endings.

Picard carefully takes a tiny sip, savors the flavor, finally
swallows.  Enjoys it.  Ahhh.

Data mimics Picard.  Taking a tiny sip, savoring the flavor
and finally swallowing.  Ahhh.

                     DATA
          Sir.  I noticed an interesting
          confluence of emotion at the
          wedding.  I am familiar with the
          human concept of tears through
          laughter and its inverse, laughter
          through tears, but I could not help
          wondering about the human capacity
          for expressing both pleasure and
          sadness simultaneously.

                     PICARD
          I understand why it would seem
          confusing.  Certain human rituals --
          like weddings, birthdays or
          funerals evoke strong and very
          complex emotions.  These rites
          carry great weight with us because
          they denote the passage of time.

                     DATA
          And you were particularly aware of
          this feeling because Commander
          Riker will be leaving to assume
          command of the Titan?

                     PICARD
          Will and Deanna joining the Titan.
          Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet
          Medical...

                     DATA
          And this makes you "sad"?

                     PICARD
          Well.  I suppose it does a bit.
          I'm very happy for them, of course,
          but I'm going to miss them.  The
          ship will seem... incomplete
          without them.

                     DATA
          That is because you have a
          familiarity with them.  You can
          predict specific reactions and
          behavior and are comfortable in
          that knowledge.

                     PICARD
          Yes.  And, frankly, I envy them as
          well.  They've made important
          choices; they're going to have
          great challenges ahead of them.
          New worlds to conquer...

He takes another sip of wine.  A beat.

                     PICARD
          Seeing Will and Deanna today made
          me think about some of the choices
          I've made in my own life.  Devoting
          myself to Starfleet... Not marrying
          or having children... All the
          choices that led me here.

A beat.  Data thinks about it.

                     DATA
          The choices I made have led me here
          as well.  This is the only home I
          have ever known.  I cannot foresee
          a reason for leaving.

                     PICARD
          You never know what's over the
          horizon, Data.  Before too long
          you'll be offered a command of your
          own.  Data looks at him; he has
          never really considered this.

                     DATA
          If I were... I believe my memory
          engrams would sense the absence of
          your specific reactions and
          behavior.  I would "miss you."

                     PICARD
               (smiles)
          Now, you make a toast.

                     DATA
          To new worlds...

                     PICARD
          New worlds.  Yes Data, brave new
          worlds...

They drink.

INT.  ROMULAN SENATE - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Flickering braziers dimly illuminate the cold, martial
splendor of a Senate corridor.

COMMANDER DONATRA and COMMANDER SURAN stride through the
corridor.

Suran is an elder Romulan officer, respected and tenacious.
Donatra -- a key figure in this story so pay close attention
to her -- is a mature, beautiful woman... not without a dry
sense of humor.

                     SURAN
          The fleet commanders are nervous.
          They've agreed to remain at their
          given coordinates and await his
          orders.  But they're anxious to
          know what's going on here.

                     DONATRA
          I don't blame them.  We can't keep
          them in the dark forever.

A voice, from the shadows:

                     VICEROY (V.O.)
          But in darkness, there is strength.

Donatra and Suran stop.

And the VICEROY steps from the shadows...

He is a terrifying sight  A powerful, monstrous alien
creature; a tall, ashen-skinned ectomorph who bears a
disturbing resemblance to the original Nosferatu.  He is
vampiric and lethal.  He is a Reman.

                     VICEROY
          Don't you agree?

He leads them along the corridor.

INT.  SENATE CHAMBER - NIGHT

We observe the Romulan crest, an imposing bird-of-prey
clutching a planet in either claw, not unlike the KAOS emblem
from "Get Smart," that dominates a wall.  As we hear:

                     SHINZON (V.O.)
          Consider it  The great symbol of
          the Empire... But the bird-of-prey
          holds planets.  Romulus, Remus.
          Their destinies conjoined...

And then we see him... SHINZON!

He is a dynamic young human in his twenties.  Very handsome
with pale, almost white skin and shining, golden hair.  He
wears a striking Reman military uniform.

He stands in the center of the eerily deserted chamber.  The
entire floor is a large star chart.

                     SHINZON
          Yet for generations one of those
          planets has been without a voice.
          We will be silent no longer.

Senator Tal'Aura (the female Senator who planted the weapon
in the Senate chamber earlier) and two other ROMULAN
COMMANDERS sit.

Cadres of Shinzon's fearsome REMAN WARRIORS stand around the
chamber.  They are his sinister children of the night.  Even
more chilling now in the flickering torch light.  It's like
something out of Tim Burton.

Donatra and Suran enter the chamber with Shinzon's Viceroy.

                     SHINZON
          Join us, Commanders.  Now what's
          the disposition of the fleet?

                     SURAN
          They're holding position.

                     SHINZON
          And?

                     SURAN
               (bows his head)
          They will obey, Praetor.

                     SHINZON
          It's imperative we retain their
          allegiance or our great mission
          will be strangled before it can
          truly draw breath.

                     DONATRA
          They support your intentions, sir.
          But they require evidence of
          your... sincerity.

Shinzon looks at her.  A quick beat.  Shinzon decides to
respond with benevolence.  He smiles.

                     SHINZON
          And they'll have it.
               (he begins to pace over
                the star chart)
          Tell the fleet that the days of
          negotiation and diplomacy are over.
          The Almighty Federation will fall
          before us.  As I promised you.

He stands on the area of the map that denotes the Neutral
Zone between the Romulan Empire and the Federation.

                     SHINZON
          The time we have dreamed of is at
          hand.  The time... of conquest.
               (sinister laugh)

He carefully steps into the area of the map marked with the
Federation symbol.  He looks down at the star chart.

                     SHINZON
          Cut off the dragon's head and it
          cannot strike back.

A beat.  Donatra watches him carefully.  Something in his
quiet words disturbs her.

                     SURAN
          How many Warbirds will you need?

                     SHINZON
          None.

They look at him, stunned.

                     SURAN
          Praetor.  You have the whole fleet
          at your disposal.  They supported
          the coup, they'll follow you.

                     SHINZON
          The Scimitar will serve my needs.

                     SURAN
          But surely --

                     SHINZON
          I came this far alone...
               (he looks at his Reman
                warriors)
          We came this far alone.  We require
          no assistance from the fleet.  Now
          leave me to my thoughts.

The Commanders and Senator Tal'Aura rise and leave.  Shinzon
looks to his Viceroy.

                     SHINZON
          Are we prepared?

                     VICEROY
          Yes, Praetor.

A beat.

                     SHINZON
          So many years for this moment.
               (he looks up at his
                Viceroy, smiles)
          Bring him to me.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - DAY

The bridge crew are at their stations.  Picard is not on the
bridge.

                     WORF
               (grumbles)
          I won't do it.

                     DEANNA
          It's tradition,Worf.  You of all
          people should appreciate that!
               (whispers)
          Besides, I've already seen it.

                     WORF
          A warrior does not appear without
          his clothing.  It leaves him...
          vulnerable.

                     RIKER
          I don't think we're going to see
          much combat on Betazed.

                     DEANNA
          Don't be too sure.  Mother will be
          there.

Worf groans.  Picard emerges from his Ready Room as:

                     WORF
          I won't do it.

                     PICARD
          Won't do what, Mister Worf?

                     WORF
          Captain.  I think it is
          inappropriate for a Starfleet
          officer to appear...
               (hates the word)
          ... naked.

                     PICARD
          Come now, a big, strapping fellow
          like you?  What are you afraid of?

Deanna laughs.  Then a readout on Worf's console attracts his
attention:

                     WORF
          I'm picking up an unusual
          electromagnetic signature from the
          Kolarin system.

                     PICARD
          What sort of signature?

Worf looks up.  Glances at Data.

                     WORF
          Positronic.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - LATER

Geordi is at the Engineering station with Picard, Riker and
Data.

                     GEORDI
          It's very faint but I've isolated
          it to the third planet in the
          Kolarin system.

                     PICARD
          What do we know about the planet?

                     GEORDI
          Uncharted.  We'll have to get
          closer for a more detailed scan.

                     PICARD
               (to Data)
          Theories?

                     DATA
          Since positronic signatures have
          only been known to emanate from
          androids such as myself, it is
          logical to theorize that there is
          an android such as myself on
          Kolarus III.

                     GEORDI
          How many of you did Dr. Soong make?

                     DATA
          I thought only me, myself and Lore.

                     RIKER
               (looking at star chart)
          Diverting to the Kolarin system
          takes us awfully close to the
          Romulan Neutral Zone.

                     PICARD
               (looking at star chart)
          Still well on our side...

Picard glances at Data, recognizes the android's deep desire
to explore this possible connection to others like himself.

                     PICARD
          I think it's worth a look.  Don't
          worry, Number One, we'll get you to
          Betazed with time to spare.

                     RIKER
          Thank you, sir...

                     PICARD
               (to all, especially Worf)
          Where we will all honor the
          Betazoid traditions.  No cold feet,
          or any other parts of our anatomy.
          Now, if you'll excuse me.  I'll be
          in the gym.

He goes.

                     RIKER
               (to Helm Officer)
          Mister Branson, set course for the
          Kolarin system.  Warp Five --
               (Deanna shoots him a
                glance)
          -- Warp Seven.

                     HELM OFFICER (MISTER BRANSON)
          Plotted and laid in, sir.

                     RIKER
          Engage.

                     DEANNA
          You better believe you're engaged!

Meanwhile, Geordi and Data remain at the Engineering Station,
studying the displays.

                     GEORDI
          What do you think, Data, a long-
          lost relative?

Data doesn't respond, but the curiosity on his face is
apparent.

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - OVER KOLARUS III - SPACE

The Enterprise is in orbit around the uncharted planet.  In
the distance we can see the distorting violence of an ion
storm.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE

Kolarus III is on the viewscreen, the ion storm raging beyond
it.

                     GEORDI
          I read six distinct positronic
          signatures, spread out over a few
          kilometers on the surface.

                     PICARD
          What do we know about the
          population?

                     DATA
          Isolated pockets of humanoids.  It
          appears to be a pre-warp
          civilization at an early stage of
          industrial development.

                     GEORDI
          Captain, I don't recommend
          transporting, that ion storm
          doesn't look very neighborly.  It
          could head this way without much
          warning.

                     PICARD
          Understood.  Data, Worf, you're
          with me.

Picard, Data and Worf start heading toward the turbolift.

                     RIKER
               (stands, protesting)
          Captain, I hope I don't have to
          remind you --

                     PICARD
          I appreciate your concern, Number
          One, but I've been itching to try
          out the Argo.

                     RIKER
          Sir --

                     PICARD
          Captain's prerogative, Will.
          There's no foreseeable danger...
          and your wife would never forgive
          me if anything happened to you.

He steps into the turbolift with the Data and Worf.

                     PICARD
          You have the bridge, Mister Troi!

The turbolift doors slide shut.

The bridge crew heartily enjoys Riker's momentary demotion to
house husband.

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - OVER KOLARUS III - DAY

The shuttlebay doors slide open and the transport vehicle
Argo emerges.

The Argo is larger than a regular shuttle with a particularly
large cargo area at the back.

EXT.  KOLARUS III - DAY

The Argo lands on the planet.  It is primarily a desert
environment with some canyons and mountains.  Like Death
Valley, blazing heat waves shimmer in the distance.  The
shuttle sits silently for a moment.  We wonder at the delay,
then...

The rear cargo doors slide open and Picard, Data and Worf
roar out on a 24th Century equivalent of a military jeep!

Picard drives, Data beside him.  Worf stands in the back at a
mounted phaser canon.  It is a muscular, exciting vehicle; a
Starfleet version of the jeep from old television series "The
Rat Patrol."

Picard screeches to a stop.  Data and Worf lurch.  A cloud of
dust momentarily obscures them.  Data quickly monitors the
positronic signatures with a tricorder:

                     DATA
          The closest signature is two
          kilometers to the west... that
          direction, sir.

                     PICARD
          Thank you, Data.
               (he smiles)
          Let's see what she can do.

He roars off in a cloud of dust!

Picard clearly enjoys driving.  He roars over the desert
terrain at breakneck speed, having a hell of a good time.
His comrades don't exactly appreciate his free-spirited
driving panache.

Worf clings on to the mounted phaser canon for dear life.
Data steadies himself by grasping onto the rollbar

                     DATA
          I will always be baffled by the
          human predilection for piloting
          vehicles at unsafe velocities.

Picard smiles and drives a little faster.

                     DATA
               (monitoring with
                tricorder)
          Over that rise, sir... half a
          kilometer.

They continue on.  Before long they can see something on the
level desert floor before them.  They approach and stop to
discover...

An android arm.  The fingers patiently drumming the ground.

                     DATA
          It appears to be...
               (he scans with his
                tricorder)
          ... an arm.

                     WORF
               (suspicious)
          Why is it moving?

                     DATA
          Like me, it has been designed with
          modular power sources.

                     PICARD
          Mister Worf, if you please.

Worf climbs from the jeep and carefully approaches the arm.
Gingerly picks it up.  The arm responds to being picked up,
the hand starts feeling around in the air like something from
a horror movie.  Worf shudders.

He returns to the jeep.  Quickly sets the arm down in the
rear cargo area.

                     DATA
          The next signature is one kilometer
          to the south.

Picard starts the jeep in motion.

Time passes as they continue on... coming across another
arm... a leg... a torso... another leg... various
disassembled components of a Data-like android!

EXT.  JEEP - KOLARUS III - CANYON - DAY

Worf stands uneasily amidst the moving body parts.  There is
only one component missing: the head.  Picard steers the jeep
into a canyon.  Stops.  Data scans with his tricorder,
pointing it up into the gently sloping hills that form the
sides of the canyon.

                     DATA
          The final signature is
          approximately 300 meters up that
          incline.

                     PICARD
          Mister Worf, accompany Data please.

                     WORF
               (uneasy)
          To find the head, sir?

                     PICARD
               (amused)
          If you don't mind.

Worf and Data climb up into the hills in pursuit of the final
piece as Picard opens the jeep's hood and checks the engine.

EXT.  KOLARUS III - HILLS - DAY

Worf and Data climb as Data scans and indicates the
direction:

                     DATA
          Ten meters...

Worf pulls his phaser, ready.

                     DATA
          I think it unlikely you will need
          your phaser to recover the cranial
          unit.  Of course, it could bite
          you.

Then they see it.

Data's head.  Or the spitting image anyway.  Lying inert in
the dust before them.

                     WORF
          It's you.

                     DATA
          The resemblance is... striking.

Then the head's eyes suddenly pop open.  It looks up at them
with a sort of blank, childlike wonder.

                     HEAD
          Why am I looking at me?

                     DATA
          You are not looking at yourself.
          You are looking at me.

                     HEAD
               (looking at Worf)
          You do not look like me.

                     WORF
          No.

                     DATA
               (to head)
          I would like to pick you up now.
          May I do that?

                     HEAD
               (to Worf)
          You have a pretty shirt.

                     WORF
          Thank you.

Data gently picks up the head.  Looks at it.  The two
identical faces gaze at each other.

                     DATA
          Fascinating...

Then BLAM! -- a boulder near them explodes.  Worf and Data
spin to see...

A nomadic tribe of desert ALIENS swarming toward them firing
primitive plasma weapons --

Data and Worf race back down the canyon, toward the jeep --
some open-field running and a bit of phaser action -- Worf
firing to distract and slow the aliens, not kill them --
through all of this the head is chattering away blandly:

                     HEAD
          I have two arms and ten fingers.
          Do you know where my arms are?  I
          cannot see where we are going.
          Where are we going?
               (Etc... like Threepio in
                "Empire" when he's
                strapped to Chewbacca's
                back.)

The action continues.  Then Data finds himself almost
surrounded --

                     DATA
          Commander!

Worf turns -- Data throws the head to Worf like a football, a
perfect spiral -- the head is still chattering away -- Worf
catches it --

                     WORF
          STOP TALKING!

The head abruptly stops talking.

Data, hands free now, quickly incapacitates the aliens around
him with a dazzling demonstration of his superior strength
and agility.

Meanwhile, Worf tucks the head under his arm and sprints like
a master running back -- evading aliens and occasionally
firing his phaser --

They are closer to the jeep now -- but they are in trouble --
the swarm of aliens almost overtaking them -- !

When a thundering BLAST sends up a shower of debris, stopping
the aliens -- Picard is standing in the rear of the jeep,
firing the phaser canon.

Data and Worf climb into the jeep as Picard leaps into the
front seat and roars off --

INT./ EXT.  JEEP - KOLARUS III - FOLLOWING

Worf, standing at the phaser canon, quickly hands the head to
Data in the front seat:

                     WORF
          If you wouldn't mind.

                     DATA
          Thank you.

The head looks up at Picard.

                     HEAD
          You have a shiny head.

Picard glances at the head.

                     DATA
          He is very observant.

                     PICARD
          I can see that.

                      WORF
          Captain!

Picard turns to see that they are being pursued!  The aliens
are racing after them in crude desert-terrain vehicles --

                     PICARD
               (to Data)
          Shall we try some "unsafe
          velocities?"

He floors it -- racing across the desert landscape.

Worf fires the mounted phaser canon -- blasting away at the
aliens, not killing them, just stopping them -- a few
dramatic crashes as the alien vehicles overturn --

Meanwhile:

                     HEAD
               (to Picard)
          You have a red shirt.

                     DATA
               (to head)
          This is not an appropriate time for
          a conversation.

                     HEAD
          Why?

                     DATA
          Because the captain has to
          concentrate on piloting the
          vehicle.

                     HEAD
          Why?

                     PICARD
          Data!

                     DATA
          Sorry, sir.

They continue to speed over the landscape -- bouncing and
flying over natural rises in the terrain -- trying to evade
their pursuers --

Picard puts the pedal to the metal and races through the
alien vehicles -- weaving in and out, avoiding their fire --
Worf blasts away with the phaser cannon -- an exhilarating
adventure --

Finally they are within sight of the Argo -- but they see it
is surrounded by more of the aliens!

                     PICARD
          Mister Data.  Let's make like the
          wind.

Data punches some buttons on a dashboard console -- and the
Argo LIFTS OFF by remote control --

Data uses the console to swing the Argo around and lower the
rear cargo doors -- it hovers over the surface --

Picard floors the jeep -- using a natural rise in the terrain
as a ramp -- the jeep FLIES THROUGH THE AIR -- over the
aliens -- and into the cargo bay --

INT.  ARGO - CARGO BAY - FOLLOWING

Picard slams on the brakes -- the jeep screeches to a stop as
the doors shut and the Argo shoots into the air.

Picard climbs from the jeep.  He nonchalantly rubs a bit of
dirt from the hood and then disappears into the main cabin.

Data and Worf remain in the jeep for a beat, stunned.

                     WORF
               (smiles)
          He must have Klingon blood.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - ENGINEERING LAB - DAY

Beverly gazes at the android head.  It gazes back at her.

                     BEVERLY
          I think you have nicer eyes.

We pull back to reveal she is speaking to Data.  Data stands
with Picard, Riker and Geordi.

                     DATA
          Our eyes are identical, Doctor.

The android is in a framework rig that holds the various body
parts in place.  The parts are not yet assembled

                     RIKER
          Geordi?

                     GEORDI
               (at work analyzing the
                torso section)
          Well, he seems to have the same
          internal mechanics as Data but not
          as much positronic development.
          The neural pathways aren't nearly
          as sophisticated.  I'd say he's a
          prototype.  Something Dr. Soong
          created before Data.

                     DATA
               (to head)
          Do you have a name, sir?

                     HEAD
          I am the B-9.

                     PICARD
          Be-nign.  Dr. Soong's penchant for
          whimsical names seems to have no
          end.

                     HEAD
               (to Riker)
          You have a fuzzy face.

                     PICARD
               (trying to ignore the
                head)
          Keep me informed, Number One, and,
          please, put him back together.

He goes.  Geordi and Data begin to reassemble the B-9 piece
by piece like the Tin Man as:

                     DATA
          Can you tell me how you came to be
          on the planet where we found you?

                     B-9
               (blandly)
          I was taken from my homeworld by
          people called the "PakJeds." They
          are fat.  They traded me to a ship
          belonging to the "Bolians." The
          "Bolians" are blue.  They put me in
          a seat and asked me questions.
          Then they were attacked by another
          ship...

Time passes...

And still the B-9 is yammering blandly away.  He is more
fully assembled   By this time Beverly is thoroughly bored.

                     B-9
          Then people called the
          Delviciansans picked me up.  They
          have long teeth.  They asked if I
          do anything to help them.  I told
          them I could do whatever they
          wanted.  They asked me to clean out
          the matrix manifolds.  I told them
          I did not know what an Matrix
          manifold looks like.

                     BEVERLY
          Excuse me.  I have some diagnostics
          to run on some medical scanner
          things.

She quickly exits.

                     B-9
          And after they showed me the
          "engine manifolds." Then they
          showed me something called a
          "plasma mop"

Time passes...

And still the B-9 is yammering away.  He is almost completely
assembled by now.  Riker is bored out of his mind.

                     B-9
          ... then the "Cardassians" put me
          into something called a "garbage
          chute" and I went out into space
          again --

                     WORF (V.O.) (ON COMM)
          Worf to Commander Riker.  I have
          the tactical manifests ready, sir.

                     RIKER
               (quickly tapping his comm
                badge)
          Worf!  Wonderful!  I'll be right
          there!...
               (he stands)
          Duty calls, gentlemen.  Carry on.

He escapes.

                     B-9
          Fuzzy face is gone.

                     DATA
          Yes, please continue.

                     B-9
          I was in space for a long time.
          Then a ship belonging to the
          "Talosians" picked me up.  They
          asked me where I came from.  I told
          them people called the "Pakleds"
          took me from my homeworld.  They
          are fat...

Geordi groans.

Time passes...

And still the B-9 is yammering away.  By this time Geordi is
slumped in a chair and only Data is listening.  The B-9 is
fully assembled.

                     B-9
          Then I opened my eyes and saw you.

A beat.  The B-9 is finally done with his tale...

                     DATA
          Do you know who I am?

                     B-9
          You are me.

                     DATA
          No.  My name is Data... I am your
          brother.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - CREW LOUNGE - NIGHT

Riker and Deanna are having dinner with Worf.

                     DEANNA
               (to Worf)
          ... and after the ceremony on
          Betazed, three entire weeks for our
          honeymoon.

                     RIKER
          We're going sailing on the Opal
          Sea.  We've booked an old-fashioned
          solar catamaran.  Just us and the
          sun and the waves.

                     WORF
          It seems a very... soft honeymoon.

                     DEANNA
               (amused)
          It's meant to be relaxing.

                     WORF
          A Klingon honeymoon begins with the
          Kholamar desert march where the
          couple bonds in endurance trials.
          If they survive the challenge they
          move on to the Fire Caves of
          Fek'lhr to face the demons of
          Gre'thor.

                     RIKER
          Well, that sounds relaxing too.

                     WORF
          It is... invigorating.

They see Data enter the lounge, carefully leading the B-9.

                     RIKER
          So they've got him up and running.

                     WORF
          He's a very unusual android

                     RIKER
               (smiles)
          Runs in the family.

They watch as Data leads the B-9 to a table.  Data instructs
him to sit.  The B-9 sits and stares forward placidly.  Data
shows him how use a napkin.

A note of concern passes over Deanna's face as she watches
Data and the B-9.

There is something strangely poignant in the twin androids.
One a bundle of curiosity and intelligence; the other
somewhat like a slow, simple child.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - READY ROOM - NIGHT

Picard is at his replicator unit.

                     PICARD
          Earl Grey, hot.

A cup of tea appears.  He takes it as the door chime sounds.

                     PICARD
          Come.
               (Deanna enters)
          Counselor.

                     DEANNA
          Do you have a moment, sir?

                     PICARD
          Of course, sit down.

He sits at his desk  She sits across from him.

                     DEANNA
          It's about Data  I've watched him
          with the B-9 and I'm troubled.
          Data's desire for a "family" is
          very strong.  I'm afraid he may be
          investing too much in the B-9.

                     PICARD
          You're speaking of emotional
          investment?

                     DEANNA
          The B-9 is like a slow child, sir.
          And Data, in his own way, has
          assumed the position of a parent or
          guardian.  I'm afraid he has
          expectations based on his own
          experiences.  He'll be disappointed
          when the B-9 cannot meet those
          expectations.

                     PICARD
          As much as we care for him,
          Deanna... we have to remember that
          Data isn't capable of
          disappointment.

                     DEANNA
          I don't believe that, sir.  We've
          shared many disappointing journeys.

A quiet beat.

                     PICARD
          I'm going to miss you.

                     DEANNA
          And I you.

They are interrupted by a comm signal:

                     RIKER (V.O.) (ON COMM)
          Captain, you have an Alpha Priority
          communication from Starfleet
          Command.

                     PICARD
          Acknowledged...
               (Deanna stands)
          ... I'll talk to Data

                     DEANNA
          Thank you, sir.

She goes.  Picard activates his desktop viewscreen.

ADMIRAL KATHRYN JANEWAY appears on Picard's monitor.  Janeway
is the former captain of Voyager.  Her new rank fits her
well, she has lost none of her dry humor and down-to-earth
charm which made her a household name and beloved cult
figure.

                     PICARD
          Admiral Janeway.  Good to see you.

                     JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          Jean Luc... How'd you like a trip
          to Romulus?  All expenses paid?

                     PICARD
               (smiles)
          With or without the rest of the
          fleet?

                     JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          A diplomatic mission.  We've been
          invited, believe it or not.  Seems
          there's been some kind of internal
          political shakeup.  The new
          Praetor, someone called Shinzon,
          has requested a Federation envoy.

                     PICARD
          New Praetor?

                     JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          There's more... as always.  He's
          Reman.
               (Picard is surprised)
          Believe me, we don't understand it
          either.  You're the closest ship so
          I want you to high tail it over
          there and hear what he has to say.
          Get the lay of the land, If the
          Empire becomes unstable, it could
          mean trouble for the entire
          quadrant.

                     PICARD
          Understood.

                     JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEEN)
          We're sending you all the
          intelligence we have, but it's not
          much.  I don't need to tell you to
          watch your back, Jean Luc.

                     PICARD
          Not with the Romulans.

                     JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
               (smiles wryly)
          The Son'a, the Borg, the Romulans,
          the evil Soran and that pesky
          Nexus.  You seem to get all the
          easy assignments!

                     PICARD
          Just lucky, Admiral.

                     JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          Let's hope that luck holds.
          Janeway out.

The transmission ends.

Picard sits for a moment, intrigued.  Then he goes to the
bridge

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard goes to his command chair:

                     PICARD
               (to Helm)
          Lay in a new course... Take us to
          Romulus.  Warp eight.

The crew is shocked.

                     HELM OFFICER
          Aye aye, sir.  Course plotted and
          laid in...

                     RIKER
          Romulus?

                     PICARD
          I'm afraid the Opal Sea will have
          to wait, Number One... Engage.

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - SPACE

And the Enterprise jumps to high warp -- disappearing in a
flash of dazzling light.  Yes!

INT.  ENTERPRISE - OBSERVATION LOUNGE - DAY

Data conducts a briefing for the senior officers.  Monitors
currently show an image of Romulus and Remus in orbit around
their sun.

                     DATA
          As you can see the habitable half
          of Remus is always in darkness
          because, like Mercury, one side
          always faces the sun.  Due to the
          extreme temperatures on that half
          of their world, the Remans live on
          the dark side of the planet.

Various grainy and unclear new images appear to illustrate
Data's words:

                     DATA
          Almost nothing is known about the
          Reman homeworld, although
          intelligence scans have proven the
          existence of dilithium mining and
          heavy weapons construction.

Very obscure images of Remans appear, the crew can barely
make out the monstrous figures:

                     DATA
          The Remans themselves are
          considered an undesirable caste in
          the hierarchy of the Empire.

                     RIKER
          But they also have the reputation
          of being formidable warriors.  In
          the Dominion War, Reman forces were
          used as assault troops in the most
          violent encounters.

                     PICARD
               (grim)
          Cannon fodder.

                     GEORDI
          Then how did a Reman get to be
          Praetor?  I don't get it.

                     RIKER
          We have to assume he had Romulan
          collaborators.

                     PICARD
          A coup d'etat?

                     RIKER
          The Praetor's power has always been
          the Romulan fleet.  They must be
          behind him.

Picard considers this.

                     PICARD
               (to Data)
          What have you learned about
          Shinzon?

The images end.  There are no images of Shinzon.

                     DATA
          Starfleet intelligence was only
          able to provide a partial account
          of his military record.  We can
          infer he is relatively young and a
          capable commander.  He fought
          seventeen major engagements in the
          war.  All successful.  Beyond that,
          we know nothing.

                     PICARD
          Well... it seems we're truly
          sailing into the unknown.  Keep at
          it.  Anything you can give me would
          be appreciated.  Dismissed.

The meeting breaks up.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - ENGINEERING LAB - DAY

The B-9 stares placidly forward.

We pull back and discover that computer conduits connect the
B-9's head to Data's head.  Geordi monitors the connection.

                     DATA
          At present he serves no useful
          function.  Dr. Soong created us to
          become active and useful members of
          society.  I do not believe he would
          have wanted the B-9 to live out his
          life in his present state.

                     GEORDI
          I can't believe the Captain went
          along with a memory download.

                     DATA
          Captain Picard agrees that the B-9
          was probably designed with the same
          self-actualization parameters as
          myself.  If my memory engrams are
          successfully integrated into his
          positronic matrix, he should have
          all my abilities.

                     GEORDI
          He'd have all your memories too.
          You feel comfortable with that?

                     DATA
          I feel nothing, Geordi.  It is my
          belief that with my memory engrams
          he will be able to function as a
          more complete individual.

                     GEORDI
          An individual more like you, you
          mean.

                     DATA
          Yes.

                     GEORDI
          Maybe he's not supposed to be like
          you.  Maybe he's supposed to be
          just like he is.

Geordi completes his work

                     GEORDI
          Okay... we're done.

Geordi removes the computer connections from between their
heads.  He carefully closes the panel in Data's head as:

                     DATA
               (to B-9)
          Do you know where you are?

                     B-9
          I am in a room with lights.

He looks blankly at the console lights.

                     DATA
          Can you remember our father?

                     B-9
          No.

Data glances to Geordi.

                     DATA
          Do you know the name of the Captain
          of this vessel?

                     B-9
          No.

                     DATA
          Is that your final answer?

                     GEORDI
               (to B-9)
          Do you know my name?

                     B-9
          You have a soft voice.

                     GEORDI
               (gently)
          Data, he's assimilating a lot of
          programming.  Remember, he's a
          prototype, a lot less sophisticated
          than you are.  We just don't know
          if his matrix will be able to
          adapt.  Or if he'll be able to
          retain anything.  We should give
          him some time.

Data has been studying some circuitry in the B-9's neck.

                     DATA
          What purpose does this serve?

                     GEORDI
               (also examining circuitry)
          It seems to be a redundant memory
          port.  Maybe it's for provisional
          memory storage in case his neural
          pathways overload?

                     DATA
          Dr. Soong must have found it
          unnecessary in later versions.

                     GEORDI
          It's possible the extra memory port
          is interfering with the engram
          processing.  Mind if I keep him
          here and run some diagnostics?

                     DATA
          No, I do not mind.

Data looks at the B-9 with a sort of sadness.

                     DATA
          But I believe he will prove
          incapable of performing higher
          functions.

                     GEORDI
          Don't give up hope, Data.  I know,
          I know, you're not capable of hope.

                     DATA
               (looking at B-9)
          I am not.

Data stands.  The B-9 stands to follow.

                     DATA
          No, remain with Commander La Forge.
          He is going to try to make you
          well.

The B-9 sits.  Data goes.  Geordi watches him go.

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - OVER ROMULUS - SPACE

The Enterprise is in orbit around Romulus.  Remus can be seen
in the distance.

                     PICARD (V.O.)
          Captain's Log.  Stardate 47844.9.
          The Enterprise has arrived at
          Romulus and is waiting at the
          designated coordinates.  All our
          hails have gone unanswered.  We've
          been waiting for seventeen hours.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The crew is tense.  Silence.

Worf, at tactical, slowly stretches his neck.  Trying to
release the tension.  It cracks.  Deanna jumps a bit.

                     RIKER
          Why don't they answer our hails?

                     PICARD
          It's an old psychological strategy,
          Number One.  To put him in a
          position of dominance and make us
          uneasy.

                     RIKER
          It's working.

                     PICARD
               (to Deanna)
          Counselor?

                     DEANNA
          They're out there, sir.

Picard stands and walks to the viewscreen.  He gazes at
Romulus below and the black infinity of space beyond.
They're out there, Waiting.

                     WORF
          Sir,  I recommend we raise shields.

                     PICARD
          Not yet, Mister Worf.

                     RIKER
          Captain, with all due respect to
          diplomatic protocols -- the
          Federation Council's not sitting
          out here, we are.

                     PICARD
          Patience.  Diplomacy is a very
          exacting occupation.  We can wait.

                     DATA
          Captain...

And on the viewscreen.

Shinzon's magnificent Reman Warbird, the SCIMITAR, decloaks
directly before the Enterprise.

EXT.  OVER ROMULUS - SPACE

Our first sight of this incredible ship is absolutely
breathtaking.

Shinzon's vessel combines the clean lines of the traditional
Romulan Warbird with unique weaponry and styling.  It is
huge, easily twice as large as the Enterprise.  And it is
aggressive.  Awesome in its power.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The crew gapes at the huge ship on the viewscreen.

                     RIKER
               (slowly rising from his
                chair)
          My God...

                     WORF
               (tense)
          Should I raise shields?

                     PICARD
          No!

                     WORF
          Captain -- !

                     PICARD
               (firm)
          Tactical analysis, Mister Worf.

                     WORF
               (quickly analyzing
                tactical display)
          Fifty-two disruptor banks, twenty-
          seven photon torpedo bays, primary
          and secondary phased shields.

                     RIKER
          She's not out for a pleasure
          cruise.

                     PICARD
               (grim)
          She's a predator.

                     WORF
          We're being hailed.

                     PICARD
          On screen.

And the image on the viewscreen transforms to:

Shinzon's Viceroy.

He stands on the Scimitar's bridge.  The bridge is as unique
as the rest of Shinzon's ship.  Instead of the usual
mechanical clutter, this bridge is designed with an almost
Asian simplicity.  Like the rest of Reman design, it is spare
and elegant.

Since the Remans are more comfortable in the darkness, most
of the light comes from the three steadily pulsing warp core
relays which dramatically soar up through the floor of the
bridge.

The crew gazes at the bridge and the monstrous features of
the viceroy.

                     VICEROY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          Enterprise.  We are the Reman
          Warbird Scimitar.

                     PICARD
          Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to --

                     VICEROY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          I am not Shinzon.  I am his
          Viceroy.  We are sending transport
          coordinates.

The transmission ends abruptly.  The Scimitar reappears on
the viewscreen.

                     RIKER
          Not very chatty.

                     PICARD
          Away team.  Transporter room four.

Picard, Riker, Deanna, Worf and Data head toward the
turbolift, energized now that the endless waiting is over.

INT.  SCIMITAR - OBSERVATION LOUNGE - NIGHT

The away team materializes in the most striking location on
Shinzon's ship: a large observation lounge.

It is a huge, empty chamber.  No furniture.  A simple Reman
mat on the floor is the only decoration.  At the very top of
the room there is a large, etched glass dome.

It is very dark.

They turn when Shinzon speaks from the shadows:

                     SHINZON (V.O.)
          I hope you'll forgive the
          darkness... we're not comfortable
          in the light.

                     PICARD
          Praetor Shinzon?

Shinzon moves toward them a bit, becoming slightly more
illuminated, the low light shining off his golden hair.

The crew cannot see him clearly in the dim light but it is
evident he is human.  Assuming that he was Reman, they're
surprised by this realization.

Shinzon just stares at Picard through the darkness for a
moment.

                     SHINZON
          Captain Picard... Jean Luc
          Picard... I don't mean to stare,
          it's just -- well, you can't
          imagine how long I've been waiting
          for this moment.  I always imagined
          you taller, isn't that odd?
               (to Data)
          You may scan me without subterfuge,
          Commander Data.

Data scans him with a tricorder as:

                     PICARD
          And you're not as we imagined you.

                     SHINZON
          No?

                     WORF
          You are human.

                     SHINZON
          Commander Worf.
               (he speaks in Klingon)
          I greet you as a valiant warrior...
          and as my brother.

                     WORF
               (terse, in Klingon)
          I'll save my greetings for a better
          brother.

Shinzon laughs, maniacally.

                     PICARD
          Why have you asked for our presence
          here?

Shinzon does not answer.  He is staring deeply at Deanna,
moans softly.

                     PICARD
          Praetor?

                     SHINZON
               (quietly)
          I've never met a human woman.

He slowly moves toward her, still hidden in the shadows.

                     DEANNA
          I'm only half human.

                     SHINZON
          Deanna Troi of Betazed.  Empathic
          and telepathic abilities, ship's
          counselor.  All of this I knew...
          But I didn't know you were so
          beautiful.

                     RIKER
          You seem very familiar with our
          personnel.

Shinzon moves even closer to Deanna, not taking his eyes from
her.

                     SHINZON
          I am, Commander Riker...
               (to Deanna)
          ... May I touch your hair?

                     PICARD
               (firm)
          Praetor, we've come to Romulus on a
          matter we were -- assured was of
          great importance.  If you have
          anything to say to us as
          representatives of the Federation,
          I suggest you do so now.

Shinzon continues to stare at Deanna.  It is strangely
seductive.  Almost disquieting in its intensity.  Deanna
handles it with grace, her level gaze never leaving his.

                     SHINZON
               (softly)
          On the world I come from there's no
          light.  No sun.  Beauty isn't
          important.  I see now there's a
          world elsewhere.

                     PICARD
          Praetor Shinzon.  We're not here to
          discuss your lack of a social life.

                     SHINZON
               (turning back to Picard)
          Yes, I'm sorry, Captain.
               (he smiles)
          There's so much we have to talk
          about.

                     PICARD
          I would be interested to know what
          we are talking about.

                     SHINZON
          Unity, Captain!  Tearing down the
          walls between us to recognize we
          are one people.  Federation and
          Romulan.  Human and Vulcan and
          Klingon and Reman.  I'm speaking of
          the thing that makes us the same.
          We want peace.

Picard and the others are stunned.

                     SHINZON
          I want to end the centuries of
          mistrust.  I want to be your ally,
          not your enemy.  As a first step I
          propose we eliminate the Neutral
          Zone and begin a free and open
          exchange of goods and ideas.

                     PICARD
          And the Senate supports you?

                     SHINZON
               (dry)
          I have dissolved the Senate.

A beat.

                     SHINZON
          Right now, you're thinking this all
          sounds too good to be true?

                     PICARD
          Yes.

                     SHINZON
          And you're wondering why the
          Scimitar is so well armed.  Is this
          the ship of a peacemaker?  Or a
          predator?
               (Picard is startled at
                Shinzon's choice of
                words)
          ... But you're also thinking the
          chance for peace is too promising
          to ignore.  Above all, you're
          trying to decide if you can trust
          me.

                     PICARD
          Yes.

                     SHINZON
          Then perhaps the time has come to
          add some illumination to our
          discussion.  Computer, raise
          lighting four levels.

Lights shoot up around the room.

For the first time the crew can see Shinzon clearly.  Picard
actually gasps when he sees Shinzon's face.  The rest of the
crew doesn't understand his reaction.

                     SHINZON
          Allow me to tell you a story that I
          hope will clarify my position.
          When I was very young I was
          stricken with an odd disease.  I
          developed a hyper-sensitivity to
          sound.  The slightest whisper
          caused me agony...

Picard watches him carefully.  Wary and strangely intense.

                     SHINZON
          No one knew what to do.  Finally I
          was taken to a doctor who had some
          experience with Terran illnesses
          and I was finally diagnosed with
          Shalaft's syndrome.  Do you know of
          it, Captain?

                     PICARD
          You know I do.

The crew is dumbfounded at Picard's unusual reaction.

                     SHINZON
          Then you know it's a very rare
          syndrome.  Genetic.  All the male
          members of my family had it.
          Eventually I was treated.  Now I
          can hear as well as you can,
          Captain.

He steps toward Picard who holds his ground.

                     SHINZON
          I can see as well as you can.  I
          can feel everything you feel.
               (He stops right before
                Picard)
          In fact, I feel exactly what you
          feel.  Don't I, Jean Luc?

Picard stares at him with a mixture of realization and
curiosity.  It is as if Picard is looking into a strange,
remembered mirror: Shinzon's face is nearly identical to his
at that age.

                     SHINZON
          Do you trust me now?

A beat.

                     PICARD
          We need to talk, just you and I.

                     SHINZON
          Come to dinner on Romulus tomorrow.
          Just the two of us.  Or just the
          one of us.

                     PICARD
          You know I need to verify this.

                     SHINZON
          I know.

The crew is utterly confused.  Their confusion turns to
outright shock when Shinzon calmly pulls out a Reman knife
and cuts his arm, drawing a little blood.  He hands the knife
to Data.

                     SHINZON
          Tomorrow then, Captain.  We have so
          much to discuss.

Picard touches his communicator pin:

                     PICARD
          Picard to Enterprise.  Five to beam
          out.

They dematerialize, the shimmering glow illuminating
Shinzon's features.  Picard's eyes never leave Shinzon as
the transporter effect ripples around him.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - SICKBAY - DAY

Beverly stands with Picard, Riker and Deanna.  The Reman
knife is under a protonmicroscope and other medical readouts
and analysis are visible.

                     BEVERLY
          There's no doubt, Captain.  Right
          down to your regressive strain of
          Shalaft's Syndrome.  He's a clone.

A beat as the confirmation sinks in.

                     PICARD
          When was he... created?

                     BEVERLY
          About twenty-five years ago.  They
          probably used a hair follicle or
          skin cell.

                     PICARD
               (touching head)
          I think a skin cell's the more
          likely of the two.

                     RIKER
          Why?

                     PICARD
          Believe me, Number One; I'm going
          to find out.  Contact Starfleet
          Command and inform them of the
          situation.  I need to know where
          the hell he came from.  Deanna.

He goes, Deanna following.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - CORRIDOR - FOLLOWING

                     DEANNA
          I would say he's been trained to
          resist telepathy.  What I could
          sense of his emotions were erratic,
          very hard to follow.

                     PICARD
          Is he sincere about wanting peace?

                     DEANNA
          I don't know.
               (she stops him)
          Sir, the strongest sense I had was
          that he's more than curious about
          you.  He very much wants to know
          you.
               (she looks at him deeply)
          The same way you want to know him.

                     PICARD
          How could I not?

                     DEANNA
          Captain, don't assume he's anything
          like you are.  You should resist
          the urge to think you know him.

                     PICARD
          I not only know him, Deanna, I am
          him... and he is me!

He goes.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - RIKER AND DEANNA'S CABIN - NIGHT

Riker is hard at work over a series of padds.  He has been
working for hours.

                     DEANNA
          Will, you need to rest.
               (he continues to work)
          As ship's counselor, I'm
          recommending you get me sleep.

Riker tosses a padd on the desk.  Rubs his eyes.  Looks up
her.

                     RIKER
          Some honeymoon.

She smiles and goes to him.

                     DEANNA
          We have time.
               (she kisses him)
          Come to bed.

She pulls him up.

                     RIKER
          Imzadi, what am I going to do with
          you?

They kiss deeply.  She pulls him across the room and they
fall into the bed.

It is passionate, erotic.  Her arms undulate around him
sensually... her fingers snake through his hair, but
something is wrong.  Riker's hair is now blond.

She starts back, her eyes growing wide.

Riker is gone.  She is now embracing Shinzon!

                     SHINZON
          Imzadi.  This is so good.

                     DEANNA
          No!

He caresses her face...

                     SHINZON
          He can never know you as I know
          you... He can never touch you as I
          touch you.

                     DEANNA
          This isn't real.

                     SHINZON
          Can you feel my hands... are they
          real?  Can you feel my lips, my
          loins?

He kisses her neck -- but when he raises his head again.  It
is the monstrous Viceroy!  Holding her.  Caressing her.  She
is frozen in horror.  But is it the Viceroy at all?

Shinzon's voice seems to come from the Viceroy's lips:

                     SHINZON (V.O.)
          I'm with you, Imzadi...

And then it is Shinzon again, kissing her:

                     SHINZON
          I'll always be with you now.  Now
          and forever...

                     DEANNA
          You sick bastard!

She pushes him away...

                     RIKER
          Deanna?!  What's with the name
          calling?

It is Riker.  She stares at him, then clings to him
desperately.

EXT.  ROMULAN SENATE - DAY

The Byzantine splendors of the Senate loom before us.

INT.  ROMULAN SENATE CHAMBER - DAY

Heavy drapes are drawn against any hint of the sun.  Shinzon
is in conference with the Romulan Commanders and Senator
Tal'Aura.  Commander Donatra watches him closely.

Commander Suran is angry, pacing.  Shinzon stands.  His
Viceroy lurks in a corner.

                     SURAN
          ... then I don't understand the
          reason for the delay!

                     SHINZON
          You don't have to understand.

                     SURAN
          And bringing the Enterprise here?!
          What possible purpose could that
          serve?!

                     SHINZON
          I have a purpose.

                     SURAN
          Then perhaps you will enlighten us?

                     SHINZON
               (snaps)
          Silence, Romulan!

A tense beat.  Shinzon regains his composure.

                     SHINZON
          You must learn patience, Commander.
          Do you know where I learned it?  In
          the dilithium mines of Remus.
          Spend eighteen hours every day
          under the lash of a Romulan guard's
          whip and you'll soon understand
          patience.

                     SURAN
               (carefully bows his head)
          Praetor.

                     SHINZON
          Now go.  I have some personal
          business.

Suran and the others go.

Donatra turns just as she is leaving the chamber, she sees
the Viceroy going to Shinzon.  And then do something odd.
The Viceroy puts his hand on Shinzon's chest, leans very
close and talks to him quietly.  This is an ancient form of
Reman telepathic medical diagnosis.

This strange sight perplexes Donatra.  The doors close,
blocking her view...

INT.  SENATE - CORRIDOR - FOLLOWING

We go with Donatra and the other Romulans.  Donatra speaks
quietly to Suran:

                     DONATRA
          How long before he has us in the
          dilithium mines?

INT.  ENTERPRISE - DATA'S CABIN - DAY

The B-9 sits placidly in a chair, staring forward.

Then, as if a switch was thrown, he moves.  He quickly rises
and goes to a computer console.  He efficiently starts
punching in commands at an amazing velocity.

INT.  ROMULAN SENATE CHAMBER - NIGHT

Picard and Shinzon sit alone in a corner of the sweeping
Senate chamber.  The remains of dinner before them.

                     SHINZON
          And when I was ready they were
          going to replace you with me, an
          exact biological duplicate.  Put a
          Romulan agent at the heart of
          Starfleet to influence your command
          structure.  It was a bold plan.

                     PICARD
          What happened?

                     SHINZON
          As happens so frequently here on
          Romulus, a new government came to
          power.  They decided to abandon the
          plan -- frankly, I think they were
          afraid I'd be discovered and it
          would lead to war.  They weren't
          ready for that.

Picard pours a glass of Romulan ale.

                     SHINZON
          Romulan ale -- I'm surprised.  I
          can't stand it.

                     PICARD
               (smiles)
          You'll acquire a taste for it.

A beat.  They look at each other.

                     SHINZON
          It's not quite the face you
          remember.

                     PICARD
          Not quite.  I envy the hairline.

                     SHINZON
          A lifetime of violence will do
          that.  My nose was broken four
          times.  And my jaw... But so much
          is the same.  The eyes, you
          recognize the eyes.

                     PICARD
          Yes.  The eyes have it.

                     SHINZON
          Our eyes reflect our lives, don't
          they?  Yours are so confident.

                     PICARD
          How did you end up on Remus?

                     SHINZON
          They sent me there to die.  How
          could a mere human survive the
          dilithium mines?  It was...
               (he can't find the words)
          ... I was a slave.  And a monster.
          The only thing the Romulan guards
          hated more than the Remans was me.
          But one man took pity on me: the
          man who became my Viceroy.  He
          taught me how to survive.  And in
          that dark place, where there was
          nothing of myself, I found my Reman
          brothers.  They showed me the only
          kindness I ever knew.

A beat.  He glances to the Romulan crest on the wall.

                     SHINZON
          For thousands of years the Romulan
          Senate has met in this chamber and
          dictated the fate of its sister-
          planet... But the time has come for
          us to live as equals.

                     PICARD
          You're doing this to liberate the
          Remans?

                     SHINZON
          No race should be a slave to
          another.

Picard is impressed with Shinzon's quiet words.

                     SHINZON
          You don't trust me.

                     PICARD
          I have no reason to.

                     SHINZON
          Of course you do.  If you had lived
          my life and experienced the
          suffering of my people... you'd be
          sitting where I am now.  At least I
          hope you would.

                     PICARD
          And if you had lived my life you
          would understand that there is a
          great responsibility in
          representing the Federation.  I
          can't let my personal feelings
          unduly influence my decisions.

                     SHINZON
          All I have is my personal feelings.
          I wasn't raised with the ideals of
          the Federation.  But I'm trying to
          understand them now.  To live up to
          them   To live up to you.

A beat.

                     SHINZON
          I want to know where I come from.
          The Remans gave me a future.  You
          can tell me about my past.

                     PICARD
          There's so much, and so much of it
          is dull...

                     SHINZON
          Were we always explorers?

                     PlCARD
          No.  I was the first Picard to
          leave Earth.  It caused quite a
          stir, In fact.  But I had spent my
          whole life...

                     SHINZON
               (finishing the sentence)
          Looking up at the stars.

                     PICARD
          Yes.

                     SHINZON
          And you dreamed about what was up
          there.  About...

                     PICARD
               (finishing the sentence)
          New worlds.

A beat.

They both reach for a carafe of water at the exact same
instant.  Stop.

                     PICARD
          After you, Praetor.

                     SHINZON
               (smiles)
          Age before rank, Jean Luc.

Picard smiles, pours a glass.

                     PICARD
          So I'm not as tall as you expected?

                     SHINZON
          I always hoped I would hit two
          meters.

                     PICARD
          With a full head of hair.

                     SHINZON
               (smiles)
          There is that.

A quiet beat.

                     PICARD
          Shinzon... I'm trying to believe
          you.

                     SHINZON
          I know.

                     PICARD
          If there's one ideal the Federation
          holds most dear it's that all men,
          all races, can be united.  From the
          first time the Vulcans came to
          Earth we've sought a future of
          peace.  Nothing would make me more
          proud than to take your hand in
          friendship.  In time.  When trust
          has been earned.

                     SHINZON
          I'm honored to think I might
          someday speak with such eloquence.

A beat.

                     SHINZON
          In time, Jean Luc.

                     PICARD
          In time.

INT.  SENATE CHAMBER - LATER

Picard is gone.  Shinzon sits, thinking.  His Viceroy enters.

                     VICEROY
          This is a mistake.

                     SHINZON
          He's gentler than I thought.  And
          he has a sense of humor.

                     VICEROY
               (stern)
          Don't forget our mission, Shinzon.
          We should act.  Now.  Time is
          running out.

                     SHINZON
               (snaps)
          My time.  I'll spend it how I
          choose.

A tense beat.

                     SHINZON
          We'll return to the Scimitar.
          Prepare yourself for the bonding.

INT.  ENTERPRISE  BRIDGE - NIGHT

Picard emerges from the turbolift.  Data, Worf and Geordi
wait at the bridge engineering station.

                     WORF
          Sir, we've had an unauthorized
          access into the main computer.

                     PICARD
          Who was it?

                     GEORDI
          It's going to take some time to
          find out -- the data stream was
          rerouted through substations all
          over the ship.

                     PICARD
          What programs were accessed?

                     GEORDI
          That's what I don't get -- it's
          mostly basic stellar cartography:
          star charts; communications
          protocols; some uplinks from colony
          tracking stations.  It's not even
          restricted material.

                     PICARD
               (to Worf)
          Set up a security program to detect
          any unusual data stream rerouting.
          If it happens again, we want to be
          ready.

                     GEORDI
               (grim)
          There's something else.  I was
          reviewing the sensor logs...
               (he refers to some
                readouts on his console)
          When the Scimitar decloaked there
          was a momentary spike in the
          tertiary EM band -- there -- You're
          not going to believe this but it's
          Thalaron.

Picard is shocked.

INT.  SICKBAY - NIGHT

Picard stands, concerned, with Beverly, Geordi and Data.
Monitors showing Thalaron research are visible.

                     PICARD
          ... I thought Thalaron radiation
          was theoretical.

                     GEORDI
          Which is why our initial scans
          didn't pick it up.  But he's got
          it, Captain.

                     PICARD
          As I remember, Thalaron research
          was banned in the Federation
          because of its bioqenic properties.

                     BEVERLY
          It has the ability to consume
          organic material at the subatomic
          level.  I can't overestimate the
          danger of Thalaron radiation, Jean
          Luc.  A microscopic amount could
          kill every living thing on this
          ship in a matter of seconds.

                     PICARD
          Understood.  Keep on it.  I need to
          know what he has and how to
          neutralize any threat.  Give me
          options.

Picard goes.  Data thinks for a moment.

                     DATA
          Doctor, will you excuse us for a
          moment?  Geordi, please come with
          me.

He and Geordi head out.  Beverly returns to some medical
displays showing Thalaron research, her expression deeply
concerned.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - PICARD'S CABIN - NIGHT

Picard is sitting at his desk, flipping through an old photo
album.  He stops and stares at one of the pictures deeply
troubled.  We finally see the photo: Young Jean Luc Picard.
A serious, unsmiling cadet at Starfleet Academy.  The face
before him bears a disturbing resemblance to Shinzon.

The door comm chirps.

                     PICARD
          Come...
               (Beverly enters)
          ... Beverly, come in.

                     BEVERLY
          You're working late.

She sits, notes the picture of Young Jean Luc.

                     PICARD
          Remember him?

                     BEVERLY
          He was a bit proud as I recall.

                     PICARD
          He was a damn fool.  Selfish and
          ambitious.  Very much in need of
          seasoning.

                     BEVERLY
          He turned out all right.

He rises, goes to a window, gazes at the Scimitar in the
distance.  A beat.

                     PICARD
          I so wanted to believe Shinzon.
          But the Thalaron radiation can't be
          explained away.  Whatever he's
          after, it's not peace.

                     BEVERLY
          Is he very much like you were?

                     PICARD
          Yes.

Data interrupts on comm:

                     DATA (V.O.) (ON COMM)
          Data to Captain Picard.  Geordi and
          I have identified the source of the
          unauthorized computer access.  And,
          I believe, we have also discovered
          an opportunity to gain a tactical
          advantage.

                     PICARD
               (to comm)
          On my way...

                     BEVERLY
               (stands)
          Jean Luc -- whatever you were --
          right now you're the man you've
          made yourself.  He's someone else.

                     PICARD
          I wish I could believe that,
          Doctor.

He goes.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - TURBOLIFT - MORNING

Deanna is alone on the turbolift.  Then a voice makes her
spin:

                     SHINZON (V.O.)
          Imzadi...

Shinzon stands across from her.

                     DEANNA
          You're not here.

                     SHINZON
               (moving to her)
          Very logical, Deanna... But your
          heart doesn't constrain itself to
          mere logic.
               (he caresses her)
          ... Your heart longs to discover
          me.  To know me...
               (he kisses her)
          ... To leave all of this behind and
          be with me.

He pushes her against the wall, with passion and almost
violence.

                     DEANNA
          No...

                     SHINZON
          I can feel your desire, Deanna...

She forces herself to concentrate... to resist
telepathically... it is a mighty effort... this Romulan is
hot.  And the world around her appears to be changing...
bending...

And she is momentarily in a cabin on the Scimitar.  Although
entirely a telepathic experience, it is as if she has
actually traveled.

She sees Shinzon kneeling over a small flame, she realizes
she is looking through the Viceroy's eyes.

On the Scimitar, Shinzon looks up at the Viceroy/Deanna:

                     SHINZON
          I can feel your hunger to know the
          Reman ways... the old ways.

Then the world changes again...

Deanna is on the turbolift.  Shinzon is pressed against her,
whispering:

                     SHINZON
          Don't fear what you desire...

She forces him away from her and --

She is alone.  She sinks to her knees.  Overcome with
emotion.

INT.  SCIMITAR - VICEROY'S CABIN - FOLLOWING

The Viceroy, in a kind of trace, kneels before a small flame.
Shinzon kneels across from him.  The Viceroy raises his head.

                     VICEROY
          The bond is broken.

                     SHINZON
          Find her again.

                     VICEROY
          No -- this is wasting time.

                     SHINZON
          Do as I tell you!

A Reman officer interrupts on comm:

                     REMAN OFFICER (V.O.)
          Praetor, we've received the
          transponder signal.

                     SHINZON
               (to comm)
          On my way.

He begins to go -- but suddenly stops, a wave of illness
overtaking him.

The Viceroy puts his hand on Shinzon's chest.  A strange
moment as the Viceroy shuts his eyes and feels Shinzon's
chest.  His mind... probing.

Then the Viceroy looks up at him, grim.

                     VICEROY
          It's accelerating.  You have no
          more time for games.

                     SHINZON
          Have the doctors prepare.  I'll be
          on the bridge.

He goes.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - DAY

Shinzon stands with some REMAN ENGINEERS.

                     SHINZON
          Transport.

An Engineer activates a transporter and the B-9 materializes!

                     SHINZON
          Welcome home.
               (to Engineers)
          Begin the download.

Reman engineers go to the B-9 and open the panel in his neck,
begin connecting computer conduits to the extra memory port
we saw earlier.

(Note: Although the audience will not know it yet, this is
actually Data pretending to be the B-9.)

Shinzon goes to a replicator unit and orders:

                     SHINZON
          Tea, hot.

A cup of tea appears.  He takes it and sips as he watches his
Engineers connecting the conduits to the B-9.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - SICKBAY - DAY

Beverly is scanning Deanna.  Picard and Riker watch,
concerned.

                     BEVERLY
          Aside from slightly elevated
          adrenalin and serotonin levels,
          you're completely normal.

                     PICARD
               (gently)
          Can you describe it, Deanna?

She looks at Picard, tears in her eyes.

                     DEANNA
          It was... a violation.

Riker takes her hand.

                     DEANNA
               (with difficulty)
          Shinzon's Viceroy seems to have the
          ability to reach into my thoughts.
          I've become a liability... I
          request to be relieved of my
          duties.

                     PICARD
          Permission denied.  If you can
          possibly endure any more of these
          assaults.  I need you at my side.
          Now more than ever I...

But before the words are out of his mouth... he begins to
dematerialize!

                     RIKER
               (to comm)
          Worf!  Raise Shields !

But Picard is gone.

EXT.  OVER ROMULUS - SPACE

The Scimitar cloaks.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIG - NIGHT

Picard stands in the Reman brig.  His communicator pin has
been removed.

Beyond the security force field a ghoulish medical apparatus
is being prepared.  A metal chair with laser scalpels, IV
tubes and hyposprays connected to it.  Reman doctors work
over the mysterious chair.

Shinzon enters with the B-9 following.  Shinzon stands on the
other side of the force field.

Picard notices something immediately.  Tiny veins are now
visible on Shinzon's face; the faintest sign of an intricate
spider-web pattern of pale blue veins.

                     SHINZON
          Hello, Jean Luc.

                     PICARD
          Why am I here?

                     SHINZON
          I was lonely...
               (he realizes Picard is
                staring at the veins on
                his face)
          Perhaps I'm not aging as well as
          you did.

He nods to a guard.  The guard deactivates the force field.
A Reman doctor enters and raises a hypospray toward Picard.

                     PICARD
               (resists)
          What are you doing?

                     SHINZON
          I need a sample of your blood.
          What do your Borg friends say?
          Resistance is futile.
               (maniacal laugh)

The Doctor takes a quick sample of Picard's blood as Picard
glances to the B-9.

                     SHINZON
          Yes.  The bait you couldn't refuse.
          I learned there might be an
          existing prototype from a
          Cardassian historian, then went to
          a great deal of trouble to find it
          and scatter it about on Kolarus
          III.  I knew it would pique your
          curiosity and conveniently make the
          Enterprise the closest ship to
          Romulus when I contacted Starfleet.

The Reman doctor leaves the cell.  The force field is
reactivated.  The doctor goes to the mysterious medical
apparatus and analyzes Picard's blood.  As:

                     PICARD
          All of this so you could capture
          me?

                     SHINZON
          Don't be so vain.  After we found
          it, we made a few modifications.
          An extra memory port, a hidden
          transponder.  Perhaps your eyes
          will be a bit less confident when
          you learn I've gained access to
          Starfleet's communications
          protocols.  I now know the location
          of your entire fleet...
               (to B-9)
          ... You may go.

                     B-9
          Where?

                     SHINZON
          Out of my sight.

The B-9 obediently leaves the room as:

                     SHINZON
          Maybe I'll train it to do little
          tricks for me like your robot does.
          Or maybe I'll snap its ugly head
          off.

                     PICARD
          What's this all about?

                     SHINZON
          It's about destiny, Picard.  About
          a Reman outcast who --

                     PICARD
          You're not Reman.

                     SHINZON
          And I'm not quite human.  So what
          am I?  What do you see?
               (he peers at Picard
                deeply)
          Do you see a life you might have
          led?  Lost youth never to be
          recaptured?

                     PICARD
          I see a young man trying
          desperately to deny who he is.

                     SHINZON
          I see an old man, set in his ways,
          afraid to live without a uniform to
          prop him up and a Starfleet
          regulation to tell him what to do.
          I see the man I will never be.

                     PICARD
          I won't defend my life to you.

                     SHINZON
          My life is meaningless as long as
          you're alive.  What am I while you
          exist?  A shadow?  An enigma?

                     PICARD
               (stern)
          If your issues are with me... This
          has nothing to do with my ship and
          nothing to do with the Federation.

                     SHINZON
          Oh, but it does.  We will no longer
          bow like slaves before anyone.  Not
          the Romulans and not your mighty
          Federation.  We're a race bred for
          war.  For conquest.

                     PICARD
          Think about what you're doing,
          Shinzon.  Are you ready to plunge
          the entire quadrant into war to
          satisfy your own personal demons?

                     SHINZON
          It amazes me how little you know
          yourself.

                     PICARD
          I'm incapable of such an act, and
          so are you.

                     SHINZON
          I think the facts speak for
          themselves.  The same noble Picard
          blood runs in our veins.  Had you
          lived my life, you'd be doing
          exactly as I am.  Look in the
          mirror, and see yourself.

Shinzon looks at him deeply.

                     SHINZON
          Consider that, Captain.  I can
          think of no greater torment for
          you.

He turns to go.

                     PICARD
          It's a mirror for you as well...

Shinzon turns back to him.

A beat.  Picard gazes at him evenly.

Picard's probing gaze makes Shinzon a bit uneasy.  He glances
to the ghoulish medical preparations.

                     SHINZON
          Not for long, Captain.
               (back to Picard)
          I'm afraid you won't survive to
          witness the victory of the echo
          over the voice.

He goes.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - NIGHT

The ship is on Red Alert.  Worf stands at tactical, muscles
coiled, hungry for action.

                     WORF
          No response to our hails.

Geordi is hard at work at the Science station.  Riker stands
over him:

                     GEORDI
               (frustrated)
          His cloak is perfect... no tachyon
          emissions, no residual antiprotons.

                     RIKER
          Keep at it, Geordi.  Find a way in.

Beverly arrives on the bridge, urgent.  She carries a medical
padd.

                     BEVERLY
          Will, I need to talk to you.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIG - NIGHT

Picard stands in his cell, peering at the edges of the
security force field, trying to spot any weakness.

Then the B-9 enters the brig, he holds a Reman disruptor
weapon.

                     B-9
               (to Reman guard)
          I am to take the prisoner to the
          Praetor.

The Reman Guard deactivates the force field.

                     B-9
          If you resist, I will incapacitate
          you.

He leads Picard out.

INT.  SCIMITAR - CORRIDORS - FOLLOWING

The B-9 leads Picard through the dark corridors, holding the
disruptor on him steadily.  All the Remans they pass glare at
Picard with undisguised loathing.

The Viceroy approaches.  Stops before them.

                     VICEROY
               (to B-9)
          Where are you taking him?

                     B-9
          Praetor Shinzon wants him on the
          bridge.

The Viceroy turns his malevolent gaze on Picard.

                     VICEROY
          So, human... you've met your better
          self!

                     PICARD
          What are you doing to Counsellor
          Troi?

                     VICEROY
          I'm preparing her for Shinzon... To
          sooth him as she soothes you.  To
          stand at his side as she does at
          yours.

                     PICARD
          That will never happen.

                     VICEROY
          Listen to him, android.  Such a
          small and weak creature.  Yet he
          roars so valiantly...
               (he raises one taloned
                claw and puts a sharp
                fingernail on Picard's
                chest)
          It would take me but an instant to
          tear that valiant heart from your
          chest.

                     PICARD
          There'll be another after me.  And
          another after that.  You'll find
          we're a resilient species.

                     VICEROY
          I look forward to the sport.
               (to the B-9, harshly)
          Take him.

The B-9 prods Picard's back roughly with the disruptor.
Picard grimaces in pain

                     B-9
          Move.

The Viceroy continues away down the corridor.  The B-9 leads
Picard along.

                     PICARD
               (whispers)
          Be careful of over-playing your
          part, Commander!

And the audience now realizes it is Data pretending to be the
B-9 and rejoices.

                     DATA
          Sorry, sir.  I thought it added a
          touch of reality to the
          performance.

They are silent as they pass a few Reman guards.  Then:

                     DATA
          My mission was a success, sir.  I
          have discovered the source of the
          Thalaron radiation.

                     PICARD
          Good work.  The download?

                     DATA
          He believes he has our
          communications protocols.  But they
          will give him inaccurate locations
          for all Starfleet vessels.

Data assumes the B-9's posture again as they pass some some
Reman Warriors.

                     DATA
          Move, puny human animal.

They pass the Warriors.

                     PICARD
          A bit less florid, Data.

                     DATA
          Aye, sir... This way.

He leads Picard down the corridor.

INT.  SCIMITAR - GENERATION CHAMBER - NIGHT

Data leads Picard into a massive chamber that soars up like a
cathedral.  It is the size of a small town.

The whole, cavernous chamber pulses with glowing green light.

                     DATA
          This entire ship is, essentially, a
          flying Thalaron generator.
               (he points up)
          All its power relays lead to that
          device.

High above them, at the very top of the chamber, is a
gigantic version of the spider-weapon we saw kill all the
Romulan Senators before.  It is breathtaking.

                     PICARD
          A weapon.

                     DATA
          It would appear so.

Data rotates his left hand and then slides it forward,
exposing a hidden compartment in his wrist.  He removes a
small, silver disc.  This is a cool new piece of Federation
technology called an ETU.  (Emergency Transport Unit.)

                     DATA
          Geordi equipped me with the
          prototype for the Emergency
          Transport Unit.  I recommend you
          use it to return to the Enterprise.

                     PICARD
          It'll only work for one of us.

                     DATA
          Yes, sir.

                     PICARD
          We'll find a way off together.
          Recommendations?

                     DATA
          There is a shuttlebay 948 meters
          from our current location.

Data inserts the ETU back into his wrist and they leave the
chamber.

INT.  SCIMITAR BRIDGE - NIGHT

The Viceroy arrives on the bridge, stops.

                     VICEROY
          Where's Picard?

Shinzon looks at him, confused.

INT.  SCIMITAR - CORRIDORS - NIGHT

Security alert klaxons suddenly begin to howl and harsh Reman
commands are broadcast through the corridors.

                     DATA
          This way, sir!

They sprint down the twisting, dark corridors -- Reman
warriors suddenly appear before them! -- Data fires the
disruptor as Picard launches himself into them --

A fight -- Picard uses a dazzlinq series of Starfleet hand-
to-hand maneuvers -- he dramatically subdues the Remans.

More Reman warriors appear down the corridor.  Picard grabs a
disruptor.

And instantly spins to fire a blazing disruptor.  A battle
breaks out in the corridor -- the energy beams and explosions
illuminating the violent fire fight in strobe-like bursts.

They run to another corridor and finally arrive at the
shuttlebay door -- it does not open.

                     DATA
               (looking at door security
                panel)
          It seems to have an encrypted
          security system.

Reman warriors are closing in on them.

Data tosses his disruptor to Picard -- Picard catches it and
instantly spins and fires -- he uses both disruptors to fire
down both ends of the corridor like a Western sheriff --
keeping the Remans at bay --

As Data uses both hands to punch numbers into the shuttlebay
door security panel at an amazing rate --

                     PICARD
          Alacrity would be appreciated,
          Commander.

                     DATA
          They are trying to override the
          access codes.  Reman is really a
          most complex language with
          pictographs representing certain
          verb roots and --

                     PICARD
          While I find that fascinating,
          Data, we really need that Goddamned
          door open!

The shuttlebay door slides open.

Picard lays down a blistering barrage of cover fire as he and
Data duck into the shuttlebay.

INT.  SCIMITAR - SHUTTLEBAY - FOLLOWING

When the door closes behind them, Picard turns and fires a
disruptor blast -- sealing the door mechanism.

They turn to face...

A fleet of very small shuttles.  They are uniquely designed.
Extremely compact and stream-lined.  A disruptor turret on
each.

They move toward one as:

                     DATA
          According to the ship's manifest
          they are Scorpion-class attack
          fliers.

They quickly climb a Scorpion.

INT.  SCORPION COCKPIT - SHUTTLEBAY - FOLLOWING

The cockpit of the Scorpion is cramped.  Picard climbs into
the pilot's position.  Data assumes the gunner's position.

They see disruptor fire trying to burn through the door to
the shuttlebay -- Picard powers up the Scorpion as:

                     PICARD
               (trying to figure out the
                controls)
          What do you imagine this is?

                     DATA
          Port thrusters, sir.  Would you
          like me to drive?

Picard shoots him a look and presses some controls.  The
Scorpion lifts off.  Hovers a few feet over the deck.  Picard
elegantly swings it around toward the large shuttlebay
external doors as:

                     PICARD
          Can you open the shuttlebay doors?

                     DATA
               (working controls)
          Affirmative, sir.  Negative, sir.
          They have instigated security
          overrides and erected a force field
          around the external portals.

                     PICARD
          Well then... only one way to go.

He swings the Scorpion around again so it is facing the doors
they came through, the doors back into the ship.

Data is dubious.

                     DATA
          Do you think this is a wise course
          of action?

                     PICARD
          We're about to find out... Power up
          disruptors and fire on my mark.

                     DATA
          Ready, Captain.

                     PICARD
          Fire!

And the Scorpion's forward disruptors fire!  The doors into
the ship explode!  Picard powers forward!

INT.  SCIMITAR CORRIDORS - FOLLOWING

And the Scorpion shoots into the corridor, past the stunned
Remans.  Picard banks sharply -- careens off the far side of
the corridor but keeps control.

The Scorpion zooms down the corridor.

INT.  SCORPION COCKPIT - SCIMITAR - FOLLOWING

Picard is concentrating intensely -- it is like trying to
control the world's fastest roller coaster.

INT.  SCIMITAR - CORRIDORS - FOLLOWING

The Scorpion banks around a corner --it zigs and zags through
the ship at breakneck speed --

INT.  SCIMITAR - OBSERVATION LOUNGE - NIGHT

The doors to the observation lounge EXPLODE in.

The Scorpion SHOOTS into the room and up --

A disruptor blast SHATTERS the etched glass dome at the top
of the room --

And the Scorpion ZOOMS triumphantly into space!

EXT.  OVER ROMULUS - SPACE

The Scorpion seems to appear from nowhere -- slicing through
the cloak of invisibility around the Scimitar --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The crew sees the Scorpion appear on the viewscreen.

                     RIKER
          Worf!  Lock on transporters!

INT.  SCIMITAR BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon sees the Scorpion as well.

                     SHINZON
          Tractor beam!  Now!

EXT.  OVER ROMULUS - SPACE

But they are too late -- the Scorpion dematerializes --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - CARGO BAY - FOLLOWING

And materializes in one of the Enterprise's cargo bays.
Picard and Data climb out --

                     PICARD
               (to comm)
          Number One, emergency warp!

EXT.  OVER ROMULUS - FOLLOWING

The Enterprise dramatically powers forward and up -- rolling
over in a great arc going into warp while still upside down.
It disappears in a blaze of light.  Fade to...

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - NIGHT

Shinzon sits in his command chair as the ship streaks through
space.  He speaks on viewscreen with his Romulan
collaborators.  His face is even more finely veined now.

                     SHINZON
          The Enterprise is immaterial!  They
          won't make it back to Federation
          space.

                     SURAN (ON VIEWSCREEN)
               (angry)
          This has gone far enough!

                     SHINZON
          I thought we discussed patience,
          Commander.

                     SURAN (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          And mine is wearing thin, young
          man!  We supported you because you
          promised action.  And yet you delay
          and you waste your time playing
          games with Picard while --

Shinzon stands and briskly pulls down his uniform tunic 
exactly as we've seen Picard do a thousand times.

                     SHINZON
          Commander Suran, the games are
          over.  In two days the Federation
          will be crippled beyond repair.
          Does that satisfy you?

                     SURAN (ON VIEWSCREEN)
               (grim)
          For the moment.

                     SHINZON
               (brutal)
          And when I return... you and I
          shall have a little talk about
          showing proper respect!

INT.  ROMULAN SENATE - CHAMBER - FOLLOWING

The viewscreen picture of Shinzon snaps out.  The Romulan sit
for a silent beat.

                     DONATRA
          Does anyone in this room harbor any
          illusions about what he means by
          "showing proper respect"?

                     TAL'AURA
          What's happening to his face?

                     SURAN
          I want opinions.  He is clearly out
          of his mind.

                     SURAN
          But can he complete his mission?

                     DONATRA
          Should he?

They look at her.

                     DONATRA
          Are you prepared to have your hands
          drenched in blood?  He'll show them
          no mercy.  And his sins will mark
          us all for generations.  Is that
          what you truly want, Romulans?

A beat.

                     DONATRA
          I think you should consider that
          question now -- or else you may
          have a lifetime to think about it
          in the dilithium mines.

She turns and stalks out.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - READY ROOM - NIGHT

Beverly sits with Picard and Riker.

                     BEVERLY
          The more I studied his DNA the more
          confusing it got.  Finally I could
          only come to one conclusion...
          Shinzon was created with temporal
          RNA sequencing.  He was designed so
          that at a certain point his aging
          process could be accelerated to
          reach your age more quickly, so he
          could replace you.

                     PICARD
          But the Romulans abandoned the
          plan...

                     BEVERLY
          As a result the temporal sequencing
          was never activated.  Remember, he
          was supposed to replace you at
          nearly your current age.  He was
          engineered to skip thirty years of
          life.  But since the RNA sequencing
          was never activated, his cellular
          structure has started to break
          down.  He's dying.

                     PICARD
          Dying?

                     RIKER
          He wasn't designed to live a
          complete, human life span.

                     PlCARD
          Can anything be done for him?

                     BEVERLY
          Not without a complete
          myelodysplastic infusion from the
          only donor with compatible DNA.
          But that would mean draining all
          your blood.

                     RIKER
          That's why he went to all that
          trouble to capture you.

                     PlCARD
          How long does he have?

                     BEVERLY
          I can't be sure but the rate of
          decay seems to be accelerating.

Picard considers this.

                     PICARD
          Then he'll come for me as a donor.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - DATA'S CABIN - NIGHT

Data stands before the B-9.

The B-9 has been deactivated, he stands lifeless and
immobile.  Data gazes deeply into his double's identical
features.  Then he opens a panel in the B-9's neck and uses a
small instrument to activate the android's head.

The B-9's eyes spring to life.  He looks at Data.

                     B-9
          Brother.  I cannot move.

                     DATA
          No, I have only activated your
          cognitive and communication
          subroutines.

                     B-9
          Why?

                     DATA
          Because you are dangerous.

                     B-9
          Why?

                     DATA
          You have been programmed to gather
          information that can be used
          against this ship.

                     B-9
          I do not understand.

                     DATA
          I know.

A beat.

                     DATA
          Do you know anything about
          Shinzon's plans against the
          Federation?

                     B-9
          No.

                     DATA
          Do you have any knowledge of the
          tactical abilities of his ship?

                     B-9
          No.  Can I move now?

                     DATA
          No.  I must deactivate you.

                     B-9
          For how long?

                     DATA
          Indefinitely.

                     B-9
          How long is that?

A beat.  Data gazes at the B-9 deeply.

                     DATA
          A long time, brother.

Data reaches forward and deactivates his brother.

The B-9's eyes lose the spark of life.  He stands, frozen.
Data stands before him.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - OBSERVATION LOUNGE - NIGHT

Picard is gathered with his senior officers.

A computer display illustrates Geordi's words about the power
of Shinzon's weapon.  We see a chilling graphic of the
Biogenic Pulse beam spreading around a ship, then a whole
planet.

                     GEORDI
          It's called a Cascading Biogenic
          Pulse.  The unique properties of
          Thalaron radiation allow the energy
          beam to expand almost without
          limits.  Depending on the radiant
          intensity it could encompass a
          ship... or a planet.

                     PICARD
               (thinking)
          And that's exactly what he's going
          to do.

                     RIKER
          Sir?

                     PICARD
          His hatred of the Federation is
          apparent.  He would have built a
          weapon of that scope for one
          reason.  He is going after Earth.

                     RIKER
          Oh boy.  Destroy humanity and the
          Federation is crippled...

                     PICARD
          And the Romulans invade.

                     DEANNA
          How can you be certain?

                     PICARD
          I know how he thinks.

A beat.

                     RIKER
               (to Geordi)
          And there's no way to penetrate his
          cloak?

                     GEORDI
          No, sir.

                     RIKER
               (frustrated)
          He could pass within 10 meters of
          every ship in Starfleet and they'd
          never know.

                     BEVERLY
          But we do have one advantage.
               (to Picard)
          He needs your blood to live.  He
          might come after you first.

                     PICARD
          I'm counting on it... We've been
          ordered to head to sector 3274.
          Starfleet is diverting the fleet to
          meet us there.

                     RIKER
          Strength in numbers?

                     PICARD
          We can only hope so.

A beat as he looks at them gravely.

                     PICARD
          He can't be allowed to use that
          weapon.  All other concerns are
          secondary.  Do you understand me?

Riker knows exactly what Picard is saying: the Enterprise is
expendable.

                     RIKER
          Yes, sir.

Picard stands.  Presses a comm button.

                     PICARD
          All hands.  Battle stations.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - VARIOUS ANGLES

We see a montage of the Enterprise preparing for battle.

Crew members assume battle stations.  Weapons locker ring
open and Security Officers hand out sidearms and phaser
rifles.

Geordi and his Engineers establish emergency force field
around the warp core.

Riker and Worf brief officers on tactical plans...

Data works at the bridge Science Station, analyzing data on
Shinzon's ship.

Picard walks through the corridors, he stops to talk with
apprehensive young ensign.

As we hear:

                     PICARD (V.O.)
          Captain's Personal Log.
          Supplemental.  We're heading toward
          Federation space at maximum warp.
          The crew has responded with the
          dedication I've come to expect of
          them.  And like a thousand other
          commanders on a thousand other
          battlefields throughout history, I
          wait for the dawn.

The montage ends as...

INT.  ENTERPRISE - SICKBAY - NIGHT

Picard enters sickbay.

Dr. Crusher and her medical staff are hard at work.  They
position anti-grav gurneys and ready medical supplies.
Security officers are handing out phasers.

Picard watches the grim preparations.  Beverly goes to him,
bolstering her phaser.

                     PICARD
               (quietly)
          To seek out new life and new
          civilizations.  Zephyr Cochran's
          own words.  When Charles Darwin set
          out on the H.M.S. Beagle, on his
          journey into the unknown... he
          sailed without a single musket.

                     BEVERLY
               (gently)
          That was another time.

                     PICARD
          How far we've come.  Let me know if
          you need anything.

He starts to go --

                     BEVERLY
          Jean Luc...
               (he stops)
          ... He is not you.

A beat.

                     PICARD
          What makes us who we are, Doctor?
          Can you tell me that?

She watches him go.

INT.  SCIMITAR BRIDGE - NIGHT

Shinzon sits in his command chair, lined with veins now.
His Viceroy again has his hand pressed to Shinzon's chest.

                     SHINZON
          How long?

                     VICEROY
          A matter of hours now --

Shinzon shoves him away.  Stands.

                     VICEROY
          If you don't begin the procedure
          soon you'll never make it back to
          Romulus.  You shouldn't have
          delayed.  You should have killed
          Picard the moment --

Shinzon slams his command chair in fury.  The Viceroy watches
him carefully.

A beat.  Shinzon regains his composure.  He sits again in his
command chair.

                     SHINZON
          How long until we reach the Rift?

                     VICEROY
               (checks a console)
          Seven minutes.

Shinzon leans back, satisfied.  And looks at the viewscreen.

The image on the viewscreen is shocking.

The Enterprise only a few hundred yards away.

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - SPACE

The Enterprise zooms through space.

Completely unaware of the predator directly above it.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - ASTROMETRICS - NIGHT

Data is at work in Astrometry.  Cartographic projections of
star systems ebb and flow on a large screen before him.
Picard enters.

                     PICARD
          Show me our current position.

The images before them quickly change to show another sector
and a blip representing the Enterprise.

                     PICARD
          How long until we reach the fleet?

                     DATA
          At our current velocity we will
          arrive at sector 3274 in
          approximately 40 minutes.

The images before them change to show sector 3274.  We see
blips denoting Starfleet ships moving into position.
Picard gazes at the projection of stars before them for a
moment.

                     PICARD
               (quietly)
          "For now we see but through a glass
          darkly..."  He said he's a mirror.

                     DATA
          Of you?

                     PICARD
          Yes.

                     DATA
          I do not agree.  Although you share
          the same genetic structure, the
          events of your life have created
          unique individual.

                     PICARD
          But so much is the same.  On a
          biological level he is... and I
          will not accept the idea that there
          is nothing I can do.  I have a
          responsibility to try to make a
          human connection with him.

                     DATA
          He would deny a "human" connection
          is possible.  He considers himself
          entirely Reman.

                     PICARD
          He may have already rejected my
          humanity, but you also have a twin.

                     DATA
          No, sir, it is not possible.  The
          B-9 is physically identical to me,
          although his neural pathways are
          not as advanced.  But even if they
          were, he would not be me.

                     PICARD
          How can you be sure?

                     DATA
          I aspire, sir.  To be better than I
          am.  The B-9 does not.  Nor does
          Shinzon.

A beat.

                     PICARD
          We'll never know what Shinzon might
          have been.  Had he stood where I
          did as a child?  And looked up at
          the stars.

Picard's words linger in the air for a moment.

Then the projections before them sputter with static for a
moment.  Flickering.

                     DATA
               (working controls)
          We are passing through the Bassen
          Rift.  The projections will return
          when we have cleared it.

                     PICARD
          It's interfering with our uplink
          from Starfleet cartography?

                     DATA
          Yes, sir.  The Rift effects all
          long-range communications --

                     PICARD
                (urgent, to comm)
          Commander Riker, evasive maneuvers!

Too late.

The ship QUAKES -- a photon torpedo blast -- the Enterprise
is under attack!

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

Disruptor beams appear from nowhere -- streaking through
space -- slamming into the Enterprise's warp drive.  The
Enterprise recoils, dangerously dropping out of warp in a
furious lurch.

The Bassen Rift is a strange area of electromagnetic
distortion.  Energy patterns crackle through space.

INT.  SCIMITAR BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon sits in his command chair.  The viewscreen shows the
Enterprise before him.

                     SHINZON
          Target weapons systems and shields.
          I don't want the Enterprise
          destroyed.

On the viewscreen, we see disruptor blasts streaking from the
Scimitar -- slicing into the Enterprise.

                     SHINZON
          Can you learn to see in the dark,
          Captain?

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard and Data emerge from the turbolift as the ship
ROCKS --

                     PICARD
          Report.

                     RIKER
          He's firing through his cloak.  We
          can't get a lock.

                     GEORDI
               (at engineering station)
          He disabled our warp drive with his
          first shot.  We've only got
          impulse.

                     WORF
          Long range communication is
          impossible as long as we're in the
          rift --

The ship SHUDDERS again --

                     PICARD
          Worf, prepare a full phaser spread,
          zero elevation.  All banks on my
          mark.  Scan for shield impacts and
          stand by photon torpedoes.

                     WORF
          Aye, sir

The ship ROCKS again.

                     PICARD
          Fire!

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The Enterprise fires her phasers simultaneously -- the energy
beams shoot into space --

And the Scimitar's shape is momentarily illuminated as one of
its shields is hit.

Photon torpedoes immediately shoot from the Enterprise -- but
pass harmlessly through the area where the Scimitar's shields
were momentarily illuminated.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

                     SHINZON
          You're too slow, old man.
               (entering commands in his
                chair console)
          Attack pattern Shinzon Theta.

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The invisible Warbird makes a dramatic run straight over the
Enterprise -- firing steadily down as it sweeps past it; is a
brutal, close range assault --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The bridge SHAKES violently under the ruthless attack--

                     DATA
          We are losing dorsal shields --

                     PICARD
          Full axis rotation to port!  Fire
          all ventral phasers!

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The Enterprise instantly complies -- Rolling completely over
to the left, firing phasers up as Shinzon's invisible ship
streaks above it --

A few lucky phaser shots from the bottom of the Enterprise --
now shooting upward -- manage to momentarily illuminate the
bottom shields of the Scimitar as it sweeps past above.

          Unless we can disable his cloak
          we're just going to be firing in
          the dark.

          Agreed.

                     WORF
          Sir, we're being hailed.

                     PICARD
          On screen.

Shinzon appears on the viewscreen.  He is on the bridge of
the Scimitar.

                     SHINZON (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          Captain Picard, will you join me in
          your Ready Room?

INT.  ENTERPRISE - READY ROOM

Picard stands in his Ready Room.  A flickering light shimmers
across the room.  And a perfect holographic representation of
Shinzon appears before him.

                     SHINZON
          You can't trace my holographic
          emitters, Captain.  So don't
          bother.  And you can't contact
          Starfleet.  We're quite alone.

                     PICARD
          We are.

                     SHINZON
          It's just the two of us now, Jean
          Luc, as it should be... Your ship
          and mine... You and me.

                     PICARD
          Why are you here?

                     SHINZON
          To accept your surrender.  I can
          clearly destroy you at any time.
          Lower your shields and allow me to
          transport you to my ship.

                     PICARD
          And what of the Enterprise?

                     SHINZON
          I have little interest in your
          quaint vessel, Captain.  If the
          Enterprise will withdraw to a
          distance of one hundred light
          years, it will not be harmed.

                     PICARD
          You know that's not possible.

                     SHINZON
          I know... you'll all gladly die to
          save your home world.

                     PICARD
               (intense)
          Look at me, Shinzon!  Do you feel
          the blood pumping inside you?  Your
          hands, your eyes, your nature, are
          the same as mine.  Buried deep
          inside you beneath the years of
          pain and anger is a capacity you've
          forgotten.  It's the one way our
          mirror can reflect the two of us
          exactly because it's the very thing
          that truly defines us.  To be human
          is to try to make yourself better
          than you are.

Picard looks at him deeply, relentlessly refusing to give up.

                     PICARD
          I know you as well as I know
          myself, Shinzon.  There was a time
          you looked at the stars and dreamed
          of what might be.

                     SHINZON
               (quietly)
          Long ago.

                     PICARD
          Not so long.

                     SHINZON
          Childish dreams, Captain.  Lost in
          the dilithium mines of Remus.  I'm
          what you see now.

                     PICARD
          I see more than what you are.

Picard steps toward him.

                     PICARD
          I see what you could be.

Shinzon slowly backs away as Picard continues to move toward
him relentlessly.

                     PICARD
          The man who is Jean Luc Picard and
          Shinzon of Remus won't exterminate
          the population of an entire planet!
          He is better than that!

                     SHINZON
               (desperate)
          He is what his life has made him!

Shinzon is in turmoil.  Picard senses this.  He proceeds
quietly:

                     PICARD
          And what will he do with that life?

Shinzon looks at him, questioning.

                     PICARD
          If I were to beam to your ship...
          let you complete your medical
          procedure, give you a full life...
          what would you do with the time?

Shinzon doesn't respond.

                     PICARD
          You once asked me about your past.
          Your history.  When I was your age,
          I burned with ambition.  I was very
          proud and my pride often hurt
          people.  I made every wrong choice
          a young man can... But one thing
          saved me... I had a father who
          believed in me.  Who took the time
          to teach me a better way.  You have
          the same father.

                     SHINZON
          Yes.

                     PICARD
          So if I gave you my life, what
          would you do with it?  Would you
          spend the years in a blaze of
          hatred as you are now?  Or could
          you change?  Could you try to
          remember a mother's touch you never
          felt?  A father's words you never
          heard?  Could you do that?

                     SHINZON
               (quietly)
          I don't know.

                     PICARD
          But you want to.

Shinzon doesn't respond.  But Picard knows he has made a
connection.  For this brief moment reconciliation is
possible.  He proceeds quietly:

                     PICARD
          Let me tell you about our father.

Shinzon looks at him with an aching sadness.  What might have
been.

                     SHINZON
          That's your life... not mine.

                     PICARD
          Please.

                     SHINZON
          It's too late.

                     PICARD
          You can still make a choice!  Make
          the right one now!

                     SHINZON
          I have no choices!  I can't fight
          what I am!

Shinzon backs away, unable to fight his nature:

                     SHINZON
          I'll show you my true nature.  Your
          nature.  And as Earth dies --
          remember that I'm forever Shinzon
          of Remus!  And my voice will echo
          through time long after yours has
          faded to a dim memory.

Shinzon ends the transmission and his holographic image
flickers and fades away.

Picard stands alone, drained.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon strides quickly to his command chair, barking to his
Viceroy:

                     SHINZON
          Disable their weapons!

But before the Viceroy can move the Scimitar suddenly ROCKS
-- attacked from somewhere!  Shinzon is stunned.

                     SHINZON
          Report!

                     REMAN OFFICER
          Two ships decloaking, sir!
          Romulan!

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard strides to his command chair as two Romulan Warbirds
appear on the viewscreen.  Deanna is now on the bridge.

                     RIKER
          Believe it or not, I think the
          cavalry has arrived.

                     WORF
          We're being hailed.

                     PICARD
          On screen.

On the viewscreen: Commander Donatra shimmers into view.

                     DONATRA (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          Captain Picard, Commander Donatra
          of the Warbird Valdore.  Might we
          be of assistance?

                     PICARD
          Your timing is impeccable,
          Commander.

                     DONATRA (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          The Empire considers this a matter
          of internal security.  We regret
          you've become involved.

                     PICARD
          When this is over, I owe you a
          drink.

On the viewscreen, the Valdore ROCKS from a disruptor blast.

                     DONATRA (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          Romulan ale, Captain.  Let's get to
          work.  Valdore out.

The transmission ends.

                     PICARD
               (to Worf)
          You heard the lady.  Get to work.
          Move your ass!

(The Romulan Warbirds must remain decloaked to fire weapons
and are visible throughout the battle.)

Although Shinzon's ship is still cloaked, the steady barrage
of triangulated phaser and disruptor fire from the Enterprise
and the two Romulan vessels illuminate its shields with
impacts.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

                     PICARD

          Auxiliary power to forward shields.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon sits quite calmly in his command chair.

                     SHINZON
          Target the flanking Warbird.  All
          forward disruptor banks on my mark.

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

It is a chaos of starships as the Enterprise and the two
Warbirds fire steadily -- illuminating the Scimitar's
shields.

The ships sweep around one another, maneuvering for position,
firing constantly.  The battlefield seems impossibly crowded
as the four vessels evade and attack; as phaser and disruptor
beams criss-cross space.

Then the Scimitar unleashes a devastating volley... all her
forward disruptor banks fire at once --

They literally cut one of the Romulan ships in half -- a huge
EXPLOSION -- debris SHOOTS across space and SLAMS VIOLENTLY
off the Enterprise's forward shields -- !

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The ship ROCKS dangerously!

                     DATA
          Forward shields are down to ten
          percent.

                     RIKER
               (to Helm)
          Bring us about!

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The Enterprise quickly turns about -- firing her aft phasers,
as the Valdore sweeps toward Shinzon's ship, firing --

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

                     SHINZON
          Let her pursue -- drop cloak on the
          aft port quadrant and prepare for
          full emergency stop.

                     VICEROY
               (startled)
          What?!

                     SHINZON
          You heard me.

INT.  VALDORE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Donatra leans forward in her command chair, looking at
viewscreen.  She sees part of the Scimitar's rear cloakning
fall away --

                     DONATRA
          She's losing her cloak!  Stand by
          all forward disruptor banks!

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

                     VICEROY
          She's almost on us.

                     SHINZON
          Not yet.

On the viewscreen  we see the Valdore in pursuit, gaining.
The Reman crew is getting nervous.

                     VICEROY
          Praetor...

                     SHINZON
          FULL STOP AND FIRE !

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The Scimitar LURCHES to a stop!  Too fast for the Valdore to
respond in time -- it flies over the Scimitar --

And the Scimitar fires!

A devastating volley of photon torpedoes rip into the
underbelly and aft of the Valdore as it streaks past --

The Valdore careens out of control and then slows to a stop.
It floats dead in space.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

                     SHINZON
          Restore the aft cloak.and bring us
          about.

He leans back in his command chair, ready for the final
battle.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

A bloody Commander Donatra is talking to Picard on
viewscreen.  Her bridge is in ruins.

                     DONATRA (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          I'm afraid that drink will have to
          wait, Captain.

                     PICARD
          Do you have life support?

                     DONATRA (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          For the moment.  But we're dead in
          the water.

                     PICARD
          Understood --

Then the ship ROCKS --

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The invisible Scimitar sweeps past for a particularly brutal
assault -- disruptor blasts streak along the Enterprise's
hull -- a huge, ripping series of explosions tear away
several decks of the Enterprise --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

                     DATA
          We have lost structural integrity
          on decks twelve through seventeen,

                     RIKER
          Evacuate those decks and reroute
          field power to forward shields.

Deanna goes to Picard:

                     DEANNA
          Captain -- I might have a way to
          find them.

                     PICARD
          Counselor?

                     DEANNA
          The one thing he may have forgotten
          in the course of battle: me.

                     PICARD
          Make it so.

She quickly goes to Worf at tactical.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - NIGHT

Shinzon is entering tactical commands in his chair console.

                     SHINZON
          Prepare a lateral run -- all
          starboard disruptors.

Then the viceroy suddenly stiffens, alarm in his eyes --

                     VICEROY
          No!

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Deanna concentrates furiously, eyes closed.  She stands with
Worf, her hand slowly moving his over the photon torpedo
targeting display.

It is a wrenching experience as she probes with her thoughts.

                     DEANNA
          He's resisting me.

She is in pain.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The Viceroy concentrates, trying to block her probing
thoughts.

                     SHINZON
          What is it?!  Focus on your job!!!

                     VICEROY
          She is here.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Deanna continues to move Worf's hand over the targeting
display.  She is sweating, panting for breath, concentrating
fiercely.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The Viceroy resists her -- their psyches lock in battle.
Deanna appears in the Viceroy's mind, she glares at him.

                     DEANNA
          Remember me?

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Her eyes snap open --

                     DEANNA
          NOW!

Worf instantly fires a full volley of photon torpedoes.

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

A full spread of photon torpedoes shoot through space.

And connect!  A series of devastating impacts -- and the
Scimitar's cloak fails!

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard stands quickly.

                     PICARD
          Savage them!

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

And the Enterprise attacks!

It fires all weapons simultaneously -- phasers and photon
torpedoes slam into the Scimitar!  Shinzon's ship responds
quickly -- maneuvering for position and returning fire!

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The bridge has been damaged, sparks sputter through the
darkness and debris litters the deck.

Shinzon eyes reflect a growing sense of desperation.

                     SHINZON
               (spinning to his Viceroy)
          Prepare a boarding party -- BRING
          ME PICARD!

The viceroy strides out as Shinzon spins to another officer.

                     SHINZON
          Get the cloak back!  And target
          shield coordinates beta three.  All
          disruptors.  Fire!

On the viewscreen, we see disruptor beams focusing on a tiny
part of the Enterprise's lower shields, slamming into them.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - NIGHT

An alarm klaxon suddenly rings through the bridge.

                     WORF
          Intruder alert!

                     RIKER
          Let's go.

Riker and Worf quickly head toward the turbolift as:

                     WORF
               (to comm)
          Security detail to deck twenty
          nine.

Data immediately assumes Worf's position at tactical.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - LOWER DECKS - NIGHT

Riker and Worf stride with a SECURITY DETAIL through the
cramped lower decks.

A sudden disruptor blast stops them cold!  The Viceroy and
his invasion force of a dozen Reman Warriors are down the
corridor!

The Enterprise crew returns fire.  It is a blazing phaser
battle, Worf leading his men with Klingon courage.  They
steadily advance in the face of the blistering disruptor
fire --

They are getting the upper hand when Riker sees the Viceroy
escape into a Jefferies tube --

                     RIKER
          Worf.

Worf instantly dives into the corridor -- landing hard and
sliding forward on his stomach all the while firing a steady
burst from his phaser rifle.

Riker uses the cover to dive after the Viceroy, following him
into the dark Jefferies tube, intent on destroying the man
who has been tormenting his wife --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The Scimitar sweeps into view on the viewscreen -- filling
the screen -- and launches a ferocious volley of photon
torpedoes.

A huge EXPLOSION as the viewscreen and some of the forward
bridge are BLOWN APART -- the Helm Officer is SUCKED INTO
SPACE before a flickering emergency force field springs into
position --

Deanna races to assume the helm --

Picard can now see his enemy directly through the gaping hole
in the ship's hull -- he sees the Scimitar banking for
another attack run as part of the ship disappears --

                     GEORDI
          He's getting his cloak back.  We
          have exhausted our compliment of
          photon torpedoes.  Phaser banks are
          down to four percent.

                     PICARD
          What if we target all phasers in a
          concentrated attack?

                     DATA
          The Scimitar's shields are still at
          seventy percent.  It would make no
          difference, sir.

Picard thinks.

                     DEANNA
          They're stopping...

Through the hole in the hull, Picard sees the Scimitar slowly
turning.  Slowly advancing.  They see another part of the
Scimitar disappear, the cloak returning.

                     GEORDI
          What's he doing?

                     PICARD
               (grim)
          He wants to look me in the eye.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - JEFFERIES TUBE - FOLLOWING

Below decks, Riker stalks the Viceroy through a labyrinthine
series of access tunnels.  It is like a scene from ALIEN.

The flickering half-light and red emergency strobes of the
crippled ship make this an ominous sequence.  The Viceroy is
in his element, used to the perpetual night of the Reman
Homeworld, he can see in the dark.

Riker moves through the darkness, hunting for the Viceroy.
He stops, phaser ready.  He peers into the dark tunnel ahead
of him.  Sees nothing.  We tilt up and see...

The Viceroy clinging to the ceiling directly above Riker!
Hidden in the darkness.  The Viceroy attacks! -- diving down
on Riker -- his lethal Reman knife slashing through the
darkness --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard stands... watching the Scimitar maneuver into
position.  Large parts of it are now cloaked.

It stops.  Only a few hundred yards from the Enterprise, its
great prow almost filling the gaping hole at the front of the
bridge.

Picard thinks, his mind racing.  Then it comes to him in a
flash:

                     PICARD
          He thinks he knows exactly what I'm
          going to do...

                     GEORDI
          Sir?

                     PICARD
          We've got him!

He sits in his command chair and begins quickly entering
command instructions in his chair console.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon, supremely confident, leans back in his command
chair.

                     SHINZON
          Open a channel.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard is still entering commands in his chair console.

                     DATA
          We are being hailed.

                     PICARD
          Deanna, stand by.
               (to Data)
          Open a channel.

                     SHINZON (V.O.)
          I hope you're still alive, Jean
          Luc.

                     PICARD
          I am.

                     SHINZON (V.O.)
          Don't you think it's time to
          surrender?  I'll have my cloak back
          in a matter of minutes and your
          poor ship is shot to pieces.  Why
          should the rest of your crew have
          to die?

Picard continues to enter command codes -- transmits them to
Deanna at helm -- she receives the commands, nods.  All of
this as Picard buys some time:

                     PICARD
          I never told you about my first
          Academy evaluation, did I?  I
          received very high marks for my
          studies.  But I was found lacking
          in certain other areas.
          Personality traits, you might say.
          In particular I was thought to be
          extremely...
               (he glares up at the prow
                of the Scimitar)
          ... over-confident.

Picard indicates for Data to end the communication.  Then:

                     PICARD
               (quickly)
          Geordi, put 211 power to the
          engines.  Take it from life support
          if you have to -- everything you
          can give me.

                     GEORDI
          Aye, sir.

                     PICARD
          Deanna, on my mark.

                     GEORDI
          Ready, sir!

Picard leans forward in his chair:

                     PICARD
               (on comm)
          All hands, brace for impact!
               (to Deanna)
          ENGAGE.

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The Enterprise powers forward in a final thrust -- !

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon sees it coming -- utterly shocked -- bolts up --

                     SHINZON
          HARD TO PORT !

Too late.

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

A massive COLLISION as the Enterprise SLAMS into the Scimitar
-- as it SMASHES and GRINDS into Shinzon's ship --

The Scimitar REELS --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Everyone goes FLYING!

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The two great ships are now locked together, slowly rotating
in space.

The forward part of the Enterprise's saucer is enmeshed in
Shinzon's ship; two scorpions with their claws locked.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon stands in the ruins of his bridge.  Many of his
bridge crew are now dead.

                     SHINZON
          Divert all power to engines.  Full
          reverse!

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

Every part of the Enterprise ROCKS -- a great lurch as the
Scimitar begins to tear itself free -- backing away -- a
deafening shriek of metal -- both ships are being torn to
pieces in the process -- but it is working -- the Scimitar
is ripping free, wrenching itself loose.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - JEFFERIES TUBES - FOLLOWING

The Jefferies tube SHUDDERS as the Scimitar continues to tear
itself free -- Riker and the Viceroy careen through the tube.
The Viceroy recovers quickly and coils for a final attack.
Riker sees that an access plate has been loosened in the
collision -- he desperately rips it away -- knowing the
relays behind will provide him with the advantage he needs --

Bright light strobes from the relays and the Viceroy is
momentarily blinded -- Riker uses this opportunity to attack!
He dives forward -- slamming into the Viceroy -- they both
tumble into a long, vertical access tunnel -- they fall!

Riker shoots out a hand and grabs a ladder -- the Viceroy,
grabs onto Riker, his talons digging into his uniform -- a
long drop below them!

Riker forces the Viceroy's head back -- away from him -- a
brutal struggle --

Riker glares at him.

                     RIKER
          Don't worry -- Hell is dark.

Riker uses every ounce of strength he has left -- pushes the
Viceroy off him --

The Viceroy falls down the long tunnel -- to his death.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The whole Enterprise bridge QUAKES as the Scimitar continues
to pull itself free --

Picard stands, steadying himself on his command chair.

                     PICARD
          Data, I need you.

Data joins Picard as:

                     PICARD
          Computer.  Auto-destruct sequence
          Omega.  Zero time delay.  Recognize
          voice pattern Jean Luc Picard.
          Authorization Alpha Alpha Three
          Zero Five --

                     COMPUTER (V.O.)
          Auto-destruct is off-line.

Then the ship gives a final LURCH.  The Scimitar is free.

An eerie moment of silence after the explosive tearing and
grinding.

Picard watches through the gaping hole in the hull as the
Scimitar backs away.  Another section of the Scimitar
disappears.  Shinzon almost has his cloak back.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon stares at the Enterprise.

A wave of sickness overcomes him for a moment, he doubles
over.  We actually see more veins appearing on his face.
Time is running out.

                     SHINZON
          Target disruptors.  Destroy them.

                     REMAN OFFICER
          Disruptors are off-line, sir.

A beat.  Shinzon looks up.

                     SHINZON
          Deploy the weapon.  Kill everything
          on that ship.  Then set a course
          for Earth.

                     REMAN OFFICER
          What about Picard?

                     SHINZON
          Our greater goal is more important,
          brother.

                     REMAN OFFICER
          But, Praetor, you won't survive
          without him...

Shinzon gazes at the Enterprise on the viewscreen.

                     SHINZON
          Some ideals are worth dying for,
          aren't they, Jean Luc?

EXT.  RIFT - SPACE

The entire Scimitar slowly begins to unfold.  Like a gigantic
version of the small spider-weapon we saw kill the Romulan
Senators before, legs appear and hoist up a savage weapon.
The Cascading Pulse.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard and the others watch the monstrous Cascading Pulse
weapon slowly deploying.

                     PICARD
          How long until he can fire?

                     GEORDI
          The targeting sequence should take
          about four minutes.

                     DEANNA
          But how can he?  He'll kill you.

                     PICARD
          This isn't about me anymore.

Picard's face is set, resolute.  He knows what he must do.
Picard grabs a phaser rifle from a weapons locker as...

                     PICARD
          Prepare for a site-to-site
          transport.

                     GEORDI
               (concerned)
          Sir, we won't be able to bring you
          back.  It's a one way trip.
          Captain, I don't know if the
          transporter --

                     PICARD
          That's an order, Commander.

                     DATA
          Sir, allow me to go.  You are
          needed here.

                     PICARD
          Negative.

                     DATA
          Sir...

Deanna takes Data's arm.  Looks at him.  She knows this is
something Picard must do himself.

                     DEANNA
          Let him go.

Picard powers up the phaser rifle as:

                     PICARD
               (to Data)
          You have the bridge, Commander.
          Use all available power to move
          away from the Scimitar.
               (to Geordi)
          Now, Mister La Forge.

                     GEORDI
          Aye, sir.

Geordi nervously works some controls on his console and
Picard dematerializes.  Then the transporter panel explodes
in a shower of sparks.

                     GEORDI
          That's it.  Transporters are down.

Data thinks for a moment.  Then:

                     DATA
          Counsellor Troi, please assume
          command.  Geordi, if you will come
          with me.

He heads toward the turbolift, Geordi following.

INT.  SCIMITAR - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Several Remen warriors in the corridor turn and fire.  Riker
returns fire, a series of lightning fast pulses from his
phaser rifle.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - FORWARD CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Data and Geordi stand in a long corridor.  The far end of the
corridor opens to space.  An emergency force field is in
place at the end of the corridor.

Geordi operates a tricorder and another force field flickers
on around him.

Data looks toward the end of the corridor, readying himself.

                     DATA
          What is our approximate distance?

                     GEORDI
               (scans with tricorder)
          400 meters.

                     DATA
          Thank you.

Data backs up a little more   He looks at Geordi again.
Deeply.

                     DATA
          Thank you, Geordi.  Deactivate the
          field.

Geordi operates his tricorder and the force field at the end
of the corridor snaps off --

The void of space fills the corridor and Data takes a running
start -- he races down the long corridor and leaps --

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

-- into space.

He floats toward the Scimitar, his momentum carrying him.
Carrying him too far!

He is going to miss the Scimitar -- almost past it now!  He
thrusts out a hand --

And just misses a piece of dangling wreckage!  Data is
floating helplessly through space.  Doomed.  Then he SLAMS
into an invisible piece of the partially cloaked on the ship!

He grabs onto the invisible part of the ship and pulls
himself up to the hull.  He rips open an access panel with
his superior strength and climbs inside.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - NIGHT

Shinzon stands, his eyes glued to the Enterprise on the
viewscreen.

We see a monitor showing that the Cascading Pulse weapon is
locked on the Enterprise.

Most of the light on the shattered bridge now comes from the
three steadily pulsing warp core relays which soar up through
the floor.

                     COMPUTER (V.O)
          Forty-seven.  Forty six...

Suddenly -- a MASSIVE BLAST as the doors to the bridge
explode in.  Shinzon spins to see --

Picard framed in the doorway, phaser rifle ready.

Picard instantly fires for the Cascading Pulse control -- but
Shinzon dives to cover it -- the phaser blast hits Shinzon in
the chest -- he recoils, slamming to the deck, stunned.

The few remaining Remans on the bridge spin to Picard, firing
disruptors -- Picard dives for cover and battles them with
his phaser rifle --

He succeeds in stunning the Remans but a final disruptor
blast knocks Picard to the deck -- the phaser rifle spins
away --

                     COMPUTER (V.O.)
          Twenty nine... Twenty eight...

Shinzon pulls himself up and races to snatch up a disruptor
from a fallen comrade --

As Picard leaps up, grabbing a piece of wreckage, a long
metal rod -- Picard thrusts it forward like a spear --

Impaling Shinzon.

A stunned moment of silence as Shinzon gazes at Picard,
almost with a look of disbelief.  Blood spews from his mouth
as he lets out a tormented cry.

And then, amazingly, Shinzon forces himself forward --
pushing Picard back against a wall -- Shinzon slowly walks
toward Picard, forcing himself down the length of the spear
-- the spear point explodes through Shinzon's back -- the
weight of Shinzon's body is pinning Picard against the wall
-- time is running out --

                     COMPUTER (V.O.)
          Eighteen... Seventeen...

Shinzon forces himself down the spear:

                     SHINZON
          I'm glad we're together now -- our
          destiny is complete.

He finally thrusts himself down the whole spear and clasps
his dying hands firmly around Picard's throat --

                     COMPUTER (V.O.)
          Ten...Nine...

Data sprints to the bridge --

He instantly tears open his wrist and pulls out the small,
silver disc we saw earlier -- the Emergency Transport Unit --
he slaps it on Picard's shoulder.  A final look between
them --
                     COMPUTER (V.O.)
          Seven..  Six...

Data activates the ETU -- Picard dematerializes.

Data looks at the space where Picard was and says simply:

                     DATA
          Goodbye.

Then he spins and pulls out his phaser --

And fires point-blank into the Scimitar's warp core relays --
the bridge explodes -- Data is incinerated --

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The Scimitar BLASTS APART in a massive flash --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard re-materializes.

He sees the brilliant flash from the explosion through the
gaping hole in the front of the bridge.

Deanna sits at helm, her face a mask of pain.  Geordi stands
on the upper rear deck, head down.

A long beat as Picard just stands on his ruined bridge, the
thousand-yard stare of a combat veteran in his eyes.

Riker emerges from the turbolift.  Goes to Picard.

                     RIKER
          Sir?

Picard doesn't answer, he just stares forward.  Deanna goes
to Riker.

                     DEANNA
          Data.

Riker looks toward the glowing debris field in the distance.
He puts an arm around Deanna.

Silence.

                     GEORDI
          Sir, we're being hailed.

                     PICARD
          On screen...
               (he remembers there is no
                longer a viewscreen)
          ... Open a channel.

                     DONATRA (V.O.)
          This is Commander Donatra of the
          Valdore.  We're dispatching
          shuttles with medical personnel and
          supplies.

                     PICARD
          Thank you, Commander.

The transmission ends.

                     PICARD
               (flat)
          Geordi... prepare the shuttlebay
          for arrivals.  They don't know our
          procedures so just... open the
          doors.

                     GEORDI
          I'll take care of it, sir.

                     PICARD
          Number One.
               (a beat)
          You have the bridge.

He turns and heads toward his Ready Room.

The others watch him go with great sadness.

When the Ready Room doors close behind Picard, Deanna finally
allows herself to cry.  Riker holds her closely.  Slow fade
to...

INT.  ENTERPRISE - CREW LOUNGE - NIGHT

Hours later.  The senior crew is solemnly gathered in the
shattered remains of the crew lounge.  Picard, Riker, Deanna,
Beverly, Worf, Geordi.

They wear their dress uniforms.

Picard goes to each of them.  He carries a small, metal box.
They each take something from the box.

At first we, don't quite see what they are doing.  Then we
realize they are affixing black bars to the collars of their
uniforms.

Mourning bands.

Picard pours six glasses of his precious Chateau Picard.
Each takes a glass.

Picard raises his glass.

                     PICARD
          To absent friends... o family.

They toast Data.  Slow fade to...

INT.  ENTERPRISE - PICARD'S CABIN - NIGHT

Picard sits at his desk, speaking quietly to someone we do
not see.

                     PICARD
          I don't know if all this has made
          sense to you, but I wanted you to
          know what kind of man he was.  In
          his quest to be more like us, he
          helped show us what it means to be
          human.

We see it is the now re-activated B-9 sitting across from
him.

                     B-9
          My brother was not a human.

                     PICARD
          No, he wasn't... But his wonder and
          his curiosity about every facet of
          human life helped all of us see the
          best parts of ourselves.  He
          embraced change... because he
          always wanted to be more than he
          was.

                     B-9
          I do not understand.

                     PICARD
          Well, I hope someday you will.

Worf interrupts on comm:

                     WORF (V.O.) (ON COMM)
          Captain, the Hemingway has arrived
          to tow us to spacedock.

                     PICARD
          On my way.  Please notify Commander
          Riker...
               (he stands, prepares to
                go)
          ... We'll talk later?

The B-9 does not respond.  He is looking rather blankly at
the padd on Picard's desk.

Picard begins to leave when a sound stops him... humming.  He
turns back to the B-9.

The B-9 is still looking blankly at the padd... but he's
humming lightly to himself... then he begins to sing, very
softly...

                     B-9
          "Blue skies, smiling at me, Nothing
          but blue skies do I see."

Then the B-9 is silent.

Picard watches him for a moment; great emotion playing over
his features, and then goes.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Picard and Riker head toward a turbolift... making their way
past the debris littering the corridor.

                     PICARD
          I'm sorry you won't be here for the
          re-fit, but I know the Titan needs
          you immediately.

Riker does not respond.

Picard stops, looks at Riker deeply.

                     PICARD
          The Titan's a fine ship, Will.  And
          she's getting a captain worthy of
          her.

                     RIKER
          She's the most beautiful ship I've
          ever seen.
               (he touches a wall of the
                corridor)
          ... But she's not the Enterprise.

                     PICARD
          I promise you in time, she'll
          become your home... If I could
          offer you one piece of advice?

                     RIKER
          Anything.

                     PICARD
          When your first officer insists
          that you can't go on away
          missions... Ignore him --

                     RIKER
               (smiles)
          I intend to.

A moment.

                     RIKER
               (with difficulty)
          Serving with you has been an honor.

                     PICARD
          The honor was mine.  Captain Riker.

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - SPACEDOCK - OVER EARTH

A few weeks later.  The Enterprise is enclosed in the great
womb of a spacedock.  The ship is being rebuilt.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - NIGHT

A fresh-faced young officer, COMMANDER MARTIN MADDEN, paces
nervously outside Picard's Ready Room.  Bracing himself
before entering.

Behind him we can see technicians working everywhere around
the bridge, trying to rebuild it.  Worf is talking to a young
officer at tactical and Geordi is working at the engineering
station.  We also see new command chairs being installed.

(Although we do not see it in this scene, the gaping hole at
the front of the bridge has not yet been repaired.)

A young Andorian woman, the new OPS OFFICER, smiles at
Madden's nervousness.  Her antennae twitch slightly in
amusement.  He sees her.

                     MADDEN
          So... what's the old man like?

                     OPS OFFICER
          Why don't you go in and find out?

Commander Madden prepares himself.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - READY ROOM - FOLLOWING

Picard is talking to Beverly on viewscreen.  She is in her
new office at Starfleet Medical.

                     BEVERLY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          You can't imagine them, Jean Luc.
          They're kids!  All with advance
          degrees in xenobiology and out to
          conquer every disease in the
          quadrant.

                     PICARD
               (smiles)
          Reminds me of a young doctor I used
          to know...

                     BEVERLY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          They're running me ragged.  Nothing
          but questions day and night... I
          love it!  Come to dinner and I'll
          tell you all about it.  There's a
          Bajoran band at the officer's mess.

                     PICARD
          Not tonight, I have work here.

                     BEVERLY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          Soon then.  I'll save the last
          dance for you.

Commander Madden enters quickly -- he did not use the door
chime so Picard is surprised.

                     MADDEN
          Commander Martin Madden reporting
          for duty, sir.

Picard stands, they shake hands as:

                     PICARD
          Welcome aboard, Commander.  I hope,
          your transfer didn't come as too
          much of a surprise.

                     MADDEN
          I was... honored, sir.

                     PICARD
          I needed you immediately to help
          oversee the re-fit...
               (gathering up some padds
                from his desk)
          ... Your service record on the
          Talos is exemplary, but there are a
          few things I would like to discuss
          with you regarding my requirements
          for a First Officer.  Shall we say
          dinner in my quarters at 1900
          hours?

                     MADDEN
          Very good, sir.

Picard heads toward the door, carrying a few padds.

                     PICARD
          Commander, I don't know how they
          did it on the Talos, but we have
          door chimes on the Enterprise.  We
          use them.

                     MADDEN
          Yes, sir.  Sorry, sir.

Picard goes to the bridge, Madden following...

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

They emerge to the bridge as Worf is arguing with the cocky
young ENSIGN busy installing Picard's new high-tech command
chair.

                     WORF
          You don't understand the Captain --
          there should be no changes until we
          have discussed the modifications
          with him.

Picard goes to them:

                     PICARD
          What's this?

                     WORF
               (grumbles)
          Your new chair, sir.

                     ENSIGN
          It's the Mark Seven, Captain.
          State-of-the-art ergonomics...
          command interfaces with --

                     WORF
          I told him you're comfortable with
          your old chair.

                     PICARD
          Let's give it a try.

He settles into his new command chair.  Looks around for a
beat at his new bridge crew.  Fresh-faced kids.  A new
generation to teach and nurture.  He smiles.

                     PICARD
          Feels good.

Worf and Geordi exchange a look, surprised.

                     ENSIGN
               (points)
          Try that button, sir.

Picard presses a button on the chair and -- zip -- metal
restraints fly into position around his waist and shoulders.
Seatbelts!  Picard is surprised.

A beat.

Then Picard smiles.

                     PICARD
          It's about time.

He presses the button again and the restraints zip back into
the body of the chair.  He is delighted.  He turns to Madden:

                     PICARD
          Commander, please sit down...

Madden sits in the First Officer's chair, Picard shares a
padd with him.

                     PICARD
          ... We've received our first
          assignment.  We're going to be
          exploring the Denab system.  It
          should be exciting.  It's a
          place... where no one has gone
          before.

And we cut to --

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - SPACEDOCK - OVER EARTH - FOLLOWING

Through the hole in the hull we see Picard talking to Madden.
Picard at work, at peace.  Where he is meant to be.

We slowly pull back from Picard and the Enterprise.  As we
hear the B-9's soft tones.  Gentle.  Hopeful.

                     B-9 (V.O.)
          "Never saw the sun shining so
          bright, Never saw things going so
          right.  Noticing the days hurrying
          by, When you're in love, my how
          they fly.  Blue days, all of them
          gone, Nothing but blue skies from
          now on."

We revolve away from the Enterprise and Earth toward the
stars.  Then ZOOM forward into the cosmos as the rousing
"Next Generation" theme explodes over END CREDITS.

                                                FADE OUT.

                                      LUCASFILM LTD.

                

               A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away...

               A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main title. 
               War drums echo through the heavens as a rollup slowly crawls 
               into infinity.

                    It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, 
                    striking from a hidden base, have won their first 
                    victory against the evil Galactic Empire.

                    During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal 
                    secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the 
                    Death Star, an armored space station with enough 
                    power to destroy an entire planet.

                    Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess 
                    Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of 
                    the stolen plans that can save her people and 
                    restore freedom to the galaxy...

               The awesome yellow planet of Tatooine emerges from a total 
               eclipse, her two moons glowing against the darkness. A tiny 
               silver spacecraft, a Rebel Blockade Runner firing lasers 
               from the back of the ship, races through space. It is pursed 
               by a giant Imperial Stardestroyer. Hundreds of deadly 
               laserbolts streak from the Imperial Stardestroyer, causing 
               the main solar fin of the Rebel craft to disintegrate.

               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN PASSAGEWAY

               An explosion rocks the ship as two robots, Artoo-Detoo (R2-
               D2) and See-Threepio (C-3PO) struggle to make their way 
               through the shaking, bouncing passageway. Both robots are 
               old and battered. Artoo is a short, claw-armed tripod. His 
               face is a mass of computer lights surrounding a radar eye. 
               Threepio, on the other hand, is a tall, slender robot of 
               human proportions. He has a gleaming bronze-like metallic 
               surface of an Art Deco design.

               Another blast shakes them as they struggle along their way.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Did you hear that? They've shut down 
                         the main reactor. We'll be destroyed 
                         for sure. This is madness!

               Rebel troopers rush past the robots and take up positions in 
               the main passageway. They aim their weapons toward the door.

                                     THREEPIO
                         We're doomed!

               The little R2 unit makes a series of electronic sounds that 
               only another robot could understand.

                                     THREEPIO
                         There'll be no escape for the Princess 
                         this time.

               Artoo continues making beeping sounds. Tension mounts as 
               loud metallic latches clank and the scream of heavy equipment 
               are heard moving around the outside hull of the ship.

                                     THREEPIO
                         What's that?

               EXT. SPACECRAFT IN SPACE

               The Imperial craft has easily overtaken the Rebel Blockade 
               Runner. The smaller Rebel ship is being drawn into the 
               underside dock of the giant Imperial starship.

               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER

               The nervous Rebel troopers aim their weapons. Suddenly a 
               tremendous blast opens up a hole in the main passageway and 
               a score of fearsome armored spacesuited stormtroopers make 
               their way into the smoke-filled corridor.

               In a few minutes the entire passageway is ablaze with 
               laserfire. The deadly bolts ricochet in wild random patterns 
               creating huge explosions. Stormtroopers scatter and duck 
               behind storage lockers. Laserbolts hit several Rebel soldiers 
               who scream and stagger through the smoke, holding shattered 
               arms and faces.

               An explosion hits near the robots.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I should have known better than to 
                         trust the logic of a half-sized 
                         thermocapsulary dehousing assister...

               Artoo counters with an angry rebuttal as the battle rages 
               around the two hapless robots.

               EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT WASTELAND - DAY

               A death-white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon. 
               The tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settle on a lone 
               figure, Luke Skywalker, a farm boy with heroic aspirations 
               who looks much younger than his eighteen years. His shaggy 
               hair and baggy tunic give him the air of a simple but lovable 
               lad with a prize-winning smile.

               A light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves on a 
               large battered moisture vaporator which sticks out of the 
               desert floor much like an oil pipe with valves. He is aided 
               by a beatup tread-robot with six claw arms. The little robot 
               appears to be barely functioning and moves with jerky motions.  
               A bright sparkle in the morning sky catches Luke's eye and 
               he instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars from his 
               utility belt. He stands transfixed for a few moments studying 
               the heavens, then dashed toward his dented, crudely repaired 
               Landspeeder (an auto-like transport that travels a few feet 
               above the ground on a magnetic-field). He motions for the 
               tiny robot to follow him.

                                     LUKE
                         Hurry up! Come with me! What are you 
                         waiting for?! Get in gear!

               The robot scoots around in a tight circle, stops short, and 
               smoke begins to pour out of every joint. Luke throws his 
               arms up in disgust. Exasperated, the young farm boy jumps 
               into his Landspeeder leaving the smoldering robot to hum 
               madly.

               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN HALLWAY

               The awesome, seven-foot-tall Dark Lord of the Sith makes his 
               way into the blinding light of the main passageway. This is 
               Darth Vader, right hand of the Emperor. His face is obscured 
               by his flowing black robes and grotesque breath mask, which 
               stands out next to the fascist white armored suits of the 
               Imperial stormtroopers. Everyone instinctively backs away 
               from the imposing warrior and a deathly quiet sweeps through 
               the Rebel troops. Several of the Rebel troops break and run 
               in a frenzied panic.

               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER

               A woman's hand puts a card into an opening in Artoo's dome.  
               Artoo makes beeping sounds.

               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER

               Threepio stands in a hallway, somewhat bewildered. Artoo is 
               nowhere in sight. The pitiful screams of the doomed Rebel 
               soldiers can be heard in the distance.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you?

               A familiar clanking sound attacks Threepio's attention and 
               he spots little Artoo at the end of the hallway in a smoke-
               filled alcove. A beautiful young girl (about sixteen years 
               old) stands in front of Artoo. Surreal and out of place, 
               dreamlike and half hidden in the smoke, she finishes adjusting 
               something on Artoo's computer face, then watches as the little 
               robot joins his companion.

                                     THREEPIO
                         At last! Where have you been?

               Stormtroopers can be heard battling in the distance.

                                     THREEPIO
                         They're heading in this direction. 
                         What are we going to do? We'll be 
                         sent to the spice mine of Kessel or 
                         smashed into who knows what!

               Artoo scoots past his bronze friend and races down the 
               subhallway. Threepio chases after him.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Wait a minute, where are you going?

               Artoo responds with electronic beeps.

               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - CORRIDOR

               The evil Darth Vader stands amid the broken and twisted bodies 
               of his foes. He grabs a wounded Rebel Officer by the neck as 
               an Imperial Officer rushes up to the Dark Lord.

                                     IMPERIAL OFFICER
                         The Death Star plans are not in the 
                         main computer.

               Vader squeezes the neck of the Rebel Officer, who struggles 
               in vain.

                                     VADER
                         Where are those transmissions you 
                         intercepted?

               Vader lifts the Rebel off his feet by his throat.

                                     VADER
                         What have you done with those plans?

                         We intercepted no transmissions. 
                         Aaah... This is a consular ship. 
                         Were on a diplomatic mission.

                                     VADER
                         If this is a consular ship... were 
                         is the Ambassador?

               The Rebel refuses to speak but eventually cries out as the 
               Dark Lord begins to squeeze the officer's throat, creating a 
               gruesome snapping and choking, until the soldier goes limp. 
               Vader tosses the dead soldier against the wall and turns to 
               his troops.

                                     VADER
                         Commander, tear this ship apart until 
                         you've found those plans and bring 
                         me the Ambassador. I want her alive!

               The stormtroopers scurry into the subhallways.

               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - SUBHALLWAY

               The lovely young girl huddles in a small alcove as the 
               stormtroopers search through the ship. She is Princess Leia 
               Organa, a member of the Alderaan Senate. The fear in her 
               eyes slowly gives way to anger as the muted crushing sounds 
               of the approaching stormtroopers grow louder. One of the 
               troopers spots her.

                                     TROOPER
                         There she is! Set for stun!

               Leia steps from her hiding place and blasts a trooper with 
               her laser pistol. She starts to run but is felled by a 
               paralyzing ray. The troopers inspect her inert body.

                                     TROOPER
                         She'll be all right. Inform Lord 
                         Vader we have a prisoner.

               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - SUBHALLWAY

               Artoo stops before the small hatch of an emergency lifepod. 
               He snaps the seal on the main latch and a red warning light 
               begins to flash. The stubby astro-robot works his way into 
               the cramped four-man pod.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Hey, you're not permitted in there. 
                         It's restricted. You'll be deactivated 
                         for sure..

               Artoo beeps something to him.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Don't call me a mindless philosopher, 
                         you overweight glob of grease! Now 
                         come out before somebody sees you.

               Artoo whistles something at his reluctant friend regarding 
               the mission he is about to perform.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Secret mission? What plans? What are 
                         you talking about? I'm not getting 
                         in there!

               Artoo isn't happy with Threepio's stubbornness, and he beeps 
               and twangs angrily.

               A new explosion, this time very close, sends dust and debris 
               through the narrow subhallway. Flames lick at Threepio and, 
               after a flurry of electronic swearing from Artoo, the lanky 
               robot jumps into the lifepod.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I'm going to regret this.

               INT. IMPERIAL STARDESTROYER

               On the main viewscreen, the lifepod carrying the two terrified 
               robots speeds away from the stricken Rebel spacecraft.

                                     CHIEF PILOT
                         There goes another one.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Hold your fire. There are no life 
                         forms. It must have been short-
                         circuited.

               INT. LIFEPOD

               Artoo and Threepio look out at the receding Imperial starship.  
               Stars circle as the pod rotates through the galaxy.

                                     THREEPIO
                         That's funny, the damage doesn't 
                         look as bad from out here.

               Artoo beeps an assuring response.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Are you sure this things safe?

               EXT. TATOOINE - ANCHORHEAD SETTLEMENT - POWER STATION - DAY

               Heat waves radiate from the dozen or so bleached white 
               buildings. Luke pilots his Landspeeder through the dusty 
               empty street of the tiny settlement. An old woman runs to 
               get out of the way of the speeding vehicle, shaking her fist 
               at Luke as he flies past.

                                     WOMAN
                         I've told you kids to slow down!

               INT. POWER STATION - DAY

               Luke bursts into the power station, waking The Fixer, a rugged 
               mechanic and Camie, a sexy, disheveled girl who has been 
               asleep in his lap. They grumbled as he races through the 
               office, yelling wildly.

                                     FIXER
                         Did I hear a young noise blast through 
                         here?

                                     CAMIE
                         It was just wormie on another rampage.

               Luke bounces into a small room behind the office where Deak 
               and Windy, two tough boys about the same age as Luke, are 
               playing a computer pool-like game with Biggs, a burly, 
               handsome boy a few years older than the rest. His flashy 
               city attire is a sharp contrast to the loose-fitting tunics 
               of the farm boys. A robot repairs some equipment in the 
               background.

                                     LUKE
                         Shape it up you guys!... Biggs?

               Luke's surprise at the appearance of Biggs gives way to great 
               joy and emotion. They give each other a great bear hug.

                                     LUKE
                         I didn't know you were back! When 
                         did you get in?

                                     BIGGS
                         Just now. I wanted to surprise you, 
                         hot shot. I thought you'd be here... 
                         certainly didn't expect you to be 
                         out working.
                              (he laughs)

                                     LUKE
                         The Academy didn't change you 
                         much...but you're back so soon? Hey, 
                         what happened, didn't you get your 
                         commission?

               Biggs has an air of cool that seems slightly phony.

                                     BIGGS
                         Of course I got it. Signed aboard 
                         The Rand Ecliptic last week. First 
                         mate Biggs Darklighter at your 
                         service...
                              (he salutes)
                         ...I just came to say good-bye to 
                         all you unfortunate landlocked 
                         simpletons.

               Everyone laughs. The dazzling spectacle of his dashing friend 
               is almost too much for Luke, but suddenly he snaps out of 
               it.

                                     LUKE
                         I almost forgot. There's a battle 
                         going on! Right here in our system. 
                         Come and look!

                                     DEAK
                         Not again! Forget it.

               EXT. TATOOINE - ANCHORHEAD - SETTLEMENT - POWER STATION - 
               DAY

               The group stumbles out into the stifling desert sun. Camie 
               and The Fixer complain and are forced to shade their eyes. 
               Luke has his binoculars out scanning the heavens.

                                     LUKE
                         There they are!

               Biggs takes the binoculars from Luke as the others strain to 
               see something with the naked eye. Through the binoculars 
               Biggs sees two small silver specks.

                                     BIGGS
                         That's no battle, hot shot... they're 
                         just sitting there! Probably a 
                         freighter-tanker refueling.

                                     LUKE
                         But there was a lot of firing 
                         earlier...

               Camie grabs the binoculars away banging them against the 
               building in the process. Luke grabs them.

                                     LUKE
                         Hey, easy with those...

                                     CAMIE
                         Don't worry about it, Wormie.

               The Fixer gives Luke a hard look and the young farm boy shrugs 
               his shoulders in resignation.

                                     FIXER
                         I keep telling you, the Rebellion is 
                         a long way from here. I doubt if the 
                         Empire would even fight to keep this 
                         system. Believe me Luke, this planet 
                         is a big hunk of nothing...

               Luke agrees, although it's obvious he isn't sure why. The 
               group stumbles back into the power station, grumbling about 
               Luke's ineptitude.

               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - HALLWAY

               Princess Leia is led down a low-ceilinged hallway by a squad 
               of armored stormtroopers. Her hands are bound and she is 
               brutally shoved when she is unable to keep up with the briskly 
               marching troops. They stop in a smoky hallway as Darth Vader 
               emerges from the shadows. The sinister Dark Lord stares hard 
               at the frail young senator, but she doesn't move.

                                     LEIA
                         Lord Vader, I should have known. 
                         Only you could be so bold. The 
                         Imperial Senate will not sit for 
                         this, when they hear you've attacked 
                         a diplomatic...

                                     VADER
                         Don't play games with me, Your 
                         Highness. You weren't on any mercy 
                         mission this time. You passed directly 
                         through a restricted system. Several 
                         transmissions were beamed to this 
                         ship by Rebel spies. I want to know 
                         what happened to the plans they sent 
                         you.

                                     LEIA
                         I don't know what you're talking 
                         about. I'm a member of the Imperial 
                         Senate on a diplomatic mission to 
                         Alderaan...

                                     VADER
                         You're a part of the Rebel Alliance... 
                         and a traitor. Take her away!

               Leia is marched away down the hallway and into the smoldering 
               hole blasted in the side of the ship. An Imperial Commander 
               turns to Vader.

                                     COMMANDER
                         Holding her is dangerous. If word of 
                         this gets out, it could generate 
                         sympathy for the Rebellion in the 
                         senate.

                                     VADER
                         I have traced the Rebel spies to 
                         her. Now she is my only link to find 
                         their secret base!

                                     COMMANDER
                         She'll die before she tells you 
                         anything.

                                     VADER
                         Leave that to me. Send a distress 
                         signal and then inform the senate 
                         that all aboard were killed!

               Another Imperial Officer approaches Vader and the Commander. 
               They stop and snap to attention.

                                     SECOND OFFICER
                         Lord Vader, the battle station plans 
                         are not aboard this ship! And no 
                         transmissions were made. An escape 
                         pod was jettisoned during the 
                         fighting, but no life forms were 
                         aboard.

               Vader turns to the Commander.

                                     VADER
                         She must have hidden the plans in 
                         the escape pod. Send a detachment 
                         down to retrieve them. See to it 
                         personally, Commander. There'll be 
                         no one to stop us this time.

                                     COMMANDER
                         Yes, sir.

               EXT. SPACE

               The Imperial Stardestroyer comes over the surface of the 
               planet Tatooine.

               EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT

               Jundland, or "No Man's Land", where the rugged desert mesas 
               meet the foreboding dune sea. The two helpless astro-droids 
               kick up clouds of sand as they leave the lifepod and clumsily 
               work their way across the desert wasteland. The lifepod in 
               the distance rests half buried in the sand.

                                     THREEPIO
                         How did I get into this mess? I really 
                         don't know how. We seem to be made 
                         to suffer. It's our lot in life.

               Artoo answers with beeping sounds.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I've got to rest before I fall apart. 
                         My joints are almost frozen.

               Artoo continues to respond with beeping sounds.

                                     THREEPIO
                         What a desolate place this is.

               Suddenly Artoo whistles, makes a sharp right turn and starts 
               off in the direction of the rocky desert mesas. Threepio 
               stops and yells at him.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Where are you going?

               A stream of electronic noises pours forth from the small 
               robot.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Well, I'm not going that way. It's 
                         much too rocky. This way is much 
                         easier.

               Artoo counters with a long whistle.

                                     THREEPIO
                         What makes you think there are 
                         settlements over there?

               Artoo continues to make beeping sounds.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Don't get technical with me.

               Artoo continues to make beeping sounds.

                                     THREEPIO
                         What mission? What are you talking 
                         about? I've had just about enough of 
                         you! Go that way! You'll be 
                         malfunctioning within a day, you 
                         nearsighted scrap pile!

               Threepio gives the little robot a kick and starts off in the 
               direction of the vast dune sea.

                                     THREEPIO
                         And don't let me catch you following 
                         me begging for help, because you 
                         won't get it.

               Artoo's reply is a rather rude sound. He turns and trudges 
               off in the direction of the towering mesas.

                                     THREEPIO
                         No more adventures. I'm not going 
                         that way.

               Artoo beeps to himself as he makes his way toward the distant 
               mountains.

               EXT. TATOOINE - DUNE SEA

               Threepio, hot and tired, struggles up over the ridge of a 
               dune; only to find more dunes, which seem to go on for endless 
               miles.  He looks back in the direction of the now distant 
               rock mesas.

                                     THREEPIO
                         That malfunctioning little twerp. 
                         This is all his fault! He tricked me 
                         into going this way, but he'll do no 
                         better.

               In a huff of anger and frustration, Threepio knocks the sand 
               from his joints. His plight seems hopeless, when a glint of 
               reflected light in the distance reveals an object moving 
               towards him.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Wait, what's that? A transport! I'm 
                         saved!

               The bronze android waves frantically and yells at the 
               approaching transport.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Over here! Help! Please, help!

               EXT. TATOOINE - ANCHORHEAD SETTLEMENT - POWER STATION - DAY

               Luke and Biggs are walking and drinking a malt brew. Fixer 
               and the others can be heard working inside.

                                     LUKE
                              (Very animated)
                         ...so I cut off my power, shut down 
                         the afterburners and came in low on 
                         Deak's trail. I was so close I thought 
                         I was going to fry my instruments. 
                         As it was I busted up the Skyhopper 
                         pretty bad. Uncle Owen was pretty 
                         upset. He grounded me for the rest 
                         of the season. You should have been 
                         there... it was fantastic.

                                     BIGGS
                         You ought to take it easy Luke. You 
                         may be the hottest bushpilot this 
                         side of Mos Eisley, but those little 
                         Skyhoppers are dangerous. Keep it 
                         up, and one day, whammo, you're going 
                         to be nothing more than a dark spot 
                         on the down side of a canyon wall.

                                     LUKE
                         Look who's talking. Now that you've 
                         been around those giant starships 
                         you're beginning to sound like my 
                         uncle. You've gotten soft in the 
                         city...

                                     BIGGS
                         I've missed you kid.

                                     LUKE
                         Well, things haven't been the same 
                         since you left, Biggs. It's been 
                         so... quiet.

               Biggs looks around then leans close to Luke.

                                     BIGGS
                         Luke, I didn't come back just to say 
                         good-bye... I shouldn't tell you 
                         this, but you're the only one I can 
                         trust... and if I don't come back, I 
                         want somebody to know.

               Luke's eyes are wide with Biggs' seriousness and loyalty.

                                     LUKE
                         What are you talking about?

                                     BIGGS
                         I made some friends at the Academy.
                              (he whispers)
                         ...when our frigate goes to one of 
                         the central systems, we're going to 
                         jump ship and join the Alliance...

               Luke, amazed and stunned, is almost speechless.

                                     LUKE
                         Join the Rebellion?! Are you kidding! 
                         How?

                                     BIGGS
                         Quiet down will ya! You got a mouth 
                         bigger than a meteor crater!

                                     LUKE
                         I'm sorry. I'm quiet.
                              (he whispers)
                         Listen how quiet I am. You can barely 
                         hear me...

               Biggs shakes his head angrily and then continues.

                                     BIGGS
                         My friend has a friend on Bestine 
                         who might help us make contact.

                                     LUKE
                         You're crazy! You could wander around 
                         forever trying to find them.

                                     BIGGS
                         I know it's a long shot, but if I 
                         don't find them I'll do what I can 
                         on my own... It's what we always 
                         talked about. Luke, I'm not going to 
                         wait for the Empire to draft me into 
                         service. The Rebellion is spreading 
                         and I want to be on the right side -- 
                         the side I believe in.

                                     LUKE
                         And I'm stuck here...

                                     BIGGS
                         I thought you were going to the 
                         Academy next term. You'll get your 
                         chance to get off this rock.

                                     LUKE
                         Not likely! I had to cancel my 
                         application. There has been a lot of 
                         unrest among the Sandpeople since 
                         you left... they've even raided the 
                         outskirts of Anchorhead.

                                     BIGGS
                         Your uncle could hold off a whole 
                         colony of Sandpeople with one blaster.

                                     LUKE
                         I know, but he's got enough vaporators 
                         going to make the place pay off. He 
                         needs me for just one more season. I 
                         can't leave him now.

                                     BIGGS
                         I feel for you, Luke, you're going 
                         to have to learn what seems to be 
                         important or what really is important. 
                         What good is all your uncle's work 
                         if it's taken over by the Empire?... 
                         You know they're starting to 
                         nationalize commerce in the central 
                         systems... it won't be long before 
                         your uncle is merely a tenant, slaving 
                         for the greater glory of the Empire.

                                     LUKE
                         It couldn't happen here. You said it 
                         yourself. The Empire won't bother 
                         with this rock.

                                     BIGGS
                         Things always change.

                                     LUKE
                         I wish I was going... Are you going 
                         to be around long?

                                     BIGGS
                         No, I'm leaving in the morning...

                                     LUKE
                         Then I guess I won't see you.

                                     BIGGS
                         Maybe someday... I'll keep a lookout.

                                     LUKE
                         Well, I'll be at the Academy next 
                         season... after that who knows. I 
                         won't be drafted into the Imperial 
                         Starfleet that's for sure... Take 
                         care of yourself, you'll always be 
                         the best friend I've got.

                                     BIGGS
                         So long, Luke.

               Biggs turns away from his old friend and heads towards the 
               power station.

               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SUNSET

               The gargantuan rock formations are shrouded in a strange 
               foreboding mist and the onimous sounds of unearthly creatures 
               fill the air. Artoo moves cautiously through the creepy rock 
               canyon, inadvertently making a loud clicking noise as he 
               goes. He hears a distant, hard, metallic sound and stops for 
               a moment. Convinced he is alone, he continues on his way.

               In the distance, a pebble tumbles down the steep canyon wall 
               and a small dark figure darts into the shadows. A little 
               further up the canyon a slight flicker of light reveals a 
               pair of eyes in the dark recesses only a few feet from the 
               narrow path.

               The unsuspecting robot waddles along the rugged trail until 
               suddenly, out of nowhere, a powerful magnetic ray shoots out 
               of the rocks and engulfs him in an eerie glow. He manages 
               one short electronic squeak before he topples over onto his 
               back. His bright computer lights flicker off, then on, then 
               off again. Out of the rocks scurry three Jawas, no taller 
               than Artoo. They holster strange and complex weapons as they 
               cautiously approach the robot. They wear grubby cloaks and 
               their faces are shrouded so only their glowing eyes can be 
               seen. They hiss and make odd guttural sounds as they heave 
               the heavy robot onto their shoulders and carry him off down 
               the trail.

               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SANDCRAWLER - SUNSET

               The eight Jawas carry Artoo out of the canyon to a huge tank-
               like vehicle the size of a four-story house. They weld a 
               small disk on the side of Artoo and then put him under a 
               large tube on the side of the vehicle and the little robot 
               is sucked into the giant machine.

               The filthy little Jawas scurry like rats up small ladders 
               and enter the main cabin of the behemoth transport.

               INT. SANDCRAWLER - HOLD AREA

               It is dim inside the hold area of the Sandcrawler. Artoo 
               switches on a small floodlight on his forehead and stumbles 
               around the scrap heap. The narrow beam swings across rusty 
               metal rocket parts and an array of grotesquely twisted and 
               maimed astro-robots. He lets out a pathetic electronic whimper 
               and stumbles off toward what appears to be a door at the end 
               of the chamber.

               INT. SANDCRAWLER - PRISON AREA

               Artoo enters a wide room with a four-foot ceiling. In the 
               middle of the scrap heap sit a dozen or so robots of various 
               shapes and sizes. Some are engaged in electronic conversation, 
               while others simply mill about. A voice of recognition calls 
               out from the gloom.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Artoo-Detoo! It's you! It's you!

               A battered Threepio scrambles up to Artoo and embraces him.

               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SANDCRAWLER - SUNSET

               The enormous Sandcrawler lumbers off toward the magnificent 
               twin suns, which are slowly setting over a distant mountain 
               ridge.

               EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - DAY

               Four Imperial stormtroopers mill about in front of the half-
               buried lifepod that brought Artoo and Threepio to Tatooine. 
               A trooper yells to an officer some distance away.

                                     FIRST TROOPER
                         Someone was in the pod. The tracks 
                         go off in this direction.

               A second trooper picks a small bit of metal out of the sand 
               and gives it to the first trooper.

                                     SECOND TROOPER
                         Look, sir -- droids.

               EXT. TATOOINE - DUNES

               The Sandcrawler moves slowly down a great sand dune.

               INT. SANDCRAWLER

               Threepio and Artoo noisily bounce along inside the cramped 
               prison chamber. Artoo appears to be shut off.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Wake up! Wake up!

               Suddenly the shaking and bouncing of the Sandcrawler stops, 
               creating quite a commotion among the mechanical men.  
               Threepio's fist bangs the head of Artoo whose computer lights 
               pop on as he begins beeping. At the far end of the long 
               chamber a hatch opens, filling the chamber with blinding 
               white light. a dozen or so Jawas make their way through the 
               odd assortment of robots.

                                     THREEPIO
                         We're doomed.

               A Jawa starts moving toward them.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Do you think they'll melt us down?

               Artoo responds, making beeping sounds.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Will this 
                         never end?

               EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - LARS HOMESTEAD - AFTERNOON

               The Jawas mutter gibberish as they busily line up their 
               battered captives, including Artoo and Threepio, in front of 
               the enormous Sandcrawler, which is parked beside a small 
               homestead consisting of three large holes in the ground 
               surrounded by several tall moisture vaporators and one small 
               adobe block house.

               The Jawas scurry around fussing over the robots, straightening 
               them up or brushing some dust from a dented metallic elbow. 
               The shrouded little creatures smell horribly, attracting 
               small insects to the dark areas when their mouths and nostrils 
               should be.

               Out of the shadows of a dingy side-building limps Owen Lars, 
               a large burly man in his mid-fifties. His reddish eyes are 
               sunken in a dust-covered face. As the farmer carefully 
               inspects each robot, he is closely followed by his slump- 
               shouldered nephew, Luke Skywalker. One of the vile little 
               Jawas walks ahead of the farmer spouting an animated sales 
               pitch in a queer, unintelligible language.

               A voice calls out from one of the huge holes that form the 
               homestead. Luke goes over to the edge and sees his Aunt Beru 
               standing in the main courtyard.

                                     BERU
                         Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a 
                         translator to be sure it speaks Bocce.

                                     LUKE
                         It looks like we don't have much of 
                         a choice but I'll remind him.

               Luke returns to his uncle as they look over the equipment 
               for sale with the Jawa leader.

                                     OWEN
                         I have no need for a protocol droid.

                                     THREEPIO
                              (quickly)
                         Sir -- not in an environment such as 
                         this -- that's why I've also been 
                         programmed for over thirty secondary 
                         functions that...

                                     OWEN
                         What I really need is a droid that 
                         understands the binary language of 
                         moisture vaporators.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Vaporators! Sir -- My first job was 
                         programming binary load lifter... 
                         very similar to your vaporators. You 
                         could say...

                                     OWEN
                         Do you speak Bocce?

                                     THREEPIO
                         Of course I can, sir. It's like a 
                         second language for me... I'm as 
                         fluent in Bocce...

                                     OWEN
                         All right shut up!
                              (turning to Jawa)
                         I'll take this one.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Shutting up, sir.

                                     OWEN
                         Luke, take these two over to the 
                         garage, will you? I want you to have 
                         both of them cleaned up before dinner.

                                     LUKE
                         But I was going into Toshi Station 
                         to pick up some power converters...

                                     OWEN
                         You can waste time with your friends 
                         when your chores are done. Now come 
                         on, get to it!

                                     LUKE
                         All right, come on! And the red one, 
                         come on. Well, come on, Red, let's 
                         go.

               As the Jawas start to lead the three remaining robots back 
               into the Sandcrawler, Artoo lets out a pathetic little beep 
               and starts after his old friend Threepio. He is restrained 
               by a slimy Jawa, who zaps him with a control box.

               Owen is negotiating with the head Jawa. Luke and the two 
               robots start off for the garage when a plate pops off the 
               head of the red astro-droid's head plate and it sparks wildly.

                                     LUKE
                         Uncle Owen...

                                     OWEN
                         Yeah?

                                     LUKE
                         This R2 unit has a bad motivator. 
                         Look!

                                     OWEN
                              (to the head Jawa)
                         Hey, what're you trying to push on 
                         us?

               The Jawa goes into a loud spiel. Meanwhile, Artoo has sneaked 
               out of line and is moving up and down trying to attract 
               attention. He lets out with a low whistle. Threepio taps 
               Luke on the shoulder.

                                     THREEPIO
                              (pointing to Artoo)
                         Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is 
                         in prime condition. A real bargain.

                                     LUKE
                         Uncle Owen...

                                     OWEN
                         Yeah?

                                     LUKE
                         What about that one?

                                     OWEN
                              (to Jawa)
                         What about that blue one? We'll take 
                         that one.

               With a little reluctance the scruffy dwarf trades the damaged 
               astro-droid for Artoo.

                                     LUKE
                         Yeah, take it away.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very 
                         pleased with that one, sir. He really 
                         is in first-class condition. I've 
                         worked with him before. Here he comes.

               Owen pays off the whining Jawa as Luke and the two robots 
               trudge off toward a grimy homestead entry.

                                     LUKE
                         Okay, let's go.

                                     THREEPIO
                              (to Artoo)
                         Now, don't you forget this! Why I 
                         should stick my neck out for you is 
                         quite beyond my capacity!

               INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - GARAGE AREA - LATE AFTERNOON

               The garage is cluttered and worn, but a friendly peaceful 
               atmosphere permeates the low grey chamber. Threepio lowers 
               himself into a large tub filled with warm oil. Near the 
               battered Landspeeder little Artoo rests on a large battery 
               with a cord to his face.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Thank the maker! This oil bath is 
                         going to feel so good. I've got such 
                         a bad case of dust contamination, I 
                         can barely move!

               Artoo beeps a muffled reply. Luke seems to be lost in thought 
               as he runs his hand over the damaged fin of a small two-man 
               Skyhopper spaceship resting in a low hangar off the garage. 
               Finally Luke's frustrations get the better of him and he 
               slams a wrench across the workbench.

                                     LUKE
                         It just isn't fair. Oh, Biggs is 
                         right. I'm never gonna get out of 
                         here!

                                     THREEPIO
                         Is there anything I might do to help?

               Luke glances at the battered robot. A bit of his anger drains 
               and a tiny smile creeps across his face.

                                     LUKE
                         Well, not unless you can alter time, 
                         speed up the harvest, or teleport me 
                         off this rock!

                                     THREEPIO
                         I don't think so, sir. I'm only a 
                         droid and not very knowledgeable 
                         about such things. Not on this planet, 
                         anyways. As a matter of fact, I'm 
                         not even sure which planet I'm on.

                                     LUKE
                         Well, if there's a bright center to 
                         the universe, you're on the planet 
                         that it's farthest from.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I see, sir.

                                     LUKE
                         Uh, you can call me Luke.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I see, sir Luke.

                                     LUKE
                              (laughing)
                         Just Luke.

                                     THREEPIO
                         And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg 
                         relations, and this is my counterpart, 
                         Artoo-Detoo.

                                     LUKE
                         Hello.

               Artoo beeps in response. Luke unplugs Artoo and begins to 
               scrape several connectors on the robot's head with a chrome 
               pick. Threepio climbs out of the oil tub and begins wiping 
               oil from his bronze body.

                                     LUKE
                         You got a lot of carbon scoring here. 
                         It looks like you boys have seen a 
                         lot of action.

                                     THREEPIO
                         With all we've been through, sometimes 
                         I'm amazed we're in as good condition 
                         as we are, what with the Rebellion 
                         and all.

                                     LUKE
                         You know of the Rebellion against 
                         the Empire?

                                     THREEPIO
                         That's how we came to be in your 
                         service, if you take my meaning, 
                         sir.

                                     LUKE
                         Have you been in many battles?

                                     THREEPIO
                         Several, I think. Actually, there's 
                         not much to tell. I'm not much more 
                         than an interpreter, and not very 
                         good at telling stories. Well, not 
                         at making them interesting, anyways.

               Luke struggles to remove a small metal fragment from Artoo's 
               neck joint. He uses a larger pick.

                                     LUKE
                         Well, my little friend, you've got 
                         something jammed in here real good. 
                         Were you on a cruiser or...

               The fragment breaks loose with a snap, sending Luke tumbling 
               head over heels. He sits up and sees a twelve-inch three-
               dimensional hologram of Leia Organa, the Rebel senator, being 
               projected from the face of little Artoo. The image is a 
               rainbow of colors as it flickers and jiggles in the dimly 
               lit garage. Luke's mouth hangs open in awe.

                                     LEIA
                         Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my 
                         only hope.

                                     LUKE
                         What's this?

               Artoo looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer for Threepio 
               to translate. Leia continues to repeat the sentence fragment 
               over and over.

                                     THREEPIO
                         What is what?!? He asked you a 
                         question...
                              (pointing to Leia)
                         What is that?

               Artoo whistles his surprise as he pretends to just notice 
               the hologram. He looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer 
               for Threepio to translate. Leia continues to repeat the 
               sentence fragment over and over.

                                     LEIA
                         Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my 
                         only hope. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. 
                         You're my only hope.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Oh, he says it's nothing, sir. Merely 
                         a malfunction. Old data. Pay it no 
                         mind.

               Luke becomes intrigued by the beautiful girl.

                                     LUKE
                         Who is she? She's beautiful.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.

                                     LEIA
                         Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi...

                                     THREEPIO
                         I think she was a passenger on our 
                         last voyage. A person of some 
                         importance, sir -- I believe. Our 
                         captain was attached to...

                                     LUKE
                         Is there more to this recording?

               Luke reaches out for Artoo but he lets out several frantic 
               squeaks and a whistle.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Behave yourself, Artoo. You're going 
                         to get us in trouble. It's all right, 
                         you can trust him. He's our new 
                         master.

               Artoo whistles and beeps a long message to Threepio.

                                     THREEPIO
                         He says he's the property of Obi-Wan 
                         Kenobi, a resident of these parts. 
                         And it's a private message for him. 
                         Quite frankly, sir I don't know what 
                         he's talking about. Our last master 
                         was Captain Antilles, but with what 
                         we've been through, this little R2 
                         unit has become a bit eccentric.

                                     LUKE
                         Obi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if he means 
                         old Ben Kenobi?

                                     THREEPIO
                         I beg your pardon, sir, but do you 
                         know what he's talking about?

                                     LUKE
                         Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-
                         Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond 
                         the dune sea. He's kind of a strange 
                         old hermit.

               Luke's gazes at the beautiful young princess for a few 
               moments.

                                     LUKE
                         I wonder who she is. It sounds like 
                         she's in trouble. I'd better play 
                         back the whole thing.

               Artoo beeps something to Threepio.

                                     THREEPIO
                         He says the restraining bolt has 
                         short circuited his recording system. 
                         He suggests that if you remove the 
                         bolt, he might be able to play back 
                         the entire recording.

               Luke looks longingly at the lovely, little princess and hasn't 
               really heard what Threepio has been saying.

                                     LUKE
                         H'm? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're 
                         too small to run away on me if I 
                         take this off! Okay.

               Luke takes a wedged bar and pops the restraining bolt off 
               Artoo's side.

                                     LUKE
                         There you go.

               The princess immediately disappears...

                                     LUKE
                         Well, wait a minute. Where'd she go? 
                         Bring her back! Play back the entire 
                         message.

               Artoo beeps an innocent reply as Threepio sits up in 
               embarrassment.

                                     THREEPIO
                         What message? The one you're carrying 
                         inside your rusty innards!

               A women's voice calls out from another room.

                                     AUNT BERU
                         Luke? Luke! Come to dinner!

               Luke stands up and shakes his head at the malfunctioning 
               robot.

                                     LUKE
                         All right, I'll be right there, Aunt 
                         Beru.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to 
                         have picked up a slight flutter.

               Luke tosses Artoo's restraining bolt on the workbench and 
               hurries out of the room.

                                     LUKE
                         Well, see what you can do with him. 
                         I'll be right back.

                                     THREEPIO
                              (to Artoo)
                         Just you reconsider playing that 
                         message for him.

               Artoo beeps in response.

                                     THREEPIO
                         No, I don't think he likes you at 
                         all.

               Artoo beeps.

                                     THREEPIO
                         No, I don't like you either.

               INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - DINING AREA

               Luke's Aunt Beru, a warm, motherly woman, fills a pitcher 
               with blue fluid from a refrigerated container in the well-
               used kitchen. She puts the pitcher on a tray with some bowls 
               of food and starts for the dining area.

               Luke sits with his Uncle Owen before a table covered with 
               steaming bowls of food as Aunt Beru carries in a bowl of red 
               grain.

                                     LUKE
                         You know, I think that R2 unit we 
                         bought might have been stolen.

                                     OWEN
                         What makes you think that?

                                     LUKE
                         Well, I stumbled across a recording 
                         while I was cleaning him. He says he 
                         belongs to someone called Obi-Wan 
                         Kenobi.

               Owen is greatly alarmed at the mention of his name, but 
               manages to control himself.

                                     LUKE
                         I thought he might have meant old 
                         Ben. Do you know what he's talking 
                         about? Well, I wonder if he's related 
                         to Ben.

               Owen breaks loose with a fit of uncontrolled anger.

                                     OWEN
                         That old man's just a crazy old 
                         wizard. Tomorrow I want you to take 
                         that R2 unit into Anchorhead and 
                         have its memory flushed. That'll be 
                         the end of it. It belongs to us now.

                                     LUKE
                         But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking 
                         for him?

                                     OWEN
                         He won't, I don't think he exists 
                         any more. He died about the same 
                         time as your father.

                                     LUKE
                         He knew my father?

                                     OWEN
                         I told you to forget it. Your only 
                         concern is to prepare the new droids 
                         for tomorrow. In the morning I want 
                         them on the south ridge working out 
                         those condensers.

                                     LUKE
                         Yes, sir. I think those new droids 
                         are going to work out fine. In fact, 
                         I, uh, was also thinking about our 
                         agreement about my staying on another 
                         season. And if these new droids do 
                         work out, I want to transmit my 
                         application to the Academy this year.

               Owen's face becomes a scowl, although he tries to suppress 
               it.

                                     OWEN
                         You mean the next semester before 
                         harvest?

                                     LUKE
                         Sure, there're more than enough 
                         droids.

                                     OWEN
                         Harvest is when I need you the most. 
                         Only one more season. This year we'll 
                         make enough on the harvest so I'll 
                         be able to hire some more hands. And 
                         then you can go to the Academy next 
                         year.

               Luke continues to toy with his food, not looking at his uncle.

                                     OWEN
                         You must understand I need you here, 
                         Luke.

                                     LUKE
                         But it's a whole 'nother year.

                                     OWEN
                         Look, it's only one more season.

               Luke pushes his half-eaten plate of food aside and stands.

                                     LUKE
                         Yeah, that's what you said last year 
                         when Biggs and Tank left.

                                     AUNT BERU
                         Where are you going?

                                     LUKE
                         It looks like I'm going nowhere. I 
                         have to finish cleaning those droids.

               Resigned to his fate, Luke paddles out of the room. Owen 
               mechanically finishes his dinner.

                                     AUNT BERU
                         Owen, he can't stay here forever. 
                         Most of his friends have gone. It 
                         means so much to him.

                                     OWEN
                         I'll make it up to him next year. I 
                         promise.

                                     AUNT BERU
                         Luke's just not a farmer, Owen. He 
                         has too much of his father in him.

                                     OWEN
                         That's what I'm afraid of.

               EXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD

               The giant twin suns of Tatooine slowly disappear behind a 
               distant dune range. Luke stands watching them for a few 
               moments, then reluctantly enters the doomed entrance to the 
               homestead.

               INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - GARAGE

               Luke enters the garage to discover the robots nowhere in 
               sight. He takes a small control box from his utility belt 
               similar to the one the Jawas were carrying. He activates the 
               box, which creates a low hum, and Threepio, letting out a 
               short yell, pops up from behind the Skyhopper spaceship.

                                     LUKE
                         What are you doing hiding there?

               Threepio stumbles forward, but Artoo is still nowhere in 
               sight.

                                     THREEPIO
                         It wasn't my fault, sir. Please don't 
                         deactivate me. I told him not to go, 
                         but he's faulty, malfunctioning; 
                         kept babbling on about his mission.

                                     LUKE
                         Oh, no!

               Luke races out of the garage followed by Threepio.

               EXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD

               Luke rushes out of the small doomed entry to the homestead 
               and searches the darkening horizon for the small triped astro-
               robot. Threepio struggles out of the homestead and on the 
               salt flat as Luke scans the landscape with his 
               electrobinoculars.

                                     THREEPIO
                         That R2 unit has always been a 
                         problem. These astro-droids are 
                         getting quite out of hand. Even I 
                         can't understand their logic at times.

                                     LUKE
                         How could I be so stupid? He's nowhere 
                         in sight. Blast it!

                                     THREEPIO
                         Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go 
                         after him?

                                     LUKE
                         It's too dangerous with all the 
                         Sandpeople around. We'll have to 
                         wait until morning.

               Owen yells up from the homestead plaza.

                                     OWEN
                         Luke, I'm shutting the power down 
                         for the night.

                                     LUKE
                         All right, I'll be there in a few 
                         minutes. Boy, am I gonna get it.

               He takes one final look across the dim horizon.

                                     LUKE
                         You know that little droid is going 
                         to cause me a lot of trouble.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Oh, he excels at that, sir.

               INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - PLAZA

               Morning slowly creeps into the sparse but sparkling oasis of 
               the open courtyard. The idyll is broken be the yelling of 
               Uncle Owen, his voice echoing throughout the homestead.

                                     OWEN
                         Luke? Luke? Luke? Where could he be 
                         loafing now!

               INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - KITCHEN

               The interior of the kitchen is a worm glow as Aunt Beru 
               prepares the morning breakfast. Owen enters in a huff.

                                     OWEN
                         Have you seen Luke this morning?

                                     AUNT BERU
                         He said he had some things to do 
                         before he started today, so he left 
                         early.

                                     OWEN
                         Uh? Did he take those two new droids 
                         with him?

                                     AUNT BERU
                         I think so.

                                     OWEN
                         Well, he'd better have those units 
                         in the south range repaired be midday 
                         or there'll be hell to pay!

               EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT WASTELAND - LUKE'S SPEEDER - DAY

               The rock and sand of the desert floor are a blur as Threepio 
               pilots the sleek Landspeeder gracefully across the vast 
               wasteland.

               INT./EXT. LUKE'S SPEEDER - DESERT WASTELAND - TRAVELING - 
               DAY

               Luke leans over the back of the speeder and adjusts something 
               in the motor compartment.

                                     LUKE
                              (yelling)
                         How's that.

               Threepio signals that is fine and Luke turns back into the 
               wind-whipped cockpit and pops the canopy shut.

                                     LUKE
                         Old Ben Kenobi lives out in this 
                         direction somewhere, but I don't see 
                         how that R2 unit could have come 
                         this far. We must have missed him. 
                         Uncle Owen isn't going to take this 
                         very well.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Sir, would it help if you told him 
                         it was my fault.

                                     LUKE
                              (brightening)
                         Sure. He needs you. He'd probably 
                         only deactivate you for a day or 
                         so...

                                     THREEPIO
                         Deactivate! Well, on the other hand 
                         if you hadn't removed his restraining 
                         bolt...

                                     LUKE
                         Wait, there's something dead ahead 
                         on the scanner. It looks like our 
                         droid... hit the accelerator.

               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK MESA - DUNE SEA - COASTLINE - DAY

               From high on a rock mesa, the tiny Landspeeder can be seen 
               gliding across the desert floor. Suddenly in the foreground 
               two weather-beaten Sandpeople shrouded in their grimy desert 
               cloaks peer over the edge of the rock mesa. One of the 
               marginally human creatures raises a long ominous laser rifle 
               and points it at the speeder but the second creature grabs 
               the gun before it can be fired.

               The Sandpeople, or Tusken Raiders as they're sometimes called, 
               speak in a coarse barbaric language as they get into an 
               animated argument. The second Tusken Raider seems to get in 
               the final word and the nomads scurry over the rocky terrain.

               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK MESA - CANYON

               The Tusken Raider approaches two large Banthas standing tied 
               to a rock. The monstrous, bear-like creatures are as large 
               as elephants, with huge red eyes, tremendous looped horns, 
               and long, furry, dinosaur-like tails. The Tusken Raiders 
               mount saddles strapped to the huge creatures' shaggy backs 
               and ride off down the rugged bluff.

               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - FLOOR

               The speeder is parked on the floor of a massive canyon. Luke, 
               with his long laser rifle slung over his shoulder, stands 
               before little Artoo.

                                     LUKE
                         Hey, whoa, just where do you think 
                         you're going?

               The little droid whistles a feeble reply, as Threepio poses 
               menacingly behind the little runaway.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Master Luke here is your rightful 
                         owner. We'll have no more of this 
                         Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and don't 
                         talk to me about your mission, either. 
                         You're fortunate he doesn't blast 
                         you into a million pieces right here.

                                     LUKE
                         Well, come on. It's getting late. I 
                         only hope we can get back before 
                         Uncle Owen really blows up.

                                     THREEPIO
                         If you don't mind my saying so, sir, 
                         I think you should deactivate the 
                         little fugitive until you've gotten 
                         him back to your workshop.

                                     LUKE
                         No, he's not going to try anything.

               Suddenly the little robot jumps to life with a mass of frantic 
               whistles and screams.

                                     LUKE
                         What's wrong with him now?

                                     THREEPIO
                         Oh my... sir, he says there are 
                         several creatures approaching from 
                         the southeast.

               Luke swings his rifle into position and looks to the south.

                                     LUKE
                         Sandpeople! Or worst! Come on, let's 
                         have a look. Come on.

               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - RIDGE - DAY

               Luke carefully makes his way to the top of a rock ridge and 
               scans the canyon with his electrobinoculars. He spots the 
               two riderless Banthas. Threepio struggles up behind the young 
               adventurer.

                                     LUKE
                         There are two Banthas down there but 
                         I don't see any... wait a second, 
                         they're Sandpeople all right. I can 
                         see one of them now.

               Luke watches the distant Tusken Raider through his 
               electrobinoculars. Suddenly something huge moves in front of 
               his field of view. Before Luke or Threepio can react, a large, 
               gruesome Tusken Raider looms over them. Threepio is startled 
               and backs away, right off the side if the cliff. He can be 
               heard for several moments as he clangs, bangs and rattles 
               down the side of the mountain.

               The towering creature brings down his curved, double-pointed 
               gaderffii -- the dreaded axe blade that has struck terror in 
               the heart of the local settlers. But Luke manages to block 
               the blow with his laser rifle, which is smashed to pieces. 
               The terrified farm boy scrambles backward until he is forced 
               to the edge of a deep crevice. The sinister Raider stands 
               over him with his weapon raised and lets out a horrible 
               shrieking laugh.

               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - FLOOR - DAY

               Artoo forces himself into the shadows of a small alcove in 
               the rocks as the vicious Sandpeople walk past carrying the 
               inert Luke Skywalker, who is dropped in a heap before the 
               speeder.  The Sandpeople ransack the speeder, throwing parts 
               and supplies in all directions. Suddenly they stop. Then 
               everything is quiet for a few moments. A great howling moan 
               is heard echoing throughout the canyon which sends the 
               Sandpeople fleeing in terror.

               Artoo moves even tighter into the shadows as the slight 
               swishing sound that frightened off the Sandpeople grows even 
               closer, until a shabby old desert-rat-of-a-man appears and 
               leans over Luke. His ancient leathery face, cracked and 
               weathered by exotic climates is set off by dark, penetrating 
               eyes and a scraggly white beard. Ben Kenobi squints his eyes 
               as he scrutinizes the unconscious farm boy. Artoo makes a 
               slight sound and Ben turns and looks right at him.

                                     BEN
                         Hello there! Come here my little 
                         friend. Don't be afraid.

               Artoo waddles over to were Luke lies crumpled in a heap and 
               begins to whistle and beep his concern. Ben puts his hand on 
               Luke's forehead and he begins to come around.

                                     BEN
                         Don't worry, he'll be all right.

                                     LUKE
                         What happened?

                                     BEN
                         Rest easy, son, you've had a busy 
                         day. You're fortunate you're still 
                         in one piece.

                                     LUKE
                         Ben? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to 
                         see you!

                         The Jundland wastes are not to be 
                         traveled lightly. Tell me young Luke, 
                         what brings you out this far?

                                     LUKE
                         Oh, this little droid! I think he's 
                         searching for his former master... 
                         I've never seen such devotion in a 
                         droid before... there seems to be no 
                         stopping him. He claims to be the 
                         property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he 
                         a relative of yours? Do you know who 
                         he's talking about?

               Ben ponders this for a moment, scratching his scruffy beard.

                                     BEN
                         Obi-Wan Kenobi... Obi-Wan? Now thats 
                         a name I haven't heard in a long 
                         time... a long time.

                                     LUKE
                         I think my uncle knew him. He said 
                         he was dead.

                                     BEN
                         Oh, he's not dead, not... not yet.

                                     LUKE
                         You know him!

                                     BEN
                         Well of course, of course I know 
                         him. He's me! I haven't gone by the 
                         name Obi-Wan since oh, before you 
                         were born.

                                     LUKE
                         Then the droid does belong to you.

                                     BEN
                         Don't seem to remember ever owning a 
                         droid. Very interesting...

               He suddenly looks up at the overhanging cliffs.

                                     BEN
                         I think we better get indoors. The 
                         Sandpeople are easily startled but 
                         they will soon be back and in greater 
                         numbers.

               Luke sits up and rubs his head. Artoo lets out a pathetic 
               beep causing Luke to remember something. He looks around.

                                     LUKE
                         Threepio!

               EXT. TATOOINE - SAND PIT - ROCK MESA - DAY

               Little Artoo stands at the edge of a large sand pit and begins 
               to chatter away in electronic whistles and beeps. Luke and 
               Ben stand over a very dented and tangled Threepio lying half 
               buried in the sand. One of his arms has broken off.

               Luke tries to revive the inert robot by shaking him and then 
               flips a hidden switch on his back several times until finally 
               the mechanical man's systems turn on.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Where am I? I must have taken a bad 
                         step...

                                     LUKE
                         Can you stand? We've got to get out 
                         of here before the Sandpeople return.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I don't think I can make it. You go 
                         on, Master Luke. There's no sense in 
                         you risking yourself on my account. 
                         I'm done for.

               Artoo makes a beeping sound.

                                     LUKE
                         No, you're not. What kind of talk is 
                         that?

               Luke and Ben help the battered robot to his feet. Little 
               Artoo watches from the top of the pit. Ben glances around 
               suspiciously. Sensing something, he stands up and sniffs the 
               air.

                                     BEN
                         Quickly, son... they're on the move.

               INT. KENOBI'S DWELLING

               The small, spartan hovel is cluttered with desert junk but 
               still manages to radiate an air of time-worn comfort and 
               security. Luke is in one corner repairing Threepio's arm, as 
               old Ben sits thinking.

                                     LUKE
                         No, my father didn't fight in the 
                         wars. He was a navigator on a spice 
                         freighter.

                                     BEN
                         That's what your uncle told you. He 
                         didn't hold with your father's ideals. 
                         Thought he should have stayed here 
                         and not gotten involved.

                                     LUKE
                         You fought in the Clone Wars?

                                     BEN
                         Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the 
                         same as your father.

                                     LUKE
                         I wish I'd known him.

                                     BEN
                         He was the best star-pilot in the 
                         galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I 
                         understand you've become quite a 
                         good pilot yourself. And he was a 
                         good friend. Which reminds me...

               Ben gets up and goes to a chest where he rummages around.  
               As Luke finishes repairing Threepio and starts to fit the 
               restraining bolt back on, Threepio looks at him nervously.  
               Luke thinks about the bolt for a moment then puts it on the 
               table. Ben shuffles up and presents Luke with a short handle 
               with several electronic gadgets attached to it.

                                     BEN
                         I have something here for you. Your 
                         father wanted you to have this when 
                         you were old enough, but your uncle 
                         wouldn't allow it. He feared you 
                         might follow old Obi-Wan on some 
                         damned-fool idealistic crusade like 
                         your father did.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Sir, if you'll not be needing me, 
                         I'll close down for awhile.

                                     LUKE
                         Sure, go ahead.

               Ben hands Luke the saber.

                                     LUKE
                         What is it?

                                     BEN
                         Your fathers lightsaber. This is the 
                         weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy 
                         or as random as a blaster.

               Luke pushes a button on the handle. A long beam shoots out 
               about four feet and flickers there. The light plays across 
               the ceiling.

                                     BEN
                         An elegant weapon for a more civilized 
                         time. For over a thousand generations 
                         the Jedi Knights were the guardians 
                         of peace and justice in the Old 
                         Republic. Before the dark times, 
                         before the Empire.

               Luke hasn't really been listening.

                                     LUKE
                         How did my father die?

                                     BEN
                         A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who 
                         was a pupil of mine until he turned 
                         to evil, helped the Empire hunt down 
                         and destroy the Jedi Knights. He 
                         betrayed and murdered your father. 
                         Now the Jedi are all but extinct. 
                         Vader was seduced by the dark side 
                         of the Force.

                                     LUKE
                         The Force?

                                     BEN
                         Well, the Force is what gives a Jedi 
                         his power. It's an energy field 
                         created by all living things. It 
                         surrounds us and penetrates us. It 
                         binds the galaxy together.

               Artoo makes beeping sounds.

                                     BEN
                         Now, let's see if we can't figure 
                         out what you are, my little friend. 
                         And where you come from.

                                     LUKE
                         I saw part of the message he was...

               Luke is cut short as the recorded image of the beautiful 
               young Rebel princess is projected from Artoo's face.

                                     BEN
                         I seem to have found it.

               Luke stops his work as the lovely girl's image flickers before 
               his eyes.

                                     LEIA
                         General Kenobi, years ago you served 
                         my father in the Clone Wars. Now he 
                         begs you to help him in his struggle 
                         against the Empire. I regret that I 
                         am unable to present my father's 
                         request to you in person, but my 
                         ship has fallen under attack and I'm 
                         afraid my mission to bring you to 
                         Alderaan has failed. I have placed 
                         information vital to the survival of 
                         the Rebellion into the memory systems 
                         of this R2 unit. My father will know 
                         how to retrieve it. You must see 
                         this droid safely delivered to him 
                         on Alderaan. This is our most 
                         desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan 
                         Kenobi, you're my only hope.

               There is a little static and the transmission is cut short.  
               Old Ben leans back and scratches his head. He silently puffs 
               on a tarnished chrome water pipe. Luke has stars in his eyes.

                                     BEN
                         You must learn the ways of the Force 
                         if you're to come with me to Alderaan.

                                     LUKE
                              (laughing)
                         Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. 
                         I've got to go home. It's late, I'm 
                         in for it as it is.

                         I need your help, Luke. She needs 
                         your help. I'm getting too old for 
                         this sort of thing.

                         I can't get involved! I've got work 
                         to do! It's not that I like the 
                         Empire. I hate it! But there's nothing 
                         I can do about it right now. It's 
                         such a long way from here.

                              (sighing)
                         Oh, God, my uncle. How am I ever 
                         going to explain this?

                                     BEN
                         Learn about the Force, Luke.

                                     LUKE
                         Look, I can take you as far as 
                         Anchorhead. You can get a transport 
                         there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're 
                         going.

                                     BEN
                         You must do what you feel is right, 
                         of course.

               An Imperial Stardestroyer heads toward the evil planet-like 
               battle station: the Death Star!

               INT. DEATH STAR - CONFERENCE ROOM

               Eight Imperial senators and generals sit around a black 
               conference table. Imperial stormtroopers stand guard around 
               the room. Commander Tagge, a young, slimy-looking general, 
               is speaking.

                                     TAGGE
                         Until this battle station is fully 
                         operational we are vulnerable. The 
                         Rebel Alliance is too well equipped. 
                         They're more dangerous than you 
                         realize.

               The bitter Admiral Motti twists nervously in his chair.

                         Dangerous to your starfleet, 
                         Commander, not to this battle station!

                                     TAGGE
                         The Rebellion will continue to gain 
                         a support in the Imperial Senate as 
                         long as....

               Suddenly all heads turn as Commander Tagge's speech is cut 
               short and the Grand Moff Tarkin, governor of the Imperial 
               outland regions, enters. He is followed by his powerful ally, 
               The Sith Lord, Darth Vader. All of the generals stand and 
               bow before the thin, evil-looking governor as he takes his 
               place at the head of the table. The Dark Lord stands behind 
               him.

                                     TARKIN
                         The Imperial Senate will no longer 
                         be of any concern to us. I've just 
                         received word that the Emperor has 
                         dissolved the council permanently. 
                         The last remnants of the Old Republic 
                         have been swept away.

                                     TAGGE
                         That's impossible! How will the 
                         Emperor maintain control without the 
                         bureaucracy?

                                     TARKIN
                         The regional governors now have direct 
                         control over territories. Fear will 
                         keep the local systems in line. Fear 
                         of this battle station.

                                     TAGGE
                         And what of the Rebellion? If the 
                         Rebels have obtained a complete 
                         technical readout of this station, 
                         it is possible, however unlikely, 
                         that they might find a weakness and 
                         exploit it.

                                     VADER
                         The plans you refer to will soon be 
                         back in our hands.

                                     MOTTI
                         Any attack made by the Rebels against 
                         this station would be a useless 
                         gesture, no matter what technical 
                         data they've obtained. This station 
                         is now the ultimate power in the 
                         universe. I suggest we use it!

                                     VADER
                         Don't be too proud of this 
                         technological terror you've 
                         constructed. The ability to destroy 
                         a planet is insignificant next to 
                         the power of the Force.

                                     MOTTI
                         Don't try to frighten us with your 
                         sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader. Your 
                         sad devotion to that ancient religion 
                         has not helped you conjure up the 
                         stolen data tapes, or given you 
                         clairvoyance enough to find the 
                         Rebel's hidden fort...

               Suddenly Motti chokes and starts to turn blue under Vader's 
               spell.

                                     VADER
                         I find your lack of faith disturbing.

                                     TARKIN
                         Enough of this! Vader, release him!

                                     VADER
                         As you wish.

                                     TARKIN
                         This bickering is pointless. Lord 
                         Vader will provide us with the 
                         location of the Rebel fortress by 
                         the time this station is operational. 
                         We will then crush the Rebellion 
                         with one swift stroke.

               EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND

               The speeder stops before what remains of the huge Jawas 
               Sandcrawler. Luke and Ben walk among the smoldering rubble 
               and scattered bodies.

                                     LUKE
                         It looks like Sandpeople did this, 
                         all right. Look, here are Gaffi 
                         sticks, Bantha tracks. It's just... 
                         I never heard of them hitting anything 
                         this big before.

               Ben is crouching in the sand studying the tracks.

                                     BEN
                         They didn't. But we are meant to 
                         think they did. These tracks are 
                         side by side. Sandpeople always ride 
                         single file to hide there numbers.

                                     LUKE
                         These are the same Jawas that sold 
                         us Artoo and Threepio.

                                     BEN
                         And these blast points, too accurate 
                         for Sandpeople. Only Imperial 
                         stormtroopers are so precise.

                                     LUKE
                         Why would Imperial troops want to 
                         slaughter Jawas?

               Luke looks back at the speeder where Artoo and Threepio are 
               inspecting the dead Jawas, and put two and two together.

                                     LUKE
                         If they traced the robots here, they 
                         may have learned who they sold them 
                         to. And that would lead them home!

               Luke reaches a sudden horrible realization, then races for 
               the speeder and jumps it.

                                     BEN
                         Wait, Luke! It's too dangerous.

               Luke races off leaving Ben and the two robots alone with the 
               burning Sandcrawler.

               EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND

               Luke races across the wasteland in his battered Landspeeder.

               EXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD

               The speeder roars up to the burning homestead. Luke jumps 
               out and runs to the smoking holes that were once his home. 
               Debris is scattered everywhere and it looks as if a great 
               battle has taken place.

                                     LUKE
                         Uncle Owen! Aunt Beru! Uncle Owen!

               Luke stumbles around in a daze looking for his aunt and uncle. 
               Suddenly he comes upon their smoldering remains. He is 
               stunned, and cannot speak. Hate replaces fear and a new 
               resolve comes over him.

               EXT. SPACE

               Imperial TIE fighter races toward the Death Star.

               INT. DEATH STAR - DETENTION CORRIDOR

               Two stormtroopers open an electronic cell door and allow 
               several Imperial guards to enter. Princess Leia's face is 
               filled with defiance, which slowly gives way to fear as a 
               giant black torture robot enters, followed by Darth Vader.

                                     VADER
                         And, now Your Highness, we will 
                         discuss the location of your hidden 
                         Rebel base.

               The torture robot gives off a steady beeping sound as it 
               approaches Princess Leia and extends one of its mechanical 
               arms bearing a large hypodermic needle. The door slides shut 
               and the long cell block hallway appears peaceful. The muffled 
               screams of the Rebel princess are barely heard.

               EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND

               There is a large bonfire of Jawa bodies blazing in front of 
               the Sandcrawler as Ben and the robots finish burning the 
               dead.  Luke drives up in the speeder and Ben walks over to 
               him.

                                     BEN
                         There's nothing you could have done, 
                         Luke, had you been there. You'd have 
                         been killed, too, and the droids 
                         would be in the hands of the Empire.

                                     LUKE
                         I want to come with you to Alderaan. 
                         There's nothing here for me now. I 
                         want to learn the ways of the Force 
                         and become a Jedi like my father.

               EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND

               The Landspeeder with Luke, Artoo, Threepio, and Ben in it 
               zooms across the desert. The speeder stops on a bluff 
               overlooking the spaceport at Mos Eisley. It is a haphazard 
               array of low, grey, concrete structures and semi-domes. A 
               harsh gale blows across the stark canyon floor. Luke adjusts 
               his goggles and walks to the edge of the craggy bluff where 
               Ben is standing.

                                     BEN
                         Mos Eisley Spaceport. You will never 
                         find a more wretched hive of scum 
                         and villainy. We must be cautious.

               Ben looks over at Luke, who gives the old Jedi a determined 
               smile.

               EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET

               The speeder is stopped on a crowded street by several combat-
               hardend stormtroopers who look over the two robots. A Trooper 
               questions Luke.

                                     TROOPER
                         How long have you had these droids?

                                     LUKE
                         About three or four seasons.

                                     BEN
                         They're for sale if you want them.

                                     TROOPER
                         Let me see your identification.

               Luke becomes very nervous as he fumbles to find his ID while 
               Ben speaks to the Trooper in a very controlled voice.

                                     BEN
                         You don't need to see his 
                         identification.

                                     TROOPER
                         We don't need to see his 
                         identification.

                                     BEN
                         These are not the droids your looking 
                         for.

                                     TROOPER
                         These are not the droids we're looking 
                         for.

                                     BEN
                         He can go about his business.

                                     TROOPER
                         You can go about your business.

                                     BEN
                              (to Luke)
                         Move along.

                         Move along. Move along.

               EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET

               The speeder pulls up in front of a rundown blockhouse cantina 
               on the outskirts of the spaceport. Various strange forms of 
               transport, including several unusual beasts of burden, are 
               parked outside the bar. A Jawa runs up and begins to fondle 
               the speeder.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I can't abide these Jawas. Disgusting 
                         creatures.

               As Luke gets out of the speeder he tries to shoo the Jawa 
               away.

                                     LUKE
                         Go on, go on. I can't understand how 
                         we got by those troopers. I thought 
                         we were dead.

                                     BEN
                         The Force can have a strong influence 
                         on the weak-minded. You will find it 
                         a powerful ally.

                                     LUKE
                         Do you really think we're going to 
                         find a pilot here that'll take us to 
                         Alderaan?

                                     BEN
                         Well, most of the best freighter 
                         pilots can be found here. Only watch 
                         your step. This place can be a little 
                         rough.

                                     LUKE
                         I'm ready for anything.

                         Come along, Artoo.

               INT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - CANTINA

               The young adventurer and his two mechanical servants follow 
               Ben Kenobi into the smoke-filled cantina. The murky, moldy 
               den is filled with a startling array of weird and exotic 
               alien creatures and monsters at the long metallic bar. At 
               first the sight is horrifying. One-eyed, thousand-eyed, slimy, 
               furry, scaly, tentacled, and clawed creatures huddle over 
               drinks. Ben moves to an empty spot at the bar near a group 
               of repulsive but human scum. A huge, rough-looking Bartender 
               stops Luke and the robots.

                                     BARTENDER
                         We don't serve their kind here!

               Luke still recovering from the shock of seeing so many 
               outlandish creatures, doesn't quite catch the bartender's 
               drift.

                                     LUKE
                         What?

                                     BARTENDER
                         Your droids. They'll have to wait 
                         outside. We don't want them here.

               Luke looks at old Ben, who is busy talking to one of the 
               Galactic pirates. He notices several of the gruesome creatures 
               along the bar are giving him a very unfriendly glare.

               Luke pats Threepio on the shoulder.

                                     LUKE
                         Listen, why don't you wait out by 
                         the speeder. We don't want any 
                         trouble.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I heartily agree with you sir.

               Threepio and his stubby partner go outside and most of the 
               creatures at the bar go back to their drinks.

               Ben is standing next to Chewbacca, an eight-foot-tall savage-
               looking creature resembling a huge grey bushbaby monkey with 
               fierce baboon-like fangs. His large blue eyes dominate a fur-
               covered face and soften his otherwise awesome appearance.  
               Over his matted, furry body he wears two chrome bandoliers, 
               and little else. He is a two-hundred-year-old Wookiee and a 
               sight to behold.

               Ben speaks to the Wookiee, pointing to Luke several times 
               during his conversation and the huge creature suddenly lets 
               out a horrifying laugh. Luke is more than a little bit 
               disconcerted and pretends not to hear the conversation between 
               Ben and the giant Wookiee.

               Luke is terrified but tries not to show it. He quietly sips 
               his drink, looking over the crowd for a more sympathetic ear 
               or whatever.

               A large, multiple-eyed Creature gives Luke a rough shove.

                                     CREATURE
                         Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!?

               The hideous freak is obviously drunk. Luke tries to ignore 
               the creature and turns back on his drink. A short, grubby 
               Human and an even smaller rodent-like beast join the 
               belligerent monstrosity.

                                     HUMAN
                         He doesn't like you.

                                     LUKE
                         I'm sorry.

                                     HUMAN
                         I don't like you either.

               The big creature is getting agitated and yells out some 
               unintelligible gibberish at the now rather nervous, young 
               adventurer.

                                     HUMAN
                         Don't insult us. You just watch 
                         yourself. We're wanted men. I have 
                         the death sentence in twelve systems.

                                     LUKE
                         I'll be careful than.

                                     HUMAN
                         You'll be dead.

               The rodent lets out a loud grunt and everything at the bar 
               moves away. Luke tries to remain cool but it isn't easy. His 
               three adversaries ready their weapons. Old Ben moves in behind 
               Luke.

                                     BEN
                         This little one isn't worth the 
                         effort. Come let me buy you 
                         something...

               A powerful blow from the unpleasant creature sends the young 
               would-be Jedi sailing across the room, crashing through tables 
               and breaking a large jug filled with a foul-looking liquid. 
               With a blood curdling shriek, the monster draws a wicked 
               chrome laser pistol from his belt and levels it at old Ben. 
               The bartender panics.

                                     BARTENDER
                         No blasters! No blaster!

               With astounding agility old Ben's laser sword sparks to life 
               and in a flash an arm lies on the floor. The rodent is cut 
               in two and the giant multiple-eyed creature lies doubled, 
               cut from chin to groin. Ben carefully and precisely turns 
               off his laser sword and replaces it on his utility belt. 
               Luke, shaking and totally amazed at the old man's abilities, 
               attempts to stand. The entire fight has lasted only a matter 
               of seconds. The cantina goes back to normal, although Ben is 
               given a respectable amount of room at the bar. Luke, rubbing 
               his bruised head, approaches the old man with new awe. Ben 
               points the the Wookiee.

                                     BEN
                         This is Chewbacca. He's first-mate 
                         on a ship that might suit our needs.

               EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET

               Threepio paces in front of the cantina as Artoo carries on 
               an electronic conversation with another little red astro-
               droid. A creature comes out of the cantina and approaches 
               two stormtroopers in the street.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I don't like the look of this.

               INT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - CANTINA

               Strange creatures play exotic big band music on odd-looking 
               instruments as Luke, still giddy, downs a fresh drink and 
               follows Ben and Chewbacca to a booth where Han Solo is 
               sitting. Han is a tough, roguish starpilot about thirty years 
               old. A mercenary on a starship, he is simple, sentimental, 
               and cocksure.

                                     HAN
                         Han Solo. I'm captain of the 
                         Millennium Falcon. Chewie here tells 
                         me you're looking for passage to the 
                         Alderaan system.

                                     BEN
                         Yes, indeed. If it's a fast ship.

                                     HAN
                         Fast ship? You've never heard of the 
                         Millennium Falcon?

                                     BEN
                         Should I have?

                                     HAN
                         It's the ship that made the Kessel 
                         run in less than twelve parsecs!

               Ben reacts to Solo's stupid attempt to impress them with 
               obvious misinformation.

                                     HAN
                         I've outrun Imperial starships, not 
                         the local bulk-cruisers, mind you. 
                         I'm talking about the big Corellian 
                         ships now. She's fast enough for 
                         you, old man. What's the cargo?

                                     BEN
                         Only passengers. Myself, the boy, 
                         two droids, and no questions asked.

                                     HAN
                         What is it? Some kind of local 
                         trouble?

                                     BEN
                         Let's just say we'd like to avoid 
                         any Imperial entanglements.

                                     HAN
                         Well, that's the trick, isn't it? 
                         And it's going to cost you something 
                         extra. Ten thousand in advance.

                                     LUKE
                         Ten thousand? We could almost buy 
                         our own ship for that!

                                     HAN
                         But who's going to fly it, kid! You?

                                     LUKE
                         You bet I could. I'm not such a bad 
                         pilot myself! We don't have to sit 
                         here and listen...

                                     BEN
                         We haven't that much with us. But we 
                         could pay you two thousand now, plus 
                         fifteen when we reach Alderaan.

                                     HAN
                         Seventeen, huh!

               Han ponders this for a few moments.

                                     HAN
                         Okay. You guys got yourself a ship. 
                         We'll leave as soon as you're ready. 
                         Docking bay Ninety-four.

                                     BEN
                         Ninety-four.

                                     HAN
                         Looks like somebody's beginning to 
                         take an interest in your handiwork.

               Ben and Luke turn around to see four Imperial stormtroopers 
               looking at the dead bodies and asking the bartenders some 
               questions. The bartender points to the booth.

                                     TROOPER
                         All right, we'll check it out.

               The stormtroopers look over at the booth but Luke and Ben 
               are gone. The bartender shrugs his shoulders in puzzlement.

                                     HAN
                         Seventeen thousand! Those guys must 
                         really be desperate. This could really 
                         save my neck. Get back to the ship 
                         and get her ready.

                         That's okay. I'm never coming back 
                         to this planet again.

               INT. MOS EISLEY - CANTINA

               As Han is about to leave, Greedo, a slimy green-faced alien 
               with a short trunk-nose, pokes a gun in his side. The creature 
               speaks in a foreign tongue translated into English subtitles.

                                     GREEDO
                         Going somewhere, Solo?

                                     HAN
                         Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I 
                         was just going to see your boss. 
                         Tell Jabba that I've got his money.

               Han sits down and the alien sits across from him holding the 
               gun on him.

                                     GREEDO
                         It's too late. You should have paid 
                         him when you had the chance. Jabba's 
                         put a price on your head, so large 
                         that every bounty hunter in the galaxy 
                         will be looking for you. I'm lucky I 
                         found you first.

                                     HAN
                         Yeah, but this time I got the money.

                                     GREEDO
                         If you give it to me, I might forget 
                         I found you.

                                     HAN
                         I don't have it with me. Tell Jabba...

                                     GREEDO
                         Jabba's through with you. He has no 
                         time for smugglers who drop their 
                         shipments at the first sign of an 
                         Imperial cruiser.

                                     HAN
                         Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you 
                         think I had a choice?

               Han Solo slowly reaches for his gun under the table.

                                     GREEDO
                         You can tell that to Jabba. He may 
                         only take your ship.

                                     HAN
                         Over my dead body.

                                     GREEDO
                         That's the idea. I've been looking 
                         forward to killing you for a long 
                         time.

                                     HAN
                         Yes, I'll bet you have.

               Suddenly the slimy alien disappears in a blinding flash of 
               light. Han pulls his smoking gun from beneath the table as 
               the other patron look on in bemused amazement. Han gets up 
               and starts out of the cantina, flipping the bartender some 
               coins as he leaves.

                                     HAN
                         Sorry about the mess.

                         systems are operational. What course 
                         shall we set?

                                     TARKIN
                         Perhaps she would respond to an 
                         alternative form of persuasion.

                         What do you mean?

                                     TARKIN
                         I think it is time we demonstrate 
                         the full power of this station.

                                     TROOPER
                         With pleasure.

               EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET

               Four heavily-armed stormtroopers move menacingly along a 
               narrow slum alleyway crowed with darkly clad creatures hawking 
               exotic goods in the dingy little stalls. Men, monsters, and 
               robots crouch in the waste-filled doorways, whispering and 
               hiding from the hot winds.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Lock the door, Artoo.

               One of the troopers checks a tightly locked door and moves 
               on down the alleyway. The door slides open a crack and 
               Threepio peeks out. Artoo is barely visible in the background.

                                     TROOPER
                         All right, check that side of the 
                         street. It's secure. Move on to the 
                         next door.

               The door opens, Threepio moves into the doorway.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I would much rather have gone with 
                         Master Luke than stay here with you. 
                         I don't know what all the trouble is 
                         about, but I'm sure it must be your 
                         fault.

               Artoo makes beeping sounds.

                                     THREEPIO
                         You watch your language!

               EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET - ALLEYWAY - USED 
               SPEEDER LOT

               Ben and Luke are standing in a sleazy used speeder lot, 
               talking with a tall, grotesque, insect-like used speeder 
               dealer. Strange exotic bodies and spindly-legged beasts pass 
               by as the insect concludes the sale by giving Luke some coins.

                                     LUKE
                         He says it's the best he can do. 
                         Since the XP-38 came out, they're 
                         just not in demand.

                                     BEN
                         It will be enough.

               Ben and Luke leave the speeder lot and walk down the dusty 
               alleyway past a small robot herding a bunch of anteater-like 
               creatures. Luke turns and gives one last forlorn look at his 
               faithful speeder as he rounds a corner. A darkly clad creature 
               moves out of the shadows as they pass and watches them as 
               they disappear down another alley.

                                     BEN
                         If the ship's as fast as he's 
                         boasting, we ought to do well.

               INT. DOCKING BAY 94 - DAY

               Jabba the Hut and a half-dozen grisly alien pirates and purple 
               creatures stand in the middle of the docking bay. Jabba is 
               the grossest of the slavering hulks and his scarred face is 
               a grim testimonial to his prowess as a vicious killer. He is 
               a fat, slug-like creature with eyes on extended feelers and 
               a huge ugly mouth.

                                     JABBA
                         Come on out, Solo!

               A voice from directly behind the pirates startles them and 
               they turn around to see Han Solo and the giant Wookiee, 
               Chewbacca, standing behind them with no weapons in sight.

                                     HAN
                         I've been waiting for you, Jabba.

                                     JABBA
                         I expected you would be.

                                     HAN
                         I'm not the type to run.

                                     JABBA
                              (fatherly-smooth)
                         Han, my boy, there are times when 
                         you disappoint me... why haven't you 
                         paid me? And why did you have to fry 
                         poor Greedo like that... after all 
                         we've been through together.

                                     HAN
                         You sent Greedo to blast me.

                                     JABBA
                              (mock surprise)
                         Han, why you're the best smuggler in 
                         the business. You're too valuable to 
                         fry. He was only relaying my concern 
                         at your delays. He wasn't going to 
                         blast you.

                                     HAN
                         I think he thought he was. Next time 
                         don't send one of those twerps. If 
                         you've got something to say to me, 
                         come see me yourself.

                                     JABBA
                         Han, Han! If only you hadn't had to 
                         dump that shipment of spice... you 
                         understand I just can't make an 
                         exception. Where would I be if every 
                         pilot who smuggled for me dumped 
                         their shipment at the first sign of 
                         an Imperial starship? It's not good 
                         business.

                                     HAN
                         You know, even I get boarded 
                         sometimes, Jabba. I had no choice, 
                         but I've got a charter now and I can 
                         pay you back, plus a little extra. I 
                         just need some more time.

                                     JABBA
                              (to his men)
                         Put your blasters away. Han, my boy, 
                         I'm only doing this because you're 
                         the best and I need you. So, for an 
                         extra, say twenty percent I'll give 
                         you a little more time... but this 
                         is it. If you disappoint me again, 
                         I'll put a price on your head so 
                         large you won't be able to go near a 
                         civilized system for the rest of 
                         your short life.

                                     HAN
                         Jabba, I'll pay you because it's my 
                         pleasure.

               EXT. DOCKING PORT ENTRY - ALLEYWAY

               Chewbacca waits restlessly at the entrance to Docking Bay 
               94.  Ben, Luke, and the robots make their way up the street.  
               Chewbacca jabbers excitedly and signals for them to hurry. 
               The darkly clad creature has followed them from the speeder 
               lot.  He stops in a nearby doorway and speaks into a small 
               transmitter.

               INT. MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT - DOCKING BAY 94

               Chewbacca leads the group into a giant dirt pit that is 
               Docking Bay 94. Resting in the middle of the huge hole is a 
               large, round, beat-up, pieced-together hunk of junk that 
               could only loosely be called a starship.

                                     LUKE
                         What a piece of junk.

               The tall figure of Han Solo comes down the boarding ramp.

                                     HAN
                         She'll make point five beyond the 
                         speed of light. She may not look 
                         like much, but she's got it where it 
                         counts, kid. I've added some special 
                         modifications myself.

               Luke scratches his head. It's obvious he isn't sure about 
               all this. Chewbacca rushes up the ramp and urges the others 
               to follow.

                                     HAN
                         We're a little rushed, so if you'll 
                         hurry aboard we'll get out of here.

               The group rushes up the gang plank, passing a grinning Han 
               Solo.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON

               Chewbacca settles into the pilot's chair and starts the mighty 
               engines of the starship.

               INT. MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT - DOCKING BAY 94

               Luke, Ben, Threepio, and Artoo move toward the Millennium 
               Falcon passing Solo.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Hello, sir.

               EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET

               Eight Imperial stormtroopers rush up to the darkly clad 
               creature.

                                     TROOPER
                         Which way?

               The darkly clad creature points to the door of the docking 
               bay.

                                     TROOPER
                         All right, men. Load your weapons!

               INT. MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT - DOCKING BAY 94]

               The troops hold their guns at the ready and charge down the 
               docking bay entrance.

                                     TROOPER
                         Stop that ship!

               Han Solo looks up and sees the Imperial stormtroopers rushing 
               into the docking bay. Several of the troopers fire at Han as 
               he ducks into the spaceship.

                                     TROOPER
                         Blast 'em!

               Han draws his laser pistol and pops off a couple of shots 
               which force the stormtroopers to dive for safety. The 
               pirateship engines whine as Han hits the release button that 
               slams the overhead entry shut.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON

                                     HAN
                         Chewie, get us out of here!

               The group straps in for take off.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much I 
                         hate space travel.

               EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREETS

               The half-dozen stormtroopers at a check point hear the general 
               alarm and look to the sky as the huge starship rises above 
               the dingy slum dwellings and quickly disappears into the 
               morning sky.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

               Han climbs into the pilot's chair next to Chewbacca, who 
               chatters away as he points to something on the radar scope.

               EXT. SPACE - PLANET TATOOINE

               The Corellian pirateship zooms from Tatooine into space.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

               Han frantically types information into the ship's computer.  
               Little Artoo appears momentarily at the cockpit doorway, 
               makes a few beeping remarks, then scurries away.

                                     HAN
                         It looks like an Imperial cruiser. 
                         Our passengers must be hotter than I 
                         thought. Try and hold them off. Angle 
                         the deflector shield while I make 
                         the calculations for the jump to 
                         light speed.

               EXT. SPACE - PLANET TATOOINE

               The Millennium Falcon pirateship races away from the yellow 
               planet, Tatooine. It is followed by two huge Imperial 
               stardestroyers.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

               Over the shoulders of Chewbacca and Han, we can see the galaxy 
               spread before them. Luke and Ben make their way into the 
               cramped cockpit where Han continues his calculation.

                                     HAN
                         Stay sharp! There are two more coming 
                         in; they're going to try to cut us 
                         off.

                                     LUKE
                         Why don't you outrun them? I thought 
                         you said this thing was fast.

                                     HAN
                         Watch your mouth, kid, or you're 
                         going to find yourself floating home. 
                         We'll be safe enough once we make 
                         the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I 
                         know a few maneuvers. We'll lose 
                         them!

               EXT. SPACE - PLANET TATOOINE

               Imperial cruisers fire at the pirateship.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

               The ship shudders as an explosion flashes outside the window.

                                     HAN
                         Here's where the fun begins!

                                     BEN
                         How long before you can make the 
                         jump to light speed?

                                     HAN
                         It'll take a few moments to get the 
                         coordinates from the navi-computer.

               The ship begins to rock violently as lasers hit it.

                                     LUKE
                         Are you kidding? At the rate they're 
                         gaining...

                                     HAN
                         Traveling through hyperspace isn't 
                         like dusting crops, boy! Without 
                         precise calculations we could fly 
                         right through a star or bounce too 
                         close to a supernova and that'd end 
                         your trip real quick, wouldn't it?

               The ship is now constantly battered with laserfire as a red 
               warning light begins to flash.

                                     LUKE
                         What's that flashing?

                                     HAN
                         We're losing our deflector shield. 
                         Go strap yourself in, I'm going to 
                         make the jump to light speed.

               The galaxy brightens and they move faster, almost as if 
               crashing a barrier. Stars become streaks as the pirateship 
               makes the jump to hyperspace.

               EXT. SPACE

               The Millennium Falcon zooms into infinity in less than a 
               second.

               EXT. DEATH STAR

               Alderaan looms behind the Death Star battlestation.

               INT. DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM

               Admiral Motti enters the quiet control room and bows before 
               Governor Tarkin, who stands before the huge wall screen 
               displaying a small green planet.

                                     MOTTI
                         We've entered the Alderaan system.

               Vader and two stormtroopers enter with Princess Leia. Her 
               hands are bound.

                                     LEIA
                         Governor Tarkin, I should have 
                         expected to find you holding Vader's 
                         leash. I recognized your foul stench 
                         when I was brought on board.

                                     TARKIN
                         Charming to the last. You don't know 
                         how hard I found it signing the order 
                         to terminate your life!

                                     LEIA
                         I surprised you had the courage to 
                         take the responsibility yourself!

                                     TARKIN
                         Princess Leia, before your execution 
                         I would like you to be my guest at a 
                         ceremony that will make this battle 
                         station operational. No star system 
                         will dare oppose the Emperor now.

                                     LEIA
                         The more you tighten your grip, 
                         Tarkin, the more star systems will 
                         slip through your fingers.

                                     TARKIN
                         Not after we demonstrate the power 
                         of this station. In a way, you have 
                         determined the choice of the planet 
                         that'll be destroyed first. Since 
                         you are reluctant to provide us with 
                         the location of the Rebel base, I 
                         have chosen to test this station's 
                         destructive power... on your home 
                         planet of Alderaan.

                                     LEIA
                         No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no 
                         weapons. You can't possibly...

                                     TARKIN
                         You would prefer another target? A 
                         military target? Then name the system!

               Tarkin waves menacingly toward Leia.

                                     TARKIN
                         I grow tired of asking this. So it'll 
                         be the last time. Where is the Rebel 
                         base?

               Leia overhears an intercom voice announcing the approach to 
               Alderaan.

                                     LEIA
                              (softly)
                         Dantooine.

               Leia lowers her head.

                                     LEIA
                         They're on Dantooine.

                                     TARKIN
                         There. You see Lord Vader, she can 
                         be reasonable.
                              (addressing Motti)
                         Continue with the operation. You may 
                         fire when ready.

                                     LEIA
                         What?

                                     TARKIN
                         You're far too trusting. Dantooine 
                         is too remote to make an effective 
                         demonstration. But don't worry. We 
                         will deal with your Rebel friends 
                         soon enough.

                                     LEIA
                         No!

               INT. DEATH STAR - BLAST CHAMBER

                                     VADER
                         Commence primary ignition.

               A button is pressed which switches on a panel of lights. A 
               hooded Imperial soldier reaches overhead and pulls a lever.  
               Another lever is pulled. Vader reaches for still another 
               lever and a bank of lights on a panel and wall light up. A 
               huge beam of light emanates from within a cone-shaped area 
               and converges into a single laser beam out toward Alderaan. 
               The small green planet of Alderaan is blown into space dust.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - CENTRAL HOLD AREA

               Ben watches Luke practice the lightsaber with a small "seeker" 
               robot. Ben suddenly turns away and sits down. He falters, 
               seems almost faint.

                                     LUKE
                         Are you all right? What's wrong?

                                     BEN
                         I felt a great disturbance in the 
                         Force... as if millions of voices 
                         suddenly cried out in terror and 
                         were suddenly silenced. I fear 
                         something terrible has happened.

               Ben rubs his forehead. He seems to drift into a trance. Then 
               he fixes his gaze on Luke.

                                     BEN
                         You'd better get on with your 
                         exercises.

               Han Solo enters the room.

                                     HAN
                         Well, you can forget your troubles 
                         with those Imperial slugs. I told 
                         you I'd outrun 'em.

               Luke is once again practicing with the lightsaber.

                                     HAN
                         Don't everyone thank me at once.

               Threepio watches Chewbacca and Artoo who are engrossed in a 
               game in which three-dimensional holographic figures move 
               along a chess-type board.

                                     HAN
                         Anyway, we should be at Alderaan 
                         about oh-two-hundred hours.

               Chewbacca and the two robots sit around the lighted table 
               covered with small holographic monsters. Each side of the 
               table has a small computer monitor embedded in it. Chewbacca 
               seems very pleased with himself as he rests his lanky fur- 
               covered arms over his head.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Now be careful, Artoo.

               Artoo immediately reaches up and taps the computer with his 
               stubby claw hand, causing one of the holographic creatures 
               to walk to the new square. A sudden frown crosses Chewbacca's 
               face and he begins yelling gibberish at the tiny robot. 
               Threepio intercedes on behalf of his small companion and 
               begins to argue with the huge Wookiee.

                                     THREEPIO
                         He made a fair move. Screaming about 
                         it won't help you.

                                     HAN
                              (interrupting)
                         Let him have it. It's not wise to 
                         upset a Wookiee.

                                     THREEPIO
                         But sir, nobody worries about 
                         upsetting a droid.

                                     HAN
                         That's 'cause droids don't pull 
                         people's arms out of their socket 
                         when they lose. Wookiees are known 
                         to do that.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I see your point, sir. I suggest a 
                         new strategy, Artoo. Let the Wookiee 
                         win.

               Luke stands in the middle of the small hold area; he seems 
               frozen in place. A humming lightsaber is held high over his 
               head. Ben watches him from the corner, studying his movements.  
               Han watches with a bit of smugness.

                                     BEN
                         Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force 
                         flowing through him.

                                     LUKE
                         You mean it controls your actions?

                                     BEN
                         Partially. But it also obeys your 
                         commands.

               Suspended at eye level, about ten feet in front of Luke, a 
               "seeker", a chrome baseball-like robot covered with antennae, 
               hovers slowly in a wide arc. The ball floats to one side of 
               the youth then the other. Suddenly it makes a lightning-swift 
               lunge and stops within a few feet of Luke's face. Luke doesn't 
               move and the ball backs off. It slowly moves behind the boy, 
               then makes another quick lunge, this time emitting a blood 
               red laser beam as it attacks. It hits Luke in the leg causing 
               him to tumble over. Han lets loose with a burst of laughter.

                                     HAN
                         Hokey religions and ancient weapons 
                         are no match for a good blaster at 
                         your side, kid.

                                     LUKE
                         You don't believe in the Force, do 
                         you?

                                     HAN
                         Kid, I've flown from one side of 
                         this galaxy to the other. I've seen 
                         a lot of strange stuff, but I've 
                         never seen anything to make me believe 
                         there's one all-powerful force 
                         controlling everything. There's no 
                         mystical energy field that controls 
                         my destiny.

               Ben smiles quietly.

                                     HAN
                         It's all a lot of simple tricks and 
                         nonsense.

                                     BEN
                         I suggest you try it again, Luke.

               Ben places a large helmet on Luke's head which covers his 
               eyes.

                                     BEN
                         This time, let go your conscious 
                         self and act on instinct.

                                     LUKE
                              (laughing)
                         With the blast shield down, I can't 
                         even see. How am I supposed to fight?

                                     BEN
                         Your eyes can deceive you. Don't 
                         trust them.

               Han skeptically shakes his head as Ben throws the seeker 
               into the air. The ball shoots straight up in the air, then 
               drops like a rock. Luke swings the lightsaber around blindly 
               missing the seeker, which fires off a laserbolt which hits 
               Luke square on the seat of the pants. He lets out a painful 
               yell and attempts to hit the seeker.

                                     BEN
                         Stretch out with your feelings.

               Luke stands in one place, seemingly frozen. The seeker makes 
               a dive at Luke and, incredibly, he managed to deflect the 
               bolt. The ball ceases fire and moves back to its original 
               position.

                         thing as luck.

                         Look, going good against remotes is 
                         one thing. Going good against the

                         Our scout ships have reached 
                         Dantooine. They found the remains of 
                         a Rebel base, but they estimate that 
                         it has been deserted for some time. 
                         They are now conducting an extensive 
                         search of the surrounding systems.

                         I told you she would never consciously 
                         betray the Rebellion.

               EXT. HYPERSPACE

               The pirateship is just coming out of hyperspace; a strange 
               surreal light show surrounds the ship.

                         Stand by, Chewie, here we go. Cut in 
                         the sublight engines.

               Han pulls back on a control lever. Outside the cockpit window 
               stars begin streaking past, seem to decrease in speed, then 
               stop. Suddenly the starship begins to shudder and violently 
               shake about. Asteroids begin to race toward them, battering 
               the sides of the ship.

                                     HAN
                         What the...? Aw, we've come out of 
                         hyperspace into a meteor shower. 
                         Some kind of asteroid collision. 
                         It's not on any of the charts.

               The Wookiee flips off several controls and seems very cool 
               in the emergency. Luke makes his way into the bouncing 
               cockpit.

                         Thats what I'm trying to tell you, 
                         kid. It ain't there. It's been totally 
                         blown away.

                         What? How?

               Ben moves into the cockpit behind Luke as the ship begins to 
               settle down.

                                     BEN

                         The entire starfleet couldn't destroy 
                         the whole planet. It'd take a thousand 
                         ships with more fire power than 
                         I've...

               A signal starts flashing on the control panel and a muffled 
               alarm starts humming.

                                     HAN
                         There's another ship coming in.

                                     LUKE
                         Maybe they know what happened.

                                     BEN
                         It's an Imperial fighter.

               Chewbacca barks his concern. A huge explosion bursts outside 
               the cockpit window, shaking the ship violently. A tiny, finned 
               Imperial TIE fighter races past the cockpit window.

                                     LUKE
                         It followed us!

                         No. It's a short range fighter.

                         it's transmissions.

                         It'd be as well to let it go. It's 
                         too far out of range.

               The pirateship zooms over the camera and away into the 
               vastness of space after the Imperial TIE fighter.

               The tension mounts as the pirateship gains on the tiny 
               fighter. In the distance, one of the stars becomes brighter 
               until it is obvious that the TIE ship is heading for it. Ben

               The TIE fighter is losing ground to the larger pirateship as 
               they race toward camera and disappear over head.

               The distant star can be distinguished as a small moon or 
               planet.

                         there... he's almost in range.

               The small moon begins to take on the appearance of a monstrous

                         It's too big to be a space station.

               The pirateship shudders and the TIE fighter accelerates away 
               toward the gargantuan battle station.

                         Get me a scanning crew in here on 
                         the double. I want every part of 
                         this ship checked!

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - HALLWAY

               A trooper runs through the hallway heading for the exit. In 
               a few moments all is quiet. The muffled sounds of a distant 
               officer giving orders finally fade. Two floor panels suddenly 
               pop up revealing Han Solo and Luke. Ben Kenobi sticks his 
               head out of a third locker.

                                     LUKE
                         Boy, it's lucky you had these 
                         compartments.

                                     HAN
                         I use them for smuggling. I never 
                         thought I'd be smuggling myself in 
                         them. This is ridiculous. Even if I 
                         could take off, I'd never get past 
                         the tractor beam.

                                     BEN
                         Leave that to me!

                                     HAN
                         Damn fool. I knew that you were going 
                         to say that!

                                     BEN
                         Who's the more foolish... the fool 
                         or the fool who follows him?

               Han shakes his head, muttering to himself. Chewbacca agrees.

               INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY

               The crewmen carry a heavy box on board the ship, past the 
               two stormtroopers guarding either side of the ramp.

                                     TROOPER
                         The ship's all yours. If the scanners 
                         pick up anything, report it 
                         immediately. All right, let's go.

               The crewmen enter the pirateship and a loud crashing sound 
               is followed by a voice calling to the guard below.

                                     HAN'S VOICE
                         Hey down there, could you give us a 
                         hand with this?

               The stormtroopers enter the ship and a quick round of gunfire 
               is heard.

               INT. DEATH STAR - FORWARD BAY - COMMAND OFFICE

               In a very small command office near the entrance to the 
               pirateship, a Gantry Officer looks out his window and notices 
               the guards are missing. He speaks into the comlink.

                                     GANTRY OFFICER
                         TX-four-one-two. Why aren't you at 
                         your post? TX-four-one-two, do you 
                         copy?

               A stormtrooper comes down the ramp of the pirateship and 
               waves to the gantry officer, pointing to his ear indicating 
               his comlink is not working. The gantry officer shakes his 
               head in disgust and heads for the door, giving his aide an 
               annoyed look.

                                     GANTRY OFFICER
                         Take over. We've got a bad 
                         transmitter. I'll see what I can do.

               As the officer approaches the door, it slides open revealing 
               the towering Chewbacca. The gantry officer, in a momentary 
               state of shock, stumbles backward. With a bone- chilling 
               howl, the giant Wookiee flattens the officer with one blow. 
               The aide immediately reaches for his pistol, but is blasted 
               by Han, dressed as an Imperial stormtrooper. Ben and the 
               robots enter the room quickly followed by Luke, also dressed 
               as a stormtrooper. Luke quickly removes his helmet.

                                     LUKE
                         You know, between his howling and 
                         your blasting everything in sight, 
                         it's a wonder the whole station 
                         doesn't know we're here.

                                     HAN
                         Bring them on! I prefer a straight 
                         fight to all this sneaking around.

                                     THREEPIO
                         We found the computer outlet, sir.

               Ben feeds some information into the computer and a map of 
               the city appears on the monitor. He begins to inspect it 
               carefully. Threepio and Artoo look over the control panel.  
               Artoo finds something that makes him whistle wildly.

                                     BEN
                         Plug in. He should be able to 
                         interpret the entire Imperial computer 
                         network.

               Artoo punches his claw arm into the computer socket and the 
               vast Imperial brain network comes to life, feeding information 
               to the little robot. After a few moments, he beeps something.

                                     THREEPIO
                         He says he's found the main computer 
                         to power the tractor beam that's 
                         holding the ship here. He'll try to 
                         make the precise location appear on 
                         the monitor.

               The computer monitor flashes readouts.

                                     THREEPIO
                         The tractor beam is coupled to the 
                         main reactor in seven locations. A 
                         power loss at one of the terminals 
                         will allow the ship to leave.

               Ben studies the data on the monitor readout.

                                     BEN
                         I don't think you boys can help. I 
                         must go alone.

                                     HAN
                         Whatever you say. I've done more 
                         that I bargained for on this trip 
                         already.

                                     LUKE
                         I want to go with you.

                                     BEN
                         Be patient, Luke. Stay and watch 
                         over the droids.

                                     LUKE
                         But he can...

                                     BEN
                         They must be delivered safely or 
                         other star systems will suffer the 
                         same fate as Alderaan. Your destiny 
                         lies along a different path than 
                         mine. The Force will be with you... 
                         always!

               Ben adjusts the lightsaber on his belt and silently steps 
               out of the command office, then disappears down a long grey 
               hallway. Chewbacca barks a comment and Han shakes his head 
               in agreement.

                                     HAN
                         Boy you said it, Chewie.

               Han looks at Luke.

                                     HAN
                         Where did you dig up that old fossil?

                                     LUKE
                         Ben is a great man.

                                     HAN
                         Yeah, great at getting us into 
                         trouble.

                                     LUKE
                         I didn't hear you give any ideas...

                                     HAN
                         Well, anything would be better than 
                         just hanging around waiting for him 
                         to pick us up...

                                     LUKE
                         Who do you think...

               Suddenly Artoo begins to whistle and beep a blue streak.  
               Luke goes over to him.

                                     LUKE
                         What is it?

                                     THREEPIO
                         I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. 
                         He says "I found her", and keeps 
                         repeating, "She's here."

                                     LUKE
                         Well, who... who has he found?

               Artoo whistles a frantic reply.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Princess Leia.

                                     LUKE
                         The princess? She's here?

                                     HAN
                         Princess? What's going on?

                                     THREEPIO
                         Level five. Detention block A A-twenty-
                         three. I'm afraid she's scheduled to 
                         be terminated.

                                     LUKE
                         Oh, no! We've got to do something.

                                     HAN
                         What are you talking about?

                                     LUKE
                         The droid belongs to her. She's the 
                         one in the message... We've got to 
                         help her.

                                     HAN
                         Now, look, don't get any funny ideas. 
                         The old man wants us to wait right 
                         here.

                                     LUKE
                         But he didn't know she was here. 
                         Look, will you just find a way back 
                         into the detention block?

                                     HAN
                         I'm not going anywhere.

                                     LUKE
                         They're going to execute her. Look, 
                         a few minutes ago you said you didn't 
                         want to just wait here to be captured. 
                         Now all you want to do is stay.

                                     HAN
                         Marching into the detention area is 
                         not what I had in mind.

                                     LUKE
                         But they're going to kill her!

                                     HAN
                         Better her than me...

                                     LUKE
                         She's rich.

               Chewbacca growls.

                                     HAN
                         Rich?

                                     LUKE
                         Yes. Rich, powerful! Listen, if you 
                         were to rescue her, the reward would 
                         be...

                                     HAN
                         What?

                                     LUKE
                         Well more wealth that you can imagine.

                                     HAN
                         I don't know, I can imagine quite a 
                         bit!

                                     LUKE
                         You'll get it!

                                     HAN
                         I better!

                                     LUKE
                         You will...

                                     HAN
                         All right, kid. But you'd better be 
                         right about this.

               Han looks at Chewie, who grunts a short grunt.

                                     LUKE
                         All right.

                                     HAN
                         What's your plan?

                                     LUKE
                         Uh... Threepio, hand me those binders 
                         there will you?

               Luke moves toward Chewbacca with electronic cuffs.

                                     LUKE
                         Okay. Now, I'm going to put these on 
                         you.

               Chewie lets out a hideous growl.

                                     LUKE
                         Okay. Han, you put these on.

               Luke sheepishly hands the binders to Han.

                                     HAN
                         Don't worry, Chewie. I think I know 
                         what he has in mind.

               The Wookiee has a worried and frightened look on his face as 
               Han binds him with the electronic cuffs.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Master Luke, sir! Pardon me for 
                         asking... but, ah... what should 
                         Artoo and I do if we're discovered 
                         here?

                                     LUKE
                         Lock the door!

                                     HAN
                         And hope they don't have blasters.

                                     THREEPIO
                         That isn't very reassuring.

               Luke and Han put on their armored stormtrooper helmets and 
               start off into the giant Imperial Death Star.

               INT. DEATH STAR - DETENTION AREA - ELEVATOR TUBE

               Han and Luke try to look inconspicuous in their armored suits 
               as they wait for a vacuum elevator to arrive. Troops, 
               bureaucrats, and robots bustle about, ignoring the trio 
               completely. Only a few give the giant Wookiee a curious 
               glance.

               Finally a small elevator arrives and the trio enters.

                                     LUKE
                         I can't see a thing in this helmet.

               A bureaucrat races to get aboard also, but is signaled away 
               by Han. The door to the pod-like vehicle slides closed and 
               the elevator car takes off through a vacuum tube.

               INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN HALLWAY

               Several Imperial officers walk through the wide main 
               passageway. They pass several stormtroopers and a robot 
               similar to Threepio but with an insect face. At the far end 
               of the hallway, a passing flash of Ben Kenobi appears, then 
               disappears down a small hallway. His appearance is so fleeting 
               that it is hard to tell if he is real or just an illusion. 
               No one in the hallway seems to notice him.

               INT. DEATH STAR - INTERIOR ELEVATOR - DETENTION SECURITY 
               AREA

               Luke and Han step forward to exit the elevator, but the door 
               slides open behind them. The giant Wookiee and his two guards 
               enter the old grey security station. Guards and laser gates 
               are everywhere. Han whispers to Luke under his breath.

                                     HAN
                         This is not going to work.

                                     LUKE
                         Why didn't you say so before?

                                     HAN
                         I did say so before!

               INT. DETENTION AREA

               Elevator doors open. A tall, grim looking Officer approaches 
               the trio.

                                     OFFICER
                         Where are you taking this... thing?

               Chewie growls a bit at the remark but Han nudges him to shut 
               up.

                                     LUKE
                         Prisoner transfer from Block one-one-
                         three-eight.

                                     OFFICER
                         I wasn't notified. I'll have to clear 
                         it.

               The officer goes back to his console and begins to punch in 
               the information. There are only three other troopers in the 
               area. Luke and Han survey the situation, checking all of the 
               alarms, laser gates, and camera eyes. Han unfastens one of 
               Chewbacca's electronic cuffs and shrugs to Luke.

               Suddenly Chewbacca throws up his hands and lets out with one 
               of his ear-piercing howls. He grabs Han's laser rifle.

                                     HAN
                         Look out! He's loose!

                                     LUKE
                         He's going to pull us all apart.

                                     HAN
                         Go get him!

               The startled guards are momentarily dumbfounded. Luke and 
               Han have already pulled out their laser pistols and are 
               blasting away at the terrifying Wookiee. Their barrage of 
               laserfire misses Chewbacca, but hits the camera eyes, laser 
               gate controls, and the Imperial guards. The officer is the 
               last of the guards to fall under the laserfire just as he is 
               about to push the alarm system. Han rushes to the comlink 
               system, which is screeching questions about what is going 
               on.  He quickly checks the computer readout.

                                     HAN
                         We've got to find out which cell 
                         this princess of yours is in. Here 
                         it is... cell twenty-one-eight-seven. 
                         You go get her. I'll hold them here.

               Luke races down one of the cell corridors. Han speaks into 
               the buzzing comlink.

                                     HAN
                              (sounding official)
                         Everything is under control. Situation 
                         normal.

                         We're all fine here, now, thank you.

                         Uh, uh, negative. We had a reactor 
                         leak here now. Give us a few minutes 
                         to lock it down. Large leak... very 
                         dangerous.

               Han blasts the comlink and it explodes.

                                     HAN
                         Boring conversation anyway.
                              (yelling down the 
                              hall)
                         Luke! We're going to have company!

               INT. DEATH STAR - CELL ROW

               Luke stops in front of one of the cells and blasts the door 
               away with a laser pistol. When the smoke clears, Luke sees 
               the dazzling young princess-senator. She had been sleeping 
               and is now looking at him with an uncomprehending look on 
               her face. Luke is stunned by her incredible beauty and stands 
               staring at her with his mouth hanging open.

                                     LEIA
                              (finally)
                         Aren't you a little short to be a 
                         stormtrooper?

               Luke takes off his helmet, coming out of it.

                                     LUKE
                         What? Oh... the uniform. I'm Luke 
                         Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you.

                                     LEIA
                         You're who?

                         I'm here to rescue you. I've got 
                         your R2 unit. I'm here with Ben 
                         Kenobi.

                                     LEIA
                         Ben Kenobi is here! Where is he?

                         Come on!

               INT. DEATH STAR - CONFERENCE ROOM

               Darth Vader paces the room as Governor Tarkin sits at the 
               far end of the conference table.

                                     VADER
                         He is here...

                                     TARKIN
                         Obi-Wan Kenobi! What makes you think 
                         so?

                         A tremor in the Force. The last time 
                         I felt it was in the presence of my 
                         old master.

                                     TARKIN
                         Surely he must be dead by now.

                                     VADER
                         Don't underestimate the power of the 
                         Force.

                                     TARKIN
                         The Jedi are extinct, their fire has 
                         gone out of the universe. You, my 
                         friend, are all that's left of their 
                         religion.

               There is a quiet buzz on the comlink.

                                     TARKIN
                         Yes.

                                     TARKIN
                         If you're right, he must not be 
                         allowed to escape.

                                     VADER
                         Escape is not his plan. I must face 
                         him alone.

               INT. DEATH STAR - DETENTION AREA - HALLWAY

               An ominous buzzing sound is heard on the other side of the 
               elevator door.

                                     HAN
                         Chewie!

               Chewbacca responds with a growling noise.

                                     HAN
                         Get behind me! Get behind me!

               A series of explosions knock a hole in the elevator door 
               through which several Imperial troops begin to emerge.

               Han and Chewie fire laser pistols at them through the smoke 
               and flame. They turn and run down the cell hallway, meeting 
               up with Luke and Leia rushing toward them.

                                     HAN
                         Can't get out that way.

                                     LEIA
                         Looks like you managed to cut off 
                         our only escape route.

                                     HAN
                              (sarcastically)
                         Maybe you'd like it back in your 
                         cell, Your Highness.

               Luke takes a small comlink transmitter from his belt as they 
               continue to exchange fire with stormtroopers making their 
               way down the corridor.

                                     LUKE
                         See-Threepio! See-Threepio!

                         We've been cut off! Are there any 
                         other ways out of the cell bay?... 
                         What was that? I didn't copy!

               INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN BAY GANTRY - CONTROL TOWER

               Threepio paces the control center as little Artoo beeps and 
               whistles a blue streak. Threepio yells into the small comlink 
               transmitter.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I said, all systems have been alerted 
                         to your presence, sir. The main 
                         entrance seems to be the only way in 
                         or out; all other information on 
                         your level is restricted.

               Someone begins banging on the door.

               INT. DEATH STAR - DETENTION CORRIDOR

               Luke and Leia crouch together in an alcove for protection as 
               they continue to exchange fire with troops. Han and Chewbacca 
               are barely able to keep the stormtroopers at bay at the far 
               and of the hallway. The laserfire is very intense, and smoke 
               fills the narrow cell corridor.

                                     LUKE
                         There isn't any other way out.

                         This is some rescue. When you came

                         getting out?

                                     HAN

                         He's the brains, sweetheart.

               Luke manages a sheepish grin and shrugs his shoulders.

                                     LUKE
                         Well, I didn't...

               The princess grabs Luke's gun and fires at a small grate in 
               the wall next to Han, almost frying him.

                                     HAN
                         What the hell are you doing?

                                     LEIA
                         Somebody has to save our skins. Into 
                         the garbage chute, wise guy.

               She jumps through the narrow opening as Han and Chewbacca 
               look on in amazement. Chewbacca sniffs the garbage chute and 
               says something.

                                     HAN
                         Get in there you big furry oaf! I 
                         don't care what you smell! Get in 
                         there and don't worry about it.

               Han gives him a kick and the Wookiee disappears into the 
               tiny opening. Luke and Han continue firing as they work their 
               way toward the opening.

                                     HAN
                         Wonderful girl! Either I'm going to 
                         kill her or I'm beginning to like 
                         her. Get in there!

               Luke ducks laserfire as he jumps into the darkness. Han fires 
               off a couple of quick blasts creating a smokey cover, then 
               slides into the chute himself and is gone.

               INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM

               Han tumbles into the large room filled with garbage and muck.  
               Luke is already stumbling around looking for an exit. He 
               finds a small hatchway and struggles to get it open. It won't 
               budge.

                                     HAN
                              (sarcastically)
                         Oh! The garbage chute was a really 
                         wonderful idea. What an incredible 
                         smell you've discovered! Let's get 
                         out of here! Get away from there...

                                     LUKE
                         No! wait!

               Han draws his laser pistol and fires at the hatch. The 
               laserbolt ricochets wildly around the small metal room.  
               Everyone dives for cover in the garbage as the bolt explodes 
               almost on top of them. Leia climbs out of the garbage with a 
               rather grim look on her face.

                                     LUKE
                         Will you forget it? I already tried 
                         it. It's magnetically sealed!

                                     LEIA
                         Put that thing away! You're going to 
                         get us all killed.

                                     HAN
                         Absolutely, Your Worship. Look, I 
                         had everything under control until 
                         you led us down here. You know, it's 
                         not going to take them long to figure 
                         out what happened to us.

                                     LEIA
                         It could be worse...

               A loud, horrible, inhuman moan works its way up from the 
               murky depths. Chewbacca lets out a terrified howl and begins 
               to back away. Han and Luke stand fast with their laser pistols 
               drawn. The Wookiee is cowering near one of the walls.

                                     HAN
                         It's worse.

                                     LUKE
                         There's something alive in here!

                                     HAN
                         That's your imagination.

                                     LUKE
                         Something just moves past my leg! 
                         Look! Did you see that?

                                     HAN
                         What?

                                     LUKE
                         Help!

               Suddenly Luke is yanked under the garbage.

                                     HAN
                         Luke! Luke! Luke!

               Solo tries to get to Luke. Luke surfaces with a gasp of air 
               and thrashing of limbs. A membrane tentacle is wrapped around 
               his throat.

                                     LEIA
                         Luke!

               Leia extends a long pipe toward him.

                                     LEIA
                         Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this.

                                     LUKE
                         Blast it, will you! My gun's jammed.

                                     HAN
                         Where?

                                     LUKE
                         Anywhere! Oh!!

               Solo fires his gun downward. Luke is pulled back into the 
               muck by the slimy tentacle.

                                     HAN
                         Luke! Luke!

               Suddenly the walls of the garbage receptacle shudder and 
               move in a couple of inches. Then everything is deathly quiet.  
               Han and Leia give each other a worried look as Chewbacca 
               howls in the corner. With a rush of bubbles and muck Luke 
               suddenly bobs to the surface.

                                     LEIA
                         Grab him!

               Luke seems to be released by the thing.

                                     LEIA
                         What happened?

                                     LUKE
                         I don't know, it just let go of me 
                         and disappeared...

                                     HAN
                         I've got a very bad feeling about 
                         this.

               Before anyone can say anything the walls begin to rumble and 
               edge toward the Rebels.

                                     LUKE
                         The walls are moving!

                                     LEIA
                         Don't just stand there. Try to brace 
                         it with something.

               They place poles and long metal beams between the closing 
               walls, but they are simply snapped and bent as the giant 
               trashmasher rumbles on. The situation doesn't look too good.

                                     LUKE
                         Wait a minute!

               Luke pulls out his comlink.

                                     LUKE
                         Threepio! Come in Threepio! Threepio! 
                         Where could he be?

               INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN GANTRY - COMMAND OFFICE

               A soft buzzer and the muted voice of Luke calling out for 
               See-Threepio can be heard on Threepio's hand comlink, which 
               is sitting on the deserted computer console. Artoo and 
               Threepio are nowhere in sight. Suddenly there is a great 
               explosion and the door of the control tower flies across the 
               floor. Four armed stormtroopers enter the chamber.

                                     FIRST TROOPER
                         Take over!
                              (pointing to the dead 
                              officer)
                         See to him! Look there!

               A trooper pushes a button and the supply cabinet door slides 
               open. See-Threepio and Artoo-Detoo are inside. Artoo follows 
               his bronze companion out into the office.

                                     THREEPIO
                         They're madmen! They're heading for 
                         the prison level. If you hurry, you 
                         might catch them.

                                     FIRST OFFICER
                              (to his troops)
                         Follow me! You stand guard.

               The troops hustle off down the hallway, leaving a guard to 
               watch over the command office.

                                     THREEPIO
                              (to Artoo)
                         Come on!

               The guard aims a blaster at them.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Oh! All this excitement has overrun 
                         the circuits of my counterpart here. 
                         If you don't mind, I'd like to take 
                         him down to maintenance.

                                     TROOPER
                         All right.

               The guard nods and Threepio, with little Artoo in tow, hurries 
               out the door.

               INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM

               As the walls rumble closed, the room gets smaller and smaller.  
               Chewie is whining and trying to hold a wall back with his 
               giant paws.

               Han is leaning back against the other wall. Garbage is 
               snapping and popping. Luke is trying to reach Threepio.

                                     LUKE
                         Threepio! Come in, Threepio! Threepio!

               Han and Leia try to brace the contracting walls with a pole. 
               Leia begins to sink into the trash.

                                     HAN
                         Get to the top!

                                     LUKE
                         Where could he be? Threepio! Threepio, 
                         will you come in?

               INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL

                                     THREEPIO
                         They aren't here! Something must 
                         have happened to them. See if they've 
                         been captured.

               Little Artoo carefully plugs his claw arm into a new wall 
               socket and a complex array of electronic sounds spew from 
               the tiny robot.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Hurry!

               INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM

               The walls are only feet apart. Leia and Han are braced against 
               the walls. The princess is frightened. They look at each 
               other. Leia reaches out and takes Han's hand and she holds 
               it tightly. She's terrified and suddenly groans as she feels 
               the first crushing pressure against her body.

                                     HAN
                         One thing's for sure. We're all going 
                         to be a lot thinner!
                              (to Leia)
                         Get on top of it!

                                     THREEPIO
                              (to Artoo)
                         Thank goodness, they haven't found 
                         them! Where could they be?

               Artoo frantically beeps something to See-Threepio.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Use the comlink? Oh, my! I forgot I 
                         turned it off!

               INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM

               Meanwhile, Luke is lying on his side, trying to keep his 
               head above the rising ooze. Luke's comlink begins to buzz 
               and he rips it off his belt.

               INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL

               Muffled sounds of Luke's voice over the comlink can be heard, 
               but not distinctly.

                                     THREEPIO

                              (to Artoo)
                         No. Shut them all down! Hurry!

               Threepio holds his head in agony as he hears the incredible 
               screaming and hollering from Luke's comlink.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Listen to them! They're dying, Artoo! 
                         Curse my metal body! I wasn't fast 
                         enough. It's all my fault! My poor 
                         master!

                                     LUKE
                              (over comlink)
                         Threepio, we're all right!

               INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM

               The screaming and hollering is the sound of joyous relief. 
               The walls have stopped moving. Han, Chewie and Leia embrace 
               in the background.

                                     LUKE
                         We're all right. You did great.

               Luke moves to the pressure sensitive hatch, looking for a 
               number.

                                     LUKE
                         Hey... hey, open the pressure 
                         maintenance hatch on unit number... 
                         where are we?

               INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL

                                     HAN
                              (over comlink)
                         Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.

               INT. DEATH STAR - TRACTOR BEAM - POWER GENERATOR TRENCH

               Ben enters a humming service trench that powers the huge 
               tractor beam. The trench seems to be a hundred miles deep. 
               The clacking sound of huge switching devices can be heard. 
               The old Jedi edges his his way along a narrow ledge leading 
               to a control panel that connects two large cables. He 
               carefully makes several adjustments in the computer terminal, 
               and several lights on the board go from red to blue.

               INT. DEATH STAR - UNUSED HALLWAY

               The group exits the garbage room into a dusty, unused hallway.  
               Han and Luke remove the trooper suits and strap on the blaster 
               belts.

                                     HAN
                         If we can just avoid any more female 
                         advice, we ought to be able to get 
                         out of here.

               Luke smiles and scratches his head as he takes a blaster 
               from Solo.

                                     LUKE
                         Well, let's get moving!

               Chewie begins growling and points to the hatch to the garbage 
               room, as he runs away and then stops howling.

                                     HAN
                              (to Chewie)
                         Where are you going?

               The Dia Nogu bangs against the hatch and a long, slimy 
               tentacle works its way out of the doorway searching for a 
               victim. Han aims his pistol.

                                     LEIA
                         No, wait. They'll hear!

               Han fires at the doorway. The noise of the blast echoes 
               relentlessly throughout the empty passageway. Luke simply 
               shakes his head in disgust.

                                     HAN
                              (to Chewie)
                         Come here, you big coward!

               Chewie shakes his head "no."

                                     HAN
                         Chewie! Come here!

                                     LEIA
                         Listen. I don't know who you are, or 
                         where you came from, but from now 
                         on, you do as I tell you. Okay?

               Han is stunned at the command of the petite young girl.

                                     HAN
                         Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get 
                         one thing straight! I take orders 
                         from one person! Me!

                                     LEIA
                         It's a wonder you're still alive.
                              (looking at Chewie)
                         Will somebody get this big walking 
                         carpet out of my way?

               Han watches her start away. He looks at Luke.

                                     HAN
                         No reward is worth this.

               They follow her, moving swiftly down the deserted corridor.

               INT. DEATH STAR - POWER TRENCH

               Suddenly a door behind Ben slides open and a detachment of 
               stormtroopers marches to the power trench. Ben instantly 
               slips into the shadows as an Officer moves to within a few 
               feet of him.

                                     OFFICER
                         Secure this area until the alert is 
                         canceled.

                                     FIRST TROOPER
                         Give me regular reports.

               All but two of the stormtroopers leave.

                                     FIRST TROOPER
                         Do you know what's going on?

                                     SECOND TROOPER
                         Maybe it's another drill.

               Ben moves around the tractor beam, watching the stormtroopers 
               as they turn their backs to him. Ben gestures with his hand 
               toward them, as the troops think they hear something in the 
               other hallway. With the help of the Force, Ben deftly slips 
               past the troopers and into the main hallway.

                                     SECOND TROOPER
                         What was that?

                                     FIRST TROOPER
                         Oh, it's nothing. Don't worry about 
                         it.

               INT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY

               Luke, Han, Chewbacca, and Leia run down an empty hallway and 
               stop before a bay window overlooking the pirateship. Troopers 
               are milling about the ship. Luke takes out his pocket comlink.

                                     HAN
                              (looking at his ship)
                         There she is.

                                     LUKE
                         See-Threepio, do you copy?

                                     THREEPIO
                              (voice)
                         For the moment. Uh, we're in the 
                         main hangar across from the ship.

                                     LUKE
                         We're right above you. Stand by.

               Han is watching the dozen or so troops moving in and out of 
               the pirateship. Leia moves towards Han, touches his arm and 
               points out the window to the ship.

                                     LEIA
                         You came in that thing? You're braver 
                         that I thought.

                                     HAN
                         Nice! Come on!

               Han gives her a dirty look, and they start off down the 
               hallway. They round a corner and run right into twenty 
               Imperial stormtroopers heading toward them. Both groups are 
               taken by surprise and stop in their tracks.

                                     FIRST TROOPER
                         It's them! Blast them!

               Before even thinking, Han draws his laser pistol and charges 
               the troops, firing. His blaster knocks one of the 
               stormtroopers into the air. Chewie follows his captain down 
               the corridor, stepping over the fallen trooper on the floor.

                                     HAN
                              (to Luke and Leia)
                         Get back to the ship!

                                     LUKE
                         Where are you going? Come back!

               Han has already rounded a corner and does not hear.

                                     LEIA
                         He certainly has courage.

                                     LUKE
                         What good will it do us if he gets 
                         himself killed? Come on!

               Luke is furious but doesn't have time to think about it for 
               muted alarms begin to go off down on the hangar deck. Luke 
               and Leia start off toward the starship hangar.

               INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY

               Han chases the stormtroopers down a long subhallway. He is 
               yelling and brandishing his laser pistol. The troops reach a 
               dead end and are forced to turn and fight. Han stops a few 
               feet from them and assumes a defensive position. The troops 
               begin to raise their laser guns. Soon all ten troopers are 
               moving into an attack position in front of the lone 
               starpirate. Han's determined look begins to fade as the troops 
               begin to advance. Solo jumps backward as they fire at him.

               INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY

               Chewbacca runs down the subhallway in a last-ditch attempt 
               to save his bold captain. Suddenly he hears the firing of 
               laser guns and yelling. Around the corner shoots Han, pirate 
               extraordinaire, running for his life, followed by a host of 
               furious stormtroopers. Chewbacca turns and starts running 
               the other way also.

               INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY

               Luke fires his laser pistol wildly as he and Leia rush down 
               a narrow subhallway, chased by several stormtroopers. They 
               quickly reach the end of the subhallway and race through an 
               open hatchway.

               INT. DEATH STAR - CENTRAL CORE SHAFT

               Luke and Leia race through the hatch onto a narrow bridge 
               that spans a huge, deep shaft that seems to go into infinity. 
               The bridge has been retracted into the wall of the shaft, 
               and Luke almost rushes into the abyss. He loses his balance 
               off the end of the bridge as Leia, behind him, takes hold of 
               his arm and pulls him back.

                                     LUKE
                              (gasping)
                         I think we took a wrong turn.

               Blasts from the stormtroopers' laser guns explode nearby 
               reminding them of the oncoming danger. Luke fires back at 
               the advancing troops. Leia reaches over and hits a switch 
               that pops the hatch door shut with a resounding boom, leaving 
               them precariously perched on a short piece of bridge overhang.  
               Laserfire from the troopers continues to hit the steel door.

                                     LEIA
                         There's no lock!

               Luke blasts the controls with his laser pistol.

                                     LUKE
                         That oughta hold it for a while.

                                     LEIA
                         Quick, we've got to get across. Find 
                         the control that extends the bridge.

                                     LUKE
                         Oh, I think I just blasted it.

               Luke looks at the blasted bridge control while the 
               stormtroopers on the opposite side of the door begin making 
               ominous drilling and pounding sounds.

                                     LEIA
                         They're coming through!

               Luke notices something on his stormtrooper belt, when 
               laserfire hits the wall behind him. Luke aims his laser pistol 
               at a stormtrooper perched on a higher bridge overhang across 
               the abyss from them. They exchange fire. Two more troops 
               appear on another overhang, also firing. A trooper is hit, 
               and grabs at his chest.

               Another trooper standing on the bridge overhang is hit by 
               Luke's laserfire, and plummets down the shaft. Troopers move 
               back off the bridge; Luke hands the gun to Leia.

                                     LUKE
                         Here, hold this.

               Luke pulls a thin nylon cable from his trooper utility belt. 
               It has a grappler hook on it. A trooper appears on a bridge 
               overhang and fires at Luke and Leia. As Luke works with the 
               rope, Leia returns the laser volley. Another trooper appears 
               and fires at them, as Leia returns his fire as well.  
               Suddenly, the hatch door begins to open, revealing the feet 
               of more troops.

                                     LEIA
                         Here they come!

               Leia hits one of the stormtroopers on the bridge above, and 
               he falls into the abyss. Luke tosses the rope across the 
               gorge and it wraps itself around an outcropping of pipes. He 
               tugs on the rope to make sure it is secure, then grabs the 
               princess in his arms. Leia looks at Luke, then kisses him 
               quickly on the lips. Luke is very surprised.

                                     LEIA
                         For luck!

               Luke pushes off and they swing across the treacherous abyss 
               to the corresponding hatchway on the opposite side. Just as 
               Luke and Leia reach the far side of the canyon, the 
               stormtroopers break through the hatch and begin to fire at 
               the escaping duo. Luke returns the fire before ducking into 
               the tiny subhallway.

               INT. DEATH STAR - NARROW PASSAGEWAY

               Ben hides in the shadows of the narrow passageway as several 
               stormtroopers rush past him in the main hallway. He checks 
               to make sure they're gone, then runs down the hallway in the 
               opposite direction. Darth Vader appears at the far end of 
               the hallway and starts after the old Jedi.

               INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY

               Threepio looks around at the troops milling about the 
               pirateship entry ramp.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Where could they be?

               Artoo, plugged into the computer socket, turns his dome left 
               and right, beeping a response.

               INT. DEATH STAR - CORRIDOR - BLAST SHIELDS DOOR

               Han and Chewbacca run down a long corridor with several 
               troopers hot on their trail.

                                     TROOPER
                         Close the blast doors!

               At the end of the hallway, blast doors begin to close in 
               front of them. The young starpilot and his furry companion 
               race past the huge doors just as they are closing, and manage 
               to get off a couple off laserblasts at the pursuing troops 
               before the doors slam shut.

                                     TROOPER
                         Open the blast doors! Open the blast 
                         doors!

               INT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY LEADING TO MAIN FORWARD BAY

               Ben hurries along one of the tunnels leading to the hangar 
               where the pirateship waits. Just before he reaches the hangar, 
               Darth Vader steps into view at the end of the tunnel, not 
               ten feet away. Vader lights his saber. Ben also ignites his 
               and steps slowly forward.

                                     VADER
                         I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan. 
                         We meet again, at last. The circle 
                         is now complete.

               Ben Kenobi moves with elegant ease into a classical offensive 
               position. The fearsome Dark Knight takes a defensive stance.

                                     VADER
                         When I left you, I was but the 
                         learner; now I am the master.

                                     BEN
                         Only a master of evil, Darth.

               The two Galactic warriors stand perfectly still for a few 
               moments, sizing each other up and waiting for the right 
               moment. Ben seems to be under increasing pressure and strain, 
               as if an invisible weight were being placed upon him. He 
               shakes his head and, blinking, tries to clear his eyes.

               Ben makes a sudden lunge at the huge warrior but is checked 
               by a lightning movement of The Sith. A masterful slash stroke 
               by Vader is blocked by the old Jedi. Another of the Jedi's 
               blows is blocked, then countered. Ben moves around the Dark 
               Lord and starts backing into the massive starship hangar. 
               The two powerful warriors stand motionless for a few moments 
               with laser swords locked in mid-air, creating a low buzzing 
               sound.

                                     VADER
                         Your powers are weak, old man.

                                     BEN
                         You can't win, Darth. If you strike 
                         me down, I shall become more powerful 
                         than you can possibly imagine.

               Their lightsabers continue to meet in combat.

               INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY

               Han Solo and Chewbacca, their weapons in hand, lean back 
               against the wall surveying the forward bay, watching the 
               Imperial stormtroopers make their rounds of the hangar.

                                     HAN
                         Didn't we just leave this party?

               Chewbacca growls a reply, as Luke and the princess join them.

                                     HAN
                         What kept you?

                                     LEIA
                         We ran into some old friends.

                                     LUKE
                         Is the ship all right?

                                     HAN
                         Seems okay, if we can get to it. 
                         Just hope the old man got the tractor 
                         beam out of commission.

               INT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY

               Vader and Ben Kenobi continue their powerful duel. As they 
               hit their lightsabers together, lightning flashes on impact. 
               Troopers look on in interest as the old Jedi and Dark Lord 
               of The Sith fight. Suddenly Luke spots the battle from his 
               group's vantage point.

                                     LUKE
                         Look!

               Luke, Leia, Han, and Chewie look up and see Ben and Vader 
               emerging from the hallways on the far side of the docking 
               bay.

               INT. DEATH STAR - DOCKING BAY

               Threepio and Artoo-Detoo are in the center of the Death Star's 
               Imperial docking bay.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Come on, Artoo, we're going!

               Threepio ducks out of sight as the seven stormtroopers who 
               were guarding the starship rush past them heading towards 
               Ben and The Sith Knight. He pulls on Artoo.

               INT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY

               Solo, Chewie, Luke, and Leia tensely watch the duel. The 
               troops rush toward the battling knights.

                                     HAN
                         Now's our chance! Go!

               They start for the Millennium Falcon. Ben sees the troops 
               charging toward him and realizes that he is trapped. Vader 
               takes advantage of Ben's momentary distraction and brings 
               his mighty lightsaber down on the old man. Ben manages to 
               deflect the blow and swiftly turns around.

               The old Jedi Knight looks over his shoulder at Luke, lifts 
               his sword from Vader's then watches his opponent with a serene 
               look on his face.

               Vader brings his sword down, cutting old Ben in half. Ben's 
               cloak falls to the floor in two parts, but Ben is not in it.  
               Vader is puzzled at Ben's disappearance and pokes at the 
               empty cloak. As the guards are distracted, the adventurers 
               and the robots reach the starship. Luke sees Ben cut in two 
               and starts for him. Aghast, he yells out.

                                     LUKE
                         No!

               The stormtroopers turn toward Luke and begin firing at him.  
               The robots are already moving up the ramp into the Millennium 
               Falcon, while Luke, transfixed by anger and awe, returns 
               their fire. Solo joins in the laserfire. Vader looks up and 
               advances toward them, as one of his troopers is struck down.

                                     HAN
                              (to Luke)
                         Come on!

                                     LEIA
                         Come on! Luke, its too late!

                                     HAN
                         Blast the door! Kid!

               Luke fires his pistol at the door control panel, and it 
               explodes. The door begins to slide shut. Three troopers charge 
               forward firing laser bolts, as the door slides to a close 
               behind them, shutting Vader and the other troops out of the 
               docking bay. A stormtrooper lies dead at the feet of his 
               onrushing compatriots. Luke starts for the advancing troops, 
               as Solo and Leia move up the ramp into the pirateship. He 
               fires, hitting a stormtrooper, who crumbles to the floor.

                                     BEN'S VOICE
                         Run, Luke! Run!

               Luke looks around to see where the voice came from. He turns 
               toward the pirateship, ducking Imperial gunfire from the 
               troopers and races into the ship.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

               Han pulls back on the controls and the ship begins to move. 
               The dull thud of laser bolts bouncing off the outside of the 
               ship as Chewie adjusts his controls.

                                     HAN
                         I hope the old man got that tractor 
                         beam out if commission, or this is 
                         going to be a real short trip. Okay, 
                         hit it!

               Chewbacca growls in agreement.

               The Millennium Falcon powers away from the Death Star docking 
               bay, makes a spectacular turn and disappears into the vastness 
               of space.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - CENTRAL HOLD AREA

               Luke, saddened by the loss of Obi-Wan Kenobi, stares off 
               blankly as the robots look on. Leia puts a blanket around 
               him protectively, and Luke turns and looks up at her. She 
               sits down beside him.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

               Solo spots approaching enemy ships.

                         shields while I charge up the main

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - CENTRAL HOLD AREA

               Luke looks downward sadly, shaking his head back and forth, 
               as the princess smiles comfortingly at him.

                                     LUKE
                         I can't believe he's gone.

               Artoo-Detoo beeps a reply.

                                     LEIA
                         There wasn't anything you could have 
                         done.

               Han rushes into the hold area where Luke is sitting with the 
               princess.

                                     HAN
                              (to Luke)

               Luke climbs down the ladder into the gunport cockpit, settling 
               into one of the two main laser cannons mounted in large 
               rotating turrets on either side of the ship.

               An enemy laserbolt hits the pirateship's control panel, 
               causing it to blow out in a shower of sparks.

               A TIE fighter heads right for the pirateship, then zooms 
               overhead.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORTS

               Luke follows the TIE fighter across his field of view, firing 
               laserbeams from his cannon.

               EXT. TIE FIGHTER

               A TIE fighter dives past the pirateship.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORTS

               Luke fires at a TIE fighter. At his port, Han follows a 
               fighter in his sights, releasing a blast of laserfire. He 
               connects, and the fighter explodes into fiery dust. Han laughs 
               victoriously.

               EXT. SPACE

               Two TIE fighters move toward and over the Millennium Falcon, 
               unleashing a barrage of laserbolts at the ship.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORTS

               Another TIE fighter moves in on the pirateship and Luke, 
               smiling, fires the laser cannon at it, scoring a spectacular 
               direct hit.

                                     LUKE
                         Got him! I got him!

               Han turns and gives Luke a victory wave which Luke gleefully 
               returns.

                                     HAN
                         Great kid! Don't get cocky.

               Han turns back to his laser cannon.

               EXT. SPACE

               Two more TIE fighters cross in front of the pirateship.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

               While Chewbacca manipulates the controls, Leia turns, looking 
               over her shoulder out the ports.

                                     LEIA
                         There are still two more of them out 
                         there!

               EXT. SPACE

               A TIE fighter moves up over the pirateship, firing laserblasts 
               at it.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORTS

               Luke and Han look into their respective projected target 
               screens. An Imperial fighter crosses Solo's port, and Han 
               swivels in his chair, following it with blasts from his laser 
               cannon. Another fighter crosses Luke's port, and he reacts 
               in a like manner, the glow of his target screen lighting his 
               face.

               EXT. SPACE

               The TIE fighter zooms toward the pirateship, firing 
               destructive blasts at it.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORTS

               Luke fires a laserblast at the approaching enemy fighter, 
               and it bursts into a spectacular explosion. Luke's projected 
               screen gives a readout of the hit. The pirateship bounces 
               slightly as it is struck by the enemy fire.

               EXT. SPACE - TIE FIGHTER

               The last of the attacking Imperial TIE fighters looms in, 
               firing upon the Falcon.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORT

               Solo swivels behind his cannon, his aim describing the arc 
               of the TIE fighter. The fighter comes closer, firing at the 
               pirateship, but a well-aimed blast from Solo's laser cannon 
               hits the attacker, which blows up in a small atomic shower 
               of burning fragments.

                                     LUKE
                              (laughing)
                         That's it! We did it!

               The princess jumps up and gives Chewie a congratulatory hug.

                                     LEIA
                         We did it!

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - PASSAGEWAY

               Threepio lies on the floor of the ship, completely tangled 
               in the smoking, sparking wires.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Help! I think I'm melting!
                              (to Artoo)
                         This is all your fault.

               Artoo turns his dome from side to side, beeping in response.

               EXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON

               The victorious Millennium Falcon moves off majestically 
               through space.

               INT. DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM

               Darth Vader strides into the control room, where Tarkin is 
               watching the huge view screen. A sea of stars is before him.

                                     TARKIN
                         Are they away?

                                     VADER
                         They have just made the jump into 
                         hyperspace.

                                     TARKIN
                         You're sure the homing beacon is 
                         secure aboard their ship? I'm taking 
                         an awful risk, Vader. This had better 
                         work.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

               Han, removes his gloves and smiling, is at the controls of 
               the ship. Chewie moves into the aft section to check the 
               damage. Leia is seated near Han.

                                     HAN
                         Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh? You 
                         know, sometimes I even amaze myself.

                                     LEIA
                         That doesn't sound too hard. Besides, 
                         they let us go. It's the only 
                         explanation for the ease of our 
                         escape.

                                     HAN
                         Easy... you call that easy?

                                     LEIA
                         Their tracking us!

                                     HAN
                         Not this ship, sister.

               Frustrated, Leia shakes her head.

                                     LEIA
                         At least the information in Artoo is 
                         still intact.

                                     HAN
                         What's so important? What's he 
                         carrying?

                                     LEIA
                         The technical readouts of that battle 
                         station. I only hope that when the 
                         data is analyzed, a weakness can be 
                         found. It's not over yet!

                                     HAN
                         It is for me, sister! Look, I ain't 
                         in this for your revolution, and I'm 
                         not in it for you, Princess. I expect 
                         to be well paid. I'm in it for the 
                         money!

                                     LEIA
                         You needn't worry about your reward. 
                         If money is all that you love, then 
                         that's what you'll receive!

               She angrily turns, and as she starts out of the cockpit, 
               passes Luke coming in.

                                     LEIA
                         Your friend is quite a mercenary. I 
                         wonder if he really cares about 
                         anything... or anyone.

                                     LUKE
                         I care!

               Luke, shaking his head, sits in the copilot seat. He and Han 
               stare out at the vast blackness of space.

                                     LUKE
                         So... what do you think of her, Han?

                                     HAN
                         I'm trying not to, kid!

                                     LUKE
                              (under his breath)
                         Good...

                                     HAN
                         Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I 
                         don't know, what do you think? Do 
                         you think a princess and a guy like 
                         me...

                                     LUKE
                         No!

               Luke says it with finality and looks away. Han smiles at 
               young Luke's jealousy.

               EXT. SPACE AROUND FOURTH MOON OF YAVIN

               The battered pirateship drifts into orbit around the planet 
               Yavin and proceeds to one of its tiny green moons.

               EXT. FOURTH MOON OF YAVIN

               The pirateship soars over the dense jungle.

               EXT. MASSASSI OUTPOST

               An alert guard, his laser gun in hand, scans the countryside.  
               He sets the gun down and looks toward the temple, barely 
               visible in the foliage.

               EXT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - JUNGLE TEMPLE

               Rotting in a forest of gargantuan trees, an ancient temple 
               lies shrouded in an eerie mist. The air is heavy with the 
               fantastic cries of unimaginable creatures. Han, Luke and the 
               others are greeted by the Rebel troops.

               Luke and the group ride into the massive temple on an armored 
               military speeder.

               INT. MASSASSI - MAIN HANGAR DECK

               The military speeder stops in a huge spaceship hangar, set 
               up in the interior of the crumbling temple. Willard, the 
               commander of the Rebel forces, rushes up to the group and 
               gives Leia a big hug. Every one is pleased to see her.

                                     WILLARD
                              (holding Leia)
                         You're safe! We had feared the worst.

               Willard composes himself, steps back and bows formally.

                                     WILLARD
                         When we heard about Alderaan, we 
                         were afraid that you were... lost 
                         along with your father.

                                     LEIA
                         We don't have time for our sorrows, 
                         Commander. The battle station has 
                         surely tracked us here.
                              (looking pointedly to 
                              Han)
                         It's the only explanation for the 
                         ease of our escape. You must use the 
                         information in this R2 unit to plan 
                         the attack. It is our only hope.

               EXT. SPACE

               The surface of the Death Star ominously approaches the red 
               planet Yavin.

               INT. DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM

               Grand Moff Tarkin and Lord Vader are interrupted in their 
               discussion by the buzz of the comlink. Tarkin moves to answer 
               the call.

                                     TARKIN
                         Yes.

               DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE

               We are approaching the planet Yavin. The Rebel base is on a 
               moon on the far side. We are preparing to orbit the planet.

               EXT. YAVIN - JUNGLE

               A lone guard stands in a tower high above the Yavin landscape, 
               surveying the countryside. A mist hangs over the jungle of 
               twisted green.

               INT. MASSASSI - WAR ROOM BRIEFING AREA

               Dodonna stands before a large electronic wall display. Leia 
               and several other senators are to one side of the giant 
               readout. The low-ceilinged room is filled with starpilots, 
               navigators, and a sprinkling of R2-type robots. Everyone is 
               listening intently to what Dodonna is saying. Han and 
               Chewbacca are standing near the back.

                                     DODONNA
                         The battle station is heavily shielded 
                         and carries a firepower greater than 
                         half the star fleet. It's defenses 
                         are designed around a direct large-
                         scale assault. A small one-man fighter 
                         should be able to penetrate the outer 
                         defense.

               Gold Leader, a rough looking man in his early thirties, stands 
               and addresses Dodonna.

                                     GOLD LEADER
                         Pardon me for asking, sir, but what 
                         good are snub fighters going to be 
                         against that?

                                     DODONNA
                         Well, the Empire doesn't consider a 
                         small one-man fighter to be any 
                         threat, or they'd have a tighter 
                         defense. An analysis of the plans 
                         provided by Princess Leia has 
                         demonstrated a weakness in the battle 
                         station.

               Artoo-Detoo stands next to a similar robot, makes beeping 
               sounds, and turns his head from right to left.

                                     DODONNA
                         The approach will not be easy. You 
                         are required to maneuver straight 
                         down this trench and skim the surface 
                         to this point. The target area is 
                         only two meters wide. It's a small 
                         thermal exhaust port, right below 
                         the main port. The shaft leads 
                         directly to the reactor system. A 
                         precise hit will start a chain 
                         reaction which should destroy the 
                         station.

               A murmer of disbelief runs through the room.

                                     DODONNA
                         Only a precise hit will set up a 
                         chain reaction. The shaft is ray-
                         shielded, so you'll have to use proton

               Luke is sitting next to Wedge Antilles, a hotshot pilot about 
               sixteen years old.

                         That's impossible, even for a 
                         computer.

                                     LUKE
                         It's not impossible. I used to bull's-
                         eye womp rats in my T-sixteen back 
                         home. They're not much bigger than 
                         two meters.

                         Man your ships! And may the Force be 
                         with you!

               The group rises and begins to leave.

               EXT. SPACE

               The Death Star begins to move around the planet toward the 
               tiny green moon.

               INT. DEATH STAR

               Tarkin and Vader watch the computer projected screen with 
               interest, as a circle of lights intertwines around one another 
               on the screen showing it's position in relation to Yavin and 
               the forth moon.

                         This will be a day long remembered. 
                         It has seen the end of Kenobi and it 
                         will soon see the end of the 
                         Rebellion.

               INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - MAIN HANGAR DECK

               Luke, Threepio and little Artoo enter the huge spaceship 
               hangar and hurry along a long line of gleaming spacefighters.  
               Flight crews rush around loading last-minute armaments and 
               unlocking power couplings. In an area isolated from this 
               activity Luke finds Han and Chewbacca loading small boxes 
               onto an armored speeder.

                                     MAN'S VOICE
                              (over loudspeaker)
                         All flight trooper, man your stations. 
                         All flight troops, man your stations.

               Han is deliberately ignoring the activity of the fighter 
               pilots' preparation. Luke is quite saddened at the sight of 
               his friend's departure.

                                     LUKE
                         So... you got your reward and you're 
                         just leaving then?

                                     HAN
                         That's right, yeah! I got some old 
                         debts I've got to pay off with this 
                         stuff. Even if I didn't, you don't 
                         think I'd be fool enough to stick 
                         around here, do you? Why don't you 
                         come with us? You're pretty good in 
                         a fight. I could use you.

                                     LUKE
                              (getting angry)
                         Come on! Why don't you take a look 
                         around? You know what's about to 
                         happen, what they're up against. 
                         They could use a good pilot like 
                         you. You're turning your back on 
                         them.

                                     HAN
                         What good's a reward if you ain't 
                         around to use it? Besides, attacking 
                         that battle station ain't my idea of 
                         courage. It's more like suicide.

                                     LUKE
                         All right. Well, take care of 
                         yourself, Han. I guess that's what 
                         you're best at, isn't it?

               Luke goes off and Han hesitates, then calls to him.

                                     HAN
                         Hey, Luke... may the Force be with 
                         you!

               Luke turns and sees Han wink at him. Luke lifts his hand in 
               a small wave and then goes off.

               Han turns to Chewie who growls at his captain,

                                     HAN
                         What're you lookin' at? I know what 
                         I'm doing.

               INT. MAIN HANGAR DECK - LUKE'S SHIP

               Luke, Leia, and Dodonna meet under a huge space fighter.

                                     LEIA
                         What's wrong?

                                     LUKE
                         Oh, it's Han! I don't know, I really 
                         thought he'd change his mind.

                                     LEIA
                         He's got to follow his own path. No 
                         one can choose it for him.

                                     LUKE
                         I only wish Ben were here.

               Leia gives Luke a little kiss, turns, and goes off. As Luke 
               heads for his ship, another pilot rushes up to him and grabs 
               his arm.

                                     BIGGS
                         Luke! I don't believe it! How'd you 
                         get here... are you going out with 
                         us?!

                                     LUKE
                         Biggs! Of course, I'll be up there 
                         with you! Listen, have I got some 
                         stories to tell...

               Red Leader, a rugged handsome man in his forties, comes up 
               behind Luke and Biggs. He has the confident smile of a born 
               leader.

                                     RED LEADER
                         Are you... Luke Skywalker? Have you 
                         been checked out on the Incom T-sixty-
                         five?

                                     BIGGS
                         Sir, Luke is the best bushpilot in 
                         the outer rim territories.

               Red Leader pats Luke on the back as they stop in front of 
               his fighter.

                                     RED LEADER
                         I met your father once when I was 
                         just a boy, he was a great pilot. 
                         You'll do all right. If you've got 
                         half of your father's skill, you'll 
                         do better than all right.

                                     LUKE
                         Thank you, sir. I'll try.

               Red Leader hurries to his own ship.

                                     BIGGS
                         I've got to get aboard. Listen, you'll 
                         tell me your stories when we come 
                         back. All right?

                                     LUKE
                         I told you I'd make it someday, Biggs.

                                     BIGGS
                              (going off)
                         You did, all right. It's going to be 
                         like old times, Luke. We're a couple 
                         of shooting stars that'll never be 
                         stopped!

               Luke laughs and shakes his head in agreement. He heads for 
               his ship.

               As Luke begins to climb up the ladder into his sleek, deadly 
               spaceship, the crew chief, who is working on the craft, points 
               to little Artoo, who is being hoisted into a socket on the 
               back of the fighter.

                                     CHIEF
                         This R2 unit of your seems a bit 
                         beat up. Do you want a new one?

                                     LUKE
                         Not on your life! That little droid 
                         and I have been through a lot 
                         together.
                              (to Artoo)
                         You okay, Artoo?

               The crewmen lower Artoo-Detoo into the craft. Now a part of 
               the exterior shell of the starship, the little droid beeps 
               that he is fine.

               Luke climbs up into the cockpit of his fighter and puts an 
               his helmet. Threepio looks on from the floor of the massive 
               hangar as the crewmen secure his little electronic partner 
               into Luke's X-wing. It's an emotional-filled moment as Artoo 
               beeps good-bye.

                                     CHIEF
                         Okay, easy she goes!

                                     THREEPIO
                         Hang on tight,Artoo, you've got to 
                         come back.

               Artoo beeps in agreement.

                                     THREEPIO
                         You wouldn't want my life to get 
                         boring, would you?

               Artoo whistles his reply.

               All final preparations are made for the approaching battle.  
               The hangar is buzzing with the last minute activity as the 
               pilots and crewmen alike make their final adjustments. The 
               hum of activity is occasionally trespassed by the distorted 
               voice of the loudspeaker issuing commands. Coupling hoses 
               are disconnected from the ships as they are fueled. Cockpit 
               shields roll smoothly into place over each pilot. A signalman, 
               holding red guiding lights, directs the ships. Luke, a trace 
               of a smile gracing his lips, peers about through his goggles.

                                     BEN'S VOICE
                         Luke, the Force will be with you.

               Luke is confused at the voice and taps his headphones.

               EXT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - JUNGLE

               All that can be seen of the fortress is a lone guard standing 
               on a small pedestal jutting out above the dense jungle. The 
               muted gruesome crying sounds that naturally permeate this 
               eerie purgatory are overwhelmed by the thundering din of ion 
               rockets as four silver starships catapult from the foliage 
               in a tight formation and disappears into the morning cloud 
               cover.

               INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - WAR ROOM

               The princess, Threepio, and a field commander sit quietly 
               before the giant display showing the planet Yavin and its 
               four moons. The red dot that represents the Death Star moves 
               ever closer to the system. A series of green dots appear 
               around the fourth moon. A din of indistinct chatter fills 
               the war room.

               The Death Star slowly moves behind the massive yellow surface 
               of Yavin in the foreground, as many X-wing fighters flying 
               in formation zoom toward us and out of the frame.

               EXT. SPACE - ANOTHER ANGLE

               Light from a distant sun creates an eerie atmospheric glow 
               around a huge planet, Yavin. Rebel fighters flying in 
               formation settle ominously in the foreground and very slowly 
               pull away.

               INT. LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT

               Luke adjusts his controls as he concentrates on the 
               approaching Death Star. The ship begins to be buffeted 
               slightly.

               EXT. SPACE

               The fighters, now X-shaped darts, move in formation. The 
               Death Star now appears to be a small moon growing rapidly in 
               size as the Rebel fighters approach. Complex patterns on the 
               metallic surface begin to become visible. A large dish antenna 
               is built into the surface on one side.

               INT. WEDGE'S COCKPIT

               Wedge is amazed and slightly frightened at the awesome 
               spectacle.

                                     WEDGE

               EXT. SPACE

               As the fighters move closer to the Death Star, the awesome 
               size of the gargantuan Imperial fortress is revealed. Half 
               of the deadly space station is in shadow and this area 
               sparkles with thousands of small lights running in thin lines 
               and occasionally grouped in large clusters; somewhat like a 
               city at night as seen from a weather satellite.

                         We're starting for the target shaft 
                         now.

               INT. RED LEADER'S COCKPIT

               Red Leader looks around at his wingmen; the Death Star looming 
               in from behind. Two Y-wing fighters bob back and forth in 
               the background. He moves his computer targeting device into 
               position.

                                     RED LEADER
                         We're in position. I'm going to cut 
                         across the axis and try and draw 
                         their fire.

               EXT. SPACE

               Two squads of Rebel fighters peel off. The X-wings dive 
               towards the Death Star surface. A thousand lights glow across 
               the dark grey expanse of the huge station.

               INT. DEATH STAR

               Alarm sirens scream as soldiers scramble to large turbo- 
               powered laser gun emplacements. Electronic drivers rotate 
               the huge guns into position as crew adjust their targeting 
               devices.

               EXT. SPACE AROUND THE DEATH STAR

               Laserbolts streak through the star-filled night. The Rebel X-
               wing fighters move in toward the Imperial base, as the Death 
               Star aims its massive laser guns at the Rebel forces and 
               fires.

               INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - WAR ROOM

               Princess Leia listens to the battle over the intercom.

               An X-wing zooms across the surface of the Death Star.

               INT. DEATH STAR

               Technical crews scurry here and there loading last-minute 
               armaments and unlocking power cables.

               Wedge maneuvers his fighter toward the menacing Death Star.

               X-wings continue in their attack course on the Death Star.

               INT. LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT

               Luke nosedives radically, starting his attack on the monstrous 
               fortress. The Death Star surface streaks past the cockpit 
               window.

                                     LUKE

               EXT. SPACE

               Luke's X-wing races toward the Death Star. Laserbolts streak 
               from Luke's weapons, creating a huge fireball explosion on 
               the dim surface.

               INT. LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT

               Terror crosses Luke's face as he realizes he won't be able 
               to pull out in time to avoid the fireball.

                                     BIGGS

               EXT. SURFACE OF DEATH STAR

               Luke's ship emerges from the fireball, with the leading edges 
               of his wings slightly scorched.

               INT. LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT

               Luke adjusts his controls and breathes a sigh of relief. 
               Flak bursts outside the cockpit window.

                                     LUKE
                         I got a little cooked, but I'm okay.

               EXT. SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR

               Rebel fighters continue to strafe the Death Star's surface 
               with laserbolts.

               INT. DEATH STAR

               Walls buckle and cave in. Troops and equipment are blown in 
               all directions. Stormtroopers stagger out of the rubble.  
               Standing in the middle of the chaos, a vision of calm and 
               foreboding, is Darth Vader. One of his Astro-Officers rushes 
               up to him.

                         We count thirty Rebel ships, Lord

                         evading our turbo-lasers!

                                     VADER
                         We'll have to destroy them ship to 
                         ship. Get the crews to their fighters.

               INT. DEATH STAR

               Smoke belches from the giant laser guns as they wind up their 
               turbine generators to create sufficient power. The crew rushes 
               about preparing for another blast. Even the troopers head 
               gear is not adequate to protect them from the overwhelming 
               noise of the monstrous weapon. One troopers bangs his helmet 
               with his hand in an attempt to stop the ringing.

               INT. READ LEADER'S X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT - TRAVELING

               Red Leader flies through a heavy hail of flak.

               INT. LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT - TRAVELING

               The Red Leader's X-wing flies past Luke as he puts his nose 
               down and starts his attack dive.

                         Watch yourself! There's a lot of 
                         fire coming from the right side of 
                         that deflection tower.

                         I'm on it.

               EXT. SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR

               Luke flings his X-wing into a twisting dive across the horizon 
               and down onto the dim grey surface.

               EXT. LUKE'S X-WING TRAVELING

               A shot hurls from Luke's guns. Laserbolts streak toward the 
               onrushing Death Star surface. Several small radar emplacements 
               erupt in flame. Laserfire erupts from a protruding tower on 
               the surface.

               INT. LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT - TRAVELING

               The blurry Death Star surface races past the cockpit window 
               as a big smile sweeps across Luke's face at the success of 
               his run. Flak thunders on all sides of him.

               EXT. SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR

               The Death Star superstructure races past Luke as he maneuvers 
               his craft through a wall of laserfire and peels away from 
               the surface towards the heavens.

               INT. DEATH STAR

               The thunder and smoke of the big guns reverberate throughout 
               the massive structure. Many soldiers rush about in the smoke 
               and chaos, silhouetted by the almost continual flash of 
               explosions.

               INT. BIGGS' COCKPIT - TRAVELING

               Biggs dives through a forest of radar domes, antennae, and 
               gun towers as he shoots low across the Death Star surface. A 
               dense barrage of laserfire streaks by on all sides.

               INT. DEATH STAR

               Imperial star pilots dash in unison to a line of small 
               auxiliary hatches that lead to Imperial TIE fighters.

               INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - WAR ROOM

               Princess Leia, surrounded by her generals and aides, paces 
               nervously before a lighted computer table. On all sides 
               technicians work in front of many lighted glass walls. Dodonna 
               watches quietly from one corner. One of the officers working 
               over a screen speaks into his headset.

               Luke looks around to see if he can spot the approaching 
               Imperial fighters.

               INT. RED LEADER'S X-WING - COCKPIT - TRAVELING

               The Death Star's surface sweeps past as Red Leader searches 
               the sky for the Imperial fighters. Flak pounds at his ship.

                         Keep up your visual scanning. With 
                         all this jamming, they'll be on top 
                         of you before your scope can pick 
                         them up.

               EXT. SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR

               Silhouetted against the rim lights of the Death Star horizon, 
               four ferocious Imperial TIE ships dive on the Rebel fighters.  
               Two of the TIE fighters peel off and drop out of frame. Pan 
               with the remaining two TIE ships.

               INT. BIGGS' COCKPIT - TRAVELING

               Biggs panics when he discovers a TIE ship on his tail. The 
               horizon in the background twists around as he peels off, 
               hoping to lose the Imperial fighter.

               EXT. SPACE AROUND THE DEATH STAR

               Biggs zooms off the surface and into space, closely followed 
               by an Imperial TIE fighter. The TIE ship fires several 
               laserbolts at Biggs, but misses.

               INT. BIGGS' COCKPIT - TRAVELING

               Biggs see the TIE ship behind him and swings around, trying 
               to avoid him.

                                     BIGGS
                         He's on me tight, I can't shake him... 
                         I can't shake him.

               EXT. SPACE AROUND THE DEATH STAR

               Biggs, flying at high altitude, peels off and dives toward 
               the Death Star surface, but he is unable to lose the TIE 
               fighter, who sticks close to his tail.

               INT. X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT - TRAVELING

               Luke is flying upside down. He rotates his ship around to 
               normal attitude as he comes out of his dive.

                                     LUKE
                         Hang on, Biggs, I'm coming in.

               EXT. SPACE AROUND THE DEATH STAR

               Biggs and the tailing TIE ship dive for the surface, now 
               followed by a fast-gaining Luke. After Biggs dives out of 
               sight, Luke chases the Imperial fighter.

               EXT. SURFACE AROUND THE DEATH STAR

               In the foreground, the Imperial fighter races across the 
               Death Star's surface, closely followed by Luke in the 
               background.

               INT. LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT - TRAVELING

               There is a shot from Luke's X-wing of the TIE ship exploding 
               in a mass of flames.

                         Hang on back there.

               Green laserfire moves past the beeping little robot as his 
               head turns.

               Luke's ship soars closer to the surface of the Death Star, 
               an Imperial TIE fighter closing in on him in hot pursuit.

               INT. WEDGE'S COCKPIT

               INT. TIE FIGHTER - COCKPIT

               The fighter pilot watches Wedge's X-wing approach. Another X-
               wing joins him, and both unleash a volley of laserfire on 
               the Imperial fighter.

               EXT. SPACE

               The TIE fighter explodes, filling the screen with white light.  
               Luke's ship can be seen far in the distance.

               Gold Leader approaches the surface and pulls out to skim the 
               surface of the huge station. The ship moves into a deep 
               trench, firing laserbolts. The surface streaks past as 
               laserfire is returned by the Death Star.

               INT. GOLD FIVE'S Y-WING - COCKPIT - TRAVELING

               Gold Five is a pilot in his early fifties with a very battered 
               helmet that looks like it's been through many battles. He 
               looks around to see if enemy ships are near. His fighter is 
               buffeted by Imperial flak.

               INT. GOLD LEADER'S Y-WING - COCKPIT

               Gold Leader races down the enormous trench that leads to the 
               exhaust port. Laserbolts blast toward him in increasing 
               numbers, occasionally exploding near the ship causing it to 
               bounce about.

               An exterior surface gun blazes away at the oncoming Rebel 
               fighters.

                         the surface, some on the towers.

               Leia, Threepio, and the technicians view the projected target 
               screen, as red and blue target lights glow. The red target 
               near the center blinks on and off.

               The three Y-wing fighters race toward camera and zoom overhead 
               through a hail of laserfire.

               Gold Leader pulls his computer targeting device down in front 
               of his eye. Laserbolts continue to batter the Rebel craft.

               Gold Two, a younger pilot about Luke's age, pulls down his 
               targeting eye viewer and adjusts it. His ship shudders under 
               intense laser barrage.

               As the fighters begin to approach the target area, suddenly 
               all the laserfire stops. An eerie clam clings over the trench 
               as the surface whips past in a blur.

               INT. LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT

               Luke breaks into a nervous sweat as the laserfire is returned, 
               knicking one of his wings close to the engine.

               Artoo works to repair the damages. The canyon wall rushes by 
               in the background, making his delicate task seem even more 
               precarious.

               Luke looks into his targeting device. He moves it away for a 
               moment and ponders its use. He looks back into the computer 
               targeter.

               Leia and the others listen to Solo's transmission.

                                     HAN
                              (over speaker)
                         Now let's blow this thing and go 
                         home!

               INT. LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT

               Luke looks up and smiles. He concentrates on the exhaust 
               port, then fires his laser torpedoes.

               EXT. SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR

               Luke's torpedoes shoot toward the port and seems to simply 
               disappear into the surface and not explode. But the shots do 
               find their mark and have gone into the exhaust port and are 
               heading for the main reactor.

               INT. LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT

               Luke throws his head back in relief.

               INT. DEATH STAR

               An Imperial soldier runs to the control panel board and pulls 
               the attack lever as the board behind him lights up.

                                     INTERCOM VOICE
                         Stand by to fire at Rebel base.

               EXT. SPACE AROUND THE DEATH STAR

               Two X-wings, a Y-wing, and the pirateship race toward Yavin 
               in the distance.

               INT. DEATH STAR

               Several Imperial soldiers, flanking a pensive Grand Moff 
               Tarkin, busily push control levers and buttons.

                                     INTERCOM VOICE
                         Standing by.

               The rumble of a distant explosion begins.

               EXT. SPACE AROUND THE DEATH STAR

               The Rebel ships race out of sight, leaving the moon-like 
               Death Star alone against a blanket of stars. Several small 
               flashes appear on the surface. The Death Star bursts into a 
               supernova, creating a spectacular heavenly display.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

                                     HAN
                         Great shot, kid. That was one in a 
                         million.

               INT. LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT

               Luke is at ease, and his eyes are closed.

                                     BEN'S VOICE
                         Remember, the Force will be with 
                         you... always.

               The ship rocks back and forth.

               EXT. DARTH VADER'S TIE FIGHTER

               Vader's ship spins off into space.

               EXT. SPACE

               The Rebel ships race toward the fourth moon of Yavin.

               INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - MAIN HANGAR

               Luke climbs out of his starship fighter and is cheered by a 
               throng of ground crew and pilots. Luke climbs down the ladder 
               as they all welcome him with laughter, cheers, and shouting. 
               Princess Leia rushes toward him.

                                     LEIA
                         Luke! Luke! Luke!

               She throws her arms around Luke and hugs him as they dance 
               around in a circle. Solo runs in toward Luke and they embrace 
               one another, slapping each other on the back.

                                     HAN
                              (laughing)
                         Hey! Hey!

                                     LUKE
                              (laughing)
                         I knew you'd come back! I just knew 
                         it!

                                     HAN
                         Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all 
                         the credit and take all the reward.

               Luke and Han look at one another, as Solo playfully shoves 
               at Luke's face. Leia moves in between them.

                                     LEIA
                              (laughing)
                         Hey, I knew there was more to you 
                         than money.

               Luke looks toward the ship.

                                     LUKE
                         Oh, no!

               The fried little Artoo-Detoo is lifted off the back of the 
               fighter and carried off under the worried eyes of Threepio.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Oh, my! Artoo! Can you hear me? Say 
                         something!
                              (to mechanic)
                         You can repair him, can't you?

                                     TECHNICIAN
                         We'll get to work on him right away.

                                     THREEPIO
                         You must repair him! Sir, if any of 
                         my circuits or gears will help, I'll 
                         gladly donate them.

                                     LUKE
                         He'll be all right.

               INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - MAIN THRONE ROOM

               Luke, Han, and Chewbacca enter the huge ruins of the main 
               temple. Hundreds of troops are lined up in neat rows. Banners 
               are flying and at the far end stands a vision in white, the 
               beautiful young Senator Leia. Luke and the others solemnly 
               march up the long aisle and kneel before Senator Leia. From 
               one side of the temple marches a shined-up and fully repaired 
               Artoo-Detoo. He waddles up to the group and stands next to 
               an equally pristine Threepio, who is rather awestruck by the 
               whole event. Chewbacca is confused. Dodonna and several other 
               dignitaries sit on the left of the Princess Leia. Leia is 
               dressed in a long white dress and is staggeringly beautiful.  
               She rises and places a gold medallion around Han's neck. He 
               winks at her. She then repeats the ceremony with Luke, who 
               is moved by the event. They turn and face the assembled 
               troops, who all bow before them. Chewbacca growls and Artoo 
               beeps with happiness.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               END CREDITS OVER STARS

                                         THE END
EXT. SPACE
A vast sea of stars severas as a backdrop for the Main Title, following by a rollup, whcih crawls into infinity.

				There is unrest in the Galactic Senate
				Several hundred solar systems under
				the leadership of the rebel leader, Count
				Dooku, have decalred their intentions to
				secede from the Republic.

				This separatist movement has made it
				difficult for the limited number of
				Jedi Kights to maintain peace and
				order in the galaxy.

				Senator Amidala, the former Queen of
				Naboo, is returning to Coruscant
				to vote on the critical issue
				of creating an army to assist the
				overwhelmed Jedi.

PAN UP to reveal the amber city planet of Coruscant. A yellow Naboo Fighter flies OVER CAMERA toward the planet, followed by a large Royal Cruiser and two more Fighters.

EXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT - DAWN
The ships skim across the surface of the city landscape. The sun glints off the chrome hulls of the sleek Naboo spacecraft as they navigate between the buildings of the capital planet.

EXT. CORUSCANT, LANDING PLATFORM - DAWN
Two Naboo Fighters land on one leaf of a three-leaf-clover landing platform. The Royal Starship lands on the central lead, and the third Fighter lands on the remaining plaform.

A small GROUP OF DIGNITARIES waits to welcome the Senator. One of the members of the group os a well dressed JAR JAR BINKS, a member of the Galactic Representative Commission, and DORME, Senator Amidala's handmaiden.

One of the FIGHTER PILOTS jumps from the wing of his ship and removes his helmet. He is CAPTAIN TYPHO, SENATOR AMIDALA'S Security Officer. He moves over to a WOMAN PILOT.

CAPTAIN TYPHO
We made it. I guess I was wrong,
there was no danger at all.

The ramp ;pwers. TWO NABOO GUARDS appear. SENATOR AMIDALA, ONE HANDMAIDEN (VERSE) and FOUR TROOPERS descend the ramp. AMIDALA is more beautiful now than she was ten years earlier when, as Queen, she was freeing her people from the yoke of the Trade Federation.

The DIGNITARIES start to move forward. SENATOR AMIDALA reaches the foot of the ramp, when suddenly there is a blinding FLASH and a huge EXPLOSION. The DIGNITARIES and PILOTS are hurled to the ground as the starship is destroyed.

Klaxons blare, alarms sound! CAPTAIN TYPHO and the TWO ESCORT PILOTS get up and run to where SENATOR AMIDALA lies dying. Beyond, ARTOO DETOO drops down from the Naboo Fighter and rolls toward the wreckage. The FEMALE ESCORT PILOT kneels by SENATOR AMIDALA and takes off her helmet, revealing SENATOR PADME AMIDALA.

				PADMÉ 
			Cordé...

She gathers up her decoy double in her arms. Cordé's eyes are open. She looks up at her.

				CORDÉ
			... I'm sorry, m'lady... I'm... not sure I... 

CORDÉ dies. PADMÉ hugs her.

				AMIDALA
			No!... No!... No!...

PADMÉ lowers CORDÉ to the ground. She gets up and looks around at the devastation. There are tears in her eyes.

				AMIDALA
			I should not have come back.

				CAPTAIN TYPHO
			M'Lady, you are still in danger.

Amidala says nothing.

				CAPTAIN TYPHO
			This vote is very important. You did
			your duty and Cordé did hers. Now
			come. (she doesn't respond) M'Lady,
			please!

She turns. They walk away. ARTOO lets out a small whimper and rolls off after them.

EXT. SENATE BUILDING - DAY 
The massive Senate Building glistens in the afternoon sun. Small patches of fog have still to burn off.

INT. SENATE CHAMBER - DAY
The vast rotunda is buzzing with chatter. MAS AMEDDA, the Supreme Chancellor's majordomo, tries to quiet things down as PALPATINE confers with an AIDE, UV GIZEN, riding a small one man floating scooter.

				MAS AMEDDA
			Order! We shall have order! The motion
			for the Republic to commission an army
			takes precedent, and that is what we
			will vote on at this time.

Everything quiets down. The AIDE disperses, and SUPREME CHANCELLOR PALPATINE steps to the podium.

				PALPATINE
			...My esteemed colleagues, excuse
			me... I have just received some
			tragic and disturbing news. Senator
			Amidala of the Naboo system... Has
			been assassinated!

There is a shock silence in the vast arena.

				PALPATINE
				(continued)
			This grievous blow is especially
			personal to me. Before I became
			Chancellor, I served Amidala when
			she was Queen. She was a great
			leader who fought for justice, not
			only in this honourable assembly,
			but also on her home planet. She
			was so loved she could have been
			elected queen for life. She
			believed in public service, and
			she fervently believed in
			democracy. Her death is a great
			loss to us all. We will all mourn
			her as a relentless champion of
			freedom... and as a dear friend.

There is a moment of silence. ASK AAK, the SENATOR of MALASTARE, moves his pod into the centre of the arena.

				SENATOR ASK AAK
			How many more Senators will die
			before this civil strife ends! We
			must confront these rebels now,
			and they need an army to do it.

A second pod moves into the centre of the area with DARSANA, the 
AMBASSADOR OF GLEE ANSELM.

				AMBASSADOR DARSANA
			Why weren't the Jedi able to stop
			this assassination? We are no
			longer safe, under their protection.

Senator ORN FREE TAA swings forward in his pod.

				ORN FREE TAA
			The Republic needs more security
			now! Before it comes to war.

				PALPATINE
			Must I remind the Senator from
			Malastare that negotiations are
			continuing with the separatists.
			Peace is our objective here... not
			war.

The SENATORS yell pro and con. MAS AMEDDA tries to calm things down. SENATOR PADME AMIDALA, with CAPTAIN TYPHO, JAR JAR, and DORME, manoeuvre her pod into the centre of the vast arena.

				AMIDALA
			My noble colleagues, I concur with
			the Supreme Chancellor. At all
			costs, we do not want war!

The Senate goes quiet, then there is an outburst of cheering and 
applause.

				PALPATINE
			It is with great surprise and
			joy the chair recognises the
			Senator from Naboo, Padmé Amidala.

				PADMÉ
			Less than an hour ago, an
			assassination attempt was made
			against my life. One of my
			bodyguards and six  others were
			ruthlessly and senselessly
			murdered. I was the target but,
			more importantly, I believe this
			security measure before you, was
			the target. I have led the
			opposition to build an army... but
			there is someone in this body who
			will stop at nothing to assure it's
			passage...

Many of the SENATORS boo and yell at SENATOR AMIDALA.

				PADMÉ
			 	(continuing)
			I warn you, if you vote to create
			this army, war will follow. I
			have experienced the misery of war 
			first-hand; I do not wish to do it
			again.

There is sporadic yelling for and against her statements.

				PADMÉ
			Wake up, Senators... you must wake
			up! If you offer the separatists
			violence, they can only show us
			violence in return! Many will
			lose their lives. All will lose
			their freedom. This decision
			could very well destroy the very
			foundation of our great Republic.
			I pray you do not let fear push
			you into a disastrous decision.
			Vote down this security measure,
			which is nothing less than a
			declaration of war! Does anyone
			here want that? I cannot believe
			they do.

There is an undercurrent of booing... and groaning. SENATOR ORN FREE TAA moves his pod next to AMIDALA.

				ORN FREE TAA
			My motion to defer the vote must
			be dealt with first. That is the
			rule of law.

AMIDALA looks angry and frustrated. PALPATINE gives her a sympathetic look.

				PALPATINE
			Due to the lateness of the hour
			and the seriousness of this
			motion, we will take up these
			matters tomorrow. Until then, the
			Senate stands adjourned.

EXT. EXECUTIVE QUARTERS BUILDING - DAY 
The giant towers of the Republic Executive Building seem to reach the heavens. Traffic clogs the smoggy sky.

INT. CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE - DAY 
CHANCELLOR PALPATINE sits behind his desk with TWO RED-CLAD ROYAL GUARDS on either side of the door. YODA, PLOT KOON, KI-AD-MUNDI, and MACE WINDU sit acress from him.

				PALPATINE
			I don't know how much longer I can
			hold off the vote, my friends.
			More and more star systems are
			joining the separatists.

				MACE WINDU
			If they do break away -

				PALPATINE
			No! I will not let that happen!

				MACE WINDU
			But if they do, you must realise
			there aren't enough Jedi to
			protect the Republic. We are
			keepers of the peace, not soldiers.

				PALPATINE
			Master Yoda, do you think it will
			really come to war?

YODA closes his eyes.

				YODA
			Worse than war, I fear... Much
			worse. 

				PALPATINE
			What?

				MACE WINDU
			What do you sense, Master?

				YODA
			Impossible to see ... The Dark Side
			clouds everything. But this I am
			sure of -
				(opens his eyes)
			Do their duty the Jedi will.

A muted BUZZER SOUNDS. A hologram of an AIDE, DAR WAC, appears on the Chancellor's desk.

				DAR WAC
			The loyalist committee has arrived,
			my Lord. 

				PALPATINE
			Send them in.

They all stand as SENATOR AMIDALA, CAPTAIN TYPHO, JAR JAR, MAS AMEDDA, DORME, and SENATORS BAIL ORGANA, HOROX RYYDER and ORN FREE TAA enter the office. YODA and MACE WINDU move to greet the SENATOR, YODA taps AMIDALA with his cane.

				YODA
			With you the force is strong...
			young Senator. To see you alive
			brings warm feeling to my heart.

				PADMÉ
			Thank you, Master Yoda. Do you
			have any idea who was behind
			the attack?

				MACE WINDU
			Our intelligence points to
			disgruntled spice miners, on
			the moons of Naboo.

				PADMÉ
			I don't wish to disagree but I
			think that Count Dooku was behind
			it.

There is a stir of surprise.

				MACE WINDU
			You know, M'Lady, Count Dooku
			was once a Jedi. He wouldn't
			assassinate anyone, it is not in
			his character.

				KI-ADI-MUNDI
			He is a political idealist, not
			a murderer.

				YODA
			In dark times nothing is what it
			appears to be, but the fact remains
			Senator, in grave danger you are.

PALPATINE gets up, walks to the window, and looks out at the vast city.

				PALPATINE
			Count Dooku has always avoided
			any kind of conflict. It appears
			he has no desire to start a war.
			Why would he kill you? To what end?

				PADMÉ 
			I don't know, but everything in my
			being tells me he was behind it... 

After gazing out of the window for several moments Palpatine turns to 
Mace.

				PALPATINE
			Master Jedi, may I suggest that
			the Senator be placed under the
			protection of your graces.

				BAIL ORGANA
			Do you think that is a wise use
			of manpower during these stressful
			times?

				PADMÉ
			Chancellor, if I may comment, I
			do not believe the...

				PALPATINE
			..."situation is that serious."
			No, but I do, Senator.

				PADMÉ
			Chancellor, please! I don't want
			any more guards!

				PALPATINE
			I realise all too well that
			additional security might be
			disruptive for you, but perhaps
			someone you are familiar with... an
			old friend like... Master Kenobi...

PALPATINE nods to MACE WINDU, who nods back.

				MACE WINDU
			That's possible. He has just
			returned from a Border dispute on
			Ansion.

				PALPATINE
			You must remember him, M'Lady...
			he watched over you during the
			blockade conflict.

				PADMÉ
			This is not necessary, Chancellor.

				PALPATINE
			Do it for me, M'Lady, please. I
			will rest easier. We had a big
			scare today. The thought of
			losing you is unbearable.

AMIDALA sighs as the JEDI get up to leave.

				MACE WINDU
			I will have Obi-Wan report to you
			immediately, M'Lady.

YODA leans into her ear.

				YODA
			Too little about yourself you
			worry, Senator, and too much about
			politics. Be mindful of your
			danger, Padmé. Accept our help.

As the JEDI leave the office, PALPATINE continues to pace behind his desk.

				PALPATINE
			I will not like this Republiv, that
			has stood for over a thousand
			years, be split in two

EXT. SENATE APARTMENTS - TWILIGHT
A graceful skyscraper twinkles in the evening light of Coruscant.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, APARTMENT CORRIDOR - EVENING
The door to the apartment slides open. JAR JAR walks into the corridor, where TWO JEDI are exiting the elevator. He recognises OBI-WAN and becomes extremely excited, jumping around, shaking his hand.

				JAR JAR
			Obi! Obi! Obi! Mesa sooo smilen
			to see'en yousa. Wahoooooo!

OBI-WAN smiles.

				OBI-WAN
			It's Good to see you, too, Jar Jar.

				JAR JAR
			Oops! Wheresa mesa manners?
			Excuse me, Master Obi-Wan. I
			completely forgot myself for
			a moment there. I have had to learn
			Diplodiaclect... speak it like a
			native now. Don't really see the
			point, actually, but members of
			the Senate seem to prefer it...

JAR JAR notices OBI-WAN'S APPRENTICE.

				JAR JAR
				(continuing)
			...and this, I take it, is your
			apprentice... Nooooooooo! Annie?
			Noooooooo! Little Bitty Annie?
				(Looks at Anakin)
			Nooooooo! Yousa so biggen!
			Yiyiyiyyi! Annie!! Mesa no
			believen.

				ANAKIN
			Hi, Jar Jar.

JAR JAR grabs hold of ANAKIN and envelops him in a big hug.

				JAR JAR
			Annie! Annie! Yiyiyiyiyiyiiii!

INT. SENATE BUILDING, APARTMENT - EVENING
PADME is in a conference with CAPTAIN TYPHO and DORME. JAR JAR enters the room, followed by the TWO JEDI.

				JAR JAR
			Lookie... lookie... Oops!... Oh,
			dear, I'm afraid I've forgotten
			myself again.

PADME and TYPHO rise as OBI-WAN and ANAKIN stop before the SENATOR. OBI-WAN steps forward. ANAKIN stares at PADME. She glances at him.

				OBI-WAN
			It's a great pleasure to see you again,
			M'Lady.

				PADMÉ
			It has been far too long Master
			Kenobi. I'm so glad our paths
			have crossed again... but I must
			warn you that I think your
			presence here is unnecessary.

				OBI-WAN
			I'm sure the Jedi Council have
			their reasons.

She moves in front of ANAKIN

				PADMÉ
			Annie??
				(stares)
			My goodness you've grown.

They look at each other for a long moment.

				ANAKIN
				(trying to be smooth)
			So have you... grown more
			beautiful, I mean... and much
			shorter... for a Senator, I mean.

OBI-WAN looks disapprovingly at his apprentice. PADME laughs and shakes her head.

				PADMÉ
			Oh Annie, you'll always be that
			little boy I knew on Tatooine.

This embarrasses ANAKIN, and he looks down. OBI-WAN and CAPTAIN TYPHO smile.

				OBI-WAN
			Our presence will be invisible,
			M'Lady.

				CAPTAIN TYPHO
			I am very grateful you are here,
			Master Kenobi. The situation is
			more dangerous than the Senator
			will admit.

				PADMÉ
			I don't need more security, I need
			answers. I want to know who is
			trying to kill me.

				OBI-WAN
				(frowning)
			We're here to protect you
			Senator, not to start an
			investigation.

				ANAKIN
			We will find out who is trying to
			kill you Padmé, I promise you.

He's done it again. He bites his lip in frustration and shame. OBI-WAN gives ANAKIN a dirty look.

				OBI-WAN
			We are not going to exceed our
			mandate, my young Padawan learner.

				ANAKIN
			I meant in the interest of
			protecting her, Master, of course.

				OBI-WAN
			We are not going through this
			exercise again, Anakin. You will
			pay attention to my lead.

				ANAKIN
			Why?

				OBI-WAN
			What??!!

				ANAKIN
			Why else do you think we were
			assigned to her, if not to find
			the killer? Protection is a job
			for local security... not Jedi.
			It's overkill, Master.
			Investigation is implied in our
			mandate.

				OBI-WAN
			We will do as the Council has
			instructed, and you will learn
			your place, young one.

				PADMÉ
			Perhaps with merely your presence,
			the mysteries surrounding this
			threat will be revealed.  Now if
			you will excuse me I will retire.

Everyone gives AMIDALA a slight bow as she and DORME leave the room.

				CAPTAIN TYPHO
			Well, I know I feel a lot better
			having you here.
			I'll have an officer on every
			floor and I'll be at the command
			centre downstairs.

				JAR JAR 
			Mesa busten wit happiness seein
			Yousa again, Annie. Deesa bad
			times, bombad times.

Captain Typho leaves.

				ANAKIN
			She didn't even recognise me, Jar
			Jar. I thought about her every
			day since we parted... and she's
			forgotten me completely.

				JAR JAR
			Shesa happy. Happier den mesa
			see-en her in longo time.

				OBI-WAN
			Anakin, you're focusing on the
			Negative again. Be mindful of your
			thoughts. She was glad to see us.
			Now lets check the security here.

				ANAKIN
			Yes, my master.

EXT. JEDI TEMPLE - EVENING
The vast Jedi Temple sits on an endless flat plain, silhouetted by a against the traffic-filled sky.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, CORRIDOR - EVENING
MACE WINDU and YODA walk down the long hallways, silhouetted by a lit room at the end.

				MACE WINDU
			Why couldn't we see this attack on
			the Senator?

				YODA
			Masking the future, is this
			disturbance in the Force.

				MACE WINDU
			The propecy is coming true, the
			Dark Side is growing.

				YODA
			And only those who have turned to
			the Dark Side can sense the
			possibilities of the future. Only
			going through the Dark Side can we
			see.

				MACE WINDU
			It's been ten years, and the Sith
			still have no shown themselves.
			Do you think they are behind this?

				YODA
			...Out there, they are. A
			certainty that is.

				MACE WINDU
			Do you think Obi-Wan's apprentice
			will be able to bring balance to
			the Force?

				YODA
			Only if he chooses to follow his
			destiny.

There is a long silence as they walk away. Only footsteps are heard.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT
PADME is asleep in her bed, lit only by the light of the city outside her window coming through the blinds. ARTOO stands in the corner of the bedroom. His power is off.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, MAIN R0OM - NIGHT
ANAKIN is standing in the living room. He is in a meditative state. It is quiet. We hear DISTANT FOOTSTEPS in the corridor outside the apartment. Suddenly ANAKIN'S eyes pop open. His eyes dart around the room. He reaches for his lightsaber, then smiles and puts it back in his belt.

The door to the apartment slides open, and OBI-WAN enters.

				OBI-WAN
			Captain Typho has more than enough
			men downstairs. No assassin will
			try that way. Any activity up
			here?

				ANAKIN
			Quiet as a tomb. I don't like
			just waiting here for something to
			happen to her.

OBI-WAN checks a palm-sized view scanner he has pulled out of his utility belt. It shows a shot of ARTOO by the door, but no sign of PADME on the bed.

				OBI-WAN
			What's going on?

ANAKIN shrugs.

				ANAKIN
			She covered that camera. I don't
			think she liked me watching her.

				OBI-WAN
			What is she thinking?

				ANAKIN
			She programmed Artoo to warn us if
			there's an intruder.

				OBI-WAN
			It's not an intruder I'm worried
			about. There are many other ways
			to kill a Senator.

				ANAKIN
			I know, but we also want to catch
			this assassin. Don't we, Master?

				OBI-WAN
			You're using her as bait??

				ANAKIN
			It was her idea... No harm will
			come to her. I can sense
			everything going on in that room.
			Trust me.

				OBI-WAN
			It's too risky... and your senses
			aren't that attuned, young
			apprentice.

				ANAKIN
			And yours are?

				OBI-WAN
			Possibly.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT
As PADME sleeps, a PROBE DROID approaches outside her window. It sends out several small arms that attach to the window, creating sparks that shut down the security system. Then a large arm cuts a small hole in the glass. A FAINT SOUND is heard as the small section of glass is removed from the window.

ARTOO wakes up, and his lights go on. The PROBE DROID freezes. ARTOO looks around, makes a PLAINTIVE LITTLE SOUND, then shuts down again. The PROBE DROID attaches a little tube to the window. TWO DEADLY LOOKING CENTIPEDE-LIKE KOUHUNS exit the tube, crawl through the blinds and head toward the sleeping PADME.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM - NIGHT
ANAKIN and OBI-WAN continue their conversation in the main room of the apartment.

				OBI-WAN 
			You look tired.

				ANAKIN
			I don't sleep well, anymore.

				OBI-WAN 
			Because of your mother?

				ANAKIN
			I don't know why I keep dreaming
			About her now. I haven't seen her
			since I was little.

				OBI-WAN
			Dreams pass in time.

				ANAKIN
			I'd rather dream of Padmé. Just
			Being around her again is...
			intoxicating.

				OBI-WAN
			Mind your thoughts, Anakin, they
			betray you. You've made a
			commitment to the Jedi order... a
			commitment not easily broken...
			and don't forget she's a
			politician. They're not to be
			trusted.

				ANAKIN 
			She's not like the others in the
			Senate, Master.

				OBI-WAN
			It's been my experience that
			Senators are only focused on
			pleasing those who fund their
			campaigns... and they are more
			than willing to forget the
			niceties of democracy to get those
			funds.

				ANAKIN
			Not another lecture, Master. Not
			on the economics of politics....
			It's too early in the morning... and
			besides, you're generalising. The
			Chancellor doesn't appear to
			be corrupt.

				OBI-WAN
			Palpatine's a politician, I've
			observed that he is very clever at
			following the passions and
			prejudices of the Senators.

				ANAKIN
			I think he is a good man. My
			instincts are very positive
			about...

ANAKIN looks stunned. He looks sharply at OBI-WAN

				OBI-WAN
			I sense it, too.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT
ARTOO sounds an alarm and shines a light on the bed. THE KOUHUNS are inches from PADME'S face. Their mouths are open, and wicked stinger tongues flick out.


OBI-WAN and ANAKIN burst into the room. The KOUHUNS stand on their hind legs and hiss as PADME wakes up. ANAKIN throws himself in front of her, whacking in half the deadly creatures with his lightsaber.

OBI-WAN sees the DROID outside the window and raqces straight at it, crashing through the blinds as he goes through the window.

EXT. WINDOW LEDGE, APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
OBI-WAN flies through the glass window and flings himself at the PROBE DROID, grabbing onto the deadly machine before it can flee. The PROBE DROID sinks under the weight of OBI-WAN but manages to stay afloat and fly away, with the Jedi hanging on for dear life, a hundred stories above the city.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
ANAKIN and PADME stare at the sight of OBI-WAN being carried off by the DROID. ANAKIN turns to her. She pulls her nightdress around her shoulders.

				ANAKIN
			Stay here!

CAPTAIN TYPHO, with TWO GUARDS and DORME, enter the room as Anakin dashes out.

EXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT - NIGHT
The PROBE DROID sends several protective electrical shocks across its surface, causing OBI-WAN to almost lose his grip. As they dart in and out of the speeder traffic, OBI-WAN disconnects a wire on the back of the DROID. Its power shuts off! OBI-WAN and the DROID drop like rocks. OBI-WAN realises the error of his ways and quickly puts the wire back. The DROID'S systems light up again and it takes off. 

EXT. SENATE APARTMENTS - ENTRANCE - NIGHT
ANAKIN charges out of the building and runs to a line of parked speeders. He vaults into an open one and takes off, gunning it fast toward the lines of speeder traffic high above.

EXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT - NIGHT
The DROID bumps against a wall, hoping to knock the Jedi loose. It moves behind a speeder afterburner to scorch him. It takesthe JEDI wildly between buildings and finally skims across a rooftop as OBI-WAN is forced to lift his legs, tenaciously hanging onto the DROID. The DROID heads for a dirty, beat-up speeder hidden in an alcove of a building about twenty stories up. When the pilot of the speeder, a scruffy bounty hunter called ZAM WESELL, sees the DROID approach with OBI-WAN hanging on, she pulls a long rifle out of the speeder and starts to fire at the JEDI. EXPLOSIONS burst all around OBI-WAN.

				OBI-WAN
			I have a bad feeling about this.

FINALLY, the DROID suffers a direct hit and blows up. OBI-WAN falls fifty stories, until a speeder drops down next to him, and he manages to grab onto the back end of the speeder and haul himself toward the cockpit. The JEDI struggles to climb into the passenger seat of the open speeder and sit down next to the driver, ANAKIN.

				ANAKIN
			That was wacky! I almost lost you
			in the traffic.

				OBI-WAN
			What took you so long?

				ANAKIN
			Oh, you know, Master, I couldn't
			find a speeder I really liked,
			with an open cockpit... and with
			the right speed capabilities...
			and then you know I had to get a
			really gonzo color...

They zoom upward in hot pursuit of ZAM asshe fires out the open window at them with her laser pistol.

				OBI-WAN
			If you'd spend as much time
			working on your saber skills as
			you do on your wit, young Padawan,
			you would rival Master Yoda as a
			swordsman.

				ANAKIN
			I thought I already did.

				OBI-WAN
			Only in your mind, my very young
			apprentice. Careful!! Hey, easy!!

As this conversation is going on, ANAKIN deftly moves in and out of the oncoming traffic, across lanes, between buildings, and miraculously through a construction site. ZAM WESELL continues firing at them.

				ANAKIN
			Sorry, I forgot you don't like
			flying, Master.

				OBI-WAN
			I don't mind flying... but
			what you're doing is suicide!

They barely miss a commuter train

				ANAKIN
			Master, you know I've been flying
			since before I could walk. I'm very
			good at this.

				OBI-WAN
			Just slow down!

ZAM WESSEL and the JEDI race through a line of cross-traffic made up of giant trucks. The speeders bank sideways as they slide around right-angle turns between buildings. ZAM races into a tram tunnel.

				OBI-WAN
				(continuing)
			Wait! Don't go in there!

ANAKIN zooms into the tunnel after ZAM. They see a tram coming at them. They brake, turn around, and race out, barely ahead of the charging commuter transport.

				OBI-WAN
				(continuing)
			You know I don't like it when you
			do that!

				ANAKIN
			Sorry, Master. Don't worry, this
			guy's gonna kill himself any
			minute now!

ZAM WESSEL turns into oncoming traffic, deliberately trying to throw the JEDI off. Oncoming speeders swerve, trying to avoid ZAM and the JEDI. ZAM does a quick, tight loop-over and ends up behind the JEDI. She is now in a much better position to fire at them with her laser pistol. To avoid being hit by the laser bolts, ANAKIN slams on the brakes and moves alongside ZAM. She now fires point-blank at OBI-WAN.

				OBI-WAN
			What are you doing? He's gonna
			blast me!

				ANAKIN
			Right - this isn't working.

ANAKIN slides underneath Zam's speeder. They race along in traffic, one speeder right on top of the other. The BOUNTY HUNTER skims over the rooftops, causing ANAKIN to drop behind. ANAKIN goes through his gears, zooming around traffic. They race at high speed across a wide, flat surface of the city planet. A large spacecraft almost collides with them as it attempts to land. They round a corner and clip a flag, which gets caught on one of the front air scoops.

				OBI-WAN
			That was too close!

				ANAKIN
			Clear that!

				OBI-WAN
			What??

				ANAKIN
			Clear the flag! We're losing
			power! Hurry!

OBI-WAN leans out of the speeder, then crawls out onto the front engine, pulling the flag free of the scoop. The speeder lurches forward with a surge of power.

				OBI-WAN
			Whooooaaa! Don't do that! I
			don't  like it when you do that!

				ANAKIN
			So sorry, Master.

They chase the BOUNTY HUNTER through a power refinery.

				OBI-WAN
			It's dangerous near those power
			couplings! Slow down! Don't go
			through there!

Huge electrical bolts shoot between the buildings as the speeders pass.

				OBI-WAN
				(continuing)
			Yiiii, what are you doing?

				ANAKIN
			Sorry, Master!

				OBI-WAN
				(sarcastically)
			Oh, that was good...

				ANAKIN
			That was crazy!!!

ZAM slides around a corner sideways, blocking an alley, firing point-blank as ANAKIN approaches.

				ANAKIN
				(continuing)
			Ahh, damn.

				OBI-WAN
			Stop!!

				ANAKIN
			No, we can make it.

ANAKIN barely misses the BOUNTY HUNTER'S speeder as he dives under it, and through a small gap in the building hitting several pipes and going wildly out of control. ANAKIN struggles to regain control of the speeder, narrowly missing a crane, barely clipping a pair of giant struts. A giant gasball shoots up, causing ANAKIN to spin and bump a building, stalling the speeder.

				OBI-WAN
			I'm crazy... I'm crazy... I'm
			crazy.

				ANAKIN
			But it worked... we made it.

				OBI-WAN
				(angrily)
			It didn't work... we've stalled!
			And you almost got us killed!

				ANAKIN
			I think we're still alive.

ANAKIN works to get the speeder started. It quickly races to life.

				OBI-WAN
				(very angrily)
			It was stupid!

				ANAKIN
				(sheepishly)
			I could have made it...

				OBI-WAN
				(furious)
			But you didn't!!! And now we've
			lost him.

Suddenly, there is an ambush. Laser bolts fire everywhere. EXPLOSIONS surround them. They look up to see ZAM WESSEL take off.

				ANAKIN
			No we didnt...

Out of a cloud of smoke and ball of flames the JEDI tear after ZAM. They are smoking. OBI-WAN slaps out the small fire on the dashboard. ZAM goes up and down, through cross-traffic. There is a near miss as a speeder almost hits them. ZAM turns down and left between two buildings. ANAKIN pulls up and to the right

				OBI-WAN
			Where are you going?! He went
			down there, the other way.

				ANAKIN
			This is a shortcut... I think.

				OBI-WAN
			What do you mean, You think?
			What kind of shortcut?! He went
			completely the other way! Youve
			lost him!

				ANAKIN
			Master, if we keep this chase
			going, that creeps gonna end up
			deep fried. Personally, Id very
			much like to find out who in the
			hell he is and who hes working
			for...

				OBI-WAN
				(sarcastic)
			Oh, so thats why were going in
			the wrong direction.

ANAKIN turns up a side street, zooming up several small passageways, then stops, hovering about fifty stories up.

				OBI-WAN
				(continuing)
			Well, you lost him.

				ANAKIN
			Im deeply sorry, Master.

ANAKIN looks around front and back. He spots something. He seems to 
start counting to himself as he watches something below approach.

				ANAKIN
				(continuing)
			Excuse me for a moment.

ANAKIN jumps out of the speeder. OBI-WAN looks down and sees Zams speeder about five stories below them cruising past. ANAKIN miraculously lands on top of the Bounty Hunters speeder. The speeder wobbles under the impact. ZAM looks up and realises what has happened.

ZAM takes off, and ANAKIN slides to the back strut and almost slips off, but manages to hang on. ANAKIN works his way back to the speeders cockpit, just as ZAM stops suddenly, and ANAKIN flies forward to the left front fork. ZAM shoots at him with a laser pistol. There is a BLAST near ANAKIN'S hand, which breaks off a piece of the speeder. ANAKIN slides to the right fork of the speeder, where ZAM cant reach him. He scrambles to the top, holding onto an air scoop.

OBI-WAN has jumped into the drivers seat of his speeder and is deftly gaining on the rogue speeder. The two speeders dive through oncoming traffic and then through cross traffic. Finally, ANAKIN is able to get hold of his lightsaber and starts to cut his way through the roof of the speeder. ZAM takes out her laser pistol and starts firing at the helpless JEDI, knocking the sword out of his hand. OBI-WAN races under the speeder and catches the Jedi weapon in the passengers seat.

ANAKIN sticks his hand into the cockpit and, using the Force, pulls the gun out of ZAMS hand. She grabs the Jedis hand, and they struggle for the weapon. It goes off, blowing a hole in the floor of the speeder. The speeder careens wildly out of control. ZAM struggles to pull the speeder out of its nose dive. OBI-WAN gets slowed down by traffic and loses sight of the Bounty Hunters speeder.

Just as the dragster is about to nose dive into the ground, ZAM pulls it out, and it slides hard on the pavement in a shower of sparks. ANAKIN goes flying into the street.

EXT. ENTERTAINMENT STREET - NIGHT
ZAM exits the crashed speeder and runs. ANAKIN picks himself up off the pavement and runs down the very crowded street.

It's the seedy underbelly of the city. Broken sidewalks, garish lights reflected on the filthy puddles. It's pretty crowded with various ALIEN LOW-LIFES, PANHANDLING DROIDS, and the occasional group of UPPERCLASS SLUMMERS.

ANAKIN barges into several of them as he chases after the fleeing ZAM. He loses the Bounty Hunter in the crowd, them sees him again. The young Jedi is having a very difficult time getting through the crowd.

Ahead, ZAM turns in through a door and disappears.

A nightclub sighs is flashing over the door. ANAKIN is just about to follow ZAM when there is a sudden swirl of litter from downthrusters. PEOPLE start moving out of the way, and the open speeder lands in the street beside him. OBI-WAN gets out and walks over, holding out ANAKIN'S lightsaber.

				OBI-WAN
			Anakin!

				ANAKIN
			She went into that club, Master.

				OBI-WAN
			Patience.

OBI-WAN hands ANAKIN the lightsaber.

				OBI-WAN
			 	(continuing)
			Here. Next time try not to lose it.

				ANAKIN
			Sorry, Master.

ANAKIN reaches for the lightsaber, but OBI-WAN holds it back.

				OBI-WAN
			A Jedi's saber is his most
			precious possession.

				ANAKIN
			Yes, Master.

He reaches for the lightsaber, OBI-WAN pulls it back.

				OBI-WAN
			He must keep it with him at all
			times.

				ANAKIN
			I know, Master.

				OBI-WAN
			This weapon is your life!

				ANAKIN
			I've heard this lesson before...

OBI-WAN finally holds out the lightsaber and ANAKIN grabs it.

				OBI-WAN
			But, you haven't learned anything,
			Anakin.

				ANAKIN
			I try, Master.

INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
OBI-WAN and ANAKIN enter the nightclub bar, and everyone stares at them

				OBI-WAN
			Why do I think you are going to be
			the death of me?!

				ANAKIN
			Don't say that Master... You're
			the closest thing I have to a
			father... I love you. I don't want
			to cause you pain.

				OBI-WAN
			Then why don't you listen to me?!

				ANAKIN
			I will. I'll do better, I promise.

				OBI-WAN
			Do you see him him?

				ANAKIN
			I think he's a she...

				OBI-WAN
			Then be extra careful...
				(nods to a room)
			Check it out.

OBI-WAN goes away.

				ANAKIN
			Where are you going, Master?

				OBI-WAN
			To get a drink.

OBI-WAN heads for the bar. ANAKIN blinks in surprise, then moves into the room, where ALIEN FACES look back at him with hostility, suspicion, and invitation as he moves among the tables. OBI-WAN arrives at the bar. He signals the BARMAN.

CLOSE - Somewhere in the room a HAND moves to a pistol in its holster and unsnaps the safety catch. At the bar, a glass is placed in from of OBI-WAN. A drink is poured. He lifts the glass.

				ELAN SLEAZEBAGGANO
			Wanna buy some death sticks?

OBI-WAN looks at him. He moves his fingers slightly.

				OBI-WAN
			You don't want to sell me death-
			sticks.

				ELAN
			I don't want to sell you death-
			sticks.

OBI-WAN moves his fingers.

				OBI-WAN
			You want to go home and rethink 
			your life.

				ELAN
			I want to go home and rethink my
			life.

He leaves. OBI-WAN lifts the drink and tosses it back.

CLOSE. The gun is drawn from its holster and held down out of sight. The BOUNTY HUNTER starts to move toward the bar.

ANAKIN checks out ALIEN FACES. OBI-WAN signals for another drink. The gun moves toward his unsuspecting back.

The drink is poured. OBI-WAN reaches for it. The gun is raised to aim directly at his back, and suddenly OBI-WAN turns fast. His lightsaber flashes. There is a shrill SCREAM and ZAM'S ARM hits the floor. The gun drops from its twitching fingers. Blood spreads.

The room is silent. ALIENS rise menacingly from their seats, and ANAKIN is suddenly at OBI-WAN's side, his lightsaber glowing.

				ANAKIN
			Easy... Official business. Go
			back to your drinks.

Slowly, the ALIENS sit. Conversation resumes. Onstage, THE PERFORMERS pick up their routine. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN lift ZAM and carry her out.

EXT. ALLEY OUTSIDE NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
OBI-WAN and ANAKIN carry ZAM into the alley and lower her to the ground. OBI-WAN attends to her wounded shoulder. She stares up hatefully at ANAKIN. She winces in pain, then nods.

				OBI-WAN
			Do you know who it was you were
			trying to kill?

				ZAM WESSEL
			The Senator from Naboo.

				OBI-WAN
			Who hired you?

ZAM glares at OBI-WAN.

				ZAM WESSEL
			It was just a job.

				ANAKIN
			Tell us!

				ZAM WESSEL
			That Senator's gonna die soon
			anyway, and the next one won't
			make the same mistake I did...

				OBI-WAN
			This wound's going to need
			treatment.

				ANAKIN
			Who hired you? Tell us... tell us
			now!

ZAM glares hatefully.

				ZAM
			It was a Bounty Hunter called...

There is a sudden FTZZZ sound. ZAM twitches. She blinks in surprise and dies.

There is a WEOOSH from above. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN look up yo see an ARMOURED ROCKET-MAN taking off from a roof high above. OBI-WAN looks down at ZAM. He touches her neck and pulls out a small, wicked-looking dart.

				OBI-WAN
			Toxic Dart...

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT - DAY
ANAKIN and JAR JAR stand near the door of the anteroom to PADME'S 
bedroom. PADME and DORME move about packing luggage.

				PADMÉ
			Representative Binks. I know I can
			count on you.

				JAR JAR
			Yousa betchen mesa bottums.

				PADMÉ
			What?!

				JAR JAR
				(coughs, recovers)
			Oh, pardone-ay, Senator. I mean,
			I am honoured to accept this heavy
			burden. I take on this
			responsibility with deep humility
			tinged with an overwhelming pride.
				(pompously)
			It is not every day that I am
			called upon to...

PADME kisses him on the cheek and gives him a hug. JAR JAR turns red.

				PADMÉ
			You're a good friend, Jar Jar. I
			don't wish to hold you up. I'm
			sure you have a great deal to do.

				JAR JAR
			Of course, M'lady.

JAR JAR bows and goes out. As he passes ANAKIN, he flashes a dazzling smile... PADME is in a very bad mood.

				PADMÉ
			I do not like this idea of hiding.

				ANAKIN
			Don't worry. Now that the Council
			has ordered an investigation, it
			won't take Master Obi-Wan long to
			find that bounty hunter.

				PADMÉ
				(frustrated)
			I haven't worked for a year to
			defeat the "Military Creation Act"
			not to be here when its fate is
			decided.

				ANAKIN
			Sometimes we have to let go of our
			pride and do what is requested of
			us.

				PADMÉ
			Pride?!? Annie, you're young, and
			you don't have a very firm grip on
			politics. I suggest you reserve
			your opinions for some other time.

				ANAKIN
			Sorry, M'lady. I was only trying
			to...

				PADMÉ
			Annie! No!

				ANAKIN
			Please don't call me that.

				PADMÉ
			What?

				ANAKIN
			Annie...

				PADMÉ
			I've always called you that... it
			is your name, isn't it?

				ANAKIN
			It's Anakin. When you say Annie
			it's like I'm still a little
			boy... and I'm not.

				PADMÉ
			I'm sorry, Anakin. It's impossible
			to deny you've...
				(looks him over)
			...that you've grown up.

PADME smiles at ANAKIN. He becomes a little shy.

				ANAKIN
			Master Obi-Wan manages not to see
			it...

				PADMÉ
			Mentors have a way of seeing more
			of our faults than we would like.
			It's the only way we grow.

				ANAKIN
			Don't get me wrong... Obi-Wan is
			a great mentor. As wise as Master
			Yoda and as powerful as Master
			Windu. I am truly thankful to be
			his apprentice. Only... although
			I'm a Padawan learner, in some
			ways... a lot of ways... I'm ahead
			of him. I'm ready for the trials.
			I know I am! He knows it too. He
			believes I'm too unpredictable...
			Other Jedi my age have gone
			through the trials and made it...
			I know I started my training
			late... but he won't let me move
			on.

				PADMÉ
			That must be frustrating.

				ANAKIN
			It's worse... he's overly
			critical. He never listens! He
			just doesn't understand! It's not
			fair!

PADME cannot surpress a laugh. She shakes her head.

				PADMÉ
			I'm sorry... You sounded exactly
			like that little boy I once knew,
			when he didn't get his way.

				ANAKIN
			I'm not whining! I'm not.

PADME just smiles at him. DORME laughs in the background.

				PADMÉ
			I didn't say it to hurt you.

				ANAKIN
			I know...

There is a brief silence. PADME comes over to ANAKIN.

				PADME
			Anakin...

They look into each other's eyes for the first time.

				PADMÉ
				(continuing)
			Don't try to grow up too fast.

				ANAKIN
			I am grown up. You said it
			yourself.

ANAKIN looks deep into PADME'S eyes.

				PADMÉ
			Please don't look at me like that.

				ANAKIN
			Why not?

				PADMÉ
			Because I can see what you're
			thinking.

				ANAKIN
				(laughing)
			Ahh... so, you have Jedi powers
			too?

DORME is watching with concern.

				PADMÉ
			It makes me feel uncomfortable.

				ANAKIN
			Sorry, M'lady.

ANAKIN backs away as PADME turns and goes back to her packing.

EXT. CORUSCANT, SPACEPORT FREIGHTER DOCKS, TRANSPORT BUS - DAY 
A small bus speeds toward the massive freighter docks of Coruscant's Industrial area. The spaceport is bustling with activity. Transports of various sizes moves supplies and passengers as giant floating cranes lift cargo out of starships. The bus stops before a huge intergalactic freighter starship. It parks in the shadows of an overhang.

INT. CORUSCANT, SPACEPORT FREIGHTER DOCKS, TRANSPORT BUS - DAY
ANAKIN and PADME, dressed in Outland peasant outfits, get up and head for the door where CAPTAIN TYPHO, DORME and OBI-WAN are waiting to hand them their luggage. DORME is dressed to look like Senator Amidala.

				CAPTAIN TYPHO
			Be safe, m'lady.

				PADMÉ
			Thank you, Captain. Take good
			care of Dorme... the threat's on
			you two now.

				DORME
			He'll be safe with me.

They laugh, and PADME embraces her faithful handmaiden. DORME start to weep.

				PADMÉ
			You'll be fine.

				DORME
			It's not me, M'Lady. I worry
			about you. What if they realise
			I'm not you?

				PADMÉ
				(looks to Anakin)
			Then my Jedi protector will have
			to prove how grown up he is.

DORME and PADME smile. ANAKIN frowns as OBI-WAN pulls him aside.

				OBI-WAN
			Anakin, you stay put on Naboo.
			Do not attract any attention. Do
			absolutely nothing without
			checking in with me or the Council.

				ANAKIN
			Yes, Master.

				OBI-WAN
				(to Padme)
			I will get to the bottom of this
			plot quickly, M'Lady. You'll be
			back here in no time.

				PADMÉ
			I will be most grateful for your
			speed, Master Jedi.

				ANAKIN
			Time to go.

				PADMÉ
			I know. 

PADME gives DORME a last hug. ANAKIN picks up the luggage, and the TWO PEASANTS exit the speeder bus, where ARTOO is waiting for them.

				OBI-WAN
			May the Force be with you.

				ANAKIN
			May the Force be with you, Master.

They head off toward the giant Starfreighter.

				PADMÉ
			Suddenly, I'm afraid...

				ANAKIN
			I'm kinda scared too. This is my
			first assignment on my own.

				PADMÉ
			There's nothing to worry about...
			we have Artoo with us.

The two laugh.

OBI-WAN and CAPTAIN TYPHO watch ANAKIN and PADME disappear into the 
vastness of the spaceport with ARTOO trundling along behind them.

				OBI-WAN
			I hope he doesn't try anything
			foolish.

				CAPTAIN TYPHO
			I'd be more concerned about her
			doing something, than him.

EXT. FREIGHTER DOCKS - CORUSCANT - DAY
The freighter slowly takes off from the huge docks area of Coruscant. It soon moves into the crowded skies.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, MAIN HALLWAY - LATE DAY
From high above, light streams down from the lofty ceilings. OBI-WAN crosses the floor of the great hallway, heaading for the Analysis Rooms.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, ANALYSIS CUBICLES - LATE DAY
OBI-WAN walks past several glass cubicles where work is going on. He comes to an empty one and sits down in front of a console. A PK-4 ANALYSIS DROID comes to life. A tray slides out of the console.

				PK-4
			Place the subject for analysis on
			the sensot tray, please.

OBI-WAN puts the dart onto the traym which retracts into the console. The DROID activates the system, and a screen lights up in from of OBI-WAN.

				OBI-WAN
			It's a toxic dart. I need to know
			where it came from and who made it.

				PK-4
			One moment, please.

Diagrams and .... appear on the screem, scrolling past at great speed. OBI-WAN watches as the screen goes blank. They tray slides out.

				PK-4
				(continuing)
			As you can see on your screen,
			subject weapon does not exist in
			any known culture. Markings
			cannot be identified. Probablt
			self-made by a warrior not
			associated with any known society.

				OBI-WAN
			Excuse me? Could you try again
			please?

				PK-4
			Master Jedi, our records are very
			thorough. they cover eight
			percent of the galaxy. If I can't
			tell you where it came from,
			nobody can.

OBI-WAN picks up the dart and looks at it, then looks to the DROID.

				OBI-WAN
			Thanks for your assistance! You
			may not be able to figure this
			out, but I think I know someone
			who might.

EXT. SPACE, STARSHIP FREIGHTER
The massive, slow-moving Freighter suddenly zooms away into lightspeed.

INT. STARFREIGHTER, STORAGE HOLD - DAY
The great, gloomy hold is crowded with EMIGRANTS and their belongings. To one side ARTOO is coming to the head of a food line, where SERVERS are ladling out bowls of mush. ARTOO holds two bowls.

				SERVER
			Keep moving! Keep moving!

ARTOO slips tube into a tub of mush and sucks up a large quantity. With one of his little claw-arms, he grabs several chunks of something that looks like brown bread. A SERVER sees him.

				FOOD SERVER
				(continuing)
			Hey! No Droids!

ARTOO takes one last big suck and heads away from the food line. The SERVER shouts after him angrily. The little droid moves past groups of eating or sleeping EMIGRANTS and comes to where ANAKIN is sound asleep. The young Jedi seems to be having a nightmare. He is very restless.

				ANAKIN
			No, no, Mom, no...

He is sweating. PADME leans over to wipe some of the sweat from his forehead. He wakes up with a start, then realises where he is. PADME simply looks at him. He stares back, somewhat confused. ARTOO fills up two bowls with mush.

				ANAKIN
				(continuing)
			What?

				PADMÉ
			You seemed to be having a
			nightmare.

ANAKIN looks at PADME a little more closely, trying to see if he has revealed any of his secrets. She hands him a bowl of mush and bread.

				PADMÉ
				(continuing)
			Are you hungry?

				ANAKIN
			Thank you.

				PADMÉ
			We went into lightspeed a while
			ago.

ANAKIN looks into PADME'S eyes.

				ANAKIN
			I look forward to seeing Naboo
			again. I've thought about it every
			day since I left. It's by far the
			most beautiful place I've ever
			seen...

PADME is a little unnerved by his intense stare. 

				PADMÉ
			You were just a little boy then.
			It may not be as you remember it;
			time changes your perception.

				ANAKIN
			I think time has given me much
			more mature feelings to enhance my
			perception.

				PADMÉ
			It must be difficult having sworn
			your life to the Jedi... not being
			able to visit the places you
			like... or do the things you
			like...

				ANAKIN
			Or be with the people I love.

				PADMÉ
			Are you allowed to love? I
			thought that was forbidden for a
			Jedi.

				ANAKIN
			Attachment is forbidden.
			Possession is forbidden.
			Compassion, which I would define
			as unconditional love, is central
			to a Jedi's life, so you might say
			we're encouraged to love.

				PADMÉ
			You have changed so much

				ANAKIN
			You haven't changed a bit. You're
			exactly the way I remember you in
			my dreams. I doubt if Naboo has
			changed much either.

				PADMÉ
			It hasn't...

				ANAKIN
			I can't wait to breathe the sweet
			breeze that comes off the rolling
			hills. Whenever I try to
			visualise the Force, those hills
			are what I see.

ANAKIN looks at PADME when he says this.

				ANAKIN
				(continuing)
			I love Naboo.

There is an awkward moment.

				PADMÉ
				(changing the subject)
			Were you dreaming about you
			mother earlier, weren't you?

				ANAKIN
			Yes... I left Tatooine so long
			ago, my memory of her is fading.
			I don't want to lose it. Recently
			I've been seeing her in my
			dreams... vivid dreams... scary
			dreams. I worry about her.

PADME gives ANAKIN a sympathetic look.

EXT. CORUSCANT, DOWNTOWN, BACK STREET - MORNING
OBI-WAN walks down the street. It is a pretty tough part of town. Old buildings, warehouses, beat up speeders and transporter rigs occasional "shiny freighters" hissing through.

OBI-WAN comes to a kind of alien diner. On the steamed-up windowa it says "DEX'S DINER" in alien lettering. He goes inside.

INT. CORUSCANT, DEX'S DINER - MORNING
A young waitress, HERMIONE BAGWA, is wiping off a booth tabletop. There is a counter with stools and a line of booths along the wall by the window. A number of CUSTOMERS are eating - TOUGH-LOOKING WORKERS, FREIGHTER DRIVERS etc. HERMIONE looks up as OBI-WAN comes in.

				HERMIONE
			Can I help ya?

				OBI-WAN
			I'm looking for Dexter.

HERMIONE'S eyes narrow.

				HERMIONE BAGWA
			Waddya want him for?

				OBI-WAN
			He's not in trouble. It's
			personal.

HERMIONE stares at OBI-WAN. There is a brief pause. Then she goes to the open serving hatch behind the counter.

				HERMIONE BAGWA
			Someone to see ya, honey
				(lowering her voice)
			A Jedi, by the looks of him.

Steam billows out from the kitchen hatch behind the counter as a huge head pokes through.

				DEXTER JETTSTER
			Obi-Wan!

				OBI-WAN
			Hey, Dex.

				DEXTER JETTSTER
			Take a seat! Be right with ya!

OBI-WAN sits in a booth.

				HERMIONE BAGWA
			You want a cup of ardees?

				OBI-WAN
			Thank you.

HERMIONE moves off as the door to the counter opens and DEXTER JETTSTER appears. He is big - bald and sweaty, old and alien. Not someone to tangle with. He arrives, beaming hugely.

				DEXTER JETTSTER
			Hey, ol' buddy!

				OBI-WAN
			Hey, Dex.

DEXTER eases himself into the seat opposite OBI-WAN. He can just make it. HERMIONE sets two mugs of steaming ardees in from of them.

				DEXTER JETTSTER
			So, my friend. What can I do for
			ya?

				OBI-WAN
			You can tell me what this is.

OBI-WAN places the dart on the table between them. DEX'S eyes widen. He puts down his mug.

				DEXTER JETTSTER
			Well, whattaya know...

DEXTER picks up the dart delicately between his puffy fingers and peers at it.

				DEXTER JETTSTER
				(continuing)
			I ain't seen one of these since I
			was prospecting on Subterrel
			beyond the Outer Rim!

				OBI-WAN
			Do you know where it came from?

DEXTER grins. He puts the dart down between them.

				DEXTER JETTSTER
			This baby belongs to them cloners.
			What you got here is a Kamino
			Kyberdart.

				OBI-WAN
			Kamino Kyberdart... I wonder why
			it didn't show up in any analysis
			archive.

				DEXTER JETTSTER
			It's these funny little cuts on
			the side give it away...
			Those analysis droids you've got
			over there only focus on symbols,
			you know. I should think you Jedi
			would have more respect for the
			difference between knowledge and
			wisdom.

				OBI-WAN
			Well, Dex, if droids could think, we
			wouldn't be here, would we?
				(laughing)
			Kamino... doesn't sound familiar.
			Is it part of the Republic?

				DEXTER JETTSTER
			No, it's beyond the Outer Rim.
			I'd say about twelve parsecs
			outside the Rishi Maze, toward the
			south. It should be easy to find,
			even for those droids in your
			archive to find. Those Kaminoans
			keep to themselves. They're
			cloners. Damned good ones, too.

OBI-WAN then picks up the dart, holding it midway between them.

				OBI-WAN
			Cloners? Are they friendly?

				DEXTER JETTSTER
			It depends.

				OBI-WAN
			On what, Dex?

Dexter grins. 

				DEXTER JETTSTER
			On how good your manners are...
			and how big your pocketbook is...

EXT. NABOO SPACEPORT - DAY
The Starfreighter lands in the giant port city of Theed.

PADME, ANAKIN and ARTOO are among the EMIGRANTS streaming from the Starfreighter and into the vast docking area. They exit onto the main plaza.

EXT. NABOO PALACE, GRAND COURTYARD (NABOO) - AFTERNOON
The speeder bus pulls up and stops. PADME, ANAKIN, and ARTOO get out. The great courtyard stretches out before them, and they see the rose-colored dome of the palace on the far side. ARTOO WHISTLES. They pick up their gear and start to cross the courtyard. ARTOO trundles behind them.

				ANAKIN
			If I grew up here, I don't think
			I'd ever leave.

				PADMÉ
				(laughing)
			I doubt that.

				ANAKIN
			No, really. When I started my
			training, I was very homesick and
			very lonely. This city and my Mom
			were the only pleasant things I
			had to think about... The problem
			was, the more I thought about my
			Mom, the worse I felt. But I
			would feel better if I thought
			about the palace - the way it
			shimmers in the sunlight - the way
			the air always smells of flowers...

				PADMÉ
			...and the soft sound of the
			distant waterfalls. The first
			time I saw the Capital, I was very
			young... I'd never seen a
			waterfall before. I though they
			were so beautiful... I never
			dreamed one day I'd live in the
			palace.

				ANAKIN
			Well, tell me, did you dream of
			power and politics when you were
			a little girl?

				PADMÉ
				(laughing)
			No! That was the last thing I
			thought of. My dream was to help
			in the "Refugee Relief Movement."
			I never thought of running for
			elected office. But the more
			history I studied, the more I
			realised how much good politicians
			could do. So when I was eight, I
			joined the "Apprentice
			Legislators", then later on became
			a Senatorial advisor, with such a
			passion that, before I knew it, I
			was elected Queen. Partly because
			I scored so high on my education
			certificate, but for the most part
			it was my conviction that reform
			was possible. I wasn't the
			youngest Queen ever elected, but
			now that I think back on it, I'm
			not sure I was old enough. I'm not
			sure I was ready.

				ANAKIN
			The people you served thought you
			did a good job. I heard they
			tried to amend the Constitution so
			you could stay in office.

				PADMÉ
			Popular rule is not democracy,
			Annie. It gives the people what
			they want, not what they need.
			And, truthfully, I was relieved
			when my two terms were up. So
			were my parents. They worried
			About me during the blockade and
			couldn't wait for it all to be
			over. Actually, I was hoping to
			have a family by now... My
			sisters have the most amazing,
			wonderful kids... but when the
			Queen asked me to serve as
			Senator, I couldn't refuse her.

				ANAKIN
			I agree! I think the Republic
			needs you... I'm glad you chose
			to serve. I feel things are going
			to happen in our generation that
			will change the galaxy in profound
			ways.

				PADMÉ
			I think so too.

ANAKIN and PADME walk toward the palace. ARTOO continues to follow.

INT. NABOO PALACE, THRONE ROOM - AFTERNOON
QUEN JAMILLIA is seated on the throne, flanked by SIO BIBBLE and a COUPLE OF ADVISORS. FOUR HANDMAIDENS stand close by, and GUARDS are at the doors.

				QUEEN JAMILLIA
			We've been worried about you.
				(takes her hand)
			I'm so glad you're safe, Padmé.

				PADMÉ
			Thank you, Your Highness. I only
			Wish I could have served you
			better by staying on Coruscant for
			the vote.

				SIO BIBBLE
			Given the circumstances, Senator,
			you know it was the only decision
			Her Highness could have made.

				QUEEN JAMILLIA
			How many systems have joined Count
			Dooku and the separatists?

				PADMÉ
			About two hundred. And more are
			leaving the Republic every day.
			If the Senate votes to create an
			army, I'm sure it's going to push
			us into a civil war.

				SIO BIBBLE
			It's unthinkable! There hasn't
			been a full-scale war since the
			formation of the Republic!

				QUEEN JAMILLIA
			Do you see any way, through
			negotiations, to bring the
			separatists back into the Republic?

				PADMÉ
			Not if they feel threatened. The
			separatists don't have an army,
			but if they are provoked, they
			will move to defend themselves.
			I'm sure of that. And with no time
			or money to build an army, my
			guess is they will turn to the
			Commerce Guilds or the Trade
			Federation for help.

				QUEEN JAMILLIA
			The armies of commerce! Why has
			Nothing been done in the Senate
			to restrain them?

				PADMÉ
			I'm afraid that, despite the
			Chancellor's best efforts, there
			are still many bureaucrats,
			judges, and even Senators on the
			payrolls of the Guilds.

				SIO BIBBLE
			It's outrageous! After all of
			those hearings, and the four trials in
			the Supreme Court, Nute Gunray is
			still the Viceroy of the Trade
			Federation. Do those money
			mongers control everything?

				QUEEN JAMILLIA
			Remember, Counsellor, the courts
			were able to reduce the
			Federation's armies. That's a
			move in the right
			direction.

				PADMÉ
			There are rumours, Your Highness,
			that the Federation Army was not
			reduced as they were ordered.

				ANAKIN
			The Jedi have not been allowed to
			investigate. It would be to be too
			dangerous for the economy, we were
			told.

				QUEEN JAMILLIA
			We must keep our faith in the
			Republic. The day we stop
			believing democracy can work is
			the day we lose it.

				PADMÉ
			Let's pray that day never comes.

				QUEEN JAMILLIA
			In the meantime, we must consider
			your own safety.

SIO BIBBLE signals. All the other ADVISORS and ATTENDANTS bow and leave the room.

				SIO BIBBLE
				(to Anakin)
			What is your suggestion, Master
			Jedi?

				PADMÉ
			Anakin's not a Jedi yet, Counsellor.
			He's still a Padawan learner. I
			was thinking...

				ANAKIN
				(nettled)
			Hey, hold on a minute!

				PADMÉ
			Excuse me! I was thinking I would
			stay in the Lake Country. There
			are some places up there that are
			very isolated.

				ANAKIN
			Excuse me?! I am in charge of
			security here, M'Lady.

SIO BIBBLE and QUEEN JAMILLIA exchange a look. Something is going on here.

				PADMÉ
			Annie, my life is at risk, and
			this is my home. I know it very
			well... that is why we're here.
			I think it would be wise for you
			to take advantage of my knowledge
			in this instance.

				ANAKIN
				(takes a deep breath)
			Sorry, M'Lady.

				SIO BIBBLE
				(to Anakin, amused)
			She is right. The Lake Country is
			the most remote part of Naboo.
			Not many people and a clear view
			of the surrounding terrain.

				QUEEN JAMILLIA
			Perfect. It's settled then.

ANAKIN glares at PADME. Then QUEEN JAMILLIA gets up, and they all start to leave.

				QUEEN JAMILLIA
				(continued)
			Padmé, I had an audience with your
			father yesterday. I told him what
			was happening. He hopes you will
			visit your mother before you
			leave... your family's very
			worried about you.

PADME looks worred. They ALL exit down the main staircase.

EXT. JEDI TEMPLE - DAY
The main entrance at the base of the huge temple is bustling with activity. All sorts of JEDI are coming and going.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, ARCHIVES LIBRARY - DAY
A bronze bust of Count Dooku, stands among a line of other busts of Jedi in the Archive Room. OBI-WAN stands in front it, studying the striking features of the chiselled face.

On the walls, lighted computer panels seem to stretch into infinity. Farther along the room in the background, FIVE JEDI are seated at tables, studying archival material.

After OBI-WAN studies the bust for a few moments before MADAME JOCASTA NU, the Jedi Archivist is standing next to him. She is an elderly, frail-looking human Jedi. Tough as old boots and smart as a whip.

				JOCASTA NU
			Did you call for assistance?

				OBI-WAN
				(distracted in thought)
			Yes... yes, I did...

				JOCASTA NU
			He has a powerful face, doesn't
			he? He was one of the most
			brilliant Jedi I have had the
			privilege of knowing.

				OBI-WAN
			I never understood why he quit.
			Only twenty Jedi have ever left
			the Order.

				JOCASTA NU
				(sighs)
			The Lost Twenty... and Count Dooku
			was the most recent and the most
			painful. No one likes to talk
			about it. His leaving was a great
			loss to the Order.

				OBI-WAN
			What happened?

				JOCASTA NU
			Well, one might say, he was always
			a bit out of step with the
			decisions of the Council... much
			like your old Master, Qui-Gon Jinn.

				OBI-WAN
				(surprised)
			Really?

				JOCASTA NU
			Oh, yes. They were alike in many
			ways. Very individual thinkers...
			idealists...

JOCASTA NU stares at the bust

				JOCASTA NU
				(continuing
			He was always striving to become
			a more powerful Jedi. He wanted
			to be the best. With a lightsaber,
			in the old style of fencing, he
			had no match. His knowledge of
			the Force was... unique. In the
			end, I think he left because he
			lost faith in the Republic. He
			believed that politics were
			corrupt, and he felt the Jedi
			betrayed themselves by serving the
			politicians. He always had very
			high expectations of government.
			He disappeared for nine or ten
			years, then he just showed up
			recently as the head of the
			separatist movement.

				OBI-WAN
			Interesting... I'm still not sure
			I understand.

				JOCASTA NU
			Well, I'm sure you didn't call me
			over here for a history lesson.
			Are you having a problem, Master
			Kenobi?

				OBI-WAN
			Yes, I'm trying to find a planet
			system called Kamino. It doesn't
			seem to show upon any of the
			archive charts.

				JOCASTA NU
			Kamino? It's not a system I'M
			familiar with... Let me see...

JOCASTA NU leans over OBI-WAN'S shoulder, looking at the screen.

				JOCASTA NU
				(continuing)
			Are you sure you have the right
			co-ordinates?

				OBI-WAN
				(nodding)
			According to my information, it
			should be in this quadrant
			somewhere... just south of the
			Rishi Maze.

JOCASTA NU taps the keyboard and frowns.

				JOCASTA NU
			No co-ordinates? It sounds like the
			kind of directions you'd get from
			a street tout... some old miner or
			Furbog trader.

				OBI-WAN
			All three actually.

				JOCASTA NU
			Are you sure it exists?

				OBI-WAN
			Absolutely.

				JOCASTA NU
			Let me do a gravitational scan.

OBI-WAN and JOCASTA NU studt the star map hologram.

				JOCASTA NU
			There are some inconsistencies
			here. Maybe the planet you're
			looking for was destroyed.

				OBI-WAN
			Wouldn't that be on record?

				JOCASTA NU
			It ought to be. Unless it was very
			recent.
				(shakes her head)
			I hate to say it, but it looks
			like the system you're searching
			for doesn't exist.

				OBI-WAN
			That's impossible... perhaps the
			archives are incomplete.

				JOCASTA NU
			The archives are comprehensive and
			totally secure, my young Jedi.
			One thing you may be absolutely
			sure of - if an item does not
			appear in our records, it does not
			exist!

OBI-WAN stares at her, then looks back at the map.

EXT. THEED, RESIDENTIAL AREA, SIDE STREET - AFTERNOON
PEOPLE are passing through the little street, OLD MEN are sunning themslves, WOMEN are gossipping, KIDS are playing. ANAKIN, PADME and ARTOO turn onto a side street. ANAKIN is back in his Jedi robes. PADME wear a beautiful simple dress. She stops, beaming.

				PADME
			There's my house!

PADME starts forward; ANAKIN hangs back.

				PADME
				(continuing)
			What? Don't say you're shy!

				ANAKIN
				(untruthfully)
			No, but I...

Suddenly, there are shouts from two little girils, RYOO (age 6) and POOJA (age 4). They come running toward PADME.

				RYOO & POOJA
			Aunt Padme!! Aunt Padme!!

				PADME
			Ryoo!! Pooja!!

PADME scoops up RYOO and POOJA and hugs them.

				PADME
				(continuing)
			I'm so happy to see you! This is
			Anakin. Anakin, this is Ryoo, and
			this is Pooja.

ANAKIN and the GIRLS say hello shyly. Then:

				RYOO & POOJA
			Artoo!!!

As they see the droid, they hug him. ARTOO WHISTLES and BEEPS. PADME laughs. ANAKIN and PADME go on toward the house. The GIRLS stay and play with ARTOO.

INT. PADME'S PARENTS' HOUSE, MAIN ROOM - AFTERNOON
SOLA, PADME'S beautiful older sister, comes in from the kitchen carrying a big bowl of food.

				SOLA
				(over her shoulder)
			They're eating over at Jev
			Narran's later, Mom. They just
			had a snack. They'll be fine.

SOLA puts the bowl down on the table, where ANAKIN, PADME and RUWEE NABERRIE (Padme's father) are coming into the room.

				PADME
			Anakin, this is my sister, Sola.

				SOLA
			Hello, Anakin.

				ANAKIN
			Hello.

SOLA sits, as JOBAL NABERRIE (Padme's mother) comes in with a heaped bowl of steaming food.

				JOBAL
			You're just in time for dinner. I
			hope you're hungry, Anakin.

				ANAKIN
			A little.

				PADME
			He's being polite, Mom. We're
			starving.

				RUWEE
				(grinning)
			You came to the right place at the
			right time. Sit down, son.

EVERYONE sits and starts passing food.

				JOBAL
				(to Padme)
			Honey, it's so good to see you
			safe. We were so worried.

PADME gives JOBAL a dirty look. RUWEE smiles as he watches.

				RUWEE
			Dear...

				JOBAL
			I know, I know... but I had to say
			it. Now it's done.

				SOLA
			Well, this is exciting! Do you
			know, Anakin, you're the first
			boyfriend my sister's ever brought
			home?

				PADME
				(rolls her eyes)
			Sola!! He isn't my boyfriend!
			He's a Jedi assigned by the Senate
			to protect me.

				JOVAL
			A bodyguard?! Oh, Padme! They
			didn't tell us it was that serious!

				PADME
			It's not, Mom, I promise.
				(glances at Jobal)
			Anyway, Anakin's a friend. I've
			known him for years. Remember
			that little boy who was with the
			Jedi during the blockade crisis?

They nod.

				PADME
				(continuing)
			He grew up.

				JOBAL
			Honey, when are you going to
			settle down? Haven't you had
			enough of that life? I certainly
			have!

				PADME
			Mom, I'm not in any danger.

				RUWEE
				(to Anakin)
			Is she?

				ANAKIN
			...Yes... I'm afraid she is.

				PADME
				(quickly)
			But not much.

EXT. PADME'S PARENTS' GARDEN - AFTERNOON
ANAKIN and RUWEE are walking.

				RUWEE
			Sometimes I wish I'd traveled
			more... but I must say, I'm happy
			here.

				ANAKIN
			Padme tells me you teach at the
			university?

				RUWEE
				(nodding)
			Yes, and before that, I was a
			builder. I also worked for the
			Refugee Relief Movement, when I
			was very young.

INT. PADME'S PARENTS' HOUSE, MAIN ROOM - AFTERNOON
PADME, SOLA and JOBAL are clearing the table.

				SOLA
			Why haven't you told us about him?

				PADMÉ
			What's there to talk about?  He's
			just a boy.

				SOLA
			A boy? Have you seen the way he
			looks at you?

				PADMÉ
			Sola - stop it!

				SOLA
			It's obvious he has feelings for
			you. Are you saying, little baby
			sister, that you haven't noticed?

				PADMÉ
			I'm not your baby sister, Sola.
			Anakin and I are friends... our
			relationship is strictly
			professional.
				(to Jobal)
			Mom, would you tell her to stop it?

				SOLA
				(laughing)
			Well, maybe you haven't noticed
			the way he looks at you. I think
			you're afraid to.

				PADMÉ
			Cut it out.

				JOBAL
			Sola's just concerned... we all
			are.

				PADMÉ
			Oh, Mom, you're impossible. What
			I'm doing is important.

				JOBAL
			You've done your service, Padmé.
			It's time you had a life of your
			own. You're missing so much!

EXT. PADME'S PARENTS' GARDEN - AFTERNOON
ANAKIN and RUWEE are walking in the garden. RUWEE stops and faces ANAKIN directly.

				RUWEE
			Now tell me, son. How serious is
			this thing? How much danger is my
			daughter really in?

				ANAKIN
			There have been two attempts on
			her life. Chances are there'll be
			more. My Master is tracking down
			the assassins. I'm sure he'll find
			out who they are. This situation,
			won't last long.

				RUWEE
			I don't want anything to happen to
			her.

				ANAKIN
			I don't either.

INT. PADME'S PARENTS' HOUSE, PADME'S ROOM - AFTERNOON
PADME throws some things into a bag.

				PADME
			Don't worry, this won't take long.

				ANAKIN
			I just want to get there before
			dark.

PADME goes on packing. ANAKIN looks around the room.

				ANAKIN
				(continuing)
			You still live at home.

				PADME
			I move around so much, I've never
			had a place of my own. Official
			residences have no warmth. I feel
			good here. I feel at home.

				ANAKIN
			I never had a real home. Home was
			always where my Mom was.

ANAKIN picks up a framed hologram.

				ANAKIN
				(continuing)
			Is this you?

The hologram shows Padme at age seven or eight surrounded by forty or fifty little green creatures. She is holding one in her arms. They are all smiling hugely.

				PADME
			That was when I went with the
			Relief Group to Shadda-Bi-Boran.
			Their sun was imploding, and the
			planet was dying. I was helping
			to relocate the children. See
			that little one I'm holding? His
			name was N'a-kee-tula, which means
			sweethear. He was so full of 
			life,. All those kids were. I did
			everything I could to save him,
			but he died... they all did. They
			were never able to adapt... to
			live off their native planet.

ANAKIN picks up another hologram. It shows PADME at age ten or eleven. She is wearing official robes and standing between two robed legislators. Her expression is severe.

				PADME
				(continuing)
			My first day as an Apprentice
			Legislator. Notice the difference?

PADME pulls a face. ANAKIN grins. She continues packing. ANAKIN sets the two holograms down side by side - the beaming little girl, and the the stern, unsmiling adolescent.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, MAIN HALLWAY - DAY
OBI-WAN walks through the main hallway to the training area.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, TRAINING VERANDA - DAY
OBI-WAN comes out onto the veranda and stops, watching TWENTY or so FOUR-YEAR-OLDS doing training exercises, supervised by YODA. They wear helmets over their eyes and try to strike little TRAINING DROIDS with their miniature lightsabers. The DROIDS dance in front of them.

				YODA
			Don't think... feel... be as one
			with the Force. Help you, it will.
				(he sees Obi-Wan)
			Younglings - enough! A visitor we
			have. Welcome him.

The CHILDREN take off their helmets and turn off their lightsabers.

				YODA
				(continuing)
			Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, meet the
			mighty Bear Clan.

				CHILDREN
			Welcome, Master Obi-Wan!

				OBI-WAN
			I am sorry to disturb you, Master.

				YODA
			What help to you, can I be?

				OBI-WAN
			Im looking for a planet described
			to me by an old friend. I trust
			him. But the system doesnt show
			up on the archive maps.

				YODA
			An interesting puzzle. Gather
			round the map reader, younglings.
			Master Obi-Wan has lost a planet.
			Find it, we will try...

The map reader is a small shaft with a hollow opening at the top. The CCHILDREN gather around it. OBI-WAN takes out a little glass ball and places it into the bowl. The window shades close darkening the room and the reader lights up, projecting the star map hologram into the room. The CHILDREN laugh. Some of them reach up to try and touch the nebulae and stars. OBI-WAN walks into the display.

				OBI-WAN
			This is where it ought to be...
			but it isnt. Gravity is pulling
			all the stars in this area inward
			to this spot. There should be a
			star here... but there isnt.

				YODA
			Most interesting. Gravitys
			silhouette remains, but the star
			and all its planets have
			disappeared. How can this be?

There is a brief pause. Then a CHILD puts its hand up. YODA nods.

				JEDI CHILD JACK
			Because someone erased it from the
			archive memory.

				CHILDREN
			Thats right! Yes! Thats what
			happened! Someone erased it!

				JEDI CHILD MAY
			If the planet blew up, the gravity
			would go away.

OBI-WAN stares; YODA chuckles.

				YODA
			Truly wonderful, the mind of a
			child is. Uncluttered. To the
			centre of the pull of gravity go,
			and find your planet you will.

				OBI-WAN
			But Master Yoda who could have
			erased information from the
			archives? Thats impossible,
			isnt it?

				YODA
				(frowning)
			Much harder to answer, that
			question is.

EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, WATER SPEEDER, LANDING PLATFORM - LATE AFTERNOON
A water speeder driven by PADDY ACCU, the retreat caretaker, skims across the lake away from the island landing platform where a chrome Naboo Starship rests. ANAKIN and PADME are sitting in the speeder as it skims away to where a lodge rises on a beautiful island in the middle of the lake.

EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, GARDEN TERRACEM LATE AFTERNOON
ANAKIN and PADME walk up the stairs from where the water speeder is parked onto a terrace overlooking a lovely garden. Behind them, PADDY ACCU supervises two serving girls, NANDI and TECKLA, as they carry the bags into the Lodge.

ANAKIN and PADME stop at the balustrade. PADME looks out across the garden to the shimmering lake and the mountains rising beyond. ANAKIN looks at her silently.

				PADMÉ
			When I was in Level Three, we used
			to come here for school retreat.
			See that island? We used to swim
			there every day. I love the water.

				ANAKIN
			I do too. I guess it comes from
			growing up on a desert planet.

PADME becomes aware that ANAKIN is looking at her.

				PADMÉ
			...We used to lie on the sand and
			let the sun dry us... and try to
			guess the names of the birds
			singing.

				ANAKIN
			I dont like sand. Its coarse
			and rough and irritating, and it
			gets everywhere. Not like here.
			Here everythings soft... and
			smooth...

He touches her arm. PADME has become receptive to the way he looks at her but is nervous.

				PADMÉ
			There was a very old man who lived
			on the island. He used to make
			glass out of sand - and vases and
			necklaces out of the glass. They
			were magical.

				ANAKIN
				(looks into her eyes)
			Everything here is magical.

				PADMÉ
			You could look into the glass and
			see the water. The way it ripples
			and moves. It looked so real...
			but it wasnt.

				ANAKIN
			Sometimes, when you believe
			something to be real, it becomes
			real. Real enough, anyway...

They look into each other's eyes. He touches her chin.

				PADMÉ
			I used to think if you looked too
			deeply into glass, you would
			lose yourself.

				ANAKIN
			I think it's true...

ANAKIN kisses PADME. She doesn't resist. She comes to her senses and pulls away.

				PADMÉ
			I shouldn't have done that.

				ANAKIN
			I'm sorry. When I'm around you,
			my mind is no longer my own.

				PADMÉ
			It's the situation... the stress...

He looks at her.

				ANAKIN
			...the view.

EXT. CORUSCANT, LANDING PLATFORM - LATE AFTERNOON
Obi-Wan's Starfighter is ready for takeoff. OBI-WAN and MACE WINDU stand beside it.

				MACE WINDU
			Be wary, this disturbance in the
			Force is growing stronger.

				OBI-WAN
			I am concerned for my Padawan. He
			is not ready to be on his own.

				YODA
			The Council is confident in this decision,
			Obi-Wan.

				MACE
			He has exceptional skills. The
			Council is confident in its
			decision, Obi-Wan. If the
			prophecy is true, he weill be the
			one to bring balance to the Force.

				OBI-WAN
			But he still has much to learn.
			And his abilities have made him...
			well... arrogant. I realise now
			what you and Master Yoda knew from
			the beginning... the boy was too
			old to start the training and...

OBI-WAN hesitates.

				MACE WINDU
			There's something else?

				OBI-WAN
			Master, he should not have been
			given this assignment. I'm afraid
			Anakin won't be able to protect
			the Senator. 

				MACE WINDU
			Why?

				OBI-WAN
			He has a... an emotional
			connection with her. It's been
			there since he was boy. Now
			he's confused... distracted.

				MACE-WINDU
			Obi-Wan, you must have faith that
			he will take the right path.

OBI-WAN climbs into the cockpit of the Starfighter.

				OBI-WAN
			Has Master Yoda gained any insight
			into whether or not this war will
			come about?

				MACE WINDU
			Probing the Dark Side is a
			dangerous process. He could be in
			seclusion for days... May the
			force be with you.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, YODA'S QUARTERS - LATE AFTERNOON
YODA sits with his eyes closed, meditating. Silence.

EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LOUNGE, LATE AFTERNOON
The setting sun touches the mountain peaks. The lake glows in the rose-tinted light. Floatinf lamps glean softly like jewels at the lodge.

INT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, DINING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
NANDI place dessert in front of PADME. TECKLA does the same for ANAKIN. The dessert is some kind of fruit. PADME picks up her fork and goes to spear a piece, but it moves! She frowns and tries again -the fruit moves. She lokk up at ANAKIN. His eyes are on his plate.

				PADME
			You did that?

ANAKIN looks up - wide-eyed innocence.

				ANAKIN
			What?

PADME scowls at him. PADME jabs at the fruit - ANAKIN subtly moves his hand and it lifts up from the plate and hovers in front of her.

				PADME
			That! Now stop it!

PADME laughs. ANAKIN laughs. She reaches out for the fruit - it loops.

				PADME
				(continuing)
			Anakin!!

ANAKIN moves his fingers. The fruit flies into his hand.

				ANAKIN
			I'm not really supposed to do
			that... for fun, I mean. If
			Master Obi-Wan were here, he'd be
			very grumpy.

ANAKIN is pleased. He cuts the fruint into several pieces and sends one back to PADME. She bites it out of the air and laughs.

INT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, FIREPLACE ALCOVE - TWILIGHT
A fire blazes in the open hearth. PADME is sitting in front of it, gazing at the flames.

She looks up as ANAKIN arrives. She makes room for him. Brief pause.

				ANAKIN
			May I tell you something?

				PADME
			I don't know.

				ANAKIN
			Then how can I tell you?

				PADME
			Maybe you should use your Jedi
			intuition.

				ANAKIN
			It doesn't work around you. My
			mind is always a muddle... I can
			only think of you.

				PADME
			Anakin, don't...

				ANAKIN
			From the moment I met you, all
			those years ago, a day hasn't gone
			by when I haven't thought of you.
			And now that I'm close to you again,
			I'm in agony. The closer I get to
			you, the worse it gets. The
			thought of not being with you
			mskes my stomach turn over - my
			mouth goes dry. I feel dizzy. I
			can't breathe. I'm haunted by the
			kiss you should never have given
			me. My heart is beating, hoping
			that kiss will not become a scar.
			You are in my very soul,
			tormenting me. What can I do? I
			will do anything you ask...

Silence. The logs flame in the hearth.

				ANAKIN
				(continuing)
			If you are suffering as much as I
			am, tell me.

				PADME
			...I can't. We can't. It's just
			not possible.

				ANAKIN
			Anything's possible. Padme,
			please listen...

				PADME
			You listen. We live in a real
			world. Come back to it. You're
			studying to become a Jedi Knight.
			I'm a Senator. If you follow your
			thoughts through to conclusion,
			they will take us to a place we
			cannot go... regardless of the way
			we feel about each other.

				ANAKIN
			Then you do feel something!
			There's an extraordinary
			connection between us. You can't
			deny that.

				PADME
			Annie, it doesn't make any
			difference. Jedi aren't allowed
			to marry. You swore an oath,
			remember? You'd be expelled from
			the Order. I will not let you
			give up your responsibilities...
			your future, for me.

				ANAKIN
			I was destined to be a Jedi. I
			don't think I could be anything
			else. But you are asking me to be
			rational. That is something I
			know I cannot do. I wish I could
			wish my feelings away... but I
			can't.

				PADME
			I am not going to give into this.
			I'm not going to throw my life
			away. I have more important things
			to do than fall in love.

There is silence as they stare at the fire. ANAKIN is thinking.

				ANAKIN
			It wouldn't have to be that way...
			we could keep it a secret.

				PADME
			Then we'd be living a lie - one we
			couldn't keep even if we wanted
			to. Mt sister saw it. So did my
			mother. I couldn't do that.
			Could you, Anakin? Could you live
			like that?

Silence for a moment.

				ANAKIN
			...No, you're right. It would
			destroy us.

EXT. SPACE
It's just like the star map hologram, plus the storm-shrouded planet of Kamino, which is exactly where it ought to be. Obi-Wan's Starship flies OVER CAMERA and heads down toward the planet.

EXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) - DAY
Heavy rans and hard-driving winds lash the platform as Obi-Wan's Starship approaches. The huge, ultra-modern city of Tipoca rests on great stilts that keep it above the pounding and ever-present waves that cover the surface of this watery world.

The Starfighter lands. OBI-WAN gets out and makes his way through the bowling wind toward a tower on the far side of the platform. A door slides open. A shaft of brilliant light pierces the swirling rain. OBI-WAN passes through it and goes inside.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR ENTRANCE
A Brilliant white light. OBI-WAN pushes the soaking hood from his face.

				TAUN WE
			Welcome to Tipoca City, Master
			Jedi.

OBI-WAN wipes the rain from his face and blinks in surprise at a tall, pasty-white alien named TAUN WE. He has large, almond shaped eyes.

				TAUN WE
			Everything is ready. The Prime
			Minister expects you.

				OBI-WAN
				(warily)
			I'm expected?

				TAUN WE
			Of course! He is anxious to see
			you. After all these years, we
			were beginning to think you
			weren't coming. Now please, this
			way!

OBI-WAN masks his surprise as they move away along the corridor.

Obi-Wan follows Taun We cautiously.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, PRIME MINISTER OFFICE - DAY
The door slides open. OBI-WAN and TAUN WE enter and cross to where LAMA SU rises, smiling, from behind his desk, which, like all the furniture on Kamino, seems made out of pure light.

				TAUN WE
			May I present Lama Su, Prime
			Minister of Kamino... and this is
			Master Jedi...

				OBI-WAN
			Obi-Wan Kenobi.

				LAMA SU
			Please...

LAMA SU indicates a chair. OBI-WAN sits. TAUN WE hovers. The room is bathed in brilliant white light. The whole place is ultra high-tech.

				LAMA SU
			I trust you are going to enjoy
			your stay. We are most happy you
			have arrived at the best part of
			the season.

				OBI-WAN
			You make me feel most welcome.

				LAMA SU
			And now to business. You will be
			delighted to hear we are on
			schedule. Two hundred thousand
			units are ready, with another
			million well on the way.

				OBI-WAN
				(improvising)
			That is... good news.

				LAMA SU
			Please tell your Master Sido-Dyas
			that we have every confidence his
			order will be met on time and in
			full. He is well, I hope?

				OBI-WAN
			I'm sorry Master - ?

				LAMA SU
			Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas. He's still
			a leading member of the Jedi
			Council, is he not?

				OBI-WAN
			Oh, yes. Sido-Dyas.

				LAMA SU
				(rising)
			You must be anxious to inspect the
			units for yourself.

				OBI-WAN
			That's why I'm here.

EXT. NABOO, MOUNTAIN MEADOW - LATER AFTERNOON
PADME and ANAKIN are in the middle of an idyllic hilly meadow, its lush grasses sprinkled with flowers. At a distance, a herd of SHAAKS graze contentedly.

Beyond is the shimmering expanse of the lake. Several other lakes stretch to the horizon. The warm air is full of little floating puffballs. They sit on the grass, in a playful, coy mood, talking. PADME is picking flowers.

				PADMÉ
			I don't know...

				ANAKIN
			Sure you do... you just don't want
			to tell me.

				PADMÉ
			Are you going to use one of your
			Jedi mind tricks on me?

				ANAKIN
			They only work on the weak-minded.
			You are anything but weak-minded.

				PADMÉ
			All right... his name was Palo.
			I was twelve. We were both in the
			Legislative Youth Program. He was
			a few years older then I... very
			cute... dark curly hair... dreamy
			eyes.

				ANAKIN
			All right, I get the picture...
			whatever happened to him?

				PADMÉ
			I went on to become a Queen. He
			went on to become an artist.

				ANAKIN
			Maybe he was the smart one.

				PADME
			You really don't like politicians,
			do you?

				ANAKIN
			I like two or three, but I'm not
			really sure about one of them.
				(smiling)
			I don't think the system works.

				PADME
			How would you have it work?

				ANAKIN
			We need a system where the
			politicians sit down and discuss
			the problems, agree what's in the
			best interests of all the people,
			and then do it.

				PADME
			That is exactly what we do. The
			trouble is that people don't
			wlways agree. In fact, they
			hardly ever do.

				ANAKIN
			Then they should be made to.

				PADME
			By whom? Who's going to make them?

				ANAKIN
			I don't know. Someone.

				PADME
			You?

				ANAKIN
			Of course not me.

				PADME
			But someone.

				ANAKIN
			Someone wise.

				PADME
			That sounds an awful lot like a
			dictatorship to me.

A mischievious little grin creeps across his face.

				ANAKIN
			Well, if it works...

PADME stares at ANAKIN. He looks back at her, straight-faced, and can't hold a smile.

				PADMÉ
			You're making fun of me.

				ANAKIN
			 	(sarcastic)
			On no, I'd be much too frightened
			to tease a Senator.

				PADMÉ
			You're so bad!

PADME picks up a piece of fruit and throws it at him. He catches it. PADME throws two more pieces of fruit, and ANAKIN catches them.

				ANAKIN
			You're always so serious. Always
			carrying the weight of the
			universe on your shoulders.

ANAKIN then starts to juggle the fruit. PADME laughs and throws more fruit at him. He manages to juggle them too until there are too many, and he loses control and ducks, letting food fall on his head. They both laugh.

ANAKIN stands in front of a SHAAK, yelling at it and waving his arms. PADME starts laughing as ANAKIN runs in circles, chased by the SHAAK.

The SHAAK crosses in front of PADME. ANAKIN is riding it, facing the SHAAK'S tail. The SHAAK bucks, and ANAKIN falls off. PADME laughs even harder. ANAKIN lies still. PADME jumps uip and runs to where ANAKIN is face down in the grass. She turns him over. He is pulling a stupid face at her. She yelps in mock fury and takes a swing at him. He catches her arm. She struggles. They roll over in the grass. Suddenly, they become aware of the contact between them. They let go of each other quickly and sit up, looking away.

ANAKIN stands up and holds out his hand to her. She take it. He pulls her up. And now they are easy together, not self-conscious any more. PADME scrambles up onto the SHAAK behind ANAKIN. She puts her arms around his waist and leans against his back. ABAJUB digs his heels in. The SHAAK starts forward, and they ride away.

EXT. TIPOCA CITY, PARADE GROUND (RAINSTORM) - DAY
OBI-WAN, LAMA SU and TAUN WE come out onto a balcony. Below is a huge parade ground. The rain and wind are brutal. THOUSANDS OF STORMTROOPERS, faces covered by helmets, are marching and drilling in formations of several hundred.

				LAMA SU
				(beaming)
			Magnificent, aren't they?

OBI-WAN nods slowly.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, COMMINSSARY - DAY
LAMA SU conducts OBI-WAN through a large eating area. TAUN WE follows as they walk by HUNDREDS OF CLONES who look exactly alike, all about twenty years old, dressed in black. They are seated at tables, eating.

				LAMA SU
			We modified their genetic
			structure to make them less
			independent than the original
			host. As a result they are
			totally obedient, taking any order
			without question.

				OBI-WAM
			Who was the original host?

				LAMA SU
			A bounty hunter called Jango Fett.
			We felt a Jedi would be the
			perfect choice, but Sido-Dyas hand-
			picked Jango Fett himself.

				OBI-WAN
			Where is this bounty hunter now?

				LAMA SU
			Oh, we keep him here. After a few
			hundred thousand clones, the
			genetic pattern starts to fade, so
			we take a fresh supply. He lives
			here, but he's free to come and go
			as he pleases.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, BARRACKS - DAY
The tour continues through a long corridor folled with narrow, transparent tubes into which CLONES are climbing. Once in the tube, the CLONE goes to sleep.

				LAMA SU
			Apart from his pay, which is
			considerable, Fett demanded only
			one thing - an unaltered clone for
			himself. Curious isn't it?

				OBI-WAN
			Unaltered?

				LAMA SU
			Pure genetic replication. No
			tampering with the structure to
			make it more docile... and no
			growth acceleration...

				OBI-WAN
			I would like to meet this Jango
			Fett.

				TAUN WE
			I would be most happy to arrange
			it, for you.

TAUN WE bows, and leaves.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, CLASSROOM - DAY
The tour continues through a classroom filled with IDENTICAL YOUNG BOY CLONES.

				OBI-WAN
			You mentioned growth
			acceleration...

				LAMA SU
			Oh yes, it's essential.
			Otherwise, a mature clone would
			take a lifetime to grow. Now, we
			can do it in half the time. Those
			items you saw on the parade ground
			were started ten years ago, when
			Sido-dyas first placed the order,
			and they're already mature...

OBI-WAN looks at the BOY CLONES.

				OBI-WAN
			And these?

				LAMA SU
			About five years ago.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, HATCHERY - DAY
They enter a space filled with great racks of glass spheres, which are filled with fluid in which EMBRYOS are suspended.

				LAMA SU
			They're immensely superior to
			droids, capable of independent
			thought and action.

				OBI-WAN
			Very impressive.

				LAMA SU
			I'd hoped you would be pleased. 

OBI-WAN gazes at the nearest embryos.

				OBI-WAN
				(carefully)
			Tell me, prime minister, when my
			Master Sido-dyas first contacted
			you, did he say the order was
			for... himself... or?

				LAMA SU
			Himself? Of course not. This
			army is for the Republic?

				OBI-WAN
				(astonished)
			The Repubic?

				LAMA SU
			We are also very much agasint this
			Count Dooku and his seccessionist
			movement. We are proud to be of
			help to the Republic.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, APARTMENT - LATE DAY
TAUN WE shows OBI-WAN into his room.

				TAUN WE
			I have arranged for you to meet
			Jango Fett in the morning. Sleep
			well.

TAUN WE goes. The door slides closed behind him. OBI-WAN looks around, then moves swiftly to check the room over. Finally, satisfied, he takes out his comlink.

				OBI-WAN
			Arfour, Arfour...

EXT. TIPOCA CITY LANDING PLATFORM, JEDI FIGHTER, (RAINSTORM) - LATE DAY
The R4 D17, Obi-Wan's Astro-Droid, who is sitting on top of Obi-Wan's Starfighter, switches on and BEEPS.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, APARTMENT - LATE DAY
OBI-WAN hears ARFOUR BEEP through his comlink.

				OBI-WAN
			Arfour, relay this, "scramble code
			five," to Courscant: care of "the
			old folks home."

EXT. TIPOCA CITY LANDING PLATFORM, JEDI FIGHTER, (RAINSTORM) - LATE DAY
ARFOUR BEEPS and WHISTLES. The panels light up inside the cockpit, as the message is transmitted.

EXT. JEDI TEMPLE, LIVINF QUARTERS - EARLY EVENING
YODA and MACE WINDU listen as a hologram of OBI-WAN stands between them broadcasting the massage. The singnal is very weak, the image fades in and out.

				OBI-WAN (V.O.)
			...I've never heard of a Jedi
			called Sido-Dyas, have you, Master?

				MACE WINDU
			No. Whoever placed that order was
			not a Jedi, I can assure you.

				OBI-WAN (V.O.)
			I have a strong feeling that this
			bounty hunter is the assassin
			we're looking for.

				YODA
			Who he is working for... discover
			that, you must.

				OBI-WAN (V.O.)
			I will, Master, and I will also
			find out more about this clone
			army... May The Force...

The hologram switches off, and OBI-WAN fades away.

				WINDU 
			A clone army! Ordered by someone
			in the Senate perhaps... Someone's
			out to start a war.

				YODA
			Inform the chancellor of this, we
			must.

				WINDU
			Who do you think this impostor
			Sido-Dyas, could be?

YODA stares back at MACE WINDU, then slowly shakes his head.

EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT - NIGHT
The silent lodge. The triple moons of Naboo reflected in the tranquil waters of the lake.

INT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, ANAKIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
ANAKIN moves restlessly in his sleep. He mutters to himself. Sweat 
forms on his forehead. He turns violently. He cries out.

				ANAKIN
			No...No...No...Mom!...Don't,
			no, don't!

EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, BALCONY OVERLOOKING GARDENS - MORNING
ANAKIN is on the balcony overlooking the gardens. After a moment, PAMDE comes onto the balcony behind him. She sees he is meditating and turns to go.

				ANAKIN
				(eyes closed)
			Don't go.

				PAMDE
			I don't want to disturb you.

				ANAKIN
			Your presence is soothing.

Brief pause.

				PADME
			You had a nightmare again last
			night.

				ANAKIN
			Jedi don't have nightmares.

				PADME
			I heard you.

ANAKIN'S opens his eyes and looks at her.

				ANAKIN
			I saw my mother. I saw her as
			clearly as I see you now. She's
			suffering, Padme. She is in
			pain...They're killing her!
				(getting up)
			I know I'm disobeying my mandate
			to protect you, Senator. I know I
			will be punished and possibly
			thrown out of the Jedi Order, but
			I must go. I have to help her!
			I'm sorry, Padme. I don't have a
			choice.

				PADME
			Annie, I told you I wouldn't let
			you give up your future for me.
			I'll go with you. That way you
			can continue to protect me, and
			you won't be disobeying your
			mandate.

				ANAKIN
			What about Master Obi-wan?

PADME smiles and takes his hand.

				PADME
			I guess we won't tell him, will we?

EXT. NABOO LAKE, FLOATING LANDING PLATFORM - DAY
ANAKIN and PADME step onto the landing platform from the water speeder. They enter the Naboo Starship. ARTOO BEEPS, and follows them on board. The ramp retracts.

PADDY ACCU drives the water speeder away from the platform as Anakin's Starship takes off.

EXT. TIPOCA CITY (RAINSTORM) - DAY
Rain lashes the city. Below, mightly waves pound the stilts, breaking almost to the height of the platforms.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR - DAY
TAUN WE conducts OBI-WAN to the door of Jango Fett's apartment. TAUN WE waves his hand, and a muted bell RINGS.

As they wait, OBI-WAN notes the door lock entry mechanism. Then the door opens, and a ten-year-old boy, BOBA FETT, looks at them. He is identical to the boys in the classroom.

				TAUN WE
			Boba, is your father here?

There is a brief pause, then BOBA FETT nods.

				TAUN WE
				(continuing)
			May we see him?

				BOBA FETT
			Sure.

Another brief pause, then BOBA FETT steps aside, and TAUN WE and OBI-WAN go through.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, FETT APARTMENT - DAY
OBI-WAN, TAUN WE, and BOBA FETT enter the apartment. OBI-WAN looks around the room.

				BOBA FETT
			Dad! Taun We's here!

JANGO FETT comes in from the bedroom. He wears a jumpsuit. He is unshaven and mean looking, his face pitted with scars of old wounds. There are a couple of weird tattoos on his muscular forearms. He eyes OBI-WAN with suspicion.

				TAUN WE
			Welcome back, Jango. Was your
			trip productive?

				JANGO FETT
			Fairly.

OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT size each other up. BOBA FETT studies both of them.

				TAUN WE
			This is Jedi Master, Obi-Wan
			Kenobi. He's come to check on our
			progress.

				JANGO FETT
			That right?

JANGO FETT'S eyes fix OBI-WAN coldly.

				OBI-WAN
			Your clones are very impressive.
			You must be very proud.

				JANGO FETT
			I'm just a simple man, trying to
			make my way in the universe,
			Master Jedi.

				OBI-WAN
			Aren't we all?

OBI-WAN eyes the half-open bedroom door, through which a couple of pieces of body armour can be seen on the floor. JANGO FETT registers OBI-WAN'S look. He moves in front of him, blocking the view.

				OBI-WAN
				(continuing)
			Ever made your way as far into the
			interior as Coruscant?

				JANGO
			Once or twice.

				OBI-WAN
			Recently?

				JANGO
				(eyes Obi-Wan carefully)
			Possibly...

				OBI-WAN
			Then you must know Master Sido-
			Dyas?

				JANGO
			Boba, close the door.

BOBA FETT moves to close the bedroom door. JANGO FETT smiles thinly at OBI-WAN.

				JANGO
				(continuing)
			Master who?

				OBI-WAN
			Sido-Dyas. Isnt he the Jedi who
			hired you for this job?

				JANGO
			Never heard of him. I was
			recuited by a man called Darth
			Tyranus on one of the moons of
			Bogden.

				OBI-WAN
			No? I thought...

				TAUN WE
			Sido-Dyas told us to expect him.
			And he showed up just when your
			Jedi Master said he would. We
			have kept the Jedis involvement
			a secret until your arrival, just
			as your Master requested.

				OBI-WAN
			Curious...

				JANGO
			Do you like your army?

				OBI-WAN
			It seems to me it's your army -
			being that they are all clones of
			you.

				JANGO
				(grinning)
			They'll do their job well, I'll
			guarantee that.

				OBI-WAN
			I look forward to seeing them in
			action. Thank you for your time,
			Jango.

				JANGO
			Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi.

OBI-WAN and TAUN WE go out. The door slides closed. JANGO FETT turns to his son. He is deep in thought.

				BOBA
			What is it, Dad?

EXT. SPACE
The Naboo Starship heads toward the desert planet of Tatooine.

EXT. TATOOINE, MOS ESPA STREETS AND WATTO'S SHIP - DAY
The Naboo Starship lands in a large parking lot of Spaceships on the outskirts of Mos Espa. ANAKIN and PADME ride a rickshaw through the streets. ANAKIN stares at sights he hasn't seen for years. Finally, they come  to Wattos' shop, and the rickshaw stops.

				ANAKIN
				(to the droid driver)
			Wait, please.

ANAKIN and PADME get down. Sitting on a stool in front of the shop is WATTO. He is using a small electronic screwdriver on a fiddly DROID. THREE PIT DROIDS are chattering away and are trying to help him, but they seem only to make him madder.

				WATTO
				(yelling, in Huttese)
			No, not that one - that one!

				ANAKIN
				(arriving)
			Excuse me, Watto.

				WATTO
				(in Huttese)
			What?

				ANAKIN
				(in Huttese)
			I said excuse me.

WATTO turns to the chattering PIT DROIDS.

				WATTO
				(in Huttese)
			Shut down.

The PIT DROIDS snap into their storage position.

				WATTO
				(continuing, in Huttese)
			What? I don't know you... What can
			I do for you? You look like a
			Jedi. Whatever it is... I didn't
			do it.

WATTO drops the screwdriver and curses loudly in Huttese

				ANAKIN
			Let me help you with that.

ANAKIN takes the fiddly piece of equipment and starts to play with it. WATTO blinks in surprise.

				ANAKIN
				(continuing)
			I'm looking for Shmi Skywalker.

WATTO looks at him suspiciously. He stares at PADME, then back to ANAKIN.

				WATTO
			Annie?? Little Annie?? Naaaah!!

Suddenly, the fiddly piece of equipment in Anakin's hands WHIRS into life. WATTO blinks at it.

				WATTO
				(continuing; in English)
			You are Annie! It is you! You
			little womp rat.

WATTO gives ANAKIN a big hug.

				WATTO
				(continuing)
			You sure sprouted Weehoo! A
			Jedi! Waddya know? Hey, maybe
			you couldda help wit some
			daedbeats who owe...

				ANAKIN
			My mother...

				WATTO
			Oh, yeah. Shmi... she's not mine
			no more. I sold her.

				ANAKIN
			Sold her...

				WATTO
			Years ago. Sorry, Anne, but you
			know, business is business.
			Sold her to a moisture farmer
			named Lars. Least I think it was
			Lars. Believe it or not, I heard
			he freed her and married her. Can
			ya beat that?

				ANAKIN
			Do you know where they are?

				WATTO
			Long way from here... someplace
			over on the other side of Mos
			Eisley, I think...

				ANAKIN
			I'd like to know.

ANAKIN'S grim look means business; WATTO gets the hint quickly.

				WATTO
			Yeah... sure... absolutely. Let's
			go look in my records.

ANAKIN and WATTO go into the shop.

EXT. TIPOCA CITY (RAINSTORM) - DAY
The waves crash against the water city as the storm continues. Light suddenlyt streams from the base of a landing platform as a door slides open.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR - DAY
OBI-WAN stands with LAMA SU and TAUN WE just inside the open door.

				LAMA SU
			Tell your Council the first
			battalions are ready. And remind
			them that if they need more
			troops, we will need time to grow
			them.

				OBI-WAN
			I won't forget.

EXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) - DAY
OBI-WAN comes out from the tower into the driving ran. The door closes behind him. He pulls his robe around him and stands braced against the gale.

Below, a huge wave crashes against the stilts. Spray flies high and whips across the platform where OBI-WAN is standing. He walks over to his Starfighter, looks to see if anyone is watching, then turns and goes back to the door. It slides open.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR - DAY
OBI-WAN enters cautiously from outside. Ahead, the corridor is deserted. He moves down it.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, FETT APARTMENT - DAY
OBI-WAN walks in to find the room in complete disorder. The bedroom door is wide open - clear signs of hurried departure. All of the Fetts' personal belongings are gone.

OBI-WAN goes to an ultra-thin computer screen. He punches up AN ONSCREEN PICTURE of JANGO FETT and BOBA FETT unhitching the lines securing their ship to the landing platform. JANGO FETT is wearing his armour and rocket pack. BOBA FETT climbs aboard the small Fighter.

EXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) - DAY
JANGO FETT picks up a case and swings it up to BOBA FETT, who stows it inside the ship. JANGO FETT picks up another case and is about to swing it, when:

				BOBA FETT
			Dad!!

JANGO FETT turns to see OBI-WAN charging out of the tower toward him. As he runs, OBI-WAN draws his lightsaber from his belt. It flashes on.

JANGO FETT draws his gun and fires at the charging JEDI. OBI-WAN deflects the blast and swings at JANGO FETT.

The bounty hunter rockets up and over OBI-WAN, landing behind him. He fires a thin wire from his wrist pack, trying to entangle the Jedi.

JANGO FETT fire several Kamino Kyber Darts from his elbow launcher. OBI-WAN deflects them back at JANGO FETT, but they strike harmlessly against the bounty hunter's armour.

IN THE COCKPIT of Jango Fett's ship, BOBA FETT grabs the controls of a laser gun and swings it to aim at OBI-WAN.

OUTSIDE, in the driving rain, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT circle each other, sizing each other up - feinting.

IN THE COCKPIT, each time BOBA FETT is ready to fire, JANGO FETT blocks his view of OBI-WAN.

OUTSIDE, OBI-WAN makes a sudden attack, swinging at JANGO FETT, who deflects the blows. One slices off a piece of the bounty hunter's shoulder plate. JANGO FETT rockets into the air and hovers above OBI-WAN. The Jedi spins as:

IN THE COCKPIT, BOBA FETT fires.

OUTSIDE, the laser shell streaks past OBI-WAN to strike the edge of the tower. JANGO FETT fires down at OBI-WAN. The Jedi deflects the shots back, but JANGO FETT evades them. Then he swoops down, swinging around OBI-WAN. As he shoots past, he kicks the lightsaber out of the Jedi's hand.

The lightsaber skids across the wet surface of the landing platform. OBI-WAN dives after it. JANGO FETT zooms in front of him and grabs the lightsaber. OBI-WAN punches it out of his hand.

IN THE COCKPIT, BOBA FETT watches as:

OUTSIDE, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT grapple and fight, punching, kicking, grabbing hold, and throwing each other around. OBI-WAN grabs JANGO FETT tightly, and JANGO FETT rockets up into the air and kicks OBI-WAN loose. OBI-WAN crashes to the deck and slides toward the edge. He grapples desperately for a handhold on the slick surface.

JANGO FETT rockets down to kick at him. OBI-WAN hauls himself up. JANGO FETT zooms to the far side of the platform.

OBI-WAN uses Jedi powers to pull part of the structure loose. It hits JANGO FETT, who loses his balance, teetering on the edge. OBI-WAN charges acress, dives, and grabs hold of JANGO FETT just as he falls over the edge.

Locked together, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT plummet down toward the raging ocean. At the last moment, JANGO FETT fires a cable out of his backpack that shoots upward and locks onto a metal strut on the underside of the platform. OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT swing and CRASH onto one of the stilts.

OBI-WAN is knocked clear and drops onto a SMALL SERVICE PLATFORM just above the waves. He hauls himself to his feet. JANGO FETT hovers in mid-air opposite him, as a HUGE WAVE crashes over OBI-WAN. When it subsides, the Jedi has disappeared.

JANGO FETT rockets up to the landing platform, where he drops down beside his ship. He clambers inside the cockpit and settles into the pilot's seat. He punches buttons. The engines ROAR.

OUTSIDE, Jango Fett's ship lifts off from the platform and heads up into the lowering sky. It disappears. Lightning flashes. Rain lashes the tower and streams across the surface of the platform, to where:

A HAND suddenlt clutches at the very edge of the platform. A moment later, ANOTHER HAND grabs hold.

EXT. TATOOINE, BLUFF OVERLOOKING HOMESTEAD - LATE DAY
The Naboo Starship descends, hovers, and land on a bluff. ANAKIN and PADME get out. They look down from the edge of the bluff to where the homestead is seen on the desert floor below.

				PADME
			Stay with the ship, Artoo.

ARTOO WHISTLES as ANAKIN and PADME start down the trail toward the homestead.

EXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, HOMESTEAD MOISTURE FARM - LATE DAY
C-3PO is working outside the homestead. He still lacks an outer covering; his inner parts and wiring show. He looks up as ANAKIN and PADME arrive,

				C-3PO
			Good evening. May I help you?

				ANAKIN
			Threepio?

				C-3PO
			Oh, my... oh, my! Master
			Anakin! My goodness, I can hardly
			believe it! And this must be Miss
			Padme.

				PADME
			Hello, Threepio.

				ANAKIN
			I've come to see my mother.

				C-3PO
			Oh, dear! I'm so terribly sorry,
			Master Annie.

				PADME
			Threepio, what's happened?

				C-3PO
			I think we'd better go inside.

EXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, COURTYARD - LATE DAY
ANAKIN, PADME and THREEPIO arrive in the courtyard. THREEPIO shuffles ahead.

				C-3PO
			Master Lars - Master Owen!
			Somebody to see you!

OWEN LARS and BERU WHITESUN come out into the courtyard.

				ANAKIN
			I'm Anakin Skywalker. I'm here
			looking for my mother.

				OWEN
			Owen Lars... I guess I'm your
			step-brother.
				(they shake hands)
			This is my girlfriend, Beru.

				BERU
			Hello.

				PADME
			I'm Padme.

				OWEN
			I had a feeling you might show up
			some day.

				ANAKIN
			Is my mother here?

				CLIEGG
			No, she's not.

CLIEGG LARS swings from the house on a small floating chair. One of his legs is heavily bandaged; the other is missing. He balances awkwardly and puts out a hand.

				CLIEGG
				(continuing)
			Cliegg Lars. Shmi is my wife...
			Come on inside. We have a lot to
			talk about.

INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, KITCHEN - LATE DAY
BERU puts several steaming cups of ardees on a tray and exits the kitchen...

				CLIEGG (O.S.)
			It was just before dawn. They
			came out of nowhere. A hunting
			party of Tusekn Raiders.

INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, DINING AREA - LATE DAY
CLIEGG, OWEN, PADME and ANAKIN sit around the table, BERU brings the drinks from the kitchen.

				CLIEGG
			Your mother had gone out early,
			like she always did, to pick
			mushrooms that grow on the
			vaporatos. From the tracks, she
			was about halfway when they
			took her. Those Tuskens walk like
			men, but they're vicious, mindless
			monsters. Thirty of us went out
			after her. Four of us came back.
			Three more are still out there
			looking. I'd be with them,
			only... I just couldn't ride any
			more... until I heal.

CLIEGG grimaces, easing his throbbing leg.

				CLIEGG
				(continuing)
			This isn't the way I wanted to
			meet you, son. This isn't how
			your mother and I planned it. I
			don't want to give up on her, but
			she's been gone a month. There's
			little hope she's lasted this long.

Silence. Then ANAKIN stands up.

				OWEN
			Where are you going?

				ANAKIN
			To find my mother.

				PADME
			No, Annie!

				CLIEGG
			She's daed, son. Accept it.

				ANAKIN
			I can feel her pain, and I will
			find her. I know she's alive.

ANAKIN turns abruptly.

EXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, MOISTURE FARM - LATE DAY
ANAKIN stands looking across the desert. PADME comes running out of the homestead after him, followed by OWEN. ANAKIN turns to PADME.

				ANAKIN
			You are going to have to stay
			here. These are good people,
			Padme. You'll be safe.

				OWEN
			Take my speeder bike.

				PADME
			Anakin...

PADME hugs him. ANAKIN walks over to Owen's speeder bike, which is standing close by.

				ANAKIN
			I trust you'll watch over her,
			Owen.

				OWEN
			Don't worry.

ANAKIN swings onto the bike. The engine fires.

				ANAKIN
			I won't be long.

ANAKIN takes off across the desert. PADME watches him go.

EXT. SPACE, GEONOSIS
The red planet of Geonosis is circled by a large asteroid field that form rings. Jango Fett's ship appears, heading toward it.

INT. COCKPIT, FETT SHIP, SPACE, GEONOSIS
JANGO FETT grins at BOBA FETT.

				JANGO FETT
			Nearly there, son.

JANGO FETT guides he ship around the asteroids. Suddenly:

				BOBA FETT
			Dad, look!!

On the view screen, Obi-Wan's ship appears, chasing after them. JANGO FETT grabs the controls. They are thrown around as the ship plummets to try to lose OBI-WAN.

				JANGO FETT
			Hang on!

The ship goes into a power-climb. A GREAT SPACE DDOGFIGHT ensues between OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT.

EXT. SPACE, GEONOSIS
The ships flip, roll, and turn at incredible speed, didging, weaving and firing. They tumble from near misses. Hits fly off Obi-Wan's fighter as one of Jango's missiles gets through.

Finally, it seems as if OBI-WAN is getting the upper hand. JANGO FETT breaks off the fight and dives sharply. He maneuvers deftly between two huge asteroids.

In JANGO FETT'S COCKPIT, BOBA FETT flinches as asteroids pass very close by.

				BOBA FETT
			Dad! Watch out!

				JANGO FETT
			Stay calm, son. We'll be fine.
			That Jedi won't be able to follow
			us through this.

But Obi-Wan ship dives into the asteroid belt after them.

IN OBI-WAN'S COCKPIT, his skill is pushed to the limit as he throws the ship from side to side, avoiding great rocks. Then a huge asteroid tumbles across his path. There seem no way he can avoid it. OBI-WAN fires a couple of aerial torpedoes. They streak toward the asteroid.

IN JANGO'S COCKPIT, they see the huge explosion as Obi-Wan's ship appears to smash into the asteroid.

				BOBA FETT
			Got him! Yeahhhhh!

				JANGO FETT
			We won't see him again.

BOBA FETT laughs. Jango Fett's ship emerges from the asteroid belt and heads down toward the planet of Geonosis.

EXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, JAWA CAMP - SUNSET
ANAKIN stands in the middle of a crowd of JAWAS. He asks them from directions. The JAWAS confer exicitedly, then the CHIEF JAWA points in a particular direction. ANAKIN gets on the bike and speeds off to where the JAWA pointed.

EXT. TATOOINE, DUNE SEA, CAMPFIRE - TWILIGHT
ANAKIN rides over a large dune toward a small flickering light in the distance.

He rides up and stops the bike in front of a campfire. There are bodies of THREE DEAD FARMERS lying beside the campfire. TWO EOPIES are thethered nearby, along with a burned and smoking speeder.

EXT. TATOOINE, LANDSCAPE (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
THREE DIFFERENT SHOTS. ANAKIN rids the speeder bike through three exotic landscapes. In one shot, he stops and looks down at some tracks. Then he starts up his speeder and rides off.

EXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, HOMESTEAD (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
The lights of the vaporators blink in the night sky. Somewhere close by, a night animal HOWLS.

EXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, COURTYARD (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
PADME is pacing the courtyard restlessly. She stops, listening to the animal HOWLING nearby. She shivers slightly, then turns and goes into the garage at the side of the courtyard.

INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD - GARAGE (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
PADME stands looking at a speeder parked in the garage. Short silence. Then:

				C-3PO
			Please don't leave us, Miss Padme.
			These people need your help.

THREEPIO is parked in a corner.

				PADME
			I'm not leaving, Threepio. I just
			can't sleep.

				C-3PO
			That's something I cannot relate
			to. As a Protocol Droid, I'm
			either active or inactive.
			There's no in-between.

				PADME
			I guess you're lucky.

				C-3PO
			Do you really think so..? I
			suppose I shouldn't expect...

				PADME
			You're not happy here?

				C-3PO
			Oh, I'm not unhappy... and my
			masters here ar so kind I
			wouldn't wish to trouuble them,
			it's just... being like this...
			well, it's embarrassing.

				PADME
			Being like what?

				C-3PO
			Naked. If you pardon the
			expression. You see, when Master
			Annie made me, he never quite
			found the time to give me any
			outer covering. It's so
			humiliating. How would you like it
			if you had to go around with all
			your circuits showing?

				PADME
			I guess I wouldn't like it at all.

				C-3PO
			Of course you wouldn't. Nobody
			would. It's simply not protocol.

PADME looks thoughtfully at a pile of spare parts and bits of metal and tools.

				PADME
			Maybe we can do something about it.

				C-3PO
			I don't think so. Only Master
			Annie...

				PADME
			Why not? They seem to have a box
			of old coverings here.

				C-3PO
			Oh? How observant of you, Miss
			Padme. Of course, I'm just not
			mechanically minded... if you see
			what I mean.

PADME picks up a piece of metal and holds it against him.

				PADME
			Let's see, if we put this...
			here...

				C-3PO
			Ooooh! That's tickles.

				PADME
			You'll have to be quiet, Threepio.
			Hold still, please.

EXT. SPACE, GEONOSIS RINGS
A huge chunk of rock tumbles slowly through the asteroid bely. CAMERA CLOSES, to discover Obi-Wan's Starship hidden in a blasted-out area on the pitted back side of the great rock.

INT. COCKPIT, JEDI FIGHTER, SPACE, GEONOSIS RINGS
OBI-WAN looks out toward Geonosis and sees in the distance a large fleet of Trade Federation Ships hidden among the asteroids. He starts the engines of his fighter.

Obi-Wan's Fighter moves out from the back side of the asteroid and heads away from the asteroid field, descending toward Geonosis.

EXT. GEONOSIS, LANDING AREA - NIGHT
Obi-Wan's ship skims across the top of a small mesa along the edge of a rocky ridge. He maneuvers under a rock overhang and lands. He gets out of the Fighter and walks onto the mesa. The wind whips at him. He looks around.

Geonosis is a red rock planet, featureless apart from buttes and mesas, and occasional tall stalagmites that stand out dramatically on the arid plains.

The night is quiet, except for an occasional WEIRD CRY. OBI-WAN checks his bearings, then heads away.

EXT. GEONOSIS, ROCK FACE TRAIL - NIGHT
OBI-WAN climbs a steep, narrow trail. Suddenly, a CRY is heard close by. OBI-WAN stumbles slightly. His foot slips on the edge, sending a stream of peblles skittering into the darkness.

OBI-WAN listens. Silence. He draws his lightsaber but does not ignite it.

He sets off again and works his way around a narrow corner, to confront a crouching MASSIFF (a dog-sized lizard) with slavering fangs! The beast leaps at him, and OBI-WAN ignites his lightsaber as the MASSIFF knocks him on his back. Its jaws open wide. OBI-WAN stabs the creature, throws it off of him, and jumps up.

A SECOND MASSIFF jumps from behind. OBI-WAN swings around and cuts it in half. The MASSIFF flies over the cliff, HOWLING. It plummets to its death hundreds of feet below.

EXT. TATOOINE, CLIFF (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
ANAKIN pulls up near the edge of a cliff. He gets off the bike and creeps to the edge. He looks over to see a Tusken camp in the oasis below. One of the huts at the edge of the camp has TWO TUSKEN GUARDS outside it.

EXT. TATOOINE, TUSKEN RAIDER CAMP, OASIS (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
ANAKIN creeps through the camp, working his way from hut to hut, flattening himself against the wall,s overhearing snatches of Tusken conversation from inside, using the shadows to him him until he arrives at the hut with the TWO GUARDS. They are sitting a short distance from the door. ANAKIN wriggles around the black. He takes out his lightsaber and cuts into the base of the wall.

INT. TUSKEN RAIDER HUTT - NIGHT
The lightsaber completes the hole in the wall. ANAKIN wriggles in. He pulls himself to his feet. There are candles everywhere.

A shaft of moonlight from a hole in the roof pierces the gloom of the hut. By its light, ANAKIN sees SHMI, hanging from a wooden frame in the middle of the hut.

He cuts her free, takes her into his arms, and lowers her gently to the ground. Her eyes are closed. Her face is bloodied. She has been 
terribly beaten. Anakin cradles her tenderly.

				ANAKIN
			Mom... Mom... Mom... 

SHMI'S eyelids flutter - and barely open. They are caked with blood.

				SHMI
			Annie...? Is it you?

SHMI'S eyes focus slowly. ANAKIN gives a little choking gasp.

				ANAKIN
			Im here, Mom. Youre safe. Hang
			on. Im going to get you out of
			here...

				SHMI
			Im so glad... to see you,
			Annie... Now... I am complete...

				ANAKIN
			Just stay with me, Mom. Im going
			to make you well again.
			Everythings going to be fine.

				SHMI
			You look so handsome. My son...
			my grown-up son. Im so proud of
			you, Annie... so proud... I missed
			you so much... I love...

SHMI dies. ANAKIN draws her to his breast. There is silence for a moment. ANAKIN lifts his head, listening for a moment, then he sits on the floor of the Tusken hut, cradling his dead mother in his arms.

EXT. GEONOSIS, ROCK FACE TRAIL - NIGHT
OBI-WAN arrives at the head of the trail. Far below, a flat plain stretches into the distance. He stop, peering into the darkness, where strange shapes loom indistinctly.

OBI-WAN takes a pair of electronic binoculars from his belt and puts them to his eyes. He sees a cluster of great towers like fantastic stalagmites rise from the plain below.

SLOW PAN with the binoculars, and suddenly a line of Battle Starships come into view. OBI-WAN touches the viewfinder. Between fifty and a hundred Federation Starships in near rows. Some are on platforms that are carrying the Starships diwn to an underground facility. Other platforms are rising to the surface. They carry THOUSANDS of BATTLE DROIDS that step off and file into the waiting ships. A fully loaded Starship takes off. OBI-WAN swings the binoculars upward, to see more Federation Starships.

EXT. TATOOINE, TUSKEN RAIDER CAMP, OASIS - DAWN
The pale light grows. Thin tendrils of smoke rise slowly in the cold, clear air. Somewhere an dog BARKS. An OLD WOMAN comes out of one of the huts. She carries a pail. She swirls it and tosses the dirty water onto the ground.

As she goes back inside the hut, a TUSKEN CHILD runs past, dragging a stick in the sand. The CHILD runs through the line of huts, turns a corner, and stops suddenly, staring at the bodies of the TWO TUSKEN GUARDS. Between them, ANAKIN stands outside the hut door. His face is a grim mask. The CHILD stares, then there is a FLASH OF LIGHT as Anakins lightsaber switches on.

EXT. GEONOSIS, LANDING AREA - NIGHT
OBI-WAN comes running back to his ship and climbs into the cockpit. He settles into his seat. His ARFOUR DROID beeps a happy greeting. OBI-WAN switches on his comlink.

				OBI-WAN
			"Guiding light" to "old folks
			home."

EXT. CORUSCANT, REPUBLIC EXECUTIVE BUILDING - DAY
LOW ANGLE. A line of reflecting pools with splashing fountains flanked by statues on each side leads to the main entrance to the awesome building.

INT. CORUSCANT, CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE
A hologram of OBI-WAN flickers in front of a group, made up of Jedi (YODA, MACE WINDU, and KI-ADI-MUNDI) and Senators (BAIL ORGANA, ASK AAK, LUMINARA, and JAR JAR). PALPATINE and MAS AMEDDA are in the middle of the group, watching with growing concern.

				OBI-WAN
			...Starships from the Trade
			Federation and the Commerce Guilds
			are taking deliveries of battle
			droids from the foundries on
			Geonosis.

				BAIL ORGANA
			That's outrageous! The treaty
			forbids the Trade Federation from
			building up an army. What are
			they doing?!

				OBI-WAN
			The droid foundry seems to be
			working at full capacity. I am
			going to go down and investigate.
			I will bring Jango Fett back home
			for interrogation.

				PALPATINE
			Those Geonosian foundries are part
			of the Techno Union. We will call
			in their representatives and ask
			them a few very pointed questions.

				OBI-WAN
			One more thing. Jango mentioned
			he was recruited by someone named
			Darth Tyranus. Any idea who that
			might be?

				YODA
			With the forename Darth, a Sith he
			must be.

				MACE WINDU
			Our missing apprentice. They are
			playing their hand at last.

				OBI-WAN
			Do you believe he could be the
			mysterious Sido-Dyas, who made the
			deal for the clone army?

				YODA
			Perhaps too many pieces are missing
			from this puzzle, there are.

				MACE WINDU
			Be careful, Obi-Wan. This
			investigation is becoming less
			than routine. Do you need help?

				OBI-WAN
			Let me see if I can figure out
			what's going on first.

The hologram of OBI-WAN fades off. PALPATINE stares at the spot where the hologram was in disbelief.

				BAIL ORGANA
			The Commerce Guilds are preparing
			for war... there can be no doubt
			of that.

				PALPATINE
			Count Dooku must have made a
			treaty with them.

				MACE WINDU
			We must stop them soon before
			they're fully ready.

				SENATOR ASK AAK
			The debate is over, we need
			that clone army now!

				BAIL ORGANA
			Unfortunately, the debate is not
			over. The Senate will never be
			able to approve the use of that
			army before the separatists
			attack.

Mas Amedda, who had been silent up until now suddenly speaks up.

				MAS AMEDDA
			This is a crisis! If the Senate
			votes the Chancellor emergency
			powers, he could approve the use
			of the army in a minute.

				PALPATINE
			Please, please, I don't wish to
			have emergency powers. That's too
			extreme a solution. It's akin to
			a dictatorship. We must rely on
			the Jedi. Master Yoda, how many
			are available to go to Geonosis?

MACE WINDU and YODA look at one another.

				YODA
			Two Hundred,... less or more.

				BAIL ORGANA
			With all due respect for the Jedi
			Order, two hundred will be no
			match for hundreds of thousands of
			battle droids.

				MACE WINDU
			Patience. We should wait for Obi-
			Wan to report back. We don't know
			that Count Dooku has made a treaty
			with the Corporate Alliance, it's
			speculation.

				SENATOR ASK AAK
			But we must prepare for the worst.
			I'm going to propose a motion
			granting emergency powers to the
			Chancellor at the next session. We
			must not wait!

				PALPATINE
			Out of the question, Senator! You
			and I are too closely aligned.
			The issue will become partisan and
			debates will begin. The proposal
			must come from a neutral source.

				MAS AMEDDA
			If only Senator Amidala were here.

JAR JAR steps forward from the back of the group.

				JAR JAR
			Supreme Chancellor... my august
			colleagues, I would be proud to
			propose the motion in question.
			This is a grave situation, and I'm
			sure Senator Amidala, and the
			Queen of Naboo would agree.

				SENATOR ASK AAK
			Thank you, Representative Binks.

Silence. Then PALPATINE sighs deeply.

				PALPATINE
			If called upon, I will serve. But
			it will be the saddest day of my
			life.

EXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, HOMESTEAD MOISTURE FARM - DAY
All is quiet. BERU comes out of the house. She goes to a moisture line and starts to draw water.

INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, GARAGE - DAY
PADME fixes the last piece of covering onto THREEPIO.

				PADME
			There!

PADME stands back. OWEN is with her. They look at THREEPIO. He isn't the golden figure we know because PADME has had to use whatever stuff she could findin the garage. He is multi-coloured in several textures, but he is complete.

				C-3PO
			Um. How do I look?

				OWEN
			Great! You look perfect.

				C-3PO
			Perfect? Oh, Miss Padme, I'm so
			happy!
				(extending his hand to shake hers)
			Oh, pardon me.

THREEPIO drops his hand and bows formally.

				THREEPIO
				(continuing)
			Thank you.

He forgets formality and hugs her. PADME hugs him back, laughing.

				C-3PO
				(continuing)
			Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

				OWEN
				(grinning)
			Well, Padme, I think he should be
			yours from now on... I know that
			is what my Mom would want.

				C-3PO
			Oh, my!

Then suddenly, from outside:

				BERU (V.O.)
			Come topside, everybody! He's
			back! He's back!

INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, GARAGE - DAY
A rough hologram of OBI-WAN is projected onto the garage by ARTOO. ANAKIN, PADME and THREEPIO watch the flickering image.

				OBI-WAN
			...Alliance have pledged their
			armies to Count Dooku and are
			forming an... Wait!... ah...
			attack... I don't... make it...
			aaaggghhh!

The hologram cuts off. ANAKIN jumps up, agitated.

				ANAKIN
			I'm going after him!

				PADME
			I thought the first thing he said
			was to retransmit his message to
			Coruscant.

				ANAKIN
			Yeah, you're right, you're right.

EXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, MOISTURE FARM - LATE DAY
ANAKIN, PADME, ARTOO and THREEPIO leave the homestead, waving to CLIEGG, OWEN and BERU as they go into the desert.

INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP - SUNSET
ANAKIN sits down in the cockpit with PADME. THREEPIO is behind them. ARTOO is beside him. They are watching a hologram of MACE WINDU.

				MACE WINDU
			We will deal with Count Dooku. The
			most important thing for you,
			Anakin, is to stay where you are.
			Protect the Senator at all costs.
			That is your priority.

				ANAKIN
			Understood, Master.

The hologram switches off. PADME is looking at the readout on the ship's control panel.

				PADME
			They'll never get there in time to
			save him. They have to come half
			way across the galaxy. Look,
			Geonosis is less than a parsec away.

PADME starts to hit buttons and flick switches. ANAKIN puts a hand over hers, stopping her. She stares at him.

				ANAKIN
			If he's still alive.

				PADME
			Annie, are you just going to sit
			here and let him die?? He's your
			friend... your mentor...

				ANAKIN
			...He's like my father, but you
			heard Master Windu. He gave me
			strict orders to stay here.

				PADME
			He gave you strict orders to
			protect me...

PADME pulls her hand free and flicks more switches. The engines fire.

				PADME
				(continuing)
			...and I'm going to save Obi-Wan.
			So if you plan to protect me, you
			will have to come along.

ANAKIN grins and takes the controls.

EXT. TATOOINE, BLUFF OVERLOOKING HOMESTEAD - SUNSET
The Naboo Starship rises from the bluff and zooms away.

EXT. CORUSCANT, JEDI TEMPLE - DAY
TWO HUNDRED JEDI KNIGHTS are assembling outside the huge center of the Jedi Order.

INT. CORUSCANT, JEDI TEMPLE, COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY
The JEDI COUNCIL are assembled as MACE WINDU makes his plea.

				MACE WINDU
			The longer we wait, the stronger
			Dooku's armies become. We cannot
			wait for the Senate to make up its
			mind about granting the Chancellor
			emergency powers, in order to be
			able to use that clone army... We
			have the authority to go now. We
			must go now.

All of the JEDI COUNCIL nod their approval.

				YODA
			Agreed, Master Windu. Two hundred
			Jedi send. Enough, let's hope
			they are.

INT. CORUSCANT, MAIN SENATE CHAMBER - DAY
Inside the great rotunda, the UPROAR is even louder. Opposing SENATOES yell furiously at one another.

				MAS AMEDDA
			Order! Order!!

Finally, the uproar dies.

				PALPATINE
			In the regrettable absence of
			Senator Amidala, the chair
			recognises Senior
			Representative of Naboo, Jar Jar
			Binks.

Amid the conflicting storm of CHEERS AND BOOS, JAR JAR, with TWO GUNGAN AIDES, floats on his pod to the middle of the vast space. He looks at PALPATINE nervously. PALPATINE nods. JAR JAR clears his throat.

				JAR JAR
			Senators, dellow felagates...

Laughter. Jeers. JAR JAR blushes.

				MAS AMEDDA
			Order! The Senate will accord the
			Representative the courtesy of a
			hearing!

Comparative quiet. JAR JAR grips the edge of the podium.

				JAR JAR
			In response to the direct threat
			to the Republic from the
			Confederacy of Independent
			Systems, I propose that the Senate
			gives immediate emergency powers to
			the Supreme Chancellor.

Uproar. JAR JAR looks a little sheepish.

				JAR JAR
				(continuing)
			Who can deny these are exceptional
			times? Exceptional times demand
			exceptional measures!
			Exceptional measures demand
			exceptional men!

				ORN FREE TAA
			We won't support a dictator.

SHOUTS of agreement.

				JAR JAR
			That is the sentiment every one of
			us agrees with! And when the
			shadow of war has dispersed and
			the bright day of liberty has
			dawned once again, the power we now
			give to the Supreme Chancellor
			will be gladly, and swiftly
			returned. Out ancient liberties
			will be restored to us, burnished
			even more brightly than before!

Brief silence, then a rolling wave of APPLAUSE. JAR JAR beams and bows.

PALPATINE rises.

				PALPATINE
			It is with great reluctance that
			I have agreed to this calling. I
			love democracy... I love the
			Republic. The fact that this
			crisis is demanding I be given
			absolute power to tule over you is
			evident. But I am mild by nature
			and have no desire to destroy
			the democratic process. The power you
			give me I will lay down when this
			crisis has abated, I promise you.
			And all I ask in return is when my
			current term of office is over,
			you allow me to reture and live
			out my life in peace.

				MAS AMEDDA
			We shall proceed to the vote. All
			those in favor of granting
			emergency powers to the Supreme
			Chancellor, signal ate at this
			time... those opposed?

EXT. SPACE
The Naboo Starship heads toward the rings of Geonosis.

EXT. GEONOSIS, LANDING AREA
The Naboo Starship lands.

INT. COCKPIT, NAOO STARFIGHTER - DAY
ANAKIN switches off the engines. ARTOO and THREEPIO are in the navigation area of the cockpit. PADME is in the co-pilot's seat. She gets up.

				ANAKIN
			Hey, where are you going?

				PADME
			To find Obi-Wan.

ANAKIN gets up and goes over to her.

				ANAKIN
			No! You're not!

He grabs her arm.

				PADME
			Let go of me!

				ANAKIN
			I'm not letting you go out there.
			It's too dangerous.

				PADMÉ
			What?!?

				ANAKIN
			It's my job to protect you. I said
			it's too dangerous. You're not
			going, and that's final!

				PADMÉ
			Don't you give me orders, Annie!
			I'm a Senator of the Galactic
			Republic. You have no authority
			to contain me, restrain me, or
			direct me! You remember your
			place, young man.
				(standing up)
			Now you can come along and protect
			me or stay here. It's up to you.

PADME storms out of the cockpit of the Naboo Starfighter. ANAKIN stands scratching his head, then follows.

ARTOO BEEPS and WHISTLES.

				C-3PO
			Yes, it is, Artoo. Most
			confusing. One moment they're
			generating a pleasant mutual
			attraction and the next, waves of
			violent hostility. Even though
			I'm programmed to understand them,
			I doubt if I ever shall.

ARTOO WHISTLES a plaintive sigh.

INT. GEONOSIS, CORRIDORS - DAY
ANAKIN and PADME enter the stalagmite city. They stop, looking around in wonder at the emptiness.

				PADME
				(in a low voice)
			It's empty!

They start forward. As they pass, the surface of the pillars seems to pulse slowly and move. High above WINGED CREATURES grow from the pillars and detach themselves.

INT. GEONOSIS, CENTRAL SQUARE - DAY
ANAKIN and PADME cross the square, reaching the middle. They stop suddenly as FOUR GEONOSIANS grabs them. ANAKIN reaches for his lightsaber.

				PADME
			Wait!

TWENTY WINGED GEONOSIANS carrying weapons alight on the flagstones in front of them.

The GEONOSIANS part, and COUNT DOOKU appears. He bows courteously.

				COUNT DOOKU
			Senator Amidala, I've heard so
			much about you.

				PADMÉ
			Count Dooku, I assume.

				COUNT DOOKU
			I'm delighted to meet you at
			last. We have a great deal to
			discuss, Senator. I hope you can
			keep your young Jedi under control.

				PADMÉ
			Don't worry he's housebroken.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM (GEONOSIS) - DAY
COUNT DOOKU sits at a large conference table with PADME on the far 
side. ANAKIN stands behind her with FOUR GEONOSIANS GUARDS standing behind him. JANGO FETT stands behind COUNT DOOKU, and SIX GEONOSIAN GUARDS stand behind him.

				PADMÉ
			You are holding a Jedi Knight, Obi-
			Wan Kenobi. I am formally
			requesting you turn him over to
			me, now.

				DOOKU
			He has been convicted of
			espionage, Senator, and will be
			executed. In just a few hours, I
			believe.

COUNT DOOKU smiles.

				PADMÉ
			He is an officer of the Republic.
			You can't do that.

				DOOKU
			We don't recognise the Republic
			here, Senator. But if Naboo were
			to join our Alliance, I could
			easily hear your plea for clemency.

ANAKIN grabs his lightsaber but doesn't turn it on.

				PADMÉ
			And if I don't join your
			rebellion, I assume this Jedi with
			me will also die?

				DOOKU
			I don't wish to make you to join
			our cause against your will,
			Senator, but you are a rational,
			honest representative of your
			people and I assume you want to do
			what's in their best interest.
			Aren't you fed up with the
			corruption, the bureaucrats, the
			hypocrisy of it all?.. Aren't
			you? Be honest, Senator.

				PADMÉ
			The ideals are still alive, Count,
			even if the institution is failing.

				DOOKU
			You believe in the same ideals we
			believe in! The same ideals we
			are striving to make prominent.

				PADMÉ
			If what you say is true, you
			should stay in the Republic and
			help Chancellor Palpatine put
			things right.

				DOOKU
			The Chancellor means well, M'Lady
			but he is incompetent. He has
			promised to cut the bureaucracy,
			but the bureaucrats are stronger
			than ever, no? Senator, the
			Republic cannot be fixed. It is
			time to start over. The
			democratic process in the Republic
			is a sham, a shell game played
			on the voters. It will not be long
			before the cult of greed, called
			the Republic, will lose even the
			pretext of democracy and freedom.

				PADMÉ
			I cannot believe that. I will not
			forsake all I have honoured and
			worked for and betray the
			Republic. I know of your treaties
			with the Trade Federation, the
			Commerce Guilds, and the others,
			Count. What is happening here is
			not government that has been
			bought out by business... it's
			business becoming government!

				DOOKU
			Are you willing to betray your Jedi
			friends? Without your co-operation
			I can do nothing to stop their
			execution.

				PADMÉ
			What is to happen to me? Am I to be
			executed also?

				DOOKU
			I wouldn't think of such an
			offence. But, there are
			individuals who have a strong
			interest in your demise, M'lady.
			It has nothing to do with
			politics, I'm afraid. It's purely
			personal, and they have already
			paid great sums to have you
			assassinated. I'm sure they will
			push hard to have you included in
			the executions. I'm sorry but if
			you are not going to co-operate, I
			must turn you over to the
			Geonosians for justice. I've done
			all I can for you.

JANGO FETT moves over to ANAKIN.

				JANGO FETT
			I'll take that weapon.

ANAKIN hesitates.

				DOOKU 
			You may cause a lot of bloodshed,
			my young Jedi, but you will not
			escape.

				PADMÉ
			Anakin...

ANAKIN hands his lightsaber over to JANGO FETT.

INT. GEONOSIS, HIGH AUDIENCE CHAMBER - DAY
ANAKIN and PADME are standing in the centre of what looks like a courtroom. Seated before them in a tall, boxed-off area is POGGLE THE LESSER, Archduke of Geonosis. He is accompanied by his underling, SUN RIT. Off to one side the Separatist Senators PO NUDU, TESSEK, and TOONBUCK TOORA. Next to them are the Commerce Dignitaries, SHU MAI, NUTE GUNRAY, PASSEL ARGENTE, WAT TAMBOR and SAN HILL of the Intergalactic Bank Clan. Along the wall about a HUNDRED GEONOSIANS wait for a verdict.

				SUN RIT
			You have been charged and found
			guilty of Espionage.

				POGGLE
			Do you have anything to say before
			your sentence is carried out?

				PADMÉ
			You are committing an act of war,
			Archduke. I hope you are prepared
			for the consequences.

POGGLE laughs. COUNT DOOKU simply smiles.

				POGGLE
			We build weapons, Senator... that
			is our business! Of course we're
			prepared!

				NUTE GUNRAY
			Get on with it. Carry out the
			sentence. I want to see her suffer.

				POGGLE
			Your other Jedi friend is waiting
			for you, Senator. Take them to
			the arena!

FOUR GUARDS take hold of PADME and ANAKIN. They are escorted out of the chamber to the sounds of chuckling.

INT. GEONOSIS TUNNEL TO EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
In the gloomy tunnel, ANAKIN and PADME are tossed into an open cart. The murmur of a vast crowd is heard offscreen. GUARDS extend their arms along the framework and tie them so that they stand facing each other.

The DRIVER gets up onto his seat.

				ANAKIN
			Don't be afraid.

				PADMÉ
			I'm not afraid to die. I've been
			dying a little bit each day since
			you came back into my life.

				ANAKIN
			What are you talking about?

				PADMÉ
			I love you.

				ANAKIN
			You love me?! I thought we
			decided not to fall in love. That
			we would be forced to live a lie.
			That it would destroy our lives...

				PADMÉ
			I think our lives are about to be
			destroyed anyway. My love for you
			is a puzzle, Annie, for which I
			have no answers. I can't control
			it... and now I don't care. I
			truly, deeply love you, and before
			we die I want you to know.

PADME leans toward ANAKIN. By straining hard, it is just possible for 
their lips to meet. They kiss.

				ANAKIN
			I have no desire to be cured of
			this love either. Long or short,
			I vow to spend the rest of my life
			with you.

They kiss again.

The DRIVER cracks his whip over the ORRAY harnessed between the shafts. The cart jerks forward. Suddenly, there isa HUGE ROAR and blinding sunlight as they emerge into the arena

INT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
The great stadium is packed with tier upon tier of yelling GEONOSIANS. The cart trundles to the center, where OBI-WAN is chained to one of four upright posts thatare three feet in diameter. The cart stops. PADME and ANAKIN are taken down, dragged to posts, and chained to them. PADME is in the center.

				OBI-WAN
			I was beginning to wonder if you
			had gotten my message.

				ANAKIN
			I retransmitted it as you
			requested, Master. Then we decided
			to come and rescue you.

				OBI-WAN
			It looks like you're going a good
			job so far.

Their arms are pulled high above their heads, and the cart drives away. There is another ROAR as POGGLE THE LESSER, COUNT DOOKU, NUTE GUNRAY, THE FETTS and DIGNITARIES arrive in the archducal box and take their places.

				SUN RIT
			The felons before you have been
			convicted of espionage against the
			Sovereign System of Geonosis.
			Their sentence of death is to be
			carried out in this public arena
			henceforth.

The crowd ROARS and CHEERS. In the box, POGGLE THE LESSER rises. The crowd becomes quiet.

				POGGLE
			Let the executions begin!

The crowd goes wild.

				ANAKIN
			I have a bad feeling about this.

From different gates around the arena, THREE MONSTERS are driven in. One is a REEK (bull-like), one is a NEXU (lion-like), and one is an ACKLAY (a kind of dino-lobster). They are driven in by PICADORS carrying long spears and riding ORRAYS. The PICADORS poke the MONSTERS toward the center, then retire to the perimeter.

The MONSTERS toss their heads, looking around, ROARING or SCREECHING. Then they catch sight of the THREE CAPTIVES and start moving toward them.

				OBI-WAN
			Take the one the left. I'll
			take the one on the right.

				ANAKIN
			What about Padme?

PADME has turned around and is pulling herself up by the chain to the top of the post. Within a moment, she is standing on top of it, trying to pull the chain free.

				OBI-WAN
			It looks like she's already on top
			of things.

The REEK charges ANAKIN. He jumps up, and the beast hits the post hard. ANAKIN lands onto its back, wrapping part of his chain around its horn. The REEK backs off, shaking its head angrily, which tears the chain from the post

OBI-WAN ducks around the post as the ACKLAY charges. It knocks the post flat, sending OBI-WAN sprawling. The ACKLAY crunches the post between its claws, freeing the chain. OBI-WAN leaps up and runs towards ONE of the PICADORS. The ACKLAY taks off after him.

The NEXU arrives at PADME'S post and rears on its hind legs. One top, PADME struggles to tear the chain free. The NEXU ROARS, displaying wicked, dripping fangs.

In the archducal box, NUTE GUNRAY beams and rubs his hands.

In the arena, OBI-WAN runs at the PICADOR. The ORRAY rears up. OBI-WAN grabs the PICADOR'S long spear and pole vaults over him. The chasing ACKLAY smashes into the ORRAY. It goes down. The PICADOR tumbles onto the sand, where he is grabbed by the ACKLAY and crunched.

ANAKIN's REEK starts to buck. It charges around the arena with ANAKIN hanging on for dear life. He whirls the free length of chain around his head and casts it into the REEK's mouth. Its jaws clamp hard on the chain. ANAKIN yanks hard on the chain, turning the REEK, beginning to ride it.

The NEXU's claws dig deep into the post. The cat-like creature reaches the top of the post and takes a swipe at PADME. She turns and the claw barely catches her shirt ripping it off, leaving superficial claw marks across her back. She hits the creature with her chain and it backs off down the pole. Then, PADME jumps off the post into the air. She swings around on the chain and whacks the beast hard on the head with both her feet. It tumbles back onto the sand.

In the archducal box:

				NUTE GUNRAY
			Foul!! She can't do that... shoot
			her or something!

In the arena, OBI-WAN runs out from behind the fallen ORRAY and throws the spear at the ACKLAY, hitting it in the neck. It lets out a terrible SCREECH and turns on him. The NEXU springs up and makes to leap up at PADME again. She finally manages to work the chain loose. ANAKIN comes charging up on the REEK.

				ANAKIN
			You okay?

				PADME
				(nods, gasping)
			Sure! Well, sort of.

				ANAKIN
			Jump!!!

The NEXU springs. PADME leaps from the top of the post to land on the REEK in front of ANAKIN. He hauls her upright. The REEK charges away, around the arena. The NEXU bounds after it. The REEK passes the wounded ACKLAY. The NEXU smells the blood and turns aside to attack the ACKLAY. The TWO MONSTERS fight. The crowd GROANS and BOOS.

In the archducal box, NUTE GUNRAY turns angrily to COUNT DOOKU.

				NUTE GUNRAY
			This isn't how it's supposed to
			be! Jango, finish her off.

COUNT DOOKU motions for the bounty hunter to ptay put. BOBA FETT is enjoying the spectacle.

				COUNT DOOKU
				(smiling enigmatically)
			Patiece, Viceroy... she will die.
			Maybe this is the way it's
			supposed to end.

OBI-WAN runs and jumps on the back of the REEK behind ANAKIN. Across the arena, the NEXU, having chewed up the ACKLAY, starts to advance toward them.

INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP - DAY
ARTOO BEEPS

				C-3PO
			Yes, it has been rather a long
			time. Do you suppose something's
			happened to them?

ARTOO BEEPS and WHISTLES.

				C-3PO
				(continuing)
			Danger? Oh no, I shouldn't think
			so. It looks a very dull planet
			to me. They should be back
			shortly. Just stop worrying, Artoo.

EXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
In the archducal box, amid the uproar, COUNT DOOKU feels a tap on his shoulder. He turns to see MACE WINDU standing behind him. COUNT DOOKU masks his surprise elegantly as he surveys the arena and sees JEDI KNIGHTS standing at every entrance and exit.

				COUNT DOOKU
			Master Windu, how pleasant of you
			to join us. You're just in time
			for the moment of truth. I would
			think these two new boys of yours
			could use a little more training.

				MACE WINDU
			Sorry to disappoint you, Dooku.
			This party's over.

MACE WINDU signals, and at stategic places around the arena there are sudden flashes of light as about ONE HUNDRED JEDI switch on their lightsabers. The crowd is suddenly silent. COUNT DOOKU'S lips curl in slight amusement.

				COUNT DOOKU
				(to Mace Windu)
			Brave, but stupid, my old Jedi
			friend. You're impossibly
			outnumbered.

				MACE WINDU
			I don't think so. One Jedi has to
			be worth a hundred Geonosians.

COUNT DOOKU looks around the great theater. His smile grows.

				COUNT DOOKU
			It wasn't the Geonosians I was
			thinking about. How well do you
			think one Jedi will hold up
			against a thousand battle droids?

COUNT DOOKU signals. THOUSANDS OF DROIDS start to pour into all parts of the arena.

MACE WINDU draws his lightsaber, JANGO FETT draws his guns and fires at MACE WINDU, who deflects the shots. JANGO FETT and MACE WINDU jump into the arena, where they fight. BOBA FETT wacthes his Dad and the Jedi Master fight. The battle beginss. GEONOSIANS fly away everywhere. DROIDS fire at JEDI, who deflect the bolts and cult down the DROIDS. The GEONOSIAN TROOPS fire ray guns that are more difficult for the JEDI to deflect.

The REEK and the NEXU are spooked by the battle. The REEK bucks the riders off its back and stampedes around the arena, trampling DROIDS and JEDI that have moved into its path. PADME picks up a discarded pistol and joins the fight. SEVERAL JEDI run to the center of the arena and toss lightsabers to OBI-WAN and ANAKIN.

Among the crowd, JEDI cut down swaths of GEONOSIANS and DROIDS. On the sand, JEDI fight, attacking DROIDS. OBI0WAN and ANAKIN swing their lightsabers, cutting DROIDS in half. PADME blasts away at DROIDS and GEONOSIANS.

INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP
ARTOO whistles.

				C-3PO
			I don't hear anything.
				(Artoo beeps)
			You're scaring me! Stop imagining
			things!

EXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
Among the tiers, JEDI are slowly being driven back. They have killed heaps of GEONOSIANS and have kncoked out piles of DROIDS, but sheer numbers are telling. Individual JEDI are being cut down or blasted/ The rest are retreating into the arena.

ANAKIN and PADME are back-to-back, fighting DROIDS and flying GEONOSIANS. MACE WINDU fights fiercely with JANGO FETT. Finally, the bounty hunter falls. His helmet goes flying, bouncing down the steps, tumbling and rolling, kicked here and there by random feet. The bounty hunter's body falls to the ground.

MACE WINDU runs to the center of the arena and fights back-to-back with OBI-WAN, as they swipe and mangle DROIDS.

				OBI-WAN
			Someone's got to - shut down -
			these droids.

				MACE WINDU
			Don't worry! It's being - taken
			care of!

EXT. GEONOSIS, FEDERATION STARSHIP - DAY
KI-ADI-MUNDI leads a raiding party of about TWENTY JEDI through the lines of parked Battle Starships. They cut a swath through masses of DROIDS until they arrive at the Command Starship. Some JEDI fall. The rest cut their way up the ramps and into the Command Ship.

INT. COMMAND FEDERATION STARSHIP, CORRIDORS - DAY
KI-ADI-MUNDI and teh surviving JEDI fight their way through the corridors of the Command Ship, deflecting laser bolts, slicing DROIDS.

INT. COMMAND FEDERATION STARSHIP, CONTROL BRIDGE - DAY
THEY burst onto the bridge and chop down the COMMAND DROIDS. The NEIMOIDIANS flee in all directions. KE-ADI-MUNDI leans over the control panel. He locates the illuminated master switch and punches down on it. It goes dark. Instantly, all the DROIDS on the Starship and all the DROIDS in the arena FREEZE!

There is a moment of stunned silence, then the JEDI CHEER. One the bridge, PLO KOON claps KI-ADI-MUNDI on the back.

				PLO KOON
			We've done it! Now we have a
			chance!

Suddenly, there is a harsh BEEPING SOUND. All the DROIDS on the Starship and all the DROIDS in the arena start fighting again! KI-ADI-MUNDI stares in disbelief and dismay.

				KI-ADI-MUNDI
			The system's off but they're still
			active. That's a new feature. They
			are independent of the control
			system.

EXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
MACE WINDU, OBI-WAN, ANAKIN, PADME and an exhausted group of about TWENTY JEDI stand in the center of the arena surrounded by a ring of BATTLE DROIDS. The bloodied sand around them is strewn with the bodies of DEAD GEONOSIANS, SHATTERED DROIDS and JEDI.

At the foot of some steps, BOBA FETT finds his father's battered helmet. He picks it up.

KI-ADI-MUNDI and the SURVIVORS from the raiding party are herded into the arena by SUPERDROIDS. From the encircling tiers above, THOUSANDS OF BATTLE DROIDS level their weapons menacingly.

In the archducal box, COUNT DOOKU lifts his hand. The DROIDS lower their weapons. The COUNT calls out to the JEDI.

				COUNT DOOKU
			Master Windu!

Silence.

				COUNT DOOKU
				(continuing)
			You have fought gallantly. Worthy
			of recognition in the history
			archives of the Jedi Order. Now
			it is finished.
				(pauses briefly)
			Surrender - and your lives will be 
			spared.

				MACE WINDU
			We will not be hostages for you to
			barter with Dooku.

				COUNT DOOKU
			Then, I'm sorry, old friend. You
			will have to be destroyed.

The DROIDS raise their weapons. ANAKIN and PADME clasps hands tightly. COUNT DOOKU raises his hand to give the order to fire. PADME looks up suddenlt and whispers to ANAKIN.

				PADME
			Look!

Above, six Gunships are descending fast through the open area in the arena ceiling. They land in a cluster around the handful of JEDI. CLONE TROOPERS spill out and start firing at the DROIDS. There is a hellstorm of laserfire that bounces off the laser shields created by the Gunships. YODA appears at the door of one of the Gunships.

				YODA
			Come on - hurry! Hurry!

The SURVIVING JEDI dash to the Gunships and scramble in. MACE WINDU hangs on tight as the Gunship, firing all its weapons, rises out of the arena up and over the topmost rim.

EXT. GEONOSIS, TERRAIN OUTSIDE EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
The massed lines of parked Federation Starships and the DROIDS surrounding the arena, are themselves surrounded by thousands of Republic Starships, disgorging TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CLONE TROOPERS. Beyond, more Republic Starships are landing and spewing out troops.

INT. GUNSHIP NUMBER ONE - DAY
MACE WINDU stares at the incredible sight.

				YODA
			More battalions to the left.
			Encircle them we must, then
			divide.

The CLONE TROOPERS open fire with artillery. EXPLOSIONS wreck the parked Battle Starships. CLONE TROOPERS advance, firing at the massed DROIDS. FIGHTER DROIDS fly overhead, exchanging fire with the Gunships and JEDI fighters.

INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP - DAY
THREEPIO and ARTOO see flashes outside of the ship, exploding everywhere.

				C-3PO
			I'm sure I heard something, this
			time. Didn't you? It's probably
			just a celebration

ARTOO lets out an EXHAUSTED BLEEP.

EXT. BATTLEFIELD, GEONOSIS LANDSCAPE - DAY
Gunship #2 skims the battlefield, firing down, deflecting answering fire from the droids.

INT. GUNSHIP NUMBER TWO - DAY
OBI-WAN, ANAKIN and PADME are at the open sides of the Gunship. CLONES fire down at the DROIDS below.

The Gunship slows, circling over a droid gun-emplacement. It blasts it, but suddenly the Gunship is rocked by a near miss. It lurches violently.

				OBI-WAN
			Hold on! Look over there...

Through the other side of the Gunship, they see a Geonosian Speeder racing past. In the open cockpit is the unmistakable figure of COUNT DOOKU.

				ANAKIN
			It's Dooku, go after him!

The PILOT starts to comply, but... there is a HUGE BLASTS, the ship lurches on its side, and PADME tumbles out.

				ANAKIN
				(continuing)
			Padme!!!

ANAKIN stares down in horror as PADME hits thr ground below.

				ANAKIN
				(continuing; to pilot)
			Put the ship down! Down!

				OBI-WAN
			No! Forget her. We have to go
			after Dooku.

				ANAKIN
			No we're not!! Land this ship!

				OBI-WAN
			Don't let your personal feelings
			get in the way. We've got a job to
			do.

Below, PADME hauls herself to her feet and waves for them to go after DOOKU.

				ANAKIN
			I don't care!.. Go back.

				OBI-WAN
			Anakin! She's all right! Look.

ANAKIN stares out to see PADME rescued by CLONE TROOPERS.

				OBI-WAN
				(continuing)
			Follow that speeder!

On the ground, PADME looks up at Gunship #2 as it speeds away after Count Dooku. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN follow the speeder to a Geonosian tower. The speeder decsends rapidly; the Gunship follows.

Count Dooku's speeder parks outside the tower; the Gunship parks next to it. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN leap down and run inside the tower.

INT. GEONOSIS, SECRET HANGER TOWER - LATE DAY
COUNT DOOKU throws switches on a control panel. His Interstellar Sail Ship is guarded by a SQUAD OF SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. The doors of the exit-port slide open.

				DROID CAPTAIN
			Your Excellency!

COUNT DOOKU turns as OBI-WAN and ANAKIN run in through the hanger doors. They draw their lightsabers. The DROIDS raise their weapons.

				COUNT DOOKU
			That won't be necessary, Captain.
			Stand down. And leave them to me.

The DROIDS lower their weapons and back off to the walls. COUNT DOOKU looks at OBI-WAN and ANAKIN with slight amusement.

				OBI-WAN
				(to Anakin)
			We move in together - you slowly
			on the...

				ANAKIN
			I'm taking him now!

				OBI-WAN
			Anakin, no!

				ANAKIN
			You'll pay for all the Jedi you've
			killed today, Dooku.

ANAKIN charges across the open space at COUNT DOOKU, who smiles faintly, watching him come. ANAKIN raises his lightsaber. At the last moment, COUNT DOOKU thrusts out an arm, and ANAKIN is lifted up, hurled across the room, and slammed into the opposite wall. He slumps to the foot of the wall, semi-conscious. COUNT DOOKU moves toward OBI-WAN

				COUNT DOOKU
			Kenobi, isn't it? As you can see,
			my Jedi powers are far beyond
			yours. Now, back down.

				OBI-WAN
			I don't think so.

OBI-WAN lifts his lightsaber. COUNT DOOKU smiles.

				COUNT DOOKU
			Ah, but if I must.

COUNT DOOKU draws his lightsaber. He and OBI-WAN start to circle each other.

				COUNT DOOKU
				(continuing)
			I have spent the last ten years
			learning to use the power of the
			Dark Side. It gives me infinitely
			greater power.

				OBI-WAN
			You will have to prove it.

OBI-WAN comes in fast, swinging at COUNT DOOKU'S head. DOOKU parries the cut easily. As they fight, it quickly becomes clear that DOOKU is the complete swordsman - elegant, graceful, classical - a master of the old style.

				COUNT DOOKU
			Grand Master Kenobi, you
			disappoint me. Yoda holds you in
			such high esteem.

COUNT DOOKU parried another cut.

				COUNT DOOKU
				(continuing)
			Surely you can do better...?
				(parries)
			No, I'm surprised. Has Jedi
			swordsmanship degenerated so
			quickly, or are you trying to make
			fun of me?
				(cuts)
			Which is it?

COUNT DOOKU thrusts. OBI-WAN steps back quickly, panting for breath.

				COUNT DOOKU
				(continuing)
			come, come, Master Kenobi. Put me
			out of my misery.

OBI-WAN takes a deep breath, gets a fresh grip on his lightsaber and comes in again. For a moment, he drives COUNT DOOKU back. Then Dooku's superior skill begins to tell again, and he forces OBI-WAN to retreat.

COUNT DOOKU increases the tempo of his attack. OBI-WAN is pushed to the limit to defend himself. DOOKU presses. His lightsaber flashes.

OBI-WAN is wounded in the shoulder, then the thigh. He stumbles back against the wall, trips, and falls. His lightsaber goes skittering across the floor.

COUNT DOOKU raises his lightsaber. OBI-WAN looks up helplessly. Dooku's lightsaber flashes down and CLASHES against - Anakin's lightsaber! COUNT DOOKU and ANAKIN stare eyeball to eyeball.

				COUNT DOOKU
				(continuing)
			That's brave of you, boy - but
			foolish. I would have thought
			you'd have learnt your lesson.

				ANAKIN
			I'm a slow learner.

And ANAKIN charges at COUNT DOOKU. The force of his attack catches the Count slightly off balance. Anakin's lightsaber flashes. COUNT DOOKU draws back, putting a hand to his arm. He takes the hand away and looks at the smear of blood whee Anakin has nicked him.

				COUNT DOOKU
			You have unusual powers, young
			Padawan. But not enought to save
			you this time.

				ANAKIN
			Don't bet on it!

				OBI-WAN
			Anakin!

OBI-WAN uses the Force to catch his lightsaber and he tosses it to ANAKIN. With TWO LIGHTSABERS, ANAKIN attacks. COUNT DOOKU parries and ripostes. It is no contest. ANAKIN is driven back against the wall. He loses one lightsaber. Finally COUNT DOOKU, in one flashing move, sends Anakin's arm, cut at the elbow, flying still gripping his lightsaber. ANAKIN drops to the ground in agony. COUNT DOOKU draws himself up to deliver the coup de grace.

Suddenly, the great doors slide open. The DROIDS turn fast, raising their weapons. Through the thick smoke, emerges the heroic figure of YODA. He stops on the smoke-filled threashold, FOUR DROIDS lined up on either side of him, guns pointed.

Before the DROIDS can get off a shot, YODA raises his hand, and the DROIDS are flung against the far walls and crash to the floor in heaps of smoking metal.

Silence. COUNT DOOKU steps away from ANAKIN to face the Jedi Grand Master. His lightsaber whirls in a formal salute.

				COUNT DOOKU
			Master Yoda. At last we shall
			know who is the most powerful.

YODA draws a miniature lightsaber out of his cane. He salutes formally.

				YODA
			Count Dooku. No interest in
			contests, do I have.

COUNT DOOKU charges across the space at YODA. He rains down blows upon the tiny figure. YODA doesn't budge an inch. For the first part of the contest, he parries every cut and thrust that Dooku aims. Nothing the great swordsman tries gets through. His energy drains. His strokes become feebler, slower.

YODA attacks! He flies forward. COUNT DOOKU is forced to retreat. Wprds are insufficient to describe the range and skill of Yoda's speed and swordplay. His lightsaber his a humming blur of light.

Count Dooku's lightsaber is sent cartwheeling from his hand. He staggers back, gasping and spent, against the control panel. YODA jumps onto DOOKU'S shoulders, and is about to drive the lightsaber into the top of the Count's head.

				YODA
				(continuing)
			The end for you, Count, this is.

				COUNT DOOKU
			...Not yet...

COUNT DOOKU raises his arms and knocks YODA off his shoulders and then, with all his might, he uses the Force to pull on one of the cranes in the hanger. It comes crashing down on OBI-WAN and ANAKIN. But in the blink of and eye, YODA is under the crane, holding it up, using the Force. YODA closes his eyes and concentrates.

ANAKIN is unconscious, and OBI0WAN tries toget out from under the crane. The fallen crane trembles and starts to life. Behind it, the sound of the Sail Ship's engines are heard starting up.

YODA concentrates harder. Slowly, the crane rises. The SOUND OF THE ENGINES increases. YODA exerts every scrap of his powers. The crane lifts clear of ANAKIN and is thrown to the ground. DOOKU'S Sail Ship takes off. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN struggle to the exhausted YODA, but it's too late. The Sail Ship rises into the air and flies away. PADMÉ and a CLONE CAPTAIN with about TEN TROOPERS appear in the doorway.

				PADMÉ
			Anakin!

PADMÉ runs too him and throws her arms around him. ANAKIN is barely able to stand up. The CLONE CAPTAIN marches up to YODA, stops, and salutes smartly.

				CLONE CAPTAIN
			Resistance is at an end, General.
			What are your orders ?

YODA looks at him and sighs.

EXT. CORUSCANT, OLD TOWN - DAWN
COUNT DOOKU'S Interstellar Sail Ship glides through a deserted, burned-out part of Coruscant. COUNT DOOKU manoeuvres the ship into one of the empty buildings and lands.

INT. CORUSCANT, SECRET LANDING PLATFORM - DAWN
The ramp lowers. COUNT DOOKU emerges and walks to where the hooded figure of DARTH SIDIOUS stands waiting. COUNT DOOKU bows.

				COUNT DOOKU
			The Force is with us, my Master.

				DARTH SIDIOUS
			Welcome home, Lord Tyranus. You have
			done well.

				COUNT DOOKU
			I bring you good news, my Lord.
			The war has begun.

				DARTH SIDIOUS
			Excellent. 
			 	(smiling)
			Everything is going as planned.

EXT. CORUSCANT, JEDI TEMPLE - SUNSET
The beautiful temple basks in the red glow of the setting sun.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, COUNCIL CHAMBER - SUNSET

				MACE WINDU
			Where is your apprentice?

				OBI-WAN
			On his way back to Naboo. He is
			escorting Senator Amidala home.

They are standing, looking out through the tall windows at the great plaza below. YODA sits in his chair.

				OBI-WAN
				(continuing)
			I must admit without the clones,
			it would not have been a victory.

				YODA
			Victory? Victory, you say?

OBI-WAN turns and looks at the sad little Jedi sitting in the Council Chamber. Apart from KI-ADI-MUNDI and PLO KOON, who is wounded, the Chamber is empty.

				YODA
				(continuing)
			Not victory, a defeat, it was...
			Master Obi-Wan. Begun, the Clone
			War has!

EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, GARDEN - LATE DAY
In a rose-covered arbor overlooking the sparkling late, ANAKIN and PADME stand before a NABOO HOLY MAN.

THREEPIO and ARTOO stand by, watching, as the HOLY MAN blesses the happy couple and, amid gently falling rose petals, ANAKIN and PADME kiss.

EXT. CORUSCANT, MILITARY STAGING AREA, BALCONY - LATE DAY
PALPATINE, JAR JAR, BAIL ORGANA and the OTHER SENATORS, with TWO ROYAL GUARDS, stand looking down at the square below.

TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CLONE TROOPS are drawn up in a strict formation or move forwards in near files to climb the ramps of the Military Assault Ships.

On the balcony, PALPATINE'S expression is deeply sad. Everyone watches comberly as, in the square, loaded Assault Ships take off. Other land immediately in their place. The sky above is thick with transports. CLONE TROOPS march and board the Ships.

The Great Clone War has begun...

by a ROLL-UP, which crawls into infinity.

Episode VI
RETURN OF THE JEDI

Luke Skywalker has returned to his home planet of Tatooine in an 
attempt to rescue his friend Han Solo from the clutches of theÊvile 
gangster Jabba the Hutt. Little does Luke know that the GALACTIC EMPIRE 
has secretly begun construction on a new armored space station even 
more powerful than the first dreaded Death Star. When completed, this 
ultimate weapon will spell certain doom for the small band of Rebels 
struggling to restore freedom to the galaxy...

PAN DOWN to reveal a monstrous half-completed Death Star, its massive 
superstructure curling away from the completed section like the arms of 
a giant octopus. Beyond, in benevolent contrast, floats the small, 
green moon of ENDOR.

An Imperial Star Destroyer moves overhead toward the massive armored 
space station, followed by two zipping TIE fighters. A small Imperial 
shuttle rockets from the main bay of the ship and hustles toward the 
Death Star.

2    INT IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - COCKPIT 
The shuttle captain makes contact with the Death Star.

SHUTTLE CAPTAIN
Command station, this is ST 321. Code Clearance Blue. We're starting 
our approach. Deactivate the security shield.

DEATH STAR CONTROLLER	(filtered VO)
The security deflector shield will be deactivated when we have 
confirmation of your code transmission. Stand by... You are clear to 
proceed.

SHUTTLE CAPTAIN
We're starting our approach.

3    INT DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM

Operators move about among the control panels. A SHIELD OPERATOR hits 
switches beside a large screen, on which is a display of the Death 
Star, the moon Endor, and a bright web delineating the invisible 
deflector shield.

A control officer rushes over to the shield operator.

OFFICER
Inform the commander that Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived.

OPERATOR
Yes, sir.

The control officer moves to a view port and watches as the Imperial 
shuttle lands in the massive docking bay. A squad of Imperial 
stormtroopers moves into formation before the craft.

4    INT DEATH STAR - MAIN DOCKING BAY

The DEATH STAR COMMANDER, MOFF JERJERROD, a tall, confident technocrat, 
strides through the assembled troops to the base of the shuttle ramp. 
The troops snap to attention; many are uneasy about the new arrival. 
But the Death Star commander stands arrogantly tall.

The exit hatch of the shuttle opens with a WHOOSH, revealing only 
darkness. Then, heavy FOOTSTEPS AND MECHANICAL BREATHING. From this 
black void appears DARTH VADER, LORD OF THE SITH. Vader looks over the 
assemblage as he walks down the ramp.

JERJERROD
Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your 
presence.

VADER
You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you 
back on
schedule.

The commander turns ashen and begins to shake.

JERJERROD
I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can.

VADER
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.

JERJERROD
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.

VADER
The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.

JERJERROD
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.

VADER
Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.

JERJERROD	 (aghast)
The Emperor's coming here?

VADER
That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your 
apparent lack of progress.

JERJERROD
We shall double our efforts.

VADER
I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as 
I am.

5    EXT ROAD TO JABBA'S PALACE - TATOOINE

A lonely, windswept road meanders through the desolate Tatooine 
terrain. We HEAR a familiar BEEPING and a distinctive reply before 
catching sight of ARTOO-DETOO and SEE-THREEPIO, making their way along 
the road toward the ominous palace of Jabba the Hutt.

THREEPIO
Of course I'm worried. And you should be, too. Lando Calrissian and 
poor Chewbacca never returned from this awful place.

Artoo whistles timidly.

THREEPIO
Don't be so sure. If I told you half the things I've heard about this 
Jabba the Hutt, you'd probably short-circuit.

The two droids fearfully approach the massive gate to the palace.

THREEPIO
Artoo, are you sure this is the right place? I better knock, I suppose.

6    EXT JABBA'S PALACE - GATE 

Threepio looks around for some kind of signaling device, then timidly 
knocks on the iron door.

THREEPIO	 (instantly) 
There doesn't seem to be anyone there. Let's go back and tell Master 
Luke.

A small hatch in the middle of the door opens and a spidery mechanical 
arm, with a large electronic eyeball on the end, pops out and inspects 
the two droids.

STRANGE VOICE
Tee chuta hhat yudd!

THREEPIO
Goodness gracious me!

 Threepio points to Artoo, then to himself.

 THREEPIO
 Artoo Detoowha bo Seethreepiowha ey toota odd mischka Jabba du Hutt.

The eye looks from one robot to the other, there is a laugh then the 
eye zips back into the door. The hatch slams shut. Artoo beeps his 
concern.

THREEPIO
I don't think they're going to let us in, Artoo. We'd better go.

Artoo beeps his reluctance as Threepio turns to leave. Suddenly the 
massive door starts to rise with a horrific metallic SCREECH. The 
robots turn back and face an endless black cavity. The droids look at 
one another, afraid to enter.

Artoo starts forward into the gloom. Threepio rushes after his stubby 
companion. The door lowers noisily behind them.

THREEPIO 
Artoo, wait. Oh, dear! Artoo. Artoo, I really don't think we should 
rush into all this.

Artoo continues down the corridor, with Threepio following.

THREEPIO
Oh, Artoo!  Artoo, wait for me!

7    INT JABBA'S PALACE - HALLWAY

The door slams shut with a loud crash that echoes throughout the dark 
passageway. The frightened robots are met by two giant, green GAMORREAN 
GUARDS, who fall in behind them. Threepio glances quickly back at the 
two lumbering brutes, then back to Artoo. One guard grunts an order. 
Artoo beeps nervously.

THREEPIO
Just you deliver Master Luke's message and get us out of here. Oh my! 
Oh! Oh, no.

Walking toward them out of the darkness is BIB FORTUNA, a humanlike 
alien with long tentacles protruding from his skull.

BIB
Die Wanna Wanga!

THREEPIO
Oh, my! Die Wanna Wauaga. We -- we bring a message to your master, 
Jabba the Hutt.

Artoo lets out a series of quick beeps.

THREEPIO	 (cont)
...and a gift.
(thinks a moment, then to Artoo)
Gift, what gift?

Bib shakes his head negatively.

BIB
Nee Jabba no badda. Me chaade su goodie.

Bib holds out his hand toward Artoo and the tiny droid backs up a bit, 
letting out a protesting array of squeaks. Threepio turns to the 
strange-looking alien.

THREEPIO
He says that our instructions are to give it only to Jabba himself.

Bib thinks about this for a moment.

THREEPIO
I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever so stubborn about these sort 
of things.

Bib gestures for the droids to follow.

BIB
Nudd Chaa.

The droids follow the tall, tentacled alien into the darkness, trailed 
by the two guards.

THREEPIO
Artoo, I have a bad feeling about this.

8    INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM

The throne room is filled with the vilest, most grotesque CREATURES 
ever conceived in the universe. Artoo and Threepio seem very small as 
they pause in the doorway to the dimly lit chamber. Light shafts 
partially illuminate the drunken courtiers as Bib Fortuna crosses the 
room to the platform upon which rests the leader of this nauseating 
crowd: JABBA THE HUTT. The monarch of the galactic underworld is a 
repulsive blob of bloated fat with a maniacal grin. Chained to the 
horrible creature is the beautiful alien female dancer named OOLA. At 
the foot of the dais sits an obnoxious birdlike creature, SALACIOUS 
CRUMB. Bib whispers something in the slobbering degenerate's ear. Jabba 
laughs horribly, at the two terrified droids before him. Threepio bows 
politely.

THREEPIO
Good morning.

JABBA
Bo Shuda!

The robots jump forward to stand before the repulsive, loose-skinned 
villain.

THREEPIO
The message, Artoo, the message.

Artoo whistles, and a beam of light projects from his domed head, 
creating a hologram of LUKE on the floor. The image grows to over ten 
feet tall, and the young Jedi towers over the space gangsters.

LUKE
Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke 
Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are 
powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally 
powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's 
life. 
(Jabba's crowd laughs) 
With your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which 
will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant 
confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift: 
these two droids.

Threepio is startled by this announcement.

THREEPIO
What did he say?

LUKE	 (cont)
... Both are hardworking and will serve you well.

THREEPIO
This can't be! Artoo, you're playing the wrong message.

Luke's hologram disappears.

Jabba laughs while Bib speaks to him in Huttese.

JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
There will be no bargain.

THREEPIO
We're doomed.

JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
I will not give up my favorite decoration. I like Captain Solo where he 
is.

Jabba laughs hideously and looks toward an alcove beside the throne. 
Hanging high, flat against the wall, exactly as we saw him last, is a 
carbonized HAN SOLO.

THREEPIO
Artoo, look! Captain Solo. And he's still frozen in carbonite.

9    INT DUNGEON CORRIDOR 

One of Jabba's Gamorrean guards marches Artoo and Threepio down a dank, 
shadowy passageway lined with holding cells. The cries of unspeakable 
creatures bounce off the cold stone walls. Occasionally a repulsive arm 
or tentacle grabs through the bars at the hapless droids. Artoo beeps 
pitifully.

THREEPIO
What could possibly have come over Master Luke. Is it something I did? 
He never expressed any unhappiness with my work. Oh! Oh! Hold it! Ohh!

A large tentacle wraps around Threepio's neck. He manages to break 
free, and they move on to a door at the end of the corridor.

10   INT BOILER ROOM

The door slides open, revealing a room filled with steam and noisy 
machinery. The guard motions them into the boiler room, where they are 
met by a tall, thin humanlike robot named EV-9D9. Behind the robot can 
be seen a torture rack pulling the legs off a screaming baby work 
droid. A second power droid is upside down.  As smoking branding irons 
are pressed into his feet, the stubby robot lets out an agonized 
electronic scream. Artoo and Threepio cringe as the guard grunts to EV-
9D9.

NINEDENINE
Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?

THREEPIO
I am See-Threepio, human-cy...

NINEDENINE
Yes or no will do.

THREEPIO
Oh. Well, yes.

NINEDENINE
How many languages do you speak?

THREEPIO
I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can 
readily...

NINEDENINE
Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got 
angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.

THREEPIO
Disintegrated?

NINEDENINE	 (to a Gamorrean guard)
Guard! This protocol droid might be useful. Fit him with a restraining 
bolt and take him back to His Excellency's main audience chamber.

The guard shoves Threepio toward the door.

THREEPIO	 (disappearing)
Artoo, don't leave me! Ohhh!

Artoo lets out a plaintive cry as the door closes. Then he beeps 
angrily.

NINEDENINE
You're a feisty little one, but you'll soon learn some respect. I have 
need for you on the master's Sail Barge. And I think you'll fit in 
nicely.

The poor work droid in the background lets out another tortured 
electronic scream.

11   INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM

The court of Jabba the Hutt is in the midst of a drunken, raucous 
party. Sloppy, smelly monsters cheer and make rude noises as Oola and a 
fat female dancer perform in front of Jabba's throne.

Jabba leers at the dancers and with a lustful gleam in his eye beckons 
Oola to come and sit with him. She stops dancing and backs away, 
shaking her head. Jabba gets angry and points to a spot next to him.

JABBA
Da Eitha!

The lovely alien shakes her head again and screams.

OOLA
Na Chuba negatorie Na! Na! Natoota...

Jabba is furious and pulls her toward him, tugging on the chain.

JABBA
Boscka!

He pushes a button and, before the dancer can flee, a trap door in the 
floor springs open and swallows her up. As the door snaps shut, a 
muffled growl is followed by a hideous scream. Jabba and his monstrous 
friends laugh hysterically and several revelers hurry over to watch her 
fate through a grate.

Threepio cringes and glances wistfully at the carbonite form of Han 
Solo, but is immediately distracted by a gunshot offscreen.ÊAn 
unnatural quiet sweeps the boisterous gathering. On the far side of the 
room, the crush of debauchers moves aside to allow the approach of two 
guards followed by BOUSHH, an oddly cloaked bounty hunter, leading his 
captive, Han Solo's copilot, CHEWBACCA THE WOOKIEE.

Bib takes his place next to his disgusting master, and whispers into 
his ear, pointing at Chewbacca and the bounty hunter. Jabba listens 
intently, then the bounty hunter bows before the gangster and speaks a 
greeting in a strange, electronically processed tongue (Ubese).

BOUSHH	 (in Ubese subtitled)
I have come for the bounty on this Wookiee.

THREEPIO
Oh, no! Chewbacca!

JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
At last we have the mighty Chewbacca.

Jabba lets out a loud, long, blood-curdling laugh and turns to 
Threepio, waving him closer. The reluctant droid obeys.

THREEPIO
Oh, uh, yes, uh, I am here, Your Worshipfulness. Uh... yes!

Jabba continues speaking, as Threepio nervously translates. Boushh 
listens, studying the dangerous creatures around the room. He notices 
BOBA FETT standing near the door.

THREEPIO
Oh. The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome and will gladly pay you the 
reward of twenty-five thousand.

BOUSHH	 (in Ubese subtitled)
I want fifty thousand. No less.

Jabba immediately flies into a rage, knocking the golden droid off the 
raised throne into a clattering heap on the floor. Boushh adjusts his 
weapon as Jabba raves in Huttese and Threepio struggles back onto the 
throne. The disheveled droid tries to compose himself.

THREEPIO
Uh, oh... but what, what did I say?
(to Boushh)
Uh, the mighty Jabba asks why he must pay fifty thousand.

The bounty hunter holds up a small silver ball in his hand. Threepio 
looks at it, then looks at Jabba, then back to the bounty hunter. The 
droid is very nervous and Jabba is getting very impatient.

THREEPIO
Because he's holding a thermal detonator.

The guards instantly back away, as do most of the other monsters in the 
room. Jabba stares at the silver ball, which begins to glow in the 
bounty hunter's hand. The room has fallen into a tense hush. Jabba 
stares at the bounty hunter malevolently until a sly grin creeps across 
his vast mouth and he begins to laugh.

JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
This bounty hunter is my kind of scum. Fearless and inventive.

Jabba continues.

THREEPIO
Jabba offers the sum of thirty-five. And I suggest you take it.

Bib and the other monsters study the bounty hunter and wait for his 
reaction. Boushh releases a switch on the thermal detonator and it goes 
dead.

BOUSHH
Zeebuss.

THREEPIO
He agrees!

The raucous crowd of monsters erupts in a symphony of cheers and 
applause as the party returns to its full noisy pitch. Chewbacca 
growls. As he is led away we spot LANDO CALRISSIAN, disguised as a 
skiff guard in a partial face mask. The band starts up and dancing 
girls take the center of the floor, to the hoots of the loudly 
appreciative creatures.

Boushh leans against a column with gunfighter cool and surveys the 
scene, his gaze stopping only when it connects with a glare from across 
the room. Boba Fett is watching him. Boushh shifts slightly, cradling 
his weapon lovingly. Boba Fett shifts with equally ominous arrogance.

12   INT DUNGEON CORRIDOR AND CELL

Gamorrean guards lead Chewie down the same hallway we saw before. When 
a tentacle reaches out at the Wookiee, Chewie's ferocious ROAR echoes 
against the walls and the tentacle snaps back into its cell in terror. 
It takes all the guards to hurl Chewie roughly into a cell, slamming 
the door behind him. Chewie lets out a pathetic howl and bangs on the 
iron door.

13   EXT JABBA'S PALACE

The palace is sitting in the light of the double sunset. On the road in 
front, a large toadlike creature flicks its tongue out for a desert 
rodent and burps in satisfaction.

14   INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM - NIGHT

Silence. The room is deserted, only the awful debris of the alien 
celebration giving mute witness to the activity here before. Several 
drunk creatures lie unconscious around the room, snoring loudly.

A shadowy figure moves stealthily among the columns at the perimeter of 
the room and is revealed to be Boushh, the bounty hunter. He picks his 
way carefully through the snoring, drunken monsters.

Han Solo, the frozen space pirate, hangs spotlighted on the wall, his 
coffin-like case suspended by a force field. The bounty hunter 
deactivates the force field by flipping a control switch to one side of 
the coffin. The heavy case slowly lowers to the floor of the alcove.

Boushh steps up to the case, studying Han, and then turns to the 
controls on the side of the coffin. He activates a series of switches 
and, after one last hesitant look at Han, slides the de-carbonization 
lever. The case begins to emit a sound as the hard shell covering the 
contours of Han's face begins to melt away. The bounty hunter watches 
as Han's body is freed of its metallic coat and his forearms and hands, 
previously raised in reflexive protest, drop slackly to his side. His 
face muscles relax from their mask of horror. He appears quite dead.

Boushh's ugly helmet leans close to Han's face listening for the breath 
of life. Nothing. He waits. Han's eyes pop open with a start and he 
begins coughing. The bounty hunter steadies the staggering newborn.

BOUSHH
Just relax for a moment. You're free of the carbonite.

Han touches his face with his hand and moans.

BOUSHH
Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.

HAN
I can't see.

BOUSHH
Your eyesight will return in time.

HAN
Where am I?

BOUSHH
Jabba's palace.

HAN
Who are you?

The bounty hunter reaches up and lifts the helmet from his head, 
revealing the beautiful face of PRINCESS LEIA.

LEIA
Someone who loves you.

HAN
Leia!

LEIA
I gotta get you out of here.

As Leia helps her weakened lover to stand up, the relative quiet is 
pierced by an obscene HUTTESE CACKLE from the other side of the alcove.

HAN
What's that? I know that laugh.

The curtain on the far side of the alcove opens, revealing Jabba the 
Hutt, surrounded by Bib and other aliens. He laughs again, and his 
gross cronies join in a cacophony of alien glee.

HAN
Hey, Jabba. Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay you back, but I 
got a little sidetracked. It's not my fault.

Jabba laughs.

JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
It's too late for that, Solo. You may have been a good smuggler, but 
now you're Bantha fodder.

HAN
Look...

JABBA	 (cont Huttese subtitled)
Take him away!

The guards grab Han and start to lead him away.

HAN
Jabba... I'll pay you triple! You're throwing away a fortune here. 
Don't be a fool!

Han is dragged off, as Lando quickly moves forward and attempts to lead 
Leia away.

JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
Bring her to me.

Jabba chuckles as Lando and a second guard drag the beautiful young 
princess toward him. Threepio peeks from behind a monster and quickly 
turns away in disgust.

LEIA
We have powerful friends. You're gonna regret this...

JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
I'm sure.

Inexorably her lovely face moves to within a few inches of Jabba's ugly 
blob of a head, and Leia turns away in disgust.

LEIA
Ugh!

THREEPIO
Ohhh, I can't bear to watch.

15   INT DUNGEON CELL

The heavy metal door of the dungeon whines and slowly creaks open. A 
guard throws the blinded star captain into the dark cell and the door 
slams shut behind him, leaving only a thin sliver of light from a crack 
in the door. Han is trying to collect himself when suddenly a growl is 
heard from the far side of the cell. He jumps back against the cell 
door and listens.

HAN
Chewie? Chewie, is that you?

The shadowy figure lets out a crazy yell and races toward Han, lifting 
him off the ground with a big hug that carries them into the light, 
revealing Chewie.

HAN
Ah! Chew--Chewie!

The giant Wookiee barks with glee.

HAN
Wait. I can't see, pal. What's goin' on?

Chewie barks an excited blue streak.

HAN
Luke? Luke's crazy. He can't even take care of himself, much less 
rescue anybody.

Chewie barks a reply.

HAN
A...Jedi Knight? I--I'm out of it for a little while, everybody gets 
delusions of grandeur.

Chewie growls insistently. He holds Han to his chest and pets his head.

HAN
I'm all right, pal. I'm all right.

16   INT MAIN GATE AND HALL - JABBA'S PALACE

Noisily, the main gate lifts to flood the blackness with blinding LIGHT 
and reveal the silhouetted figure of LUKE SKYWALKER. He is clad in a 
robe similar to Ben's and wears neither pistol nor laser sword. Luke 
strides purposefully into the hallway. Two giant guards move to block 
Luke's path. Luke halts.

Luke raises his hand and points at the puzzled guards, who immediately 
lower their spears and fall back. The young Jedi lowers his hand and 
moves on down the hallway.

Bib Fortuna appears out of the gloom. He speaks to Luke as they 
approach each other, but Luke doesn't stop and Bib must reverse his 
direction and hurry alongside the young Jedi in order to carry on the 
conversation. Several other guards fall in behind them in the darkness.

LUKE
I must speak with Jabba.

Bib answers in Huttese, shaking his head in denial. Luke stops and 
stares at Bib; he raises his hand slightly.

LUKE
You will take me to Jabba now!

Bib turns in hypnotic response to Luke's command, and Luke follows him 
into the gloom.

LUKE
You serve your master well.

Bib responds.

LUKE
And you will be rewarded.

17   INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM

Jabba is asleep on his throne, with Leia lying in front of him. 
Salacious sits by Jabba's tail, watching it wriggle. Leia is now 
dressed in the skimpy costume of a dancing girl; a chain runs from a 
manacle/necklace at her throat to her new master, Jabba the Hutt. 
Threepio stands behind Jabba as Bib comes up to the gangster slug.

THREEPIO
At last! Master Luke's come to rescue me.

BIB
Master.

Jabba awakens with a start and Bib continues, in Huttese.

BIB
...Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight.

JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
I told you not to admit him.

LUKE
I must be allowed to speak.

BIB	 (in Huttese subtitled)
He must be allowed to speak.

Jabba, furious, clobbers Bib and shoves him away.

JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
You weak-minded fool! He's using an old Jedi mind trick.

Luke stares hard at Jabba.

LUKE
You will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me.

JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
Your mind powers will not work on me, boy.

LUKE
Nevertheless, I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can either 
profit by this... or be destroyed! It's your choice. But I warn you not 
to underestimate my powers.

Jabba's laugh is mean and loud. Threepio attempts to warn Luke about 
the pit.

THREEPIO
Master Luke, you're standing on...

JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
There will be no bargain, young Jedi. I shall enjoy watching you die.

Luke reaches out, and a pistol jumps out of a guard's holster and flies 
into Luke's hand. The bewildered guard grabs for it as Jabba raises his 
hand.

JABBA
Bascka!

The floor suddenly drops away, sending Luke and the hapless guard into 
the pit. The pistol goes off, blasting a hole in the ceiling. Jabba 
laughs and his courtiers join in. Leia starts forward but is restrained 
by a human guard-- Lando, recognizable behind his mask. She looks at 
him and he shakes his head "no."

18   INT RANCOR PIT

Luke and the guard have dropped twenty-five feet from a chute into the 
dungeonlike cage. Luke gets to his feet as the guard yells hysterically 
for help. A crowd gathers up around the edge of the pit as the door in 
the side of the pit starts to RUMBLE open. The guard screams in panic. 
Luke looks calmly around for a means of escape.

THREEPIO
Oh, no! The Rancor!

At the side of the pit, an iron door rumbles upward and a giant, fanged 
RANCOR emerges. The guard runs to the side of the pit and tries 
futilely to scramble to the top. The hideous beast closes in on him.

The Rancor moves past Luke, and as the guard continues to scramble, the 
Rancor picks him up and pops him into its slavering jaws. A few 
screams, and the guard is swallowed with a gulp. The audience cheers 
and laughs at the guard's fate.

The monster turns and starts for Luke. The young Jedi dashes away just 
ahead of the monster's swipe at him, and picks up the long arm bone of 
an earlier victim. The monster grabs Luke and brings him up to his 
salivating mouth. At the last moment, Luke wedges the bone in the 
monster's mouth and is dropped to the floor. The monster bellows in 
rage and flails about, hitting the side of the pit, causing an 
avalanche.

The monster crushes the bone in its jaws and sees Luke, who squeezes 
into a crevice in the pit wall. Luke looks past the monster to the 
holding cave beyond. On the far side of the holding cave is a utility 
door--if only he can get to it. The Rancor spots Luke and reaches into 
the crevice for him. Luke grabs a large rock and raises it, smashing it 
down on the Rancor's finger.

19   HOLDING TUNNEL - RANCOR PIT

The Rancor lets out a loud howl as Luke makes a run for the holding 
cave. He reaches the door and pushes a button to open it. When he 
succeeds, he sees a heavy barred gate between him and safety. Beyond 
the gate two guards look up from their dinner. Luke turns to see the 
monster heading for him, and pulls with all his might on the gate. The 
guards move to the gate and start poking at the young Jedi with spears, 
laughing.

Luke crouches (against the wall) as the monster starts to reach for 
him. Suddenly he notices a main door control panel halfway up the wall. 
As the Rancor moves in for the kill, Luke picks up a skull from the 
cave floor and hurls it at the panel. The giant overhead door comes 
crashing down on the beast's head, squashing it like a sledgehammer on 
an egg.

A startled gasp is heard from the stunned court. There's consternation 
at this turn of events. Heads look to Jabba, who is actually turning 
red with anger. Leia cannot suppress her joy. Jabba utters harsh 
commands to his guards and they hurry off.

JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
Bring me Solo and the Wookiee. They will all suffer for this outrage.

21   INT RANCOR PIT

The Rancor KEEPERS have come into the cage and are examining their dead 
beast. One of them breaks down and weeps. The other glares menacingly 
at Luke, who is unworried. Several guards rush into the holding tunnel 
and take Luke away.

22   INT THRONE ROOM

The crowd of creepy courtiers parts as Han and Chewie are brought into 
the throne room, and other guards drag Luke up the steps.

LUKE
Han!

HAN
Luke!

LUKE
Are you all right?

HAN
Fine. Together again, huh?

LUKE
Wouldn't miss it.

HAN
How are we doing?

LUKE
The same as always.

HAN
That bad, huh? Where's Leia?

Luke looks to Leia.

LEIA
I'm here.

Threepio is standing behind the grotesque gangster as he strokes Leia 
like a pet cat. Several of the guards, including Lando, bring Luke from 
the other side of the room. Boba is standing behind Jabba.

Threepio steps forward and translates for the captives.

THREEPIO
Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed 
that you are to be terminated immediately.

HAN
Good, I hate long waits.

THREEPIO
You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of 
Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.

HAN	 (to Luke)
Doesn't sound so bad.

THREEPIO
In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as 
you are slowly digested over a thousand years.

HAN
On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?

Chewie barks his agreement.

LUKE
You should have bargained, Jabba. That's the last mistake you'll ever 
make.

Jabba cackles evilly at this.

As the guards drag the prisoners from the throne room, a loud cheer 
rises from the crowd. Leia and Chewie exchange concerned looks, but 
Luke Skywalker, Jedi warrior, cannot suppress a smile.

23   EXT TATOOINE SEA - SKIFF

Jabba's huge SAIL BARGE moves above the desert surface accompanied by 
two smaller Skiffs. One of the skiffs glides close, revealing Luke, 
Han, and Chewie -- all in bonds -- surrounded by guards, one of whom is 
Lando in disguise.

HAN
I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a 
big light blur.

LUKE
There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.

HAN
You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.

LUKE
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.

HAN
Oh... great!

24   INT BARGE OBSERVATION DECK

Jabba the Hutt rides like a sultan in the massive antigravity ship. His 
entire retinue is with him, drinking, eating, and having a good time. 
Leia is watching her friends in the skiff when the chain attached to 
her neck is pulled tight and Jabba tugs the scantily clad princess to 
him.

JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
Soon you will learn to appreciate me.

Threepio wanders among the Sail Barge aliens, bumping into a smaller 
droid serving drinks, spilling them all over the place. The stubby 
droid lets out an angry series of beeps and whistles.

THREEPIO
Oh, I'm terribly sor... Artoo! What are you doing here?

Artoo beeps a quick reply.

THREEPIO
Well, I can see you're serving drinks, but this place is dangerous. 
They're going to execute Master Luke and, if we're not careful, us too!

Artoo whistles a singsong response.

THREEPIO
Hmm.  I wish I had your confidence.

25   EXT SARLACC PIT 

The convoy moves up over a huge sand pit. The Sail Barge stops to one 
side of the depression, as does the escort skiff. But the prisoner's 
skiff moves out directly over the center and hovers. At the bottom of 
the deep cone of sand is a repulsive, mucous-lined hole, surrounded by 
thousands of needle-sharp teeth. This is the SARLACC. A plank is 
extended from the edge of the prisoner's skiff. Guards release Luke's 
bonds and shove him out onto the plank above the Sarlacc's mouth.

26   EXT SAIL BARGE OBSERVATION DECK

Jabba and Leia are now by the rail, watching. Threepio leans forward 
and the slobbering villain mumbles something to him. As Threepio steps 
up to a comlink, Jabba raises his arm and the motley array of 
intergalactic pirates fall silent. Threepio's voice is amplified across 
loudspeakers.

THREEPIO
Victims of the almighty Sarlacc: His Excellency hopes that you will die 
honorably. But should any of you wish to beg for mercy, the great Jabba 
the Hutt will now listen to your pleas.

27   EXT SKIFF

Han steps forward arrogantly and begins to speak.

HAN
Threepio, you tell that slimy piece of... worm-ridden filth he'll get 
no such pleasure from us. Right?

Chewie growls his agreement.

LUKE
Jabba! This is your last chance. Free us or die.

Lando moves unobtrusively along the skiff as Luke shoots a quick look 
of conspiracy to him.

28   INT SAIL BARGE OBSERVATION DECK

The assembled monsters rock with mocking laughter as Artoo zips 
unnoticed up the ramp to the upper deck. Jabba's laughter subsides as 
he speaks into the comlink.

JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
Move him into position.

Jabba makes a thumbs-down gesture. Leia looks worried.

29   EXT BARGE - UPPER DECK

Artoo appears from below and zips over to the rail facing the pit. 
Below, in the skiff, Luke is prodded by a guard to the edge of the 
plank over the gaping Sarlacc. Luke looks up at Artoo, then gives a 
jaunty salute: the signal the little droid has been waiting for. A flap 
opens in Artoo's domed head.

JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
Put him in.

30   EXT SKIFF - PLANK

Luke is prodded and jumps off the plank to the cheers of the 
bloodthirsty spectators. But, before anyone can even perceive what is 
happening, he spins around and grabs the end of the plank by his 
fingertips. The plank bends wildly from his weight and catapults him 
skyward. In midair he does a complete flip and drops down on the end of 
the plank in the same spot he just vacated, but facing the skiff. He 
casually extends an open palm and -- his lightsaber, which Artoo has 
sent arcing toward him, drops into his hand.

With samurai speed, Luke ignites it and attacks the guard who prodded 
him off the plank, sending the hapless monster screaming overboard. The 
other guards swarm toward Luke. He wades into them, lightsaber 
flashing. Lando struggles with another guard at the back of the skiff.

31   EXT SARLACC PIT

A bewildered guard lands in the soft, sandy slope of the pit, and 
begins sliding. He claws desperately as a Sarlacc tentacle grabs him 
and pulls him screaming into the viscous mouth.

32   INT SAIL BARGE

Jabba watches this and explodes in rage. He barks commands, and the 
guards around him rush off to do his bidding. The scuzzy creatures 
watching the action from the window are in an uproar.

33   EXT SKIFF 

Luke knocks another guard off the skiff and into the waiting mouth of 
the Sarlacc. He starts to untie Chewie's bonds.

LUKE
Easy, Chewie.

At that moment, the deck gunmen on the barge unleash a series of blasts 
from a big cannon on the upper deck. Lando is tossed from the deck of 
the rocking skiff. He manages to grab a rope, and dangles desperately 
above the Sarlacc pit.

LANDO
Whoa! Whoa! Help!

34   EXT UPPER DECK - SAIL BARGE

With two swift strides, the dangerous Boba Fett ignites his rocket 
pack, leaps into the air, and flies from the barge down to the skiff.

35   EXT SKIFF

Boba lands on the skiff and starts to aim his laser gun at Luke, who 
has freed Han and Chewie from their bonds. But before Boba can fire, 
the young Jedi spins on him, lightsaber sweeping, and hacks the bounty 
hunter's gun in half.

Immediately, the skiff takes another direct hit from the barge's deck 
gun. Shards of skiff deck fly. Chewie and Han are thrown against the 
rail.

HAN
Chewie, you okay? Where is he?

The Wookiee is wounded and he howls in pain.

HAN
I'm okay, pal.

For a moment, Luke is distracted, and in that moment, Boba fires a 
cable out of his armored sleeve. Instantly, Luke is wrapped in a strong 
cable, his arms pinned against his side, his sword arm free only from 
the wrist down.  Luke bends his wrist so the lightsaber points straight 
up to reach the wire lasso and cuts through. Luke shrugs away the cable 
and stands free.

Another blast from the Barge's deck gun hits near Boba and he is 
knocked unconscious to the deck, next to where Lando is hanging.

LANDO
Han! Chewie?

HAN
Lando!

Luke is a little shaken but remains standing as a fusillade brackets 
him. The second skiff, loaded with guards firing their weapons, moves 
in on Luke fast. Luke leaps toward the incoming second skiff. The young 
Jedi leaps into the middle of the second skiff and begins decimating 
the guards from their midst.

Chewie, wounded, tries to lift himself as he barks directions to Han, 
guiding him toward a spear which has been dropped by one of the guards. 
Han searches the deck as Chewie barks directions; finally he grabs hold 
of the spear.

Boba Fett, badly shaken, rises from the deck. He looks over at the 
other skiff, where Luke is whipping a mass of guards. Boba raises his 
arm, and aims his lethal appendage.

Chewie barks desperately at Han.

HAN
Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?

The space pirate turns around blindly, and the long spear in his hand 
whacks squarely in the middle of Boba's rocket pack.

The impact of the swing causes the rocket pack to ignite. Boba blasts 
off, flying over the second skiff like a missile, smashing against the 
side of the huge Sail Barge and sliding away into the pit. He screams 
as his armored body makes its last flight past Lando and directly into 
the mucous mouth of the Sarlacc. The Sarlacc burps. Chewie growls a 
weak congratulations to Han.

36   INT SAIL BARGE

Leia turns from the spectacle outside, leaps onto Jabba's throne, and 
throws the chain that enslaves her over his head around his bulbous 
neck. Then she dives off the other side of the throne, pulling the 
chain violently in her grasp. Jabba's flaccid neck contracts beneath 
the tightening chain. His huge eyes bulge from their sockets and his 
scum-coated tongue flops out. The Exalted Hutt's huge tail spasms 
through its death throes and then slams down into final stillness. Leia 
struggles to free herself of her bondage.

37   EXT SKIFF

Luke continues to destroy the aliens on the guards' skiff, as Han 
extends his spear downward to Lando, who is still dangling precariously 
from a rope on the prisoner's skiff.

HAN
Lando, grab it!

LANDO
Lower it!

HAN
I'm trying!

A major hit from the barge deck gun knocks the skiff on its side. Han 
and almost everything else on board slides overboard. The rope breaks, 
and Lando falls to the side of the Sarlacc pit. Luckily, Han's foot 
catches on the skiff railing and he dangles above Lando and the pit. 
The wounded Wookiee holds onto the skiff for dear life as another hit 
from the deck gun rocks the skiff violently.

HAN
Whoa! Whoa! Grab me, Chewie! I'm slipping.

Chewie grabs hold of Han's feet, holding him upside down, as Han 
extends the spear toward Lando, who is clutching to the side of the 
pit.

HAN
Grab it! L--Lando. Grab!

Luke finishes off the last guard on the second skiff. He sees the deck 
gun blasting away at his helpless companions. Luke leaps from the 
skiff, across a chasm of air, to the sheer metallic side of the Sail 
Barge. Barely able to get a fingerhold, he begins a painful climb up 
the hull, when suddenly an ax smashes through a window an inch from his 
head. With Jedi agility, Luke grasps the wrist holding the ax and yanks 
the helpless guard through the broken window and into the deadly pit.

The injured Chewie is reaching over the rail for the dangling Han, who 
is in turn blindly reaching down toward the desperate Lando. The Baron 
has stopped his slippage down the sandy slope of the Sarlacc pit by 
lying very still. Every time he tries to reach for Han, the loose sand 
moves him closer to his final reward.

HAN
Grab it! Almost... You almost got it!

Another blast hits the front of the tilted skiff, causing Lando to let 
go of the spear.

LANDO
Hold it! Whoa!

Again Han extends the spear toward Lando.

HAN
Gently now. All... all right. Now easy, easy. Hold me, Chewie.

Lando screams. One of the Sarlacc's tentacles has wrapped tightly 
around his ankle, dragging him down the side of the pit.

HAN
Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.

LANDO
No, wait! I thought you were blind!

HAN
It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.

LANDO
All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!

Han adjusts his aim as Lando lowers his head, and the fuzzy-eyed pirate 
fires at the tentacle. Direct hit. The tentacle releases Lando, and 
Chewie starts to pull them on board the skiff.

HAN
Chewie, Pull us up! Come on! Okay... up, Chewie, up!

38   EXT UPPER DECK

The deck gunners have Chewie and the desperate dangling human chain in 
their gun sights when something up on deck commands their attention: 
Luke, standing before them like a pirate king, ignites his lightsaber. 
The deck gunners have barely reached for their pistols before the young 
Jedi has demolished them. Immediately, Luke turns to see two more 
gunners (who have been uncovering a giant gun at the end of the barge) 
racing for him, firing their laser pistols.

39   INT SAIL BARGE - OBSERVATION DECK

Leia is struggling against her chains in desperation as Artoo zips 
through the tumult of confused monsters to the rescue; the stubby 
little droid extends a small laser gun and blasts the chain apart.

LEIA
Come on. We gotta get out of here quick.

Artoo and Leia race for the exit, passing Threepio, who is kicking and 
screaming as Salacious Crumb, the reptilian monkey- monster picks out 
one of the golden droid's eyes.

THREEPIO
Not my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! You beast!

Artoo zips over and zaps Salacious, sending him skyward with a scream, 
crashing into the rafters as Artoo, Leia, and Threepio (with his eye 
dangling from a wire) hurry off.

40   EXT UPPER DECK - SAIL BARGE

Luke is warding off laser blasts with his lightsaber, surrounded by 
guards and fighting like a demon. Leia emerges onto the deck as Luke 
turns to face another guard.

LUKE	 (to Leia)
Get the gun! Point it at the deck!

Leia turns toward the barge cannon, climbs on the platform, and swivels 
the gun around.

LUKE
Point it at the deck!

A laser blast hits Luke's mechanical hand and he bends over in pain, 
but manages to swing his lightsaber upward and take out the last of the 
guards. He looks at the wounded hand, which reveals the mechanism. He 
flexes the hand; it still works.

Near the rail of the upper deck, Artoo and Threepio steady themselves 
as Threepio gets ready to jump. Artoo beeps wildly.

THREEPIO
Artoo, where are we going? I couldn't possibly jump.

Artoo butts the golden droid over the edge and steps off himself, 
tumbling toward the sand.

Luke runs along the empty deck toward Leia and the barge gun, which she 
has brought around to point down at the deck.

LUKE
Come on!

Luke has hold on one of the rigging ropes from the mast. He gathers 
Leia in his other arm and kicks the trigger of the deck gun. The gun 
explodes into the deck as Luke and Leia swing out toward the skiff.

41   EXT SKIFF  

Han leans panting against the rail as Chewie helps Lando onto the deck. 
Luke and Leia land on the skiff with flair.

LUKE
Let's go! And don't forget the droids.

LANDO
We're on our way.

The Sail Barge is exploding in stages in the distance. Half of the huge 
craft is on fire.

42   EXT SAND DUNE

Threepio's legs stick straight up from the dune where he landed. Next 
to it, Artoo's periscope is the only thing above the sand. The skiff 
floats above them and two large electromagnets dangle down on a wire. 
With a loud CLANG, both droids are pulled 
from the sand.

43   EXT DUNE SEA

The little skiff skips around the burning Sail Barge, which continues 
its chain of explosions. As the skiff sails off across the desert, the 
barge settles to the sand and disappears in one final conflagration.

44   EXT DUNE SEA - LANDING AREA

A ferocious sandstorm blocks our view. Then, through the ROAR, we HEAR 
THE VOICES of our heroes. They emerge slowly from the veil of sand, 
pressing on against the wind. First come Artoo and Threepio, followed 
by Leia guiding Han, then Luke and Lando come into view, each 
supporting one side of the towering Chewbacca, who hobbles from his 
wound.

Soon, they can make out some large vague shapes in the blowing sand. It 
is the Millennium Falcon and, parked beside it, Luke's trusty X-wing 
and a two-seated Y-wing. They must shout to be heard.

HAN
I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!

LEIA
That's all any of us can see.

HAN	 (blinking)
Then I guess I'm getting better.

As soon as the group huddles under the bulk of the Falcon, the wind 
dies down to something more describable as a severe weather condition. 
Threepio hits a switch, and the gang-plank lowers with a HUM.

HAN 	(turning to Luke)
I've got to hand it to you, kid, you were pretty good out there.

LUKE	 (shrugging it off)
I had a lot of help. Think nothing of it.

HAN
No, I'm thinking a lot about it. That carbon freeze was the closest 
thing to dead there is. And it wasn't just sleepin'. It was a big wide 
awake nothing!

Luke nods, as Chewie growls affectionately at the young Jedi warrior, 
mussing his hair like a proud uncle. And Leia warmly hugs him.

LUKE 	(moving to his ship)
I'll see you back at the fleet.

HAN
Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?

LUKE
I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.

Luke and Artoo take off in their spacecraft.

HAN		
(looking dubiously at Lando, obviously remembering his friend's 
betrayal and subsequent aide)
Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.

LANDO
Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the 
rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.

LEIA
He means "You're welcome."

LANDO
Come on, let's get off this miserable dust ball.

44A  EXT SPACE ABOVE TATOOINE 

The desolate yellow planet fills the screen, Luke's X-wing appears and 
peels off to the left. A moment later, the FALCON appears as a dot and 
grows huge, to roar directly over the CAMERA.

45   INT X-WING - COCKPIT

Luke is at the controls, with Artoo attached behind him outside the 
canopy. Luke speaks into his comlink to the others, in the MILLENNIUM 
FALCON.

LUKE
I'll meet you back at the fleet.

LEIA	 (over comlink)
Hurry. The Alliance should be assembled by now.

LUKE
I will.

HAN	 (over comlink)
Hey, Luke, thanks. Thanks for comin' after me. Now I owe you one.

A message from Artoo appears on the small monitor screen in front of 
Luke. He smiles at the monitor and speaks to Artoo, as he pulls a black 
glove on to cover his wounded mechanical hand.

LUKE
That's right, Artoo. We're going to the Dagobah system. I have a 
promise to keep... to an old friend.

46   EXT SPACE - DEATH STAR AND ENDOR

A Super Star Destroyer and several ships of the Imperial Fleet rest in 
space above the half-completed Death Star and its green neighbor, 
Endor. Four squads of TIE fighters escort an Imperial shuttle toward 
the Death Star.

47   INT DEATH STAR - CORRIDOR TO DOCKING BAY

Lord Vader strides down the hallway, accompanied by a very nervous 
Death Star commander.

48   INT DOCKING BAY - DEATH STAR

Thousands of Imperial troops in tight formation fill the mammoth 
docking bay. Vader and the officer walk to the landing platform, where 
the shuttle is coming to rest.

The shuttle's ramp lowers and the Emperor's Royal Guards come out and 
create a lethal perimeter. The assembled troops move to rigid attention 
with a momentous SNAP.

Then, in the huge SILENCE which follows, the EMPEROR appears. He is a 
rather small, shriveled old man. His bent frame slowly makes its way 
down the ramp with the aid of a gnarled cane. He wears a hooded cloak 
similar to the one Ben wears, except that it is black. The Emperor's 
face is shrouded and difficult to see, except for his piercing yellow 
eyes. Commander Jerjerrod and Darth Vader kneel to him. The Supreme 
Ruler of the galaxy beckons to the Dark Lord.

EMPEROR	 (to Vader)
Rise, my friend.

Vader rises and falls in next to the Emperor as he slowly makes his way 
along the rows of troops. Jerjerrod and the other commanders stay 
kneeling until the Supreme Ruler and Vader, followed by several 
Imperial dignitaries, pass by; only then do they join in the 
procession.

VADER
The Death Star will be completed on schedule.

EMPEROR
You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue 
your search for young Skywalker.

VADER
Yes, my Master.

EMPEROR
Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, 
you must bring him
before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the 
dark side of the
Force.

VADER
As you wish.

EMPEROR
Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.

He laughs to himself as they pass along the vast line of Imperial 
troops.

49   EXT YODA'S HOUSE - DAGOBAH

Once again, Artoo finds himself waiting around in the damp environs of 
the swamp planet, and he's none too happy about it. He beeps 
disconsolately to himself and turns to look at Yoda's cottage. Warm 
yellow light escapes the oddly shaped windows to fight the gloom.

50   INT YODA'S HOUSE

The tip of a walking stick taps hesitantly across the earthen floor of 
the cottage. Our view travels up the stick to the small green hand that 
clutches it, and then to the familiar face of YODA, THE JEDI MASTER. 
His manner is frail, and his voice, though cheerful, seems weaker.

YODA
Hmm. That face you make. Look I so old to young eyes?

Luke is sitting in a corner of the cramped space and, indeed, his look 
has been woeful. Caught, he tries to hide it.

LUKE
No... of course not.

YODA	 (tickled, chuckles)
I do, yes, I do!  Sick have I become. Old and weak. 
(Points a crooked finger)
When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not. Hmm?

Yoda chuckles at this, coughs, and hobbles over toward his bed.

YODA
Soon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned it, I have.

Yoda sits himself on his bed, with great effort.

LUKE
Master Yoda, you can't die.

YODA
Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me 
and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the 
Force.

LUKE
But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.

YODA
No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.

Yoda sighs, and lies back on his bed.

LUKE
Then I am a Jedi?

YODA	 (shakes his head)
Ohhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then, 
only then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will.

Luke is in agony. He is silent for a long moment, screwing up his 
courage. Finally he is able to ask.

LUKE
Master Yoda... is Darth Vader my father?

Yoda's eyes are full of weariness and compassion. An odd, sad smile 
creases his face. He turns painfully on his side, away from Luke.

YODA
Mmm... rest I need. Yes... rest.

Luke watches him, each moment an eternity.

LUKE
Yoda, I must know.

YODA
Your father he is.

Luke reacts as if cut.

YODA
Told you, did he?

LUKE
Yes.

A new look of concern crosses Yoda's face.  He closes his eyes.

YODA
Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...

LUKE
Unfortunate that I know the truth?

Yoda opens his eyes again and studies the youth.

YODA		 (gathering all his strength)
No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that incomplete was your 
training. Not
ready for the burden were you.

LUKE
Well, I'm sorry.

YODA
Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger, 
fear, aggression.
The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever 
will it dominate your
destiny.

He beckons the young Jedi closer to him.

YODA
Luke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor, 
or suffer your father's fate, you will. Luke, when gone am I
(cough),
the last of the Jedi will you be. Luke, the Force runs strong in your 
family. Pass on what you have learned, Luke... 
(with great effort)
There is...another...Sky...Sky...walker.

He catches his breath. A shiver runs through the ancient green 
creature, and he dies. Luke stares at his dead master as he disappears 
in front of his eyes.

51   EXT DAGOBAH SWAMP - X-WING 

Luke wanders back to where his ship is sitting. Artoo beeps a greeting, 
but is ignored by his depressed master. Luke kneels down, begins to 
help Artoo with the ship, then stops and shakes his head dejectedly.

LUKE
I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.

BEN	 (OS)
Yoda will always be with you.

Luke looks up to see the shimmering image of BEN KENOBI.

LUKE
Obi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me?

The ghost of Ben Kenobi approaches him through the swamp.

LUKE
You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.

BEN
You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be 
Anakin Skywalker
and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your 
father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a 
certain point of view.

LUKE	 (turning away, derisive)
A certain point of view!

BEN
Luke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend 
greatly on our own
point of view.

Luke is unresponsive. Ben studies him in silence for a moment.

BEN
I don't blame you for being angry. If I was wrong in what I did, it 
certainly wouldn't have been for the first time. You see, what happened 
to your father was my fault.

Ben pauses sadly.

BEN
Anakin was a good friend.

Luke turns with interest at this. As Ben speaks, Luke settles on a 
stump, mesmerized. Artoo comes over to offer his comforting presence.

BEN
When I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was 
amazed how strongly the Force was with him. I took it upon myself to 
train him as a Jedi. I thought that I could instruct him just as well 
as Yoda. I was wrong. My pride has had terrible consequences for the 
galaxy.

Luke is entranced.

LUKE
There's still good in him.

BEN
I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be 
done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.

LUKE
I can't do it, Ben.

BEN
You cannot escape your destiny.

LUKE
I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.

BEN
Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience 
was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value 
of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you 
could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been 
prepared.

LUKE
But I had to help my friends.

BEN	 (grinning at Luke's indignation)
And did you help them? It was they who had to save you. You achieved 
little by rushing back prematurely, I fear.

LUKE	 (with sadness)
I found out Darth Vader was my father.

BEN
To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side 
- the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest 
door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what 
he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're 
no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, 
you must face Darth Vader again!

LUKE
I can't kill my own father.

BEN
Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.

LUKE
Yoda spoke of another.

BEN
The other he spoke of is your twin sister.

LUKE
But I have no sister.

BEN
Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your 
father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were 
to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the 
reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.

LUKE
Leia! Leia's my sister.

BEN
Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They 
do you credit.
But they could be made to serve the Emperor.

Luke looks into the distance, trying to comprehend all this.

BEN	 (continuing his narrative)
When your father left, he didn't know your mother was pregnant. Your 
mother and I knew he would find out eventually, but we wanted to keep 
you both as safe as possible, for as long as possible.  So I took you 
to live with my brother Owen on Tatooine... and your mother took Leia 
to live as the daughter of Senator Organa, on Alderaan.

Luke turns, and settles near Ben to hear the tale.

BEN	 (attempting to give solace with his words)
The Organa household was high-born and politically quite powerful in 
that system. Leia became a princess by virtue of lineage... no one knew 
she'd been adopted, of course. But it was a title without real power, 
since Alderaan had long been a democracy.  Even so, the family 
continued to be politically powerful, and Leia, following in her foster 
father's path, became a senator as well.  That's not all she became, of 
course... she became the leader of her cell in the Alliance against the 
corrupt Empire. And because she had diplomatic immunity, she was a 
vital link for getting information to the Rebel cause.  That's what she 
was doing when her path crossed yours... for her foster parents had 
always told her to contact me on Tatooine, if her troubles became 
desperate.

Luke is overwhelmed by the truth, and is suddenly protective of his 
sister.

LUKE
But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.

BEN
She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, 
Luke... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your 
family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy 
Vader!

52   EXT SPACE - REBEL FLEET

The vast Rebel Fleet stretches as far as the eye can see. Overhead a 
dozen small Corellian battleships fly in formation. Fighters and 
battlecruisers surround the largest of the Rebel Star Cruisers, the 
HEADQUARTERS FRIGATE.

53   INT HEADQUARTERS FRIGATE - MAIN BRIEFING ROOM

Hundreds of Rebel commanders of all races and forms are assembled in 
the WAR ROOM. WEDGE is among them. In the center of the room is a 
holographic model depicting the half-completed Imperial Death Star, the 
nearby Moon of Endor, and the protecting deflector shield.

MON MOTHMA, the leader of the Alliance, enters the room. She is a stern 
but beautiful woman in her fifties. Conferring with her are several 
military leaders, including GENERAL MADINE and ADMIRAL ACKBAR (a 
salmon-colored Mon Calamari). Lando moves through the crowd until he 
finds Han and Chewie, standing next to Leia and the two droids.

Han peers at Lando's new insignia on his chest, and is amused.

HAN
Well, look at you, a general, huh?

 LANDO
 Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the 
battle of Taanab.

HAN	 (sarcastic)
Well, don't look at me, pal. I just said you were a fair pilot. I 
didn't know they were
lookin' for somebody to lead this crazy attack.

LANDO	 (smiling)
I'm surprised they didn't ask you to do it.

HAN
Well, who says they didn't.  But I ain't crazy. You're the respectable 
one, remember?

Mon Mothma signals for attention, and the room falls silent.

MON MOTHMA
The Emperor has made a critical error and the time for our attack has 
come.

This causes a stir. Mon Mothma turns to a holographic model of the 
Death Star, the Endor moon and the protecting deflector shield in the 
center of the room.

MON MOTHMA
The data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoints the exact location 
of the Emperor's new battle station. We also know that the weapon 
systems of this Death Star are not yet operational. With the Imperial 
Fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us, it is 
relatively unprotected. But most important of all, we've learned that 
the Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the 
construction of this Death Star.

A volley of spirited chatter erupts from the crowd. Han turns to Leia 
as Chewie barks his amazement.

MON MOTHMA	 (cont)
Many Bothans died to bring us this information. Admiral Ackbar, please.

Admiral Ackbar steps forward and points to the Death Star's force field 
and the Moon of Endor.

ACKBAR
You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest Moon of Endor. 
Although the weapon
systems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death Star does 
have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield, 
which is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield 
must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield 
is down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly 
into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor.

There's a concerned murmur.

ACKBAR	 (cont)
General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack

Han turns to Lando with a look of respect.

HAN
Good luck.

Lando nods his thanks.

HAN
You're gonna need it.

ACKBAR
General Madine.

Madine moves center stage.

GENERAL MADINE
We have stolen a small Imperial shuttle. Disguised as a cargo ship, and 
using a secret
Imperial code, a strike team will land on the moon and deactivate the 
shield generator.

The assembly begins to mumble among themselves.

THREEPIO
Sounds dangerous.

LEIA	 (to Han)
I wonder who they found to pull that off.

GENERAL MADINE
General Solo, is your strike team assembled?

Leia, startled, looks up at Han, surprise changing to admiration.

HAN
Uh, my team's ready. I don't have a command crew for the shuttle.

Chewbacca raises his hairy paw and volunteers.  Han looks up at him.

HAN
Well, it's gonna be rough, pal. I didn't want to speak for you.

Chewie waves that off with a huge GROWL.

HAN	 (smiles)
That's one.

LEIA
Uh, General... count me in.

VOICE	 (OS)
I'm with you, too!

They turn in that direction and peer into the crowd as there are more 
cheers. The commanders part, and there at the back stands Luke. Han and 
Leia are surprised and delighted.

Leia moves to Luke and embraces him warmly. She senses a change in him 
and looks into his eyes questioningly.

LEIA
 What is it?

LUKE	 (hesitant)
Ask me again sometime.

Han, Chewie, and Lando crowd around Luke as the assembly breaks up.

HAN
Luke.

LUKE
Hi, Han... Chewie.

Artoo beeps a singsong observation to a worried Threepio.

 THREEPIO
"Exciting" is hardly the word I would use.

54   INT HEADQUARTERS FRIGATE - MAIN DOCKING BAY

The Millennium Falcon rests beyond the stolen IMPERIAL SHUTTLE, which 
looks anomalous among all the Rebel ships in the vast docking bay. 
Chewie barks a final farewell to Lando and leads Artoo and Threepio up 
the shuttle, crowded now with the Rebel strike team loading weapons and 
supplies. Lando turns to face Han. Luke and Leia have said their good-
byes and start up the ramp.

HAN
Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the 
help you can get. She's
the fastest ship in the fleet.

LANDO
All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take 
good care of her.
She-she won't get a scratch. All right?

HAN	 (looks at him warmly)
Right. I got your promise now. Not a scratch.

LANDO
Look, would you get going, you pirate.

Han and Lando pause, then exchange salutes.

LANDO
Good luck.

HAN
You, too.

Han goes up the ramp. Lando watches him go and then slowly turns away.

55   INT IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - COCKPIT

Luke is working on a back control panel as Han comes in and takes the 
pilot's seat. Chewie, in the seat next to him, is trying to figure out 
all the Imperial controls.

HAN
You got her warmed?

LUKE
Yeah, she's comin' up.

Chewie growls a complaint.

HAN
No. I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed 
her, Chewie.

Leia comes in from the hold and takes her seat near Luke.

Chewie barks and hits some switches. Han's glance has stuck on 
something out the window: the Millennium Falcon. Leia nudges him 
gently.

LEIA
Hey, are you awake?

HAN
Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.

Chewie, hearing this, stops his activity and looks longingly out at the 
Falcon, too. Leia puts a hand on Han's shoulder.

LEIA	 (softly)
Come on, General, let's move.

Han snaps back to life.

HAN
Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, 
everybody?

LUKE
All set.

THREEPIO
Here we go again.

HAN
All right, hang on.

56   EXT SPACE - THE REBEL FLEET

The stolen Imperial shuttle leaves the main docking bay of the 
Headquarters Frigate, lowers its wings into flight position, and zooms 
off into space.

57   INT EMPEROR'S THRONE ROOM

The converted control room is dimly lit, except for a pool of light at 
the far end. There the Emperor sits in an elaborate control chair 
before a large window which looks out across the half-completed Death 
Star to the giant green moon of Endor.

Darth Vader, standing with other members of the Imperial council, 
cautiously approaches his master. The ruler's back is to Vader. After 
several tense moments, the Emperor's chair rotates around to face him.

VADER
What is thy bidding, my Master?

EMPEROR
Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until 
called for.

VADER
What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?

EMPEROR
It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young 
Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go 
out to the command ship and await my orders.

VADER
Yes, my Master.

Vader bows, then turns and exits the throne room as the Emperor walks 
toward the waiting council members.

58   EXT SPACE - DEATH STAR - MOON

There is a great deal of Imperial traffic in the area as construction 
proceeds on the Death Star. Transports, TIE fighters, and a few Star 
Destroyers move about. Now the huge Super Star Destroyer announces 
itself with a low roar and soon fills the frame.

59   INT STOLEN IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - COCKPIT

Han looks back at Luke and Leia as Chewie flips several switches. 
Through the viewscreen, the Death Star and the huge Super Star 
Destroyer can be seen.

HAN
If they don't go for this, we're gonna have to get outta here pretty 
quick, Chewie.

Chewie growls his agreement.

CONTROLLER	 (over radio)
We have you on our screen now. Please identify.

HAN
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shield.

CONTROLLER	 (over radio)
Shuttle Tydirium, transmit the clearance code for shield passage.

HAN
Transmission commencing.

Leia and Chewbacca listen tensely as the sound of a high speed 
transmission begins.

LEIA
Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.

HAN
It'll work. It'll work.

Chewie whines nervously. Luke stares at the Huge Super Star Destroyer 
that looms ever larger before them.

LUKE
Vader's on that ship.

HAN
Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep 
your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep 
your distance.

Chewie barks a question.

HAN
I don't know.  Fly casual.

LUKE
I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.

HAN
It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.

Chewie barks his worries as the Super Star Destroyer grows larger out 
the window.

60   INT VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE

Lord Vader stands, back to us, staring out a window at the Death Star. 
Now, some vibration felt only by him causes him to turn. After a moment 
of stillness, he walks down the row of controllers to where ADMIRAL 
PIETT is leaning over the tracking screen of the controller we've seen 
earlier. Piett straightens at Vader's approach.

VADER
Where is that shuttle going?

PIETT	 (into comlink)
Shuttle Tydirium, what is your cargo and destination?

PILOT VOICE    (HAN)   (filtered)
Parts and technical crew for the forest moon.

The Bridge Commander looks to Vader for a reaction.

VADER
Do they have a code clearance?

PIETT
It's an older code, sir, but it checks out. I was about to clear them.

Vader looks upward, as he senses Luke's presence.

PIETT
Shall I hold them?

VADER
No. Leave them to me. I will deal with them myself.

PIETT	 (surprised)
As you wish, my lord.
(to controller)
Carry on.

Piett nods at controller, who switches on his comlink.

61   INT STOLEN IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - COCKPIT

The group waits tensely.

HAN
They're not goin' for it, Chewie.

present course.

Everyone breaths a sigh of relief. Everyone but Luke, who looks 
worried. Chewie barks.

HAN
Okay! I told you it was gonna work. No problem.

62   EXT SPACE - STOLEN IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - ENDOR

The stolen Imperial shuttle moves off toward the green Sanctuary Moon.

63   EXT FOREST LANDING SITE - ENDOR

The stolen Imperial shuttle sits in a clearing of the moon's dark, 
primeval forest, dwarfed by the ancient towering trees.

On an adjacent hill, the helmeted Rebel contingent makes its way up a 
steep trail. Leia and Han are slightly ahead of Chewie and Luke. The 
troops of the strike-team squad follow, with Artoo and Threepio 
bringing up the rear. Artoo beeps.

Up ahead, Chewie and Leia reach a crest in the hill and drop suddenly 
to the ground, signaling the rest of the group to stop. Han and Luke 
crawl up to take a look.

THREEPIO
Oh, I told you it was dangerous here.

THEIR POV. Not far below them, two IMPERIAL SCOUTS are wandering 
through bushes in the valley below. Their two ROCKET BIKES are parked 
nearby.

LEIA
Shall we try and go around?

HAN
It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.

Leia motions for the squad to stay put, then she, Han, Luke and Chewie 
start quietly down.

64   EXT FOREST CLEARING - CAMPSITE

The four friends make their way to the edge of the clearing not far 
from the two Imperial scouts.

HAN
Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.

LUKE
Quietly, there might be more of them out there.

HAN	 (grins)
Hey... it's me.

Han and Chewie turn and start through the bushes toward the scouts. 
Luke and Leia exchange smiles.

Han sneaks up behind one of the scouts, steps on a twig and the scout 
whirls, knocking Han into a tree. The scout shouts for his companion.

SCOUT #1
Go for help! Go!

The second scout jumps on his speeder bike and takes off, but Chewie 
gets off a shot on his crossbow laser weapon, causing the scout to 
crash into a tree. Han and Scout #1 are in a rousing fistfight.

LUKE	 (sarcastic)
Great. Come on.

Luke starts for the scuffle, followed by Leia with her laser pistol 
drawn. As they run through the bushes, Leia stops and points to where 
two more scouts are sitting on their speeder bikes, with an unoccupied 
bike parked nearby.

LEIA
Over there! Two more of them!

LUKE
I see them. Wait, Leia!

But Leia doesn't hear him and races for the remaining speeder bike. She 
starts it up and takes off as Luke jumps on the bike behind her.

LUKE	 (pointing to the controls)
Quick! Jam their comlink. Center switch!

Luke and Leia speed into the dense foliage in hot pursuit, barely 
avoiding two huge trees.

HAN
Hey, wait! Ahhh!

He flips the remaining scout to the ground.

65   EXT FOREST - THE BIKE CHASE

The two fleeing Imperial scouts have a good lead as Luke and Leia 
pursue through the giant trees at 200 miles an hour, the fire from 
their bike's laser cannon hitting harmlessly near the moving targets.

LUKE
Move closer!

Leia guns it, closing the gap, as the two scouts recklessly veer 
through a narrow gap in the trees. One of the bikes SCRAPES a tree, 
slowing the scout.

LUKE
Get alongside that one!

Leia pulls her speeder bike up so close to the scout's bike that their 
steering vanes SCRAPE noisily. Luke leaps from his bike to the back of 
the scout's, grabs the Imperial warrior around the neck, and flips him 
off the bike, into a thick tree trunk. Luke gains control of the bike 
and follows Leia, who has pulled ahead. They tear off after the 
remaining scout.

LUKE
Get him!

The speeding chase passes TWO MORE IMPERIAL SCOUTS. These two swing 
into pursuit, chasing Luke and Leia, firing away with their laser 
cannon. The two Rebels look behind them just as Luke's bike takes a 
glancing hit.

LUKE	 (indicating the one ahead)
Keep on that one! I'll take these two!

With Leia shooting ahead, Luke suddenly slams his steering vanes into 
the braking mode. Luke's bike is a blur to the two pursuing scouts as 
they zip by him on either side. Luke slams his bike into forward and 
starts firing away, having switched places with his pursuers in a 
manner of seconds. Luke's aim is good and one scout's bike is blasted 
out of control. It explodes against a tree trunk.

The scout's cohort takes one glance back at the flash and shifts into 
turbo drive, going even faster. Luke keeps on his tail.

FAR AHEAD, Leia and the first scout are doing a highspeed slalom 
through the death-dealing trunks. Now Leia aims her bike skyward and 
rises out of sight.

The scout turns in confusion, unable to see his pursuer. Suddenly, Leia 
dives down upon him from above, cannon blasting. The scout's bike takes 
a glancing hit.

Leia moves in alongside him. The scout eyes her beside him, reaches 
down, and pulls out a handgun. Before Leia can react, the scout has 
blasted her bike, sending it out of control. Leia dives off as her bike 
explodes against a tree. The happy scout looks back at the explosion. 
But when he turns forward again, he is on a collision course with a 
giant fallen tree. He hits his brakes to no avail and disappears in a 
conflagration.

ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST: Luke and the last remaining scout continue 
their weaving chase through the trees. Now Luke moves up close. The 
scout responds by slamming his bike into Luke's. A fallen tree forms a 
bridge across their path. The scout zips under. Luke goes over the top 
and crashes his bike down on the scout's. Both riders look ahead - a 
wide trunk looms directly in Luke's path, but the scout's bike beside 
him makes it almost impossible for him to avoid it. Luke banks with all 
his might, leaning almost horizontal over the scout's bike, and is able 
to make it by, just clipping the tree. When he straightens, he and the 
scout discover that their two bikes have locked front vanes and are 
moving as one.

Another big tree looms in Luke's path. He reacts instinctively and 
dives off his bike. The two bikes come apart a second before Luke's 
explodes against a tree. The scout sweeps out and circles back to find 
Luke.

Luke rises from the undergrowth as the scout bears down on him and 
opens fire with his laser cannon. Luke ignites his laser sword and 
begins deflecting the bolts. The scout's bike keeps coming and it 
appears that in a second it will cut Luke in half. At the last instant, 
Luke steps aside and chops off the bike's control vanes with one mighty 
slash. The scout's bike begins to shudder, then, pitching and rolling, 
it rises up to slam directly into a tree in a giant ball of fire.

66   EXT SCOUT CAMPSITE - FOREST

Han, Chewie, and the droids, along with the rest of the squad, wait 
anxiously in the clearing. Artoo's radar screen sticks out of his domed 
head and revolves, scanning the forest. He beeps.

THREEPIO
Oh, General Solo, somebody's coming. Oh!

Han, Chewie, and the rest of the squad raise their weapons.

Luke steps out of the foliage to find the weapons trained on him. He's 
too tired to care. He plops himself down on a boulder and looks around.

HAN
Luke! Where's Leia?

LUKE	 (concerned)
What? She didn't come back?

HAN
I thought she was with you.

LUKE
We got separated.

Luke and Han exchange a silent, grim look. Luke gets up wearily.

LUKE
Hey, we better go look for her.

Han nods, and signals to a Rebel officer.

HAN
Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.

LUKE
Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.

Luke, Chewie, Han, and the droids move off in one direction as the 
squad proceeds in another.

THREEPIO
Don't worry, Master Luke.  We know what to do.

They move off into the woods.

THREEPIO	 (to Artoo)
And you said it was pretty here. Ugh!

67   EXT FOREST CLEARING - LEIA'S CRASH SITE

A strange little furry face with huge black eyes comes slowly into 
view. The creature is an EWOK, by the name of WICKET. He seems somewhat 
puzzled, and prods Leia with a spear. The princess groans; this 
frightens the stubby ball of fuzz and he prods her again. Leia sits up 
and stares at the three-foot-high Ewok. She tries to figure out where 
she is and what has happened. Her clothes are torn; she's bruised and 
disheveled.

The Ewok jumps up and grabs a four-foot-long spear, which he holds in a 
defensive position. Leia watches him as he circles warily and begins 
poking her with the sharp point of the spear.

LEIA
Cut it out!

She stands up, and the Ewok quickly backs away.

LEIA
I'm not gonna hurt you.

Leia looks around at the dense forest, and at the charred remains of 
her speeder bike, then sits down, with a sigh, on a fallen log.

LEIA
Well, looks like I'm stuck here. Trouble is, I don't know where here 
is.

She puts her head in her hands to rub away some of the soreness from 
her fall. She looks over at the watchful little Ewok and pats the log 
beside her.

LEIA
Well, maybe you can help me. Come on, sit down.

Wicket holds his spear up warily and growls at her like a puppy. Leia 
pats the log again.

LEIA
I promise I won't hurt you. Now come here.

More growls and squeaks from the little bear creature.

LEIA
All right. You want something to eat?

She takes a scrap of food out of her pocket and offers it to him. 
Wicket takes a step backward, then cocks his head and moves cautiously 
toward Leia, chattering in his squeaky Ewok language.

LEIA
That's right. Come on. Hmmm?

Sniffing the food curiously, the Ewok comes toward Leia and sits on the 
log beside her. She takes off her helmet, and the little creature jumps 
back, startled again. He runs along the log, pointing his spear at her 
and chattering a blue streak. Leia holds out the helmet to him.

LEIA
Look, it's a hat. It's not gonna hurt you. Look. You're a jittery 
little thing, aren't you?

Reassured, Wicket lowers his spear and climbs back on the log, coming 
to investigate the helmet. Suddenly his ears perk up and he begins to 
sniff the air. He looks around warily, whispering some Ewokese warning 
to Leia.

LEIA
What is it?

Suddenly a laser bolt comes out of the foliage and explodes on the log 
next to Leia. Leia and Wicket both roll backwards off the log, hiding 
behind it. Leia holds her own laser gun ready, while Wicket disappears 
underneath the log. Another shot, and still no sight of anyone in the 
forest. Then Leia senses something and turns to find a large IMPERIAL 
SCOUT standing over her with his weapon pointed at her head. He reaches 
out his hand for her weapon.

SCOUT #l
Freeze!  Come on, get up!

She hands the weapon over, as a second scout emerges from the foliage 
in front of the log.

SCOUT #1
Go get your ride and take her back to base.

SCOUT #2
Yes, sir.

The second scout starts toward his bike, as Wicket, crouched under the 
log, extends his spear and hits the first scout on the leg. The scout 
jumps and lets out an exclamation, and looks down at Wicket, puzzled. 
Leia grabs a branch and knocks him out. She dives for his laser pistol, 
and the second scout, now on his bike, takes off. Leia fires away and 
hits the escaping bike, causing it to crash into the first scout's 
bike, which flies end over end and explodes. The forest is quiet once 
more. Wicket pokes his fuzzy head up from behind the log and regards 
Leia withÊnew respect. He mumbles his awe. Leia hurries over, looking 
around all the time, and motions the chubby little creature into the 
dense foliage.

LEIA
Come on, let's get outta here.

As they move into the foliage, Wicket takes the lead. He shrieks and 
tugs at Leia to follow him.

68   INT DEATH STAR - CORRIDOR TO EMPEROR'S TOWER

Darth Vader walks down the corridor to the Emperor's Tower and private 
elevator. The Emperor's private guard steps in Vader's path.

GUARD
Halt! The Emperor does not wish to be disturbed at the moment.

VADER        
(raising his gloved hand to the two guards and choking them with the 
Force)
The Emperor will see me, now!

GUARD
(repeating Vader's command)
The Emperor will see you, now.

69   INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM

Two red Imperial Guards stand watch at the elevator as the door opens 
to reveal Vader. Vader enters the eerie, foreboding throne room. It 
appears to be empty. His footsteps echo as he approaches the throne. He 
waits, absolutely still. The Emperor sits with his back to the Dark 
Lord.

EMPEROR
I told you to remain on the command ship.

VADER
A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.

EMPEROR	 (no surprise)
Yes, I know.

VADER	 (after a beat)
My son is with them.

EMPEROR	 (very cool)
Are you sure?

VADER
I have felt him, my Master.

EMPEROR
Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are 
clear, Lord
Vader.

Vader knows what is being asked.

VADER
They are clear, my Master.

EMPEROR
Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them.

VADER	 (skeptical)
He will come to me?

EMPEROR
I have foreseen it. His compassion for you will be his undoing. He will 
come to you and
then you will bring him before me.

VADER	 (bows)
As you wish.

The Dark Lord strides out of the throne room.

70   EXT FOREST CLEARING - LEIA'S CRASH SITE

Han, Luke, Chewie, and the two droids are spread out as they move 
through the heavy foliage near the clearing where we last saw Leia. 
Luke finds Leia's helmet, picks it up with an expression of concern.

HAN	 (OS)
Luke! Luke!

Luke runs with the helmet to where Han has found the charred wreckage 
of a speeder bike in the grass.

THREEPIO
Oh, Master Luke.

LUKE
There's two more wrecked speeders back there. And I found this.

He tosses the helmet to Han.

THREEPIO
I'm afraid that Artoo's sensors can find no trace of Princess Leia.

HAN	 (gravely)
I hope she's alright.

Chewbacca growls, sniffing the air, then, with a bark, pushes off 
through the foliage.

                              HAN
What, Chewie? What? Chewie!

The others rush to keep up with the giant Wookiee. As he scoots along, 
Artoo whistles nervously.

71   EXT FOREST - DENSE FOLIAGE

The group has reached a break in the undergrowth. Chewie walks up to a 
tall stake planted in the ground. There is a dead animal hanging from 
it.

HAN
Hey, I don't get it.

The rest of the group joins the Wookiee around the stake.

HAN	 (cont)
Nah, it's just a dead animal, Chewie.

Chewie can't resist. He reaches toward the meat.

LUKE
Chewie, wa-wait!  Don't!

Too late. The Wookiee has already pulled the animal from the stake. 
SPROOING! The group finds itself hanging upside down in an Ewok net, 
suspended high above the clearing. Artoo lets out a wild series of 
beeps and whistles, and Chewie howls his regret. Their bodies are a 
jumble in the net. Han removes a Wookiee paw from his mouth.

HAN
Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach.

LUKE
Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this 
thing. 
(trying to free an arm) 
Han, can you reach my lightsaber?

HAN
Yeah, sure.

Artoo is at the bottommost point in the net. He extends his cutting 
appendage and begins slicing at the net. Han is trying to squeeze an 
arm past Threepio to get at Luke's lightsaber. The net continues to 
spin.

THREEPIO
Artoo, I'm not sure that's such a good idea. It's a very long dro-o-
op!!

Artoo has cut through and the entire group tumbles out of the net, 
crashing to the ground. As they regain their senses and sit up, they 
realize they are surrounded by dozens of Ewoks, each brandishing a long 
spear.

HAN
Wha--?  Hey!  Point that thing someplace else.

Han pushes the spear wielded by TEEBO out of his face and a second Ewok 
warrior comes up to argue with Teebo. The spear returns to Han's face. 
He grabs it angrily and starts to go for his laser pistol.

HAN
Hey!

LUKE
Han, don't. It'll be all right.

The Ewoks swarm through them and confiscate their weapons. Luke lets 
them take his lightsaber. Chewie growls at the furry critters.

LUKE
Chewie, give 'em your crossbow.

Artoo and Threepio are just untangling themselves. Threepio gets free 
of the net and sits up, rattled.

THREEPIO
Oh, my head. Oh, my goodness!

When the Ewoks see Threepio, they let out a gasp and chatter among 
themselves. Threepio speaks to them in their native tongue. The Ewok 
nearest him drops his spear and prostrates himself before the droid. In 
a moment, all the Ewoks have followed suit. Chewie lets out a puzzled 
bark. Han and Luke regard the bowed creatures in wonder. The Ewoks 
begin to chant at Threepio.

LUKE
Do you understand anything they're saying?

THREEPIO
Oh, yes, Master Luke!  Remember that I am fluent in over six million 
forms of
communication.

HAN
What are you telling them?

THREEPIO
Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive 
dialect.  But
I do believe they think I am some sort of god.

Chewbacca and Artoo think that's very funny. Han and Luke exchange 
"what next?" looks.

HAN
Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?

THREEPIO
I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.

HAN
Proper?!

THREEPIO
It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.

Han moves toward Threepio threateningly.

HAN
Why, you--

Several Ewoks' spears are thrust in Han's face at the affront to their 
god. The Ewoks move in to protect their god and Han is surrounded by a 
menacing circle of spears, all aimed at him. He holds up his hands 
placatingly.

HAN
My mistake. He's an old friend of mine.

72   EXT FOREST - SERIES OF SHOTS

A procession of Ewoks winds through the ever-darkening forest. Their 
prisoners - Han, Luke, Chewie, and Artoo - are tied to long poles and 
wrapped in vines, cocoonlike.

Each pole is carried on the shoulders of several Ewoks. Behind the 
captives, Threepio is carried on a litter, like a king, by the 
remaining creatures.

73   EXT FOREST WALKWAY - MOON FOREST

The procession moves along a shaky, narrow, wooden walkway, high in the 
giant trees. It stops at the end of the walkway, which drops off into 
nothingness. On the other side of the abyss is a village of mud huts 
and rickety walkways, attached to the giant trees. The lead Ewok takes 
hold of a long vine and swings across to the village square; the other 
Ewoks follow suit.

74   EXT EWOK VILLAGE SQUARE

The procession winds its way into the village square. Mother Ewoks 
gather their babies up and scurry into their huts at the sight of the 
newcomers. The group stops before the largest hut.

Han, Luke, Chewie, and Artoo are still bound to their poles. Han is 
placed on a spit above what looks like a barbecue pit and the others 
are leaned against a tree nearby. Threepio's litter/throne is gently 
placed near the pit. He watches with rapt fascination. Han, Luke, and 
Chewie are less than fascinated.

HAN
I have a really bad feeling about this.

Chewie growls his concern.

Suddenly all activity stops as LOGRAY, the tribal Medicine Man, comes 
out of the big hut. He examines the captives carefully, goes to join 
Threepio, whose throne has been placed on an elevated platform. A 
larger, gray-haired Ewok, CHIEF CHIRPA, is examining Luke's lightsaber 
with great curiosity.

Logray speaks to Threepio and the assemblage of fuzzy Ewoks, pointing 
to the prisoners tied to the stakes. The Ewoks begin filling the pit 
under Han with firewood.

HAN
What did he say?

THREEPIO
I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the 
main course at a
banquet in my honor.

The drums start beating, and all the furry heads turn to the large hut. 
Leia emerges, wearing an animal-skin dress. She sees what's happening 
at the same moment the prisoners see her.

HAN and LUKE
Leia!

As she moves toward them, the Ewoks block her way with raised spears.

LEIA
Oh!

THREEPIO
Your Royal Highness.

Artoo and Chewie chime in with their welcome. Leia looks at the 
assembled Ewoks and sighs.

LEIA
But these are my friends. Threepio, tell them they must be set free.

Threepio talks to Chirpa and Logray, who listen and shake their heads 
negatively. The Medicine Man gestures toward the prisoners and barks 
some orders. Several Ewoks jump up and pile more wood on the barbecue 
with vigor. Leia trades frantic looks with Luke and Han .

HAN
Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.

LUKE
Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry 
and use your magic.

THREEPIO
But Master Luke, what magic? I couldn't possibly --

LUKE
Just tell them.

Threepio speaks to the Ewoks. The Ewoks are disturbed. Logray steps 
forward and challenges Threepio. Luke closes his eyes and begins to 
concentrate.

THREEPIO
You see, Master Luke; they didn't believe me. Just...

Now the litter/throne, with Threepio sitting upon it, rises from the 
ground. At first Threepio doesn't notice and keeps talking.

THREEPIO
... as I said they wouldn't. Wha-wha-what's happening! Oh! Oh, dear! 
Oh!

The Ewoks fall back in terror from the floating throne. Now Threepio 
begins to spin as though he were on a revolving stool, with Threepio 
calling out in total panic at his situation.

THREEPIO
Put me down! He-e-elp! Master Luke! Artoo! Somebody, somebody, help! 
Master Luke, Artoo! Artoo, quickly! Do something, somebody! Oh! Ohhh!

Chief Chirpa yells orders to the cowering Ewoks. They rush up and 
release the bound prisoners. Luke and Han enfold Leia in a group 
embrace. Luke notices the spinning Threepio, with Artoo beeping up at 
him, and slowly lowers the golden droid and the throne to the ground. 
Logray orders the little droid cut down. Artoo crashes to the ground. 
When the Ewoks set him upright, the little droid is fighting mad. Artoo 
beeps a blue streak at the nearest Ewok, and begins pursuing him, 
finally getting close enough to zap him with an electric charge. The 
Ewok jumps two feet in the air and runs away, screaming. A small group 
of Ewoks surround the giant Wookiee, scratching their heads and 
marveling at his height.

THREEPIO
Oh, oh, oh, oh! Thank goodness.

LUKE
Thanks, Threepio.

THREEPIO	 (still shaken)
I...I never knew I had it in me.

75   INT CHIEF'S HUT - COUNCIL OF ELDERS

A glowing fire dances in the center of the spartan, low-ceilinged room, 
creating a kaleidoscope of shadows on the walls. Along one side, a 
group of ten Ewok elders flank Chief Chirpa, who sits on his throne. 
The Rebels sit along the walls of the hut, with Threepio between the 
two groups and Wicket and Teebo off to one side.

Threepio is in the midst of a long, animated speech in the Ewok's 
squeaky native tongue. The Ewoks listen carefully and occasionally 
murmur comments to each other. Threepio points several times at the 
Rebel group and pantomimes a short history of the Galactic Civil War, 
mimicking the explosion and rocket sounds, imitating Imperial walkers. 
Throughout the long account, certain familiar names are distinguishable 
in English: Princess Leia, Artoo, Darth Vader, Death Star, Jedi, Obi-
Wan Kenobi. Artoo begins beeping excitedly at Threepio.

THREEPIO
Yes, Artoo. I was just coming to that.

Threepio continues with: Millennium Falcon, Cloud City, Vader, Han 
Solo, carbonite, Sarlacc, bringing the history up to the present time.

At the end of it, the Chief, Logray, and the elders confer, then nod in 
agreement. The Chief stands and makes a pronouncement.

The drums begin to sound, and all the Ewoks stand with a great cheer 
and screeches.

HAN
What's going on?

LEIA
I don't know.

Luke has been sharing the joy with smiling visage, but now something 
passes like a dark cloud through his consciousness. The others do not 
notice.

THREEPIO
Wonderful! We are now a part of the tribe.

Several of the little teddy bears run up and hug the Rebels.

HAN
Just what I always wanted.

Chewbacca is being enthusiastically embraced by an Ewok, while Wicket 
clings to Han's leg.

HAN	 (chuckles)
Well, short help is better than no help at all, Chewie. 
(to Wicket) 
Thank you. Okay.

THREEPIO
He says the scouts are going to show us the quickest way to the shield 
generator.

Chewie barks. Luke has drifted to the back of the hut. Now he wanders 
outside into the moonlight. Leia notices and follows.

HAN
Good. How far is it? Ask him. We need some fresh supplies, too. And try 
and get our weapons back.

Han pulls Threepio back as he keeps trying to translate.

HAN	 (cont)
And hurry up, will ya? I haven't got all day.

76   EXT EWOK VILLAGE - NIGHT

The walkway is deserted now. The windows of the little huts glow and 
flicker from the fires inside. The sounds of the forest fill the soft 
night air. Luke has wandered away from the Chief's hut and stands 
staring up at the Death Star. Leia finds him like that.

LEIA
Luke, what's wrong?

Luke turns and looks at her a long moment.

LUKE
Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?

LEIA
Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.

LUKE
What do you remember?

LEIA
Just...images, really. Feelings.

LUKE
Tell me.

LEIA
(a little surprised at his insistence)
She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.
(looks up)
Why are you asking me all this?

He looks away.

LUKE
I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.

LEIA
Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?

LUKE
Vader is here...now, on this moon.

LEIA	 (alarmed)
How do you know?

LUKE
I felt his presence. He's come for me. He can feel when I'm near. 
That's why I have to go.
(facing her)
As long as I stay, I'm endangering the group and our mission here.
(beat)
I have to face him.

Leia is distraught, confused.

LEIA
Why?

Luke moves close and his manner is gentle. And very calm.

LUKE
He's my father.

LEIA
Your father?

LUKE
There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I 
don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance.

Leia is very disturbed by this. She moves away, as if to deny it.

LEIA
Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and 
could never have.

LUKE
You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to 
use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has 
it...I have it...and...my sister has it.

Leia stares into his eyes. What she sees there frightens her. But she 
doesn't draw away. She begins to understand.

LUKE
Yes. It's you Leia.

LEIA
I know. Somehow...I've always known.

LUKE
Then you know why I have to face him.

LEIA
No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave 
this place. I wish I could go with you.

LUKE
No, you don't. You've always been strong.

LEIA
But, why must you confront him?

LUKE
Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to 
the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I 
have to try.

They hold each other close and look at each other, brother and sister.

Leia holds back her tears as Luke slowly lets her go and moves away. He 
disappears onto the walkway that leads out of the village. Leia, bathed 
in moonlight, watches him go as Han comes out of the Chief's hut and 
comes over to her. Leia is crying, her body trembling. He realizes only 
now that she is crying.

HAN
Hey, what's goin' on?

Leia attempts to stifle her sobs and wipes her eyes.

LEIA
Nothing. I - just want to be alone for a little while.

HAN	 (angry)
Nothing?  Come on, tell me.  What's goin' on?

She looks up at him, struggling to control herself.

LEIA
I...I can't tell you.

HAN	 (loses his temper)
Did you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell?

LEIA
I...

HAN
Ahhh...

He starts to walk away, exasperated, then stops and walks back to her.

HAN
I'm sorry.

LEIA
Hold me.

Han gathers her tightly in his protective embrace.

77   EXT FOREST - IMPERIAL LANDING PLATFORM

An Imperial shuttle floats down from the Death Star and lands 
gracefully on the huge platform.

Now, an Imperial walker approaches the platform from the darkness of 
the forest. The whole outpost - platform, walkers, military - looks 
particularly offensive in the midst of this verdant beauty.

78   EXT IMPERIAL LANDING PLATFORM - LOWER DECK

Darth Vader walks down the ramp of the shuttle onto the platform, into 
an elevator, and appears on a ramp on a lower level. He walks toward 
another ramp exit and is met by two troopers and a commander with Luke, 
in binders, at their center. The young Jedi gazes at Vader with 
complete calm.

COMMANDER
This is a Rebel that surrendered to us. Although he denies it, I 
believe there may be more of them, and I request permission to conduct 
a further search of the area.

The commander extends his hand, revealing Luke's lightsaber.

COMMANDER
He was armed only with this.

Vader looks at Luke, turns away and faces the commander, taking the 
lightsaber from the commander's hand.

VADER
Good work, Commander. Leave us. Conduct your search and bring his 
companions to me.

COMMANDER
Yes, my Lord.

The officer and troops withdraw. Vader and Luke are left standing alone 
in the oddly tranquil beauty of the place. The sounds of the forest 
filter in upon them.

VADER
The Emperor has been expecting you.

LUKE
I know, father.

VADER
So, you have accepted the truth.

LURE
I've accepted the truth that you were once Anakin Skywalker, my father.

VADER	 (turning to face him)
That name no longer has any meaning for me.

LUKE
It is the name of your true self. You've only forgotten. I know there 
is good in you. The Emperor hasn't driven it from you fully. That is 
why you couldn't destroy me. That's why you won't bring me to your 
Emperor now.

Vader looks down from Luke to the lightsaber in his own black- gloved 
hand. He seems to ponder Luke's words.

VADER	 (indicating lightsaber)
I see you have constructed a new lightsaber.

Vader ignites the lightsaber and holds it to examine its humming, 
brilliant blade.

VADER
Your skills are complete. Indeed, you are powerful, as the Emperor has 
foreseen.

They stand for a moment, the Vader extinguishes the lightsaber.

LUKE
Come with me.

VADER
Obi-Wan once thought as you do.

Luke steps close to Vader, then stops. Vader is still.

VADER
You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.

LUKE
I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.

VADER
If that is your destiny.

LUKE
Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict 
within you. Let go
of your hate.

VADER
It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature 
of the Force. He is
your master now.

Vader signals to some distant stormtroopers. He and Luke stand staring 
at one another for a long moment.

LUKE
Then my father is truly dead.

79   EXT ENDOR - RIDGE OVERLOOKING SHIELD GENERATOR

Han, Leia, Chewbacca, the droids, Wicket, and another Ewok scout, 
PAPLOO, hide on a ridge overlooking the massive Imperial shield 
generator. At the base of the generator is an Imperial landing 
platform. Leia studies the installation.

LEIA
The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that 
landing platform. This
isn't gonna be easy.

HAN
Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily 
guarded than this.

Wicket and Paploo are chattering away in Ewok language. They speak to 
Threepio.

LEIA
What's he saying?

THREEPIO
He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.

80   EXT SPACE - REBEL FLEET

The vast fleet hangs in space near a blue planet. A giant Rebel Star 
Cruiser is up at the front, but now the Millennium Flacon roars up to a 
spot ahead of it, tiny in comparison.

81   INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Lando is in the pilot seat. His alien copilot, NIEN NUNB, takes some 
getting used to in the familiar environs of the Falcon's cockpit. Lando 
speaks into his comlink.

LANDO
Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for.

ACKBAR 	(VO)
Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates.

Lando turns to his weird copilot.

LANDO
Don't worry, my friends are down there. They'll have that shield down 
on time...
(to himself) 
or this'll be the shortest offensive of all time.

The copilot flips some switches and grunts an alien comment.

ACKBAR	 (VO)
All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark.

LANDO
All right. Stand by.

He pulls a lever, and the stars outside begin to streak.

82   EXT SPACE - REBEL FLEET

We are treated to an awesome sight: first the Millennium Falcon, then 
Ackbar's Star Cruiser, then, in large segments, the huge fleet ROARS 
INTO HYPERSPACE. And disappears.

83   EXT ENDOR - RIDGE OVERLOOKING CONTROL BUNKER

Han, Leia, Chewie, the droids, and their two Ewok guides, Wicket and 
Paploo, have reunited with the Rebel strike squad. The entire group is 
spread through the thick undergrowth. Below them is the BUNKER that 
leads into the generator. Four Imperial scouts, their speeder bikes 
parked nearby, keep watch over the bunker entrance. Chewie growls an 
observation, and Paploo chatters away to Han in Ewok language.

HAN
Back door, huh? Good idea.

Wicket and Paploo continue their Ewok conversation.

HAN	 (cont)
It's only a few guards. This shouldn't be too much trouble.

LEIA
Well, it only takes one to sound the alarm.

HAN	 (with self-confident grin)
Then we'll do it real quiet-like.

Threepio explains what is going on to Wicket and Paploo. The Ewoks 
chatter a moment between themselves. Then Paploo jumps up and scampers 
into the underbrush.

Threepio asks Wicket where Paploo went and is given a short reply.

THREEPIO
Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!

LEIA
Quiet.

THREEPIO
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.

LEIA
Oh, no.

84   EXT BUNKER - ENTRANCE

Paploo has slipped out of the undergrowth near where the Imperial 
scouts are lounging. He silently swings his furry ball of a body onto 
one of the scout's speeder bikes and begins flipping switches at 
random. Suddenly, the bike's engine fires up with a tremendous ROAR. 
Paploo grins and continues flipping switches. The scouts leap up in 
surprise.

85   EXT RIDGE

Han, Leia and company watch in distress. Chewie barks.

HAN 	(sighs)
There goes our surprise attack.

86   EXT BUNKER

The Imperial scouts race toward Paploo just as his speeder zooms into 
motion. Paploo hangs on by his paws and shoots away into the forest.

SCOUT
Look! Over there! Stop him!

Three of the Imperial scouts jump on their rocket bikes and speed away 
in pursuit. The fourth watches them go from his post at the door.

87   EXT RIDGE

Han, Leia, and Chewie exchange delighted looks.

HAN
Not bad for a little furball. There's only one left. You stay here. 
We'll take care of this.

Han and the Wookiee nod at each other and slip down toward the bunker. 
Threepio moves to stand next to Wicket and Artoo.

THREEPIO
I have decided that we shall stay here.

88   EXT FOREST

Paploo sails through the trees, more lucky than in control. It's scary, 
but he loves it. When the Imperial scouts pull within sight behind him 
and begin firing laser bolts, he decides he's had enough. As he rounds 
a tree, out of their sight, Paploo grabs a vine and swings up into the 
trees. A moment later, the scouts tear under him in pursuit of the 
still-flying, unoccupied bike.

89   EXT BUNKER

Han sneaks up behind the remaining Imperial scout, taps him on the 
shoulder and lets the scout chase him behind the bunker into the arms 
of the waiting Rebel strike team. Han returns to the front, and taps 
out a pattern on the bunker door's control panel. Everyone stands out 
of sight, police-style, as the door opens. Han and Leia peek inside. No 
sign of life. The group enters the bunker silently, leaving one lookout 
behind.

90   INT DEATH STAR - EMPEROR'S THRONE ROOM

The elevator opens. Vader and Luke enter the room alone. They walk 
across the dark space to stand before the throne, father and son side 
by side beneath the gaze of the Emperor. Vader bows to his Master.

EMPEROR
Welcome, young Skywalker. I have been expecting you.

Luke peers at the hooded figure defiantly. The Emperor then looks down 
at Luke's binders.

EMPEROR
You no longer need those.

The Emperor motions ever so slightly with his finger and Luke's binders 
fall away, clattering to the floor. Luke looks down at his own hands, 
free now to reach out and grab the Emperor's neck. He does nothing.

EMPEROR
Guards, leave us.

The red-cloaked guards turn and disappear behind the elevator.

EMPEROR	 (to Luke)
I'm looking forward to completing your training. In time you will call 
me Master.

LUKE
You're gravely mistaken. You won't convert me as you did my father.

The Emperor gets down from his throne and walks up very close to Luke. 
The Emperor looks into his eyes and, for the first time, Luke can 
perceive the evil visage within the hood.

EMPEROR
Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are 
mistaken...about a great many things.

VADER
His lightsaber.

Vader extends a gloved hand toward the Emperor, revealing Luke's 
lightsaber. The Emperor takes it.

EMPEROR
Ah, yes, a Jedi's weapon. Much like your father's. By now you must know 
your father can never be turned from the dark side. So will it be with 
you.

LUKE
You're wrong. Soon I'll be dead...and you with me.

The Emperor laughs.

EMPEROR
Perhaps you refer to the imminent attack of your Rebel fleet.

Luke looks up sharply.

EMPEROR
Yes...I assure you we are quite safe from your friends here.

Vader looks at Luke.

LUKE
Your overconfidence is your weakness.

EMPEROR
Your faith in your friends is yours.

VADER
It is pointless to resist, my son.

The Emperor turns to face Luke.

EMPEROR	 (angry)
Everything that has transpired has done so according to my design. 
(indicates Endor)
Your friends up there on the Sanctuary Moon...

Luke reacts. The Emperor notes it.

EMPEROR	 (cont)
...are walking into a trap. As is your Rebel fleet! It was I who 
allowed the Alliance to know the location of the shield generator. It 
is quite safe from your pitiful little band. An entire legion of my 
best troops awaits them.

Luke's look darts from the Emperor to Vader and, finally, to the sword 
in the Emperor's hand.

EMPEROR
Oh...I'm afraid the deflector shield will be quite operational when 
your friends arrive.

91   INT BUNKER - MAIN CONTROL ROOM

Han, Leia, Chewie, and the Rebel strike team storm through a door and 
enter the main control room, taking all of the personnel prisoner.

HAN
All right! Up! Move! Come on! Quickly! Quickly, Chewie.

The Rebel troops herd the generator controllers away from their panels. 
Leia glances at one of the screens on the control panel.

LEIA
Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.

HAN
Charges!  Come on, come on!

Outside, Threepio watches nervously in the bushes as several more 
controllers and stormtroopers run into the bunker, leaving guards at 
the door.

THREEPIO	 (to Wicket)
Oh, my! They'll be captured!

Wicket chatters in Ewok language, and then takes off full steam into 
the forest.

THREEPIO
Wa-wait! Wait, come back! Artoo, stay with me.

Inside the bunker, Han looks up from setting charges as an Imperial 
commander enters.

COMMANDER
Freeze! You Rebel scum.

Han and Leia spin, to find dozens of Imperial weapons trained on them 
and their cohorts. A poised force of Imperial troops surround them. 
Even more pour into the room, roughly disarming the Rebel contingent. 
Han, Leia, and Chewie exchange looks. They're helpless.

92   EXT SPACE - ENDOR, DEATH STAR, REBEL FLEET

The Death Star and its Sanctuary Moon hang distant in space as the 
Rebel fleet comes out of hyperspace with an awesome roar. The 
Millennium Falcon and several Rebel fighters are at the front as the 
space armada bears down on its target.

93   INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Lando flips switches, checks his screen, and speaks into the radio.

LANDO
All wings report in.

WEDGE
Red Leader standing by.

GRAY LEADER
Gray Leader standing by.

GREEN LEADER
Green Leader standing by.

WEDGE
Lock S-foils in attack positions.

94   INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE

From the bridge of the Rebel Headquarters Frigate, Admiral Ackbar 
watches the fighters massing outside his viewscreen.

ACKBAR
May the Force be with us.

95   INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Lando looks worriedly at his alien copilot, Nien Nunb, who points to 
the control panel and talks to Lando.

LANDO
We've got to be able to get some kind of a reading on that shield, up 
or down. Well, how
could they be jamming us if they don't know if we're coming.

Lando shoots a concerned look out at the approaching Death Star as the 
implications of what he's just said sink in. He hits a switch on his 
comlink.

LANDO
Break off the attack! The shield is still up.

RED LEADER	 (VO)
I get no reading. Are you sure?

LANDO
Pull up! All craft pull up!

The Falcon turns hard to the left. Out the window the stars and the 
Death Star move off right.

96   EXT SPACE - DEATH STAR SHIELD

The Falcon and the fighters of Red Squad veer off desperately to avoid 
the unseen wall.

97   INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE

Alarms are screaming and lights flashing as the huge ship changes 
course abruptly. Other ships in the fleet shoot by outside as the 
armada tries to halt its forward momentum.

ACKBAR
Take evasive action! Green Group, stick close to holding sector MV-7.

A Mon Calamari controller turns away from his screen and calls out to 
Ackbar, quite excited. The Admiral rushes over to the controller.

CONTROLLER
Admiral, we have enemy ships in sector 47.

On the screen can be seen the moon, Death Star, and the massive 
Imperial fleet. Ackbar moves to the comlink.

ACKBAR
It's a trap!

LANDO	 (over comlink)
Fighters coming in.

There is much excitement on the bridge as the attack begins.

The Millennium Falcon and several squads of Rebel fighters head into an 
armada of TIE fighters. The sky explodes as a fierce dogfight ensues in 
and around the giant Rebel cruisers.

REBEL PILOT
There's too many of them!

LANDO
Accelerate to attack speed! Draw their fire away from the cruisers.

WEDGE
Copy, Gold Leader.

The battle continues around the giant cruisers.

98   INT DEATH STAR - EMPEROR'S THRONE ROOM

Through the round window behind the Emperor's throne can be seen the 
distant flashes of the space battle in progress.

EMPEROR
Come, boy. See for yourself.

The Emperor is sitting in his throne, with Vader standing at his side. 
Luke moves to look through a small section of the window.

EMPEROR
From here you will witness the final destruction of the Alliance, and 
the end of your insignificant Rebellion.

Luke is in torment. He glances at his lightsaber sitting on the armrest 
of the throne. The Emperor watches him and smiles, touches the 
lightsaber.

EMPEROR
You want this, don't you? The hate is swelling in you now. Take your 
Jedi weapon. Use it. I am unarmed. Strike me down with it. Give in to 
your anger. With each passing moment, you make yourself more my 
servant.

Vader watches Luke in his agony.

LUKE
No!

EMPEROR
It is unavoidable. It is your destiny. You, like your father, are now 
mine!

99   EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER

Han, Leia, Chewie, and the rest of the strike team are led out of the 
bunker by their captors. The surrounding area, deserted before, is now 
crowded with two-legged Imperial walkers and hundreds of Imperial 
troops. The situation looks hopeless.

STORMTROOPER
All right, move it! I said move it! Go on!

From the undergrowth beyond the clearing comes a wild series of beeps 
and whistles. 
And --

THREEPIO
Hello! I say, over there! Were you looking for me?

BUNKER COMMANDER
Bring those two down here!

STORMTROOPER
Let's go!

Artoo and Threepio are standing near one of the big trees. As six 
Imperial stormtroopers rush over to take them captive, the two droids 
duck out of sight behind the tree.

THREEPIO
Well, they're on their way. Artoo, are you sure this was a good idea?

STORMTROOPER
Freeze! Don't move!

THREEPIO
We surrender.

The stormtroopers come around the tree and find the two droids waiting 
quietly to be taken. As the Imperial troops move to do that, however, a 
band of Ewoks drops down from above and overpowers them.

THREEPIO
Ohhh! Stand back, Artoo.

In a nearby tree, an Ewok raises a horn to his lips and sounds the EWOK 
ATTACK CALL. All hell breaks loose as hundreds of Ewoks throw their 
fuzzy bodies into the fray against the assembled stormtroopers and 
their awesome two-legged walkers. Biker scouts dart about blasting 
Ewoks, only to be crushed by a volley of rocks tossed by Ewoks from the 
trees above.

In the confusion of the battle, Han and Leia break away and dive for 
the cover of the bunker door as explosions erupt around them. Han goes 
to the bunker door control panel.

LEIA
The code's changed. We need Artoo!

HAN
Here's the terminal.

LEIA	 (into comlink)
Artoo, where are you? We need you at the bunker right away.

Artoo and Threepio are hiding behind a log as the battle ragesaround 
them. Suddenly the stubby little astrodroid lets out a series of 
whistles and shoots off across the battlefield. Threepio, panicked, 
runs after him.

THREEPIO
Going? What do you mean, you're going. But-- but going where, Artoo? 
No, what! Artoo! Oh, this is no time for heroics. Come back!

Biker scouts race around and over the two droids, blasting away at the 
little Ewoks as the furries scurry for cover.

A group of Ewoks have moved a primitive catapult into position. They 
fire off a large boulder that hits one of the walkers. The walker turns 
and heads for the catapult, blasting away with both guns. The Ewoks 
abandon their weapons and flee in all directions. Just as the walker 
moves in to stomp the catapult, Ewoks drop vines restraining two huge 
logs that swing down and smash thewalker's head flat.

A line of Ewoks hang desperately to a vine that is hooked to a walker's 
foot. As the walker moves along, the fuzzy creatures are dragged 
behind.

Two speeder bikes chase Ewoks through the underbrush. As the scouts 
round a tree, they are knocked off their bikes by a vinetied between 
two trees.

100  EXT SPACE

The Falcon and other Rebel fighters are engaged in a ferocious combat 
with Imperial TIE fighters, the battle raging around thecruisers of the 
Rebel armada.

101  INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
Lando is in radio communication with the pilots of the other Rebel 
squads.

LANDO
Watch yourself, Wedge! Three from above!

WEDGE
Red Three, Red Two, pull in!

RED TWO
Got it!

RED THREE
Three of them coming in, twenty degrees!

WEDGE
Cut to the left! I'll take the leader! They're heading for the medical 
frigate.

Lando steers the Falcon through a complete flip, as his crew fires at 
the TIEs from the belly guns.

NAVIGATOR
Pressure's steady.

The copilot Nien Nunb chatters an observation.

LANDO
Only the fighters are attacking.  I wonder what those Star Destroyers 
are waiting for.

102  EXT SPACE - IMPERIAL FLEET  

The giant Imperial Star Destroyer waits silently some distance from the 
battle. The Emperor's huge Super Star Destroyer rests in the middle of 
the fleet.

103  INT SUPER STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE

Admiral Piett and two fleet commanders watch the battle at the huge 
window of the Super Star Destroyer bridge.

COMMANDER
We're in attack position now, sir.

PIETT
Hold here.

COMMANDER
We're not going to attack?

PIETT
I have my orders from the Emperor himself. He has something special 
planned for them. We only need to keep them from escaping.

104  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM

The Emperor, Vader, and a horrified Luke watch the aerial battle 
fireworks out the window and on the viewscreens. Another Rebel ship 
explodes against the protective shield.

EMPEROR
As you can see, my young apprentice, your friends have failed. Now 
witness the firepower of this fully armed and operational battle 
station.
(into comlink)
Fire at will, Commander.

Luke, in shock, looks out across the surface of the Death Star to the 
Rebel fleet beyond.

105  INT DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM

Controllers pull back on several switches. Commander Jerjerrod stands 
over them.

JERJERROD
Fire!

106  INT DEATH STAR - BLAST CHAMBER

A button is pressed, which switches on a panel of lights. A hooded 
Imperial soldier reaches overhead and pulls a lever. A huge beam of 
light emanates from a long shaft. Two stormtroopers stand to one side 
at a control panel.

107  EXT DEATH STAR

The giant laser dish on the completed half of the Death Star begins to 
glow; Then a powerful beams shoots out toward the aerial battle.

108  EXT SPACE - AIR BATTLE

The air is thick with giant ships. In among them, Rebel X-wings 
dogfight with Imperial TIE fighters. Now an enormous Rebel cruiser is 
hit by the Death Star beam and is blown to dust.

The Millennium Falcon roars over CAMERA, followed closely byseveral TIE 
fighters.

109  INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

The ship is buffeted by the tremendous explosion of the Rebel cruiser. 
Lando and his copilot are stunned by the sight of the Death Star 
firepower.

LANDO
That blast came from the Death Star! That thing's operational! 
(into comlink)
Home One, this is Gold Leader.

110  INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE

Ackbar stands amid the confusion on the wide bridge and speaks into the 
comlink.

ACKBAR
We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.

LANDO
You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.

ACKBAR
We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel 
firepower of that magnitude.

LANDO
Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.

111  EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER

Artoo and Threepio make it to the door, as Han and Leia provide cover 
fire.

THREEPIO
We're coming!

HAN
Come on! Come on!

THREEPIO
Oh, Artoo, hurry!

The little droid moves to the terminal and plugs in his computer arm. A 
large explosion hits near Artoo, knocking him head over heels, finally 
landing on his feet. The stubby astrodroid's head is spinning and 
smoldering. Suddenly there is a loud SPROOING and Han and Leia turn 
around to see Artoo with all his compartment doors open, and all of his 
appendages sticking out; water and smoke spurt out of the nozzles in 
his body. Han rushes to the terminal, as Threepio rushes to his wounded 
companion.

THREEPIO
My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?

HAN
Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.

LEIA
I'll cover you.

Ewoks in handmade, primitive hanggliders drop rocks onto the 
stormtroopers, divebombing their deadly adversaries.  One is hit in the 
wing with laser fire and crashes. A walker lumbers forward, shooting 
laser blasts at frantic Ewoks running in all directions.  Two Ewoks are 
struck down by laser blasts.  One tries to awaken his friend, then 
realizes that he is dead.

112  EXT SPACE - DEATH STAR

The Rebel fleet continues to be picked off, from one side by the Death 
Star's deadly beam, from the other by the rampaging Imperial Star 
Destroyers.

113  INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Lando steers the Falcon wildly through an obstacle course of floating 
giants. He's been yelling into the comlink.

LANDO	 (desperately)
Yes! I said closer! Move as close as you can and engage those Star 
Destroyers at point-
blank range.

ACKBAR
At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers.

LANDO
We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might 
just take a few of
them with us.

The Rebel cruisers move very close to the Imperial Star Destroyers and 
begin to blast away at point-blank range. Tiny fighters race across the 
giant surfaces, against a backdrop of laser fire.

The control tower of a Star Destroyer is under attack.

REBEL PILOT
She's gonna blow!

Y-WING PILOT
I'm hit!

The damaged Y-wing plummets toward the Star Destroyer, and crashes into 
the control tower, exploding.

114  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM

Out of the window and on the view screens, the Rebel fleet is being 
decimated in blinding explosions of light and debris. But in here there 
is no sound of battle. The Emperor turns to Luke.

EMPEROR
Your fleet has lost. And your friends on the Endor moon will not 
survive. There is no escape, my young apprentice. The Alliance will 
die...as will your friends.

Luke's eyes are full of rage. Vader watches him.

EMPEROR
Good. I can feel your anger. I am defenseless.  Take your weapon! 
Strike me down with all your hatred, and your journey towards the dark 
side will be complete.

Luke can resist no longer. The lightsaber flies into his hand. He 
ignites it in an instant and swings at the Emperor. Vader's lightsaber 
flashes into view, blocking Luke's blow before it can reach the 
Emperor. The two blades spark at contact. Luke turns to fight his 
father.

115  EXT FOREST

The battle rages on. Stormtroopers fire on Ewoks with sophisticated 
weapons while their furry little adversaries sneak up behind the 
Imperial troopers and bash them over the head with large clubs.

A walker marches through the undergrowth blasting Ewoks as it goes. An 
Ewok warrior gives the signal, and a pile of logs is cut loose. The 
logs tumble under the walker's feet, causing it to slip and slide until 
it finally topples over with a great crash.

A scout bike races past and is lassoed with a heavy vine. The other end 
of the vine is tied to a tree, and the bike swings around in ever-
tightening circles until it runs out of rope and
crashes into the trees with a huge explosion.

Chewie swings on a vine to the roof of one of the walkers. Two Ewoks 
cling to him. They land with a thud on the top of the lurching machine, 
then hang on for dear life. One of the Ewoks peeks through the window.

WALKER PILOT #1
Look!

PILOT #2
Get him off of there!

The walker pilot opens the hatch to see what's going on. He is yanked 
out and tossed overboard before he can scream. The two Ewoks jump into 
the cockpit and knock the second pilot unconscious. The Ewoks are 
thrown violently as the mighty machine careens out of control. Outside, 
Chewie is almost knocked overboard; he sticks his head into the hatch 
with a series of angry barks. The Ewoks are too busy and frightened to 
listen to the Wookiee's complaint. Chewie slips inside the walker.

Chewbacca's walker moves through the forest, firing laser blasts at 
unsuspecting stormtroopers, and destroying other Imperial walkers. The 
Ewoks shout and cheer as the giant machine helps turn the tide of the 
battle in their favor.

116  EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER

Han works furiously at the control panel; wires spark as he attempts to 
hotwire the door. He motions to Leia, who is blasting away at some 
stormtroopers.

HAN
I think I got it. I got it!

The three wires spark as the connection is made. With a LOUD WHOOSH, a 
second blast door crashes down in front of the first.

Han frowns and turns back to the wires again. Leia exchanges shots with 
stormtroopers in the bushes, then suddenly cries out in pain, her 
shoulder hit by a laser blast.

THREEPIO
Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?

HAN
Let's see.

LEIA
It's not bad.

STORMTROOPER	 (OS)
Freeze!

They freeze.

THREEPIO
Oh, dear.

STORMTROOPER
Don't move!

Leia holds her laser gun ready, behind Han, out of view of the two 
stormtroopers moving toward them. Han and Leia's eyes lock; the moment 
seems suspended in time.

HAN
I love you.

Another shared look between them, as she smiles up at Han.

LEIA
I know.

STORMTROOPER
Hands up! Stand up!

Han stands up slowly and turns, revealing the gun in Leia's hand. She 
disposes of the stormtroopers in a flash. As Han turns back toward 
Leia, he looks up to see a giant walker approach and stand before him, 
its deadly weapons aimed right at him.

HAN	 (to Leia)
Stay back.

The hatch on top of the walker opens and Chewie sticks his head out and 
barks triumphantly.

HAN
Chewie!  Get down here!  She's wounded!  No, wait....  I got an idea.

117  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM

Luke and Vader are engaged in a man-to-man duel of lightsabers even 
more vicious then the battle on Bespin. But the young Jedi has grown 
stronger in the interim, and now the advantage shifts to him. Vader is 
forced back, losing his balance, and is knocked down the stairs. Luke 
stands at the top of the stairs, ready to attack.

EMPEROR (laughing)
Good.  Use your aggressive feelings, boy!  Let the hate flow through 
you.

Luke looks momentarily toward the Emperor, then back to Vader, and 
realizes he is using the dark side. He steps back, turns off his 
lightsaber, and relaxes, driving the hate from his being.

VADER
Obi-Wan has taught you well.

LUKE
I will not fight you, father.

Vader walks back up the stairs to Luke.

VADER
You are unwise to lower your defenses.

Vader attacks, forcing Luke on the defensive. The young Jedi leaps in 
an amazing reverse flip up to the safety of the catwalk overhead. Vader 
stands below him.

LUKE
Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the 
conflict.

VADER
There is no conflict.

LUKE
You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe 
you'll destroy me
now.

VADER
You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, 
then you will meet
your destiny.

Vader throws the laser sword and it cuts through the supports holding 
the catwalk, then returns to Vader's hand. Luke tumbles to the ground 
in a shower of sparks and rolls out of sight under the Emperor's 
platform. Vader moves to find him.

EMPEROR	 (laughs)
Good.  Good.

118  EXT SPACE - AIR BATTLE

The two armadas, like their sea-bound ancestors, blast away at each 
other in individual point-blank confrontations. A Star Destroyer 
explodes. The Rebel victor limps away, its back half alive with a 
series of minor explosions. The Rebel cruiser manages to move in next 
to a second Star Destroyer before it explodes completely, taking the 
Imperial Star Destroyer with it. The Falcon and several fighters attack 
one of the larger Imperial ships.

LANDO
Watch out. Squad at .06.

REBEL PILOT
I'm on it, Gold Leader.

WEDGE
Good shot, Red Two.

LANDO
Now...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down.

119  INT BUNKER - CONTROL ROOM

Controllers watch the main viewscreen on which a vague figure of an 
Imperial walker pilot can be seen. There is a great deal of static and 
interference.

HAN/PILOT	 (VO)
It's over, Commander. The Rebels have been routed. They're fleeing into 
the woods. We
need reinforcements to continue the pursuit.

The controllers cheer.

CONTROL ROOM COMMANDER
Send three squads to help. Open the back door.

SECOND COMMANDER
Yes, sir.

120  EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER

As the door to the bunker opens and the Imperial troops rush out, 
they're surprised to find themselves surrounded by Rebels, their 
weapons pointed at them. Ewoks holding bows and arrows appear on the 
roof of the bunker. The Imperial troops throw down their guns
as Han and Chewie rush inside the bunker with explosive charges.

121  INT BUNKER - CONTROL ROOM

Han, Chewie, and several troops rush into the control room and plant 
explosive charges on the control panels and rush out.

HAN
Throw me another charge.

122  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM

Vader stalks the low-ceilinged area on the level below the throne, 
searching for Luke in the semi-darkness, his lightsaber held ready.

VADER
You cannot hide forever, Luke.

LUKE
I will not fight you.

VADER
Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your 
friends. Yes, your
thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially 
for...

Vader stops and senses something. Luke shuts his eyes tightly, in 
anguish.

VADER
Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed 
her, too. Obi-Wan
was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will 
not turn to the dark
side, then perhaps she will.

LUKE
Never-r-r!

Luke ignites his lightsaber and screams in anger, rushing at hisfather 
with a frenzy we have not seen before. Sparks fly as Luke and Vader 
fight in the cramped area. Luke's hatred forces Vader to retreat out of 
the low area and across a bridge overlooking a vast elevator shaft. 
Each stroke of Luke's sword drives his father further toward defeat.

The Dark Lord is knocked to his knees, and as he raises his sword to 
block another onslaught, Luke slashes Vader's right hand off at the 
wrist, causing metal and electronic parts to fly from the mechanical 
stump. Vader's sword clatters uselessly away, over the
edge of the platform and into the bottomless shaft below. Luke moves 
over Vader and holds the blade of his sword to the Dark Lord's throat. 
The Emperor watches with uncontrollable, pleased agitation.

EMPEROR
Good! Your hate has made you powerful. Now, fulfill your destiny and 
take your father's
place at my side!

Luke looks at his father's mechanical hand, then to his own mechanical, 
black-gloved hand, and realizes how much he is becoming like his 
father. He makes the decision for which he has spent a lifetime in 
preparation. Luke steps back and hurls his lightsaber away.

LUKE
Never! I'll never turn to the dark side. You've failed, Your Highness. 
I am a Jedi,
like my father before me.

The Emperor's glee turns to rage.

EMPEROR
So be it...Jedi.

123  EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER

Han and several of the fighters run out of the bunker and race across 
the clearing.

HAN
Move! Move!

A shock wave knocks them flat as the bunker explodes, followed by a 
spectacular display as the huge shield-generator radar dish explodes 
along with the bunker.

124  INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE

Ackbar, sitting in his control chair, speaks into the radio.

ACKBAR
The shield is down! Commence attack on theDeath Star's main reactor.

LANDO
We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me. 
(laughs)
Told you they'd do it!

The Falcon, followed by several smaller Rebel fighters, heads toward 
the unfinished superstructure of the Death Star.

125  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM

Luke stands still, as the Emperor reaches the bottom of thestairs. The 
Emperor's laughter has turned to anger. He raises his arms toward Luke.

EMPEROR
If you will not be turned, you will be destroyed.

Blinding bolts of energy, evil lightning, shoot from the Emperor's 
hands at Luke. Even in his surprise, the young Jedi tries to use the 
Force to deflect them. At first he is half successful, but after a 
moment the bolts of energy are coming with such speed and power the 
young Jedi shrinks before them, his knees buckling. The wounded Vader 
struggles to his feet, and moves to stand at his master's side.

EMPEROR
Young fool...only now, at the end, do you understand.

Luke is almost unconscious beneath the continuing assault of the 
Emperor's lightning. He clutches a canister to keep from falling into 
the bottomless shaft as the bolts tear through him.

EMPEROR
Your feeble skills are no match for the power of the dark side. You 
have paid the price for
your lack of vision.

Luke writhes on the floor in unbearable pain, reaching weakly up toward 
where Vader stands watching.

LUKE	 (groans)
Father, please. Help me.

Again Vader stands, watching Luke. He looks at his master, the Emperor, 
then back to Luke on the floor.

EMPEROR
Now, young Skywalker...you will die.

Although it would not have seemed possible, the outpouring of bolts 
from the Emperor's fingers actually increases in intensity, the sound 
screaming through the room. Luke's body writhes in pain.

Vader grabs the Emperor from behind, fighting for control of the robed 
figure despite the Dark Lord's weakened body and gravely weakened arm. 
The Emperor struggles in his embrace, his bolt-shooting hands now 
lifted high, away from Luke. Now the white lightning arcs back to 
strike at Vader. He stumbles with his load as the sparks rain off his 
helmet and flow down over his black cape. He holds his evil master high 
over his head and walks to the edge of the abyss at the central core of 
the throne room. With one final burst of his once awesome strength, 
Darth Vader hurls the Emperor's body into the bottomless shaft.

The Emperor's body spins helplessly into the void, arcing as it falls 
into the abyss. Finally, when the body is far down the shaft, it 
explodes, creating a rush of air through the room.Vader's cape is 
whipped by the wind and he staggers, and collapses toward the 
bottomless hole. Luke crawls to his father's side and pulls him away 
from the edge of the abyss to safety. Both the young Jedi and the giant 
warrior are too weak to move.

126  EXT/INT - SPACE BATTLE - FIGHTER AND DEATH STAR

Rebel fighters follow the Falcon across the surface of the Death Star 
to the unfinished portion, where they dive into the superstructure of 
the giant battle station, followed by many TIE fighters.

WEDGE
I'm going in.

LANDO
Here goes nothing.

Three X-wings lead the chase through the ever-narrowing shaft, followed 
by the Falcon and four other fighters, plus TIE fighters who 
continually fire at the Rebels. Lights reflect off the pilot's faces as 
they race through the dark shaft.

LANDO
Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power 
generator.

WEDGE
Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.

The fighters and the Falcon race through the tunnel, still pursued by 
the TIE fighters. One of the X-wings is hit from behind and explodes.

LANDO
Split up and head back to the surface. See if you can get a few of 
those TIE fighters to
follow you.

PILOT
Copy, Gold Leader.

The Rebel ships peel off pursued by three of the TIE's, while Lando and 
Wedge continue through the main tunnel. It narrows, and the Falcon 
scrapes the side dangerously. Two other TIE fighters continue to blast 
away at them.

LANDO
That was too close.

Nien Nunb agrees. The battle between the Rebel and Imperial fleet rages 
on. Several cruisers fire at the giant Super Star Destroyer.

127  INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE

ACKBAR
We've got to give those fighters more time. Concentrate all fire on 
that Super Star Destroyer.

X-wings pilots head across the surface of the huge battleship.

128  INT VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE

Admiral Piett and a commander stand at the window, looking out to the 
battle. They look concerned.

CONTROLLER
Sir, we've lost our bridge deflector shield.

PIETT
Intensify the forward batteries. I don't want anything to get through.

The commander is looking out of the window where a damaged Rebel 
fighter is out of control and heading directly toward the bridge.

PIETT
Intensify forward firepower!

COMMANDER
It's too late!

The Rebel pilot screams as his ship hits the Star Destroyer, causing a 
huge explosion. The giant battle ship loses control, crashes into the 
Death Star, and explodes.

129  INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE

There is excitement on the bridge as the battle rages on all sides. 
They cheer as the giant Star Destroyer blows up.

130  INT DEATH STAR - MAIN DOCKING BAY

Chaos. For the first time, the Death Star is rocked by explosions as 
the Rebel fleet, no longer backed against a wall, zooms over, unloading 
a heavy barrage. Imperial troops run in all directions, confused and 
desperate to escape.

In the midst of this uproar, Luke is trying to carry the enormous 
deadweight of his father's weakening body toward an Imperial shuttle. 
Finally, Luke collapses from the strain. The explosions grow louder as 
Vader draws him closer.

VADER	 (a whisper)
Luke, help me take this mask off.

LURE
But you'll die.

VADER
Nothing can stop that now. Just for once... let me look on you with my 
own eyes.

Slowly, hesitantly, Luke removes the mask from his father's face. There 
beneath the scars is an elderly man. His eyes do not focus. But the 
dying man smiles at the sight before him.

ANAKIN	 (very weak)
Now...go, my son. Leave me.

LUKE
No. You're coming with me. I can't leave you here. I've got to save 
you.

ANAKIN
You already have, Luke. You were right about me. Tell your sister...you 
were right.

LUKE
Father...I won't leave you.

Darth Vader, Anakin Skywalker...Luke's father, dies.

A huge explosion rocks the docking bay. Slowly, Luke rises and, half 
carrying, half dragging the body of his father, stumbles toward a 
shuttle.

131  EXT DEATH STAR

The Millennium Falcon leads a swerving bomb run through the immense 
superstructure of the half-built Death Star. The Rebel Star Cruisers 
outside continually bombard the huge station. And each direct hit is 
answered by resonating, chain-reaction explosions within the station 
itself.

132  INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT AND GUN PORTS

Lando's crew fires away at the pursuing TIE fighters as the dashing 
Baron of Bespin and his alien copilot home in on the main reactor 
shaft. It is awesome. A lone X-wing is just in front of the Falcon.

WEDGE
There it is!

LANDO
All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower.

WEDGE
Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out.

The X-wing heads for the top of the huge reactor and fires several 
proton torpedoes at the power regulator, causing a series of small 
explosions.

The Falcon heads for the main reactor, and when it is dangerously 
close, Lando fires the missiles, which shoot out of the Falcon with a 
powerful roar, and hit directly at the center of the main reactor.

He maneuvers the Falcon out of the winding superstructure just ahead of 
the continuing chain of explosions.

133  INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE

Ackbar and other Mon Calamari lean on the railing of the bridge, 
watching the large screen showing the Death Star in the main briefing 
room.

ACKBAR
Move the fleet away from the Death Star.

134  EXT DEATH STAR

An Imperial shuttle, with Luke alone in the cockpit, rockets out of the 
main docking bay as that entire section of the Death Star is blown 
away.

Finally, just as it looks like the Falcon will not make it, Lando 
expertly pilots the craft out of the exploding superstructure and 
whizzes toward the Sanctuary Moon, only a moment before the Death Star 
supernovas into oblivion.

135  INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Lando and Nien Nunb laugh and cheer in relief.

136  EXT ENDOR FOREST

Han and Leia, Chewie, the droids, the Rebel troops, and the Ewoks all 
look to the sky as the Death Star reveals itself in a final flash of 
self-destruction. They all cheer.

THREEPIO
They did it!

Han looks town from the sky to Leia, a look of concern on his face. 
Leia continues to look at the sky as though listening for a silent 
voice.

HAN
I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew.

LEIA
He wasn't. I can feel it.

HAN
You love him, don't you?

Leia smiles, puzzled.

LEIA
Yes.

HAN
All right. I understand. Fine. When he comes back, I won't get in the 
way.

She realizes his misunderstanding.

LEIA
Oh. No, it's not like that at all. He's my brother.

Han is stunned by this news. She smiles, and they embrace.

137  EXT ENDOR FOREST - NIGHT

Luke sets a torch to the logs stacked under a funeral pyre where his 
father's body lies, again dressed in black mask and helmet. He stands, 
watching sadly, as the flames leap higher to consume Darth Vader -- 
Anakin Skywalker.

In the sky above, fireworks explode and Rebel fighters zoom above the 
forest.

138  EXT EWOK VILLAGE SQUARE - NIGHT

A huge bonfire is the centerpiece of a wild celebration. Rebels and 
Ewoks rejoice in the warm glow of firelight, drums beating, singing, 
dancing, and laughing in the communal language of victory and 
liberation.

Lando runs in and is enthusiastically hugged by Han and Chewie. Then, 
finally, Luke arrives and the friends rush to greet and embrace him. 
They stand close, this hardy group, taking comfort in each other's 
touch, together to the end.

Rebels and Ewoks join together in dancing and celebration. The original 
group of adventurers watch from the sidelines. Only Luke seems 
distracted, alone in their midsts, his thoughts elsewhere.

He looks off to the side and sees three shimmering, smiling figures at 
the edge of the shadows: Ben Kenobi, Yoda, and Anakin Skywalker.

EXT. GALAXY - PLANET HOTH

A Star Destroyer moves through space, releasing Imperial probe robots 
from its underside.  

One of these probes zooms toward the planet Hoth and lands on its ice-
covered surface.  An explosion marks the point of
impact.  

EXT. HOTH - METEORITE CRATER - SNOW PLAIN - DAY

A weird mechanical sound rises above the whining of the wind.  A 
strange probe robot, with several extended sensors, emerges from the 
smoke-shrouded crater.  The ominous mechanical probe floats across the 
snow plain and disappears into the distance.

EXT. PLAIN OF HOTH - DAY

A small figure gallops across the windswept ice slope.  The bundled 
rider is mounted on a large gray snow lizard, a Tauntaun.  Curving 
plumes of snow rise from beneath the speeding paws of the two-legged 
beast.

The rider gallops up a slope and reins his lizard to a stop.  Pulling 
off his protective goggles, Luke Skywalker notices something in the 
sky.  He takes a pair of electrobinoculars from his utility belt and 
through them sees smoke rising from where the probe robot has crashed.

The wind whips at Luke's fur-lined cap and he activates a comlink 
transmitter.  His Tauntaun shifts and moans nervously beneath him.

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		Echo Three to Echo Seven.  Han, 
		old buddy, do you read me?

After a little static a familiar voice is heard.

				HAN
			(over comlink)
		Loud and clear, kid.  What's up?

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		Well, I finished my circle.  I 
		don't pick up any life readings.

				HAN
			(over comlink)
		There isn't enough life on this 
		ice cube to fill a space cruiser.  
		The sensors are placed, I'm going 
		back.

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		Right.  I'll see you shortly.  
		There's a meteorite that hit the 
		ground near here.  I want to check 
		it out.  It won't take long.

Luke clicks off his transmitter and reins back on his nervous lizard.  
He pats the beast on the head to calm it.

				LUKE
		Hey, steady girl.  What's the 
		matter?  You smell something?

Luke takes a small device from his belt and starts to adjust it when 
suddenly a large shadow falls over him from behind.  He hears a 
monstrous howl and turns to see an eleven-foot-tall shape towering over 
him.  It is a Wampa Ice Creature, lunging at him ferociously.

				LUKE
		Aaargh!

Luke grabs for his pistol, but is hit flat in the face by a huge white 
claw.  He falls unconscious into the snow and in a moment the terrified 
screams of the Tauntaun are cut short by the horrible snap of a neck 
being broken.

The Wampa Ice Creature grabs Luke by one ankle and drags him away 
across the frozen plain.

EXT. HOTH - REBEL BASE ENTRANCE - DAY

A stalwart figure rides his Tauntaun up to the entrance of an enormous 
ice cave.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK

Rebel troopers rush about unloading supplies and otherwise securing 
their new base.  The rider, Han Solo, swings off his lizard and pulls 
off his goggles.

He walks into the main hangar deck toward the Millennium Falcon, which 
is parked among several fighters.  Mechanics, R2 units, and various 
other droids hurry about.  Han stops at the Millennium Falcon where his 
Wookiee copilot, Chewbacca, is welding on a central lifter.  Chewie 
stops his work and lifts his face shield, growling an irritated 
greeting to his boss.

				HAN
		Chewie!

The Wookiee grumbles a reply.

				HAN
		All right, don't lose your temper.
		I'll come right back and give you 
		a hand.

Chewbacca puts his mask back on and returns to his welding as Han 
leaves.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER

A makeshift command center has been set up in a blasted area of thick 
ice.  The low-ceilinged room is a beehive of activity. Controllers, 
troops, and droids move about setting up electronic equipment and 
monitoring radar signals.

General Rieekan straightens up from a console at Han's approach.

				RIEEKAN
		Solo?

				HAN
No sign of life out there, General.
The sensors are in place.  You'll 
know if anything comes around.

				RIEEKAN
		Commander Skywalker reported in yet?

				HAN
		No.  He's checking out a meteorite 
		that hit near him.

				RIEEKAN
			(indicates radar 
			 screen)
		With all the meteor activity in this
		system, it's going to be difficult 
		to spot approaching ships.

Taking a deep breath, Han blurts out what is on his mind.

				HAN
		General, I've got to leave.  I 
		can't stay anymore.

Princess Leia, standing at a console nearby, is dressed in a short 
white combat jacket and pants.  Her hair is braided across her head in 
a Nordic fashion.  She overhears their  conversation and seems somewhat 
distressed.

				RIEEKAN
		I'm sorry to hear that.

				HAN
		Well, there's a price on my head.
		If I don't pay off Jabba the Hut, 
		I'm a dead man.

				RIEEKAN
		A death mark's not an easy thing 
		to live with.  You're a good
		fighter, Solo.  I hate to lose you.

				HAN
		Thank you, General.

He turns to Leia as Rieekan moves away.

				HAN
			(with feeling)
		Well, Your Highness, I guess this 
		is it.

				LEIA
		That's right.

Leia is angry.  Han sees she has no warmth to offer him.  He shakes his 
head and adopts a sarcastic tone.

				HAN
			(cooly)
		Well, don't get all mushy on me.
		So long, Princess.

Han walks away into the quiet corridor adjoining the command center.  
Leia stews a moment, then hurries after him.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - ICE CORRIDOR

				LEIA
		Han!

Han stops in the corridor and turns to face Leia.

				HAN
		Yes, Your Highnessness?

				LEIA
		I thought you decided to stay.

				HAN
		Well, the bounty hunter we ran 
		into on Ord Mantell changed my
		mind.  

				LEIA
		Han, we need you!

				HAN
		We?

				LEIA
		Yes.

				HAN
		Oh, what about you need?

				LEIA
			(mystified)
		I need?  I don't know what you're 
		talking about.

				HAN
			(shakes his head, 
			 fed up) 
		You probably don't.

				LEIA
		And what precisely am I supposed 
		to know?

				HAN
		Come on!  You want me to stay 
		because of the way you feel about
		me.

				LEIA
		Yes.  You're a great help to us.
		You're a natural leader...

				HAN
		No!  That's not it.  Come on.  
		Aahhh - uh huh!  Come on.

Leia stares at him, understanding, then laughs.

				LEIA
You're imagining things.

				HAN
		Am I?  Then why are you following 
		me?  Afraid I was going to leave
		without giving you a goodbye kiss?

				LEIA
		I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee.

				HAN
		I can arrange that.  You could use 
		a good kiss!

Angrily, Han strides down the corridor as Leia stares after him.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - ANOTHER ICE CORRIDOR

A familiar stream of beeps and whistles herald the approach of Artoo-
Detoo and See-Threepio, who appear around a corner and move along an 
ice wall toward the main hangar.

				THREEPIO
		Don't try to blame me.  I didn't 
		ask you to turn on the thermal 
		heater.  I merely commented that it 
		was freezing in the princess' 
		chamber.  But it's supposed to be 
		freezing.  How are we going to dry 
		out all her clothes?  I really don't 
		know.

Artoo beeps a stream of protesting whistles.

				THREEPIO
		Oh, switch off.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK

The two robots stop at Han Solo's space freighter.  Han and Chewie are 
struggling with their central lifters.

				HAN
			(to Chewie)
		Why do you take this apart now? 
		I'm trying to get us out of here 
		and you pull both of these.

Chewie grumbles in irritation.

				THREEPIO
		Excuse me, sir.

				HAN
			(to Chewie)
		Put them back together right now.

				THREEPIO
		Might I have a word with you, 
		please?

				HAN
		What do you want?

				THREEPIO
		Well, it's Princess Leia, sir.
		She's been trying to get you on 
		the communicator.

				HAN
		I turned it off.  I don't want to 
		talk to her.

				THREEPIO
		Oh.  Well, Princess Leia is wondering 
		about Master Luke.  He hasn't come 
		back yet.  She doesn't know where he 
		is.

				HAN
		I don't know where he is.

				THREEPIO
		Nobody knows where he is.

				HAN
		What do you mean, "nobody knows"?

Han glances at the fading light at the entrance of the ice cave as 
night slowly begins to fall on the planet.

				THREEPIO
		Well, uh, you see...

Han jumps down off the lift, as Threepio follows him.

				HAN
		Deck Officer.  Deck Officer!

				THREEPIO
		Excuse me, sir.  Might I inqu...

Han abruptly puts his hand over Threepio's mouth as the deck officer 
approaches.

				DECK OFFICER
		Yes, sir?

				HAN
		Do you know where Commander 
		Skywalker is?

				DECK OFFICER
		I haven't seen him.  It's possible 
		he came in through the south entrance.

				HAN
		It's possible?  Why don't you go 
		find out?  It's getting dark out there.

				DECK OFFICER
		Yes, sir.

The deck officer leaves hurriedly, as Han takes his hand off Threepio's 
mouth.

				THREEPIO
		Excuse me, sir.  Might I inquire 
		what's going on?

				HAN
		Why not?

				THREEPIO
		Impossible man.  Come along, Artoo, 
		let's find Princess Leia.  Between 
		ourselves, I think Master Luke is 
		in considerable danger.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN ICE TUNNEL

The deck officer and his assistant hurry toward Han as he enters the 
tunnel.

				DECK OFFICER
		Sir, Commander Skywalker hasn't 
		come in through the south entrance.
		He might have forgotten to check in.

				HAN
		Not likely.  Are the speeders ready?

				DECK OFFICER
		Not yet.  We're having some trouble 
		adapting them to the cold.

				HAN
		Then we'll have to go out on 
		Tauntauns.

				DECK OFFICER
		Sir, the temperature's dropping too 
		rapidly.

				HAN
		That's right.  And my friends out 
		in it.

				ASSISTANT OFFICER
		I'll cover sector twelve.  Have 
		com-control set screen alpha.

Han pushes through the troops and mounts a Tauntaun.

				DECK OFFICER
		Your Tauntaun'll freeze before you 
		reach the first marker.

				HAN
		Then I'll see you in hell!

Han maneuvers his mount out of the cave and races into the dark bitter 
night.

EXT. HOTH - ICE GORGE - DUSK

The jagged face of a huge ice wall sits gloomily in the dim twilight of 
a Hoth day.  Luke hangs upside down, ankles frozen into icy 
stalactites, his extended arms within a foot of the snow floor.  One 
side of his face is covered in a dried mask of frozen blood.  He opens 
his eyes as a chilling moan of the hideous ice creature echoes off the 
gorge walls.  Luke pulls himself up, grabs hold of his ankles, and 
futilely tries to unfasten the throngs.

Exhausted, he drops back into his hanging position.  As he hangs there, 
he spies his lightsaber lying near a pile of his discarded gear, about 
three feet out of reach.

He focuses on the saber and, as his hand strains toward the weapon, he 
squeezes his eyes tight in concentration.

Just as the ice creature looms over Luke, the lightsaber jumps into 
Luke's hand.

The young warrior instantly ignites his sword, swinging up, and cuts 
himself loose from the ice.  He flops to the snow in a heap.  The 
startled creature moves back, his giant yellow eyes blinking.  Luke 
scrambles to his feet.  He swings his lightsaber and the beast screams 
in pain.

EXT. HOTH - ENTRANCE TO ICE GORGE - DUSK

Luke staggers out of the gorge into the dark and snowy twilight.  Weak 
and exhausted, he stumbles down a snow bank.

EXT. HOTH - SNOW PLAIN - DUSK

A small, lone figure riding a Tauntaun races through the hostile 
vastness of snow and cold.  As it runs, the Tauntaun's legs kick up 
large clouds of snow and ice into the snowy air.

EXT. HOTH - OUTSIDE ICE				 HANGAR - DUSK

Artoo stands in the falling snow, beeping worriedly.  Threepio moves 
stiffly over to him.

				THREEPIO
		You must come along now, Artoo.  
		There's really nothing more we can 
		do.  And my joints are freezing up.

Artoo beeps, long and low.

				THREEPIO
		Don't say thing like that!  Of 
		course we'll see Master Luke again.
		He'll be quite all right, you'll see.
			(to himself)
		Stupid little short-circuit.  He'll 
		be quite all right.

Threepio turns to go back inside the main hangar as Artoo mournfully 
keeps his vigil.

EXT. HOTH - SNOW DRIFT - DUSK

The wind is blowing quite strong now.  Luke struggles to stay upright, 
but a blast of freezing snow knocks him over.  He struggles to get up, 
but he can't.  The young warrior from Tatooine drags himself a couple 
of feet and then collapses.

INT. REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK - ENTRANCE - NIGHT

Princess Leia stands inside the dark entrance to the Rebel base, 
waiting for a sign of the two Rebel heroes.  She shivers in the cold 
wind as, nearby, Chewie sits with his head in his hands.  In the 
background, Artoo and Threepio move through the doors.  

A Rebel lieutenant moves to Major Derlin, an officer keeping watch with 
the princess.

				LIEUTENANT
		Sir, all the patrols are in.
		There's still no contact from 
		Skywalker or Solo.

				THREEPIO
		Mistress Leia, Artoo says he's been 
		quite unable to pick up any signals, 
		although he does admit that his own 
		range is far too weak to abandon 
		all hope.

Leia nods an acknowledgment, but she is lost in thought.

				DERLIN
		Your Highness, there's nothing 
		more we can do tonight.  The shield 
		doors must be closed.

He turns to the lieutenant.

				DERLIN
		Close the doors.

				LIEUTENANT
		Yes, sir.

The lieutenant walks away.  Chewie lets out a long, mournful howl, 
somewhat like a coyote.  At the same moment, Artoo begins a complex 
series of efficient beeps.

				THREEPIO
		Artoo says the chances of survival 
		are seven hundred seventy-five...
		to one.

Leia stands praying to herself as the huge metal doors slam across the 
entrance of the ice cave.  The loud booms echo throughout the huge 
cavern.  Chewie lets out another suffering howl.

				THREEPIO
		Actually, Artoo has been known to 
		make mistakes... from time to time.
		Oh, dear, oh, dear.  Don't worry 
		about Master Luke.  I'm sure he'll 
		be all right.  He's quite clever, 
		you know... for a human being.

EXT. HOTH - SNOW DRIFT - DUSK

Luke lies face down in the snow, nearly unconscious.  Slowly he looks 
up and sees Ben Kenobi, barely visible through the blowing snow.  It is 
hard to tell if Kenobi is real or a hallucination.

				BEN
		Luke... Luke.

				LUKE
			(weakly)
		Ben?

				BEN
		You will go to the Dagobah system.

				LUKE
		Dagobah system?

				BEN
		There you will learn from Yoda, 
		the Jedi Master who instructed me.

The image of Ben fades, revealing a lone Tauntaun rider approaching 
from the windswept horizon.

				LUKE
			(groaning faintly)
		Ben... Ben.

Luke drops into unconsciousness.

Han pulls up and leaps off his mount.  He hurries to his snow-covered 
friend, cradling him in his arms.  Han's Tauntaun lets out a low, 
pitiful bellow.  But Han's concern is with Luke, and he shakes him 
urgently.

				HAN
		Luke!  Luke!  Don't do this, Luke.  
		Come on, give me a sign here.

Luke doesn't respond.  Han begins frantically rubbing and slapping 
Luke's unconscious face.  As he starts to lift the youth, Han hears a 
rasping sound behind him.  He turns, just in time to see his Tauntaun 
stagger and then fall over into the snow.

Han carries Luke to the moaning beast.  Then, with a final groan, the 
Tauntaun expires.

				HAN 
		Not much time.

He pushes Luke's inert form against the belly of the dead beast.

				LUKE
			(moaning)
		Ben... Ben...

				HAN
		Hang on, kid.

				LUKE
		Dagobah system...

Han ignites Luke's saber and cuts the beast from head to toe.  He 
quickly tosses it's steaming innards into the snow, then lifts Luke's 
inert form and stuffs him inside the carcass.

				HAN
			(reeling from the 
			 odor) 
		Whew...

				LUKE
		Dagobah...

				HAN
		This may smell bad, kid...

				LUKE
			(moaning)
		Yoda...

				HAN
		...but it will keep you warm... 
		til I get the shelter built.
			(struggling to get 
			 Luke inside the 
			 carcass) 
		Ooh... I thought they smelled bad 
		on the outside!

The wind has picked up considerably, making it difficult to move.  Han 
removes a pack from the dead creature's back, taking out a shelter 
container.  He begins to set up what can only be a pitiful protection 
against a bitter Hoth night.

EXT. HOTH - SNOWDRIFT - DAWN

Four snub-nosed armored snowspeeders race across the white landscape.

INT. SNOWSPEEDER COCKPIT

There is only one pilot, Zev, in the enclosed two-man craft.  He 
concentrates on the scopes which ring his cockpit.  He hears a low beep 
from one of his monitors.

				ZEV
			(into transmitter) 
		Echo Base... I've got something!  Not 
		much, but it could be a life form.

EXT. HOTH - SNOWDRIFT

The small craft banks and makes a slow arc, then races off in a new 
direction.

INT. SNOWSPEEDER - COCKPIT

The pilot switches over to a new transmitter.

				ZEV
			(into transmitter)
		This is Rogue Two.  this is Rogue 
		Two.  Captain Solo, so you copy?  
		Commander Skywalker, do you copy? 
		This is Rogue Two.

There is a sharp crackle of static, then a faint voice.

				HAN
			(filtered over 
			 Zev's receiver)
		Good morning.  Nice of you guys 
		to drop by.

				ZEV
			(switching transmitters) 
		Echo Base... this is Rogue Two.  I 
		found them.  Repeat, I found them.

EXT. HOTH - SNOWDRIFT - DAY

The small shelter Han set up is covered with snow on the windward side.  
A makeshift antenna rests gingerly on top the snowdrift.  Han spots 
Zev's snowspeeder approaching in the distance, and begins waving his 
arms frantically at the tiny craft.

INT. REBEL BASE - MEDICAL CENTER

Strange robot surgeons adjust a mass of electronic equipment.  A switch 
is thrown and a sudden blinding flash obscures Luke in a bacta tank 
filled with a thick, gelatinous slime.  He begins to thrash about, 
raving in delirium.

INT. REBEL BASE - MEDICAL CENTER - RECOVERY ROOM

Luke sits up in a recovery-room bed, weak but smiling.  His face shows 
terrible wounds from the Wampa's attack.  Threepio and Artoo enter the 
room.

				THREEPIO
		Master Luke, sir, it's so good 
		to see you fully functional again.

Artoo beeps his good wishes.

				THREEPIO
		Artoo expresses his relief, also.

Han and Chewie make their entrance.  The Wookiee growls a greeting.

				HAN
		How are you feeling, kid?  You 
		don't look so bad to me.  In 
		fact, you look strong enough to 
		pull the ears off a Gundark.

				LUKE
		Thanks to you.

				HAN
		That's two you owe me, junior.

Han turns as Leia enters the room.  He looks at her with a big, 
devilish grin.

				HAN
		Well your Worship, looks like 
		you managed to keep me around for
		a little while longer.

				LEIA
			(haughtily)
		I had nothing to do with it.  General 
		Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for 
		any ships to leave the system until 
		we've activated the energy shield.

				HAN
		That's a good story.  I think you 
		just can't bear to let a gorgeous 
		guy like me out of your sight.

				LEIA
		I don't know where you get your 
		delusions, laser brain.

Chewie is amused; he laughs in his manner.  Han, enjoying himself, 
regards Chewie good-humoredly.

				HAN
		Laugh it up, fuzzball.  But you 
		didn't see us alone in the south 
		passage.

Luke sparks to this; he looks at Leia.

				HAN
		She expressed her true feelings 
		for me.

Leia is flushed, eyes darting between Luke and Han.

				LEIA
		My...!  Why, you stuck up,... half-
		witted... scruffy-looking ...nerf-
		herder!

				HAN
		Who's scruffy-looking? 
			(to Luke) 
		I must have hit pretty close to 
		the mark to get her all riled up 
		like that, huh, kid?

Leia looks vulnerable for a moment, then the mask falls again, and she 
focuses on Luke.

				LEIA
		Why, I guess you don't know 
		everything about women yet?

With that she leans over and kisses Luke on the lips.  Then she turns 
on her heel and walks out, leaving everyone in the room slightly 
dumbstruck.  With some smugness, Luke puts his hands behind his head 
and grins.

Suddenly, in the distance, the muffled sound of an alarm is heard.

				ANNOUNCER
			(over loudspeaker)
		Headquarters personnel, report to 
		command center.

The voice repeats the order and Han, Chewie, Artoo, and Threepio hurry 
out of the room, bidding farewell to Luke.

				HAN
		Take it easy.

				THREEPIO
		Excuse us, please.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER

Rieekan looks up grimly from a console screen.  He calls over to Leia 
and Han.

				RIEEKAN
		Princess... we have a visitor.

The group hurries over to Rieekan.

				RIEEKAN
		We've picked up something outside 
		the base in zone twelve, moving 
		east.

				SENIOR CONTROLLER
		It's metal.

				LEIA
		Then it couldn't be one of those 
		creatures that attacked Luke.

				HAN
		It could be a speeder, one of ours.

				SENIOR CONTROLLER
		No.  Wait - there's something very 
		weak coming through.

Threepio steps up to the control panel and listens intently to the 
strange signal.

				THREEPIO
		Sir, I am fluent in six million 
		forms of communication.  This signal 
		is not used by the Alliance.  It 
		could be an Imperial code.

The transmission ends in static.

				HAN
		It isn't friendly, whatever it is.  
		Come on, Chewie, let's check it out.

				RIEEKAN
		Send Rogues Ten and Eleven to 
		station three-eight.

EXT. HOTH - SNOW PLAIN - DAY

The dark probe robot moves past the smoldering ruins of station three-
eight and down a ridge toward the Rebel base.  It raises a large 
antenna from the top of its head and begins to send out a piercing 
signal.

The probe droid has spotted Chewbacca who, not thirty feet away, has 
popped his head over a snow bank.  Instantly, the probe robot swings 
around, its deadly ray ready to fire.  But before it can get a shot 
off, it is hit from behind by a laser bolt, and explodes in a million 
pieces.

Han Solo replaces his blaster in its holster and peers intently at the 
smoldering remains of the Imperial probe.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER

Leia and Rieekan listen to Han on the comlink.

				HAN
			(over comlink)
		Afraid there's not much left.

				LEIA
			(into comlink)
		What was it?

				HAN
			(over comlink)
		Droid of some kind.  I didn't hit 
		it that hard.  It must have had a 
		self-destruct.

				LEIA
			(into comlink)
		An Imperial probe droid.

				HAN
			(over comlink)
		It's a good bet the Empire knows 
		we're here.

				RIEEKAN
		We'd better start the evacuation.

EXT. SPACE - IMPERIAL FLEET

Darth Vader's Star Destroyer, larger and more awesome than the five 
Imperial Star Destroyers that surround it, sits in the vastness of 
space.  The six huge ships are surrounded by a convoy of smaller 
spacecraft.  TIE fighters dart to and fro.

INT. DARTH VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE - MAIN CONTROL DECK

Controllers working the vast complex of electronic controls hear 
ominous approaching footsteps and look up from their controls.  The 
squat, evil-looking Admiral Ozzel and the young, powerfully built 
General Veers, who have been conferring near the front, also feel the 
approaching presence and turn toward it.  Darth Vader, Lord of the 
Sith, enters like a chill wind.  As Vader moves across the wide bridge, 
Captain Piett hurries up to Ozzel.

				PIETT
		Admiral.

				OZZEL
		Yes, Captain

				PIETT
		I think we've got something, sir.  
		The report is only a fragment from 
		a probe droid in the Hoth system, 
		but it's the best lead we've had.

				OZZEL
			(irritated) 
		We have thousands of probe droids 
		searching the galaxy.  I want proof, 
		not leads!

				PIETT
		The visuals indicate life readings.

				OZZEL
		It could mean anything.  If we 
		followed every lead...

				PIETT
		But, sir, the Hoth system is supposed 
		to be devoid of human forms.

Vader moves to a large screen showing an image of the Rebel snow base.  
Rebel speeders can be seen approaching the base in the distance.

				VADER
		You found something?

				PIETT
		Yes, my lord.

				VADER
			(studying the image 
			 on the console screen) 
		That's it.  The Rebels are there.

				OZZEL
		My lord, there are so many uncharted 
		settlements.  It could be smugglers, 
		it could be...

				VADER
		That is the system.  And I'm sure 
		Skywalker is with them.  Set your 
		course for the Hoth system.  General 
		Veers, prepare you men.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - TRANSPORT BAY

A captain issues instructions to two of his men at the entrance to the 
main transport bay.  Several Rebel transports behind them are being 
loaded by men carrying heavy boxes and moving quickly, but not in 
panic.

				REBEL CAPTAIN
		Groups seven and ten will stay 
		behind to fly the speeders.  As 
		soon as each transport is loaded, 
		evacuation control will give 
		clearance for immediate launch.

				REBEL FIGHTER
		Right, sir.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK

Alarms sound.  Troops, ground crews, and droids rush to their alert 
stations.  Armored snowspeeders are lined up in attack formation near 
the main entrance.

In the midst of all this activity, Han does some frantic welding on the 
lifters of the Millennium Falcon.

Han finishes his work and hops down to the hangar floor.  He pulls out 
his comlink, all the while eyeing problematic lifters.

				HAN
			(into comlink, to 
			 Chewie)
		Okay, that's it.  Try it... Off! 
		Turn it off!  Turn it off!  Off!

Smoke rises from a minor explosion on the lifter.  Exasperated, Han 
surveys the new damage.

INT. REBEL BASE - MEDICAL CENTER

Luke dresses in readiness for the evacuation as his attending medical 
droid stands by.

				MEDICAL DROID
		Sir, it will take quite a while 
		to evacuate the T-forty- sevens.

				LUKE
		Well, forget the heavy equipment.
		There's plenty of time to get the 
		smaller modules on the transports.

				MEDICAL DROID
		Take care, sir.

				LUKE
		Thanks.

INT. REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK

Pilots, gunners, and R2 units scurry about.  Luke, pulling on his 
heavy-weather jacket, is headed toward a row of armored speeders.  He 
stops at the rear of the Millennium Falcon, where Han and Chewie are 
trying to repair the right lifter with even more haste than before.

				LUKE
		Chewie, take care of yourself, 
		okay?

As Luke pats Chewie on the arm, Chewie puts his arms around Luke and 
gives him a tight hug.  Han is discussing the lifter with a repair 
droid when he sees Luke.

				HAN
		Hi, kid.
			(to droid)
		There's got to be a reason for 
		it.  Check it at the other end.
		Wait a second.
			(to Luke)
		You all right?

				LUKE
		Yeah.

				HAN
		Be careful.

				LUKE
		You, too.

Luke smiles, then waves at his friend and walks on.  After a few steps, 
he stops and looks back.  Han glances up and the two exchange a silent 
communication, each wishing the other safety, happiness - many things, 
all difficult to verbalize.

INT. REBEL BASE - CONTROL ROOM.

Alarms sound throughout the hidden Rebel base.  In the control room, a 
controller urgently gestures for General Rieekan to check a computer 
scan.

				CONTROLLER
		General, there's a fleet of Star 
		Destroyers coming out of hyperspace 
		in sector four.

				RIEEKAN
		Reroute all power to the energy 
		shield.  We've got to hold them till 
		all transports are away.  Prepare 
		for ground assault.

Rieekan exits hurriedly.

INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - VADER'S CHAMBER - MEDITATION CUBICLE

The dark cubicle is illuminated by a single shaft of light which falls 
on the brooding Dark Lord as he sits on a raised meditation cube.  
General Veers enters the room and approaches the silent, unmoving 
Vader.  Although seemingly very sure of himself, Veers is still not 
bold enough to interrupt the meditating lord.  The younger general 
stands quietly at attention until the evil presence speaks.

				VADER
		What is it, General?

				VEERS
		My lord, the fleet has moves out 
		of light-speed.  Com-Scan has 
		detected an energy field protecting 
		an area around the sixth planet of 
		the Hoth system.  The field is 
		strong enough to deflect any 
		bombardment.

				VADER
			(angrily)
		The Rebels are alerted to our 
		presence.  Admiral Ozzel came out 
		of light-speed too close to the 
		system.

				VEERS
		He felt surprise was wiser...

				VADER
		He is as clumsy as he is stupid.
		General, prepare your troops for a 
		surface attack.

				VEERS
		Yes, my lord.

Veers turns smartly and leaves as Vader activates a large viewscreen 
showing the bridge of his mighty ship.  Admiral Ozzel appears on the 
viewscreen, standing slightly in front of Captain Piett.

				OZZEL
		Lord Vader, the fleet has moved 
		out of light-speed, and we're 
		preparing to... Aaagh!

				VADER
		You have failed me for the last 
		time, Admiral.  Captain Piett.

Piett steps forward, as the admiral moves away, slightly confused, 
touching his throat as it begins to constrict painfully.

				PIETT
		Yes, my lord.

				VADER
Make ready to land out troops beyond 
the energy shield and deploy the 
fleet so that nothing gets off that 
system.  You are in command now, 
Admiral Piett.

				PIETT
		Thank you, Lord Vader.

Piett's pleasure about his unexpected promotion is not an unmixed 
emotion.  He glances warily at the struggling Admiral Ozzel who, with a 
final choke, stumbles and falls in a lifeless heap before him.

INT. REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK

With a sense of urgency, Leia quickly briefs a group of pilots gathered 
in the center of the hangar.

				LEIA
		All troop carriers will assemble 
		at the north entrance.  The heavy 
		transport ships will leave as 
		soon as they're loaded.  Only two 
		fighter escorts per ship.  The 
		energy shield can only be opened 
		for a short time, so you'll have 
		to stay very close to your transports.

				HOBBIE
		Two fighters against a Star Destroyer?

				LEIA
		The ion cannon will fire several 
		shots to make sure that any enemy 
		ships will be out of your flight 
		path.  When you've gotten past the 
		energy shield, proceed directly to 
		the rendezvous point.  Understood?

				PILOTS
			(in unison)
		Right.  Okay.

				LEIA
		Good luck.

				DERLIN
		Okay.  Everyone to your stations.  
		Let's go!

The pilots hurry away.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - SNOW TRENCH - DAY

Rebel troops carry heavy bazooka-type weapons and position them along 
the snow trench.  Men hurriedly respond to their officers' yelled 
orders and brace themselves against the rhythmic gusts of bitter-cold 
wind.

Other troops load power packs into a gun turret and swing its guns into 
position.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - POWER GENERATORS

Near the base power generators, troops rush to set up their heavy 
battle equipment.  Buzzing loudly, the generators send along, sparking 
fingers of energy into the bitter Hoth wind.

INT. REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER

The long line of Rebel controllers is tense, as are Princess Leia and 
General Rieekan, who are trying very hard not to show any fear.

				RIEEKAN
		Their primary target will be the 
		power generators.  Prepare to 
		open the shield.

EXT. ICE PLAIN

The Rebel transport and two escort fighters begin their departure from 
the ice planet.

EXT. SPACE - IMPERIAL STAR DESTROYER

A huge Imperial Star Destroyer rest against a sea of stars, far above 
the white surface of the planet Hoth.

INT. IMPERIAL STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE

An Imperial controller approaches his commander.

				CONTROLLER
		Sir, Rebel ships are coming into 
		our sector.

				CAPTAIN
		Good.  Our first catch of the day.

INT. REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER

				WOMAN CONTROLLER
		Stand by, ion control... Fire!

EXT. REBEL BASE ICE CAVE - ION CANNON

The giant ball-shaped ion cannon rotates into position and blasts two 
red energy beams skyward.

EXT. SPACE - HOTH - REBEL TRANSPORT

The Rebel transport and its escort race away from the white planet, 
closely followed by the two red energy beams.

As the Rebel transport races toward the waiting Imperial Star 
Destroyer, it is overtaken by the two scarlet energy bolts.  The 
Imperial Star Destroyer is hit in the conning tower by the powerful 
bolts, which set up fiery explosions on its metal hull.

The big Star Destroyer veers, then spins wildly out of control.  As the 
Imperial ship careers into deep space, the Rebel transport races away 
to safety.

INT. REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK

Pilots, gunners, and troopers hurry to their stations and their 
vehicles.

				ANNOUNCER
			(over loudspeaker)
		The first transport is away.

Everyone cheers at the announcement, which echoes through the hangar.  
Luke turns and walks on, heading toward his snowspeeder.  His gunner, 
Dack, a fresh-faced, eager kid, is glad to see him.  They climb in.

				DACK
		Feeling all right, sir?

				LUKE
		Just like new, Dack.  How about 
		you?

				DACK
		Right now I feel like I could take 
		on the whole Empire myself.

				LUKE
			(quietly, strapping 
			 in)
		I know what you mean.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN

A thin horizon line cuts across the bleak landscape.  Small dot-size 
objects begin to appear on the horizon, moving in the direction of the 
Rebel base.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - SNOW TRENCH

A Rebel officer lifts a pair of electrobinoculars to his eyes.  Through 
the lens he sees a very close view of a giant Imperial snow walker.  He 
adjusts the view which then zooms back to reveal three more of the 
ominous battle machines.  Small flashes of yellow fire billow from the 
guns of the lumbering snow walkers.

The officer lowers his binoculars as the regular rhythmic pounding 
begins to make the ground vibrate.  The pounding grows louder and is 
accompanied by a high-pitched, metallic rattling.  The officer speaks 
into his comlink.

				TRENCH OFFICER
		Echo Station Three-T-Eight.

INT. REBEL BASE - CORRIDOR

Pilots and gunners race to their waiting snowspeeders.  Ice and snow 
begin falling from the walls of the corridor, shaken by the pounding 
Imperial snow walker as they draw ever nearer.

				TRENCH OFFICER
			(over comlink) 
		We have spotted Imperial walkers!

				CONTROLLER
Imperial walkers on the north 
ridge.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - SNOW TRENCH

The Rebel troops aim their weapons at the horizon as explosions erupt 
all around them.  They are nervous and their grip on their weapons 
tightens from the cold and from fear.

Behind the troops a dozen snowspeeders race through the sky.

INT. LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT

				LUKE
			(into comlink) 
		Echo station Five-Seven.  We're 
		on our way.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - BATTLEFIELD

The fleet of snowspeeders races above the ice field at full throttle.  
They accelerate away from the base and head toward the distant walkers.

INT. LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT

				LUKE
			(into comlink) 
		All right, boys, keep tight now.

				DACK
		Luke, I have no approach vector.  
		I'm not set.

				LUKE
		Steady, Dack.  Attack pattern 
		delta.  Go now!

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - BATTLEFIELD

The cannons mounted on the walker head fire at the speeders.  Other 
walkers loom in the background.  Two speeders race away past two of the 
enormous walkers and bank to the right.

INT.  LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT

				LUKE
		All right, I'm coming in.

He turns his speeder and heads directly at one of the walkers, flying 
toward its towering legs.  The horizon twists as the speeder banks 
between the legs.

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		Hobbie, you still with me?

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - BATTLEFIELD

Two speeders race directly at the head of a walker, then split and fly 
past it.

Three other walkers march onward, firing all cannons.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - SNOWTRENCH

Rebel troops fire on the approaching walkers, as the snow and ice 
explode all around them.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - BATTLEFIELD

A speeder banks through and away from the legs of a walker.  Two other 
speeders pass the first speeder from the opposite direction.  Other 
Rebel craft race just above the icy plain.

A giant walker head swivels and fires, striking a snowspeeder and 
sending it crashing in a ball of flames.

INT. IMPERIAL SNOW WALKER - COCKPIT

General Veers and two walker pilots keep a careful eye on the racing 
Rebel snowspeeders as they maneuver their lumbering war machine 
forward.

Luke's speeder banks in from the side of Veers's walker and heads 
straight for its viewport, blasting away.  An explosion hits the walker 
window, but dissipates, doing no harm.  The speeder roars up and over 
the impregnable war machine.

INT.  LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT

Luke looks back at the walker as it grows smaller in the distance.

				LUKE
		That armor's too strong for 
		blasters.

On the horizon, another walker moves up past Luke's cockpit window, 
twisting out of sight as Luke banks and starts another run.

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		Rogue Group, use your harpoons 
		and tow cables.  Go for the legs.
		It might be our only chance of 
		stopping them.
			(to Dack)
		All right, stand by, Dack.

Dack is at the gunner's controls.

				DACK
		Luke, we've got a malfunction in 
		fire control.  I'll have to cut in 
		the auxiliary.

				LUKE
		Just hang on.  Hang on, Dack.  Get 
		ready to fire that tow cable.

Barely keeping his seat in the tumbling ship, Dack struggles to set up 
his harpoon gun.

Luke swings his speeder around and heads toward an oncoming walker.  
Laser bolts and flak fill the air, creating a deadly obstacle course 
for the tiny craft.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - BATTLEFIELD

Rogue Leader and another snowspeeder fly in tight formation toward the 
walker as explosions burst all around them.

INT.  LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT

After sustaining a heavy volley of fire, Luke turns around to see if 
Dack is all right.

				LUKE
		Dack?  Dack!

Dack is lost.  Blood streams down his forehead, which rests on his 
smoldering controls.  Out the back window, an Imperial walker recedes 
in the distance.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - SNOW TRENCH AREA

Rebel troops fire the dishlike ray gun while explosions erupt around 
them.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - BATTLEFIELD

Two walkers lumber toward the Rebel base as a speeder between them 
explodes in a ball of flames.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - SNOW TRENCH

The dislike ray gun is hit by a laser bolt and instantly explodes.

INT. IMPERIAL SNOW WALKER - COCKPIT

Through the cockpit window, Veers and his pilot can see the Rebel power 
generators in the distance.

A hologram of Darth Vader appears on a control panel screen.

				VEERS
		Yes, Lord Vader.  I've reached the 
		main power generator.  The shield 
		will be down in moments.  You may 
		start your landing.

INT.  LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT

				LUKE

		Rogue Three.

INT. WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE THREE - COCKPIT

				WEDGE
			(into comlink) 
		Copy, Rogue Leader

				LUKE 
			(over comlink) 
		Wedge, I've lost my gunner.  You'll 
		have to make this shot.  I'll cover 
		for you.  Set your harpoon.  Follow 
		me on the next pass.

				WEDGE
			(into comlink) 
		Coming around, Rogue Leader.

INT.  LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT

				LUKE
			(into comlink) 
		Steady, Rogue Two

EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD

Wedge's speeder races through the legs of one of the monstrous walkers.

INT. WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE THREE - COCKPIT

				WEDGE
			(to gunner) 
		Activate harpoon.

Wedge's gunner reaches for a firing switch to activate the harpoon.  
The harpoon flashes out, and speeds toward the receding legs of the 
walker.

EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD

The harpoon hurtles toward the walker, In an instant it is embedded in 
one of the walker's legs.

INT. WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE THREE - COCKPIT

				WEDGE 
			(to gunner) 
		Good shot, Janson.

EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD

The speeder Rogue Three races around one of the giant walker's feet, 
trailing the cable behind it.  Continuing around the back foot, Rogue 
Three then circles the walker around the tail end.

INT. WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE THREE - COCKPIT

Wedge checks his controls and banks around the front of the walker.

				WEDGE
		One more pass.

				JANSON 
		Coming around.  Once more.

EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD

The speeder sweeps left to right in front of the giant legs, towing the 
cable behind it.

INT. WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE THREE - COCKPIT

				JANSON
		Once more.

Wedge swings the speeder between the legs of the giant walker.

				JANSON
		Cable out!  Let her go!

				WEDGE
		Detach cable.

EXT. WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE THREE

The cable release on the back of the speeder snaps loose and the cable 
drops away.

INT. WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE THREE - COCKPIT

				JANSON
		Cable detached.

EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD

The speeder zooms away into the distance.  The tangled legs of the 
enormous war machine attempt a step, but as they do the giant Imperial 
walker begins to topple.  It teeters for a moment, and then crashes 
onto the icy ground, sending snow and metal pieces flying.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - SNOW TRENCH

The troops in the trenches cheer at the sight of the crashing walker.

An officer gives a signal to his men and Rebel troops charge the fallen 
war machine.

				TRENCH OFFICER
		Come on!

The troops run toward the downed walker, followed by two Rebel speeders 
flying overhead.  Just as they reach the walker, it explodes, the 
impact throwing some of the men onto the frozen ground.

INT. WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE THREE - COCKPIT

Wedge lets out a triumphant yell, banking his speeder away from the 
fallen walker.

				WEDGE
			(into comlink) 
		Whooha!  That got him!

INT.  LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT

				LUKE
			(into comlink) 
		I see it, Wedge.  Good work.

INT. REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER

Large chunks of ice tumble into the command center as Leia and General 
Rieekan monitor computer screens.

				RIEEKAN
		I don't think we can protect two 
		transports at a time.

				LEIA 
		It's risky, but we can't hold out 
		much longer.  We have no choice.

				RIEEKAN
			(into comlink) 
		Launch patrols.

				LEIA
			(to an aide) 
		Evacuate remaining ground staff.

INT. REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR

Muffled distant explosions create widening cracks in the ice roof of 
the hangar.  Trying to ignore the noise and falling bits of snow, Han 
works on one of the Falcon's lifters while Chewie works on one of the 
wings.  Noticing Chewie attach a wrong part, Han grows impatient.

				HAN
		No, no!  No!  This one goes there, 
		that one goes there.  Right?

In another area of the hangar, Threepio watches as Artoo is raised up 
into Luke's X-wing fighter.

				THREEPIO
		Artoo, you take good care of 
		Master Luke now, understand?  And
		... do take good care of yourself.  
		Oh, dear, oh, dear.

EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD

The fierce battle on the vast snow plains of Hoth rages on.  The 
Imperial walkers continue their slow, steady assault on the Rebel base, 
firing lasers as they lumber ever onward.  In the snow trench, Rebel 
troops fire large bazookalike guns and dishlike ray guns as explosions 
erupt around them.  A gun tower is hit by a laser bolt and instantly 
explodes.  Another blast destroys a ray gun.

INT. IMPERIAL SNOW WALKER - COCKPIT

General Veers studies various readouts on his control panel.

				VEERS
		All troops will debark for ground 
		assault.  Prepare to target the 
		main generator.

EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD

Luke's speeder and Rogue Two fly in formation, banking from right to 
left and flying above the erupting battlefield.  Flak bursts all around 
them.

INT.  LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT

Luke, glancing over, sees Rogue Two on his left.  His ship shudders as 
flak bursts nearby.

				LUKE
			(into comlink) 
		Rogue Two, are you all right?

INT. ZEV'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE TWO - COCKPIT

				ZEV
			(into comlink) 
		Yeah.  I'm with you, Rogue Leader.

INT.  LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT

				LUKE
			(into comlink) 
		We'll set harpoon.  I'll cover for you.

EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD

The two speeders race across the horizon toward the giant walkers.

INT. ZEV'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE TWO - COCKPIT

				ZEV
			(into comlink) 
		Coming around.

INT.  LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT

				LUKE

		Watch that cross fire, boys.

INT. ZEV'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE TWO - COCKPIT

				ZEV
			(into comlink) 
		Set for position three.
			(to gunner) 
		Steady.

				LUKE
			(over comlink) 
		Stay tight and low.

EXT. ZEV'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE TWO

Luke's speeder moves in formation with Rogue Two, when suddenly Zev's 
speeder is hit by a laser bolt.  His ship bucks violently under the 
impact and the cockpit explodes in a ball of flame.

Spewing smoke, the speeder hurtles toward a looming walker.  Before 
they collide.  Rogue Two explodes in a million flaming pieces.

INT. LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT

Desperately, Luke works the controls of his flak-buffeted ship.  
Suddenly, the speeder is rocked by a huge explosion.  Luke struggles 
with the controls with a look of terror on his face.  The speeder fills 
with smoke, and electrical sparks jump about the cockpit.

				LUKE
			(into comlink) 
		Hobbie, I've been hit!

INT. REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER

Apart from the distant thunder of laser blasts, the corridor is 
strangely quiet and empty.  Running footsteps echo through the freezing 
hallway, then Han appears.  Cracks have appeared in some of the walls 
and some pipes have broken, sending hot steam billowing into the 
underground hallways.  Han hurries into the command center.  It is a 
shambles, but some people are still at their posts.  As he enters, a 
gigantic cave-in almost obliterates the room.  He finds Leia and 
Threepio near one of the control boards.

				HAN
		You all right?

Leia nods.  She is surprised to see him.

				LEIA
		Why are you still here?

				HAN
		I heard the command center had 
		been hit.

				LEIA
		You got your clearance to leave.

				HAN
		Don't worry.  I'll leave.  First 
		I'm going to get you to your ship.

				THREEPIO
		Your Highness, we must take this 
		last transport.  It's our only hope.

				LEIA
			(to controller) 
		Send all troops in sector twelve 
		to the south slope to protect the 
		fighters.

A blast rocks the command center, throwing Threepio backward into Han's 
arms.

				ANNOUNCER
			(over loudspeaker) 
		Imperial troops have entered the 
		base.

				HAN
		Come on... that's it.

				LEIA
			(to head controller) 
		Give the evacuation code signal.  
		And get to your transports!

Leia looks exhausted.  Han grabs her and starts to lead her out.

As Han, Leia, and Threepio run out of the command center, the code 
signal can be heard echoing off the corridor walls.

				HEAD CONTROLLER
		K-one-zero... all troops disengage.

				THREEPIO
			(to Han and Leia) 
		Oh!  Wait for me!

EXT. BATTLEFIELD - SNOW TRENCH

Rebel troops retreat under the awesome Imperial onslaught.

				OFFICER
		Begin retreat!

				SECOND OFFICER
		Fall back!

Troops flee from the battle, the ground exploding around them.

EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD

Three of the giant walkers, firing lasers, advance toward the Rebel 
headquarters.

EXT. HOTH - SNOW TRENCH

Continuing their retreat, the Rebels see the walkers looming ever 
nearer.

EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD - ICE PLAIN

On the battlefield, Luke watches as a walker foot rises and moves over 
him.  He looks up at the underbelly of the huge walker, passing 
overhead.

Running beneath the monstrous machine, Luke fires his harpoon gun at 
the walker's underside.  A thin cable follows the projectile from the 
gun.  The magnetic head and cable attach firmly to the metal hull.

Still running under the walker, Luke attaches the cable drum to his 
belt buckle.  Soon he is pulled up the cable and hangs dangling 
underneath the walker.

The walker's giant feet continue to pound onward across the frozen 
snow.  Stray laser bolts whistle by Luke as he climbs up the cable to 
the walker's hull, reaching a small hatch.  Hanging precariously, Luke 
cuts the solid metal hatch with his laser sword.

He takes a landmine from around his neck and throws it inside the 
Imperial machine.  Quickly, Luke starts down the cable and crashes onto 
the icy ground far below.  He lies unconscious as a giant rear leg 
passes by - and just misses him.

The giant walker stops in mid-step.  A muffled explosion comes from 
within - and then the walker's mechanical insides  are spewed out every 
conceivable opening.  The machine sits dead in its tracks, smoking like 
a locomotive on stilts.

EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD

Veers's walker continues to advance toward the Rebel base.  The 
smoldering walker that Luke exploded stands smoking just to the right 
of Veers's path.

INT. IMPERIAL SNOW WALKER - COCKPIT

Inside his walker, General Veers prepares to fire on the Rebel power 
generators.

				VEERS
		Distance to power generators?

				PILOT
		One-seven, decimal two-eight.

Veers reaches for the electrorangefinder and lines up the main 
generator.

				VEERS
		Target.  Maximum fire power.

EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD

The Rebel troops continue their desperate retreat, pushed back by the 
relentless Imperial assault.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - ICE CORRIDORS

With Threepio lagging behind, Han and Leia race through the crumbling 
ice corridors.  Suddenly, there is an explosion.  Han turns, grabs the 
princess, and pulls her to the wall as a tremendous cave-in blacks 
their path.

He takes the comlink from his pocket.

				HAN 
			(into comlink) 
		Transport, this is Solo.  Better 
		take off - I can't get to you.  
		I'll get the princess out on the 
		Falcon.

Han and Leia turn and race down the corridor.

				THREEPIO
		But... but... but... where are 
		you going?  Uh... come back!!

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER

Imperial troops have reached the base.  As they push through the 
blocked passageway, Darth Vader strides behind them.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - ICE CORRIDOR

Han and Leia run toward the entrance of the main hangar where the 
Millennium Falcon is docked.  Threepio still lags behind.

				THREEPIO
		Wait!  Wait for me!  Wait!  Stop!

The door to the hangar closes in his face.

				THREEPIO
			(exasperated) 
		How typical.

Quickly, the door reopens as Han reaches out and pulls the golden droid 
through.

				HAN
		Come on.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR

Chewie paces under the shelter of the Millennium Falcon's landing gear.  
The giant Wookiee pats the underbelly of his beloved ship and barks a 
few reassuring words.  As he searches worriedly for his captain, 
something at last catches his eye.

Chewie lets out a relieved shriek at seeing Han and Leia running toward 
the ship.  The Wookiee runs out into the falling ice, lets out a howl, 
then runs up the ship's ramp.  Han and Leia run up the ramp after him, 
closely followed by Threepio.

				HAN
		Hurry up, goldenrod, or you're 
		going to be a permanent resident!

				THREEPIO
		Wait!  Wait!

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - ICE CORRIDOR

Imperial troops run through the base corridors.  Vader surveys the 
place.  A huge chunk falls, almost hitting him, but  he calmly, 
purposefully, continues around it.

INT. REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGER - MILLENNIUM FALCON

A distant, huge, explosion rocks the hangar deck.  Ice cakes come 
crashing down on the Millennium Falcon.

INT. MAIN HANGAR - MILLENNIUM FALCON - MAIN HOLD

Han, standing before a control panel, is busy flipping switches as 
Chewie watches a troublesome gauge.  A worried Leia observes their 
efforts.

				HAN
			(to Chewie)
		How's this?

The Wookiee barks a negative reply.

				LEIA
		Would it helped if I got out and 
		pushed?

				HAN
		It might.

Threepio clanks into the hold.

				THREEPIO
		Captain Solo, Captain Solo... sir, 
		might I suggest that you...

Han gives the gold robot a devastating look.

				THREEPIO
		It can wait.

INT. MAIN HANGAR - MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

They move to the cockpit where Han flips some more switches.  Leia 
watches him, impatient, disbelieving.

				LEIA
		This bucket of bolts is never going 
		to get us past that blockade.

				HAN
		This baby's got a few surprises 
		left in her, sweetheart.

Han and Leia look out the cockpit window and see a squad of 
stormtroopers rushing into the far side of the hangar.

Quickly, Han straps himself into the pilot's seat and Leia into the 
navigator's chair.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR

Stormtroopers hurriedly set up a large bazookalike weapon.  Behind them 
the giant hangar doors open slowly.

EXT. MAIN HANGAR - MILLENNIUM FALCON

A laser gun appears on the Falcon and swings around to aim at the 
Imperial troops.

The stormtroopers, preparing to fire their bazooka cannon, are hit by 
the Falcon's fire and are thrown about in all directions.

INT. MAIN HANGAR - MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Chewie rushes into the cockpit.

				HAN
		Come on!  Come on!  Switch over.
		Let's hope we don't have a burnout.

A laser hits the window near Chewie as he is settling into his chair.  
Letting out a loud whelp, Chewie quickly pulls back on the controls and 
the first stage of engine fire can be heard.  Han flashes a big grin at 
Leia.

				HAN
		See?

				LEIA
		Someday you're going to be wrong, 
		and I hope I'm there to see it.

Han looks at Chewie.

				HAN
		Punch it!

The roar of the Falcon's main engines blasts out everything as the ice-
cave wall rushes by outside the cockpit window.

INT. REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR

More stormtroopers run into the hangar, closely followed by Vader.  
Hearing the loud roar of the Millennium Falcon's engines, Vader looks 
toward the main hangar doors just in time to see the Falcon lift up and 
disappear outside the cave.

EXT. HOTH - ICE SLOPE - DAY

Luke and two other pilots look up as the Millennium Falcon races above 
them, flying very close to the ground.

The three pilots turn then, and trudge onward toward their X-wing 
fighters, each going to his own ship.  Luke waves farewell, then heads 
toward his own fighter.  

Artoo, seated on his cubbyhole, chirps an excited greeting as Luke 
climbs aboard the spacecraft.

				LUKE
		Artoo!  Get her ready for takeoff.

From his ship, Luke sees Wedge in his own X-wing, preparing for 
takeoff.

				WEDGE
		Good luck, Luke.  See you at 
		the rendezvous.

Luke smiles and nods at Wedge, then lowers himself into the cockpit of 
his X-wing while Artoo waits in the cubbyhole, beeping impatiently.

				LUKE
		Don't worry, Artoo.  We're going, 
		we're going.

The canopy over the X-wing lowers and snaps shut.

EXT. SPACE -  LUKE'S X-WING

Luke's fighter, its wings closed, speeds away from the icy planet.  
Soon it disappears into the stars.

INT.  LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT

Luke, looking thoughtful, suddenly makes a decision.  He flips several 
switches.  The stars shift as he takes his fighter into a steep turn.  
The X-wing banks sharply and flies away in a new direction.

The monitor screen on Luke's control panel prints out a question from 
the concerned Artoo.

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		There's nothing wrong, Artoo.
		I'm just setting a new course.

Artoo beeps once again.

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		We're not going to regroup with 
		the others.

Artoo begins a protest, whistling an unbelieving, "What?!"

Luke reads Artoo's exclamation on his control panel.

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		We're going to the Dagobah system.

Luke checks his readouts and makes a few adjustments.  He rides along 
with only the soft hum of the instruments to break the silence.  
Finally, Artoo chirps up.

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		Yes, Artoo?

Artoo utters a soft, carefully phrased steam of whistles.

				LUKE
			(into comlink, chuckling)
		That's all right.  I'd like to 
		keep it on manual control for a 
		while.

The little droid lets out a defeated whimper.  Luke smiles, and 
continues on his course.

EXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON

The Millennium Falcon speeds away from Hoth, closely followed by one 
huge Star Destroyer and four tiny TIE fighters.

As it is pursued, the Falcon races toward two very bright star-sized 
objects.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Inside the cockpit, Chewie lets out a loud howl.  Han checks as the 
ship is buffeted by exploding flak.  He appears to be doing six things 
at once.

				HAN
			(harried)
		I saw them!  I saw them!

				LEIA
		Saw what?

				HAN
		Star Destroyers, two of them, 
		coming right at us.

Threepio bumps and bangs his way into the cockpit.

				THREEPIO
		Sir, sir!  Might I suggest...

				HAN
			(to Leia)
		Shut him up or shut him down!
			(to Chewie)
		Check the deflector shield!

Chewie barks a reply as he readjusts an overhead switch.

				HAN
		Oh, great.  Well, we can still 
		outmaneuver them.

EXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - STAR DESTROYERS

The Millennium Falcon races toward one of the huge oncoming Star 
Destroyers.  Suddenly, the Falcon starts into a deep dive straight 
down, closely followed by four TIE fighters.  The underside of the Star 
Destroyer continues on a collision course with two oncoming Star 
Destroyers.  Slowly, it starts to veer to the left.

INT. STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE
Out the front window, the two approaching Star Destroyers can be seen 
veering to the left.

				IMPERIAL OFFICER
		Take evasive action!

Alarms sound all over the huge ship.  The two other Star Destroyers get 
closer, one of them moving over the bridge so close that it makes 
brushing contact with it.

EXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - TIE FIGHTERS

The Millennium Falcon races away from the colliding Star Destroyers, 
still followed by four TIE fighters.  Laser bolts spark the pitch-black 
skies.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Things have calmed down a bit, but the race isn't over yet.  Chewie 
barks at Han.  Leia is still trying to recover from the steep dive.  
The ship is buffeted by laser blasts.

				HAN
		Prepare to make the jump to light-
		speed.

				THREEPIO
		But, sir!

The buffeting of lasers becomes louder and stronger.

				LEIA
		They're getting closer!

				HAN
			(with a gleam in his 
			 eye)
		Oh yeah?  Watch this.

Expectantly, they look out the cockpit window as stars do not go into 
hyperspace, but just sit there.

Han and Chewie look at each other and are thrown into an acute state of 
concern.

				LEIA
		Watch what?

Han tries again.  Still nothing.

				HAN
		I think we're in trouble.

				THREEPIO
		If I may say so, sir, I noticed 
		earlier that the hyperdrive 
		motivator has been damaged.  It's 
		impossible to go to light-speed!

				HAN
		We're in trouble!

The explosions become heavier.

EXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - TIE FIGHTERS - STAR DESTROYER

The Falcon races into the starry vastness, followed by the four 
Imperial TIE fighters and an Imperial Star Destroyer.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Stars race by as flak bursts outside the Falcon's window.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - HOLD

Han works furiously at some control panels while giving various orders 
to Chewie.

				HAN
		Horizontal boosters...!
			(Chewie barks)
		Alluvial dampers...!  Well that's 
		not it.
			(Chewie barks)
		Bring me the hydrospanners!

Chewie hurries over to the pit and places the tools on the edge.

				HAN
		I don't know how we're going to 
		get out of this one.

Suddenly, a loud thump hits the side of the Falcon, causing it to lurch 
radically.  Chewie barks.  The tools fall into the pit on top of Han.

				HAN
		Oww!  Chewie!

More turbulence rocks the ship.

				HAN
		That was no laser blast!  Something 
		hit us.

				LEIA
			(over comlink)
		Han, get up here!

				HAN
		Come on, Chewie!

Han climbs out of the hold like a shot.  Both he and Chewie run out of 
the hold and toward the cockpit.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Out the front cockpit window, they see hundreds of asteroids racing by.

				LEIA
		Asteroids!

Han changes places with Leia who has been at the controls, and Chewie 
gets into his chair.  Han works his controls as a chunk of rock crosses 
in front of the ship.

				HAN
		Oh, no!  Chewie, set two-seven-
		one.

				LEIA
		What are you doing?  You're not 
		actually going into an asteroid 
		field?

				HAN
		They'd be crazy to follow us, 
		wouldn't they?

Another asteroid thumps against the ship and Leia winces at the jolt.

				LEIA
		You don't have to do this to 
		impress me.

				THREEPIO
		Sir, the possibility of successfully 
		navigating an asteroid field is 
		approximately three thousand, seven 
		hundred and twenty to one.

				HAN
		Never tell me the odds!

EXT. ASTEROID BELT - MILLENNIUM FALCON

The Falcon turns into the asteroid storm and as the ship completes its 
turn, asteroids start coming straight at the cockpit windows.

A large asteroid tumbles away from the Falcon's path at top speed.  
Several smaller asteroids crash into the big one, creating small 
explosions on its surface.  Other asteroids of all sizes pass by in 
every direction, some colliding and exploding.  The tiny Millennium 
Falcon veers around the big asteroid and races past it through the rain 
of rocks, followed by four TIE fighters, which bob and weave around the 
asteroids.

One of the pursuing TIE fighters connects with an asteroid and 
explodes.  The other fighters are pelted with a steady stream of 
smaller explosions.

Two huge asteroids tumble toward the Millennium Falcon, which quickly 
banks around both of them.  The three TIE fighters follow in hot 
pursuit until one of the fighters scrapes an asteroid and tumbles out 
of control into deep space.

EXT. SPACE - STAR DESTROYER - ASTEROID BELT

The massive Star Destroyer blasts oncoming asteroids as it follows the 
Falcon.  Smaller asteroids explode across its vast surface.

EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - TIE FIGHTERS - ASTEROID BELT

The Falcon twists on its side as it races around an oncoming asteroid.  
Two TIE fighters follow in the distance, coming from either side.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Asteroids race by the cockpit window as Han pilots his trusty craft 
through the dangerous field.

Looking out the cockpit window, the Falcon crew sees a big asteroid 
drop past the window, narrowly missing their ship.

Chewie barks in terror as a slightly smaller asteroid comes especially 
close - to close - and bounces off the Falcon with a loud crunch.  
Threepio's hands cover his eyes.  He manages a short peek at the 
cockpit window.  Princess Leia sits stone-faced, staring at the action.  
Han gives her a quick look.

				HAN
		You said you wanted to be around 
		when I made a mistake; well, this 
		could be it, sweetheart.

				LEIA
		I take it back.  We're going to 
		get pulverized if we stay out here 
		much longer.

The group watches as more asteroids race by outside the window.

				HAN
		I'm not going to argue with that.

				THREEPIO
		Pulverized?

				HAN
		I'm going in closer to one of 
		those big ones.

				LEIA
		Closer?

				THREEPIO
		Closer?!

Chewbacca barks the same word, only louder.

EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - ASTEROID BELT

The Millennium Falcon dives toward the surface of one of the moon-sized 
asteroids.  There is a continued display of explosions against the 
starry void as smaller asteroids collide with larger chunks of rock.  
The two remaining TIE fighters follow the Falcon to the large asteroid.  
The Falcon skims the surface of the giant asteroid as, all the while, 
small asteroids explode on the surface of the ship.

The TIE fighters approach the Falcon, but a giant asteroid hurtles 
directly into their path.  As the asteroid continues on its way, it 
leaves remains of the two exploded TIE fighters to tumble into deep 
space.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Rattled by the violent rocking of the starship, Threepio is nearly in 
hysterics.

				THREEPIO
		Oh, this is suicide!

Han notices something on his main scope and nudges his faithful 
Wookiee, pointing.

				HAN
		There.  That looks pretty good.

				LEIA
		What looks pretty good?

				HAN
		Yeah.  That'll do nicely.

				THREEPIO
			(to Leia)
		Excuse me, ma'am, but where are 
		we going?

Out the cockpit window, they see that they are skimming the surface of 
the enormous asteroid and nearing a large crater.

EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GIANT ASTEROID CRATER

The Millennium Falcon dives into the huge crater and disappears.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

				LEIA
		I hope you know what you're doing.

				HAN
		Yeah, me too.

INT. GIANT ASTEROID CRATER

The Falcon races down into the crater.  The walls are barely visible as 
the ship speed through the tunnellike opening.  A small cave appears on 
one side of the crater, and the Falcon turns, slows, and scoots into 
it.

EXT. SPACE -  LUKE'S X-WING

The tiny X-wing speeds toward the cloud cover of Dagobah.  Artoo, 
riding on the back of the fighter, turns his head back and forth with 
some anxiety.

INT.  LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT

Luke watches Artoo's words as they are translated and screened on the 
computer scope.

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		Yes, that's it.  Dagobah.

Artoo beeps a hopeful inquiry.

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		No, I'm not going to change my 
		mind about this.
			(getting a little nervous)
		I'm not picking up any cities or
		technology.  Massive life-form 
		readings, though.  There's something
		alive down there...

Artoo beeps, this time a slightly worried question.

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		Yes, I'm sure it's perfectly safe 
		for droids.

EXT. SPACE - DAGOBAH -  LUKE'S X-WING

The X-wing continues its flight through the twilight above the cloud-
covered planet.

INT.  LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT

Luke sees the cloud race by as he takes his craft closer to the planet.  
He must operate his controls carefully since the cloud cover has 
completely obscured his vision.  An alarm buzzes in the background, 
Artoo beeps and whistles frantically.

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		I know, I know!  All the scopes are 
		dead.  I can't see a thing!  Just 
		hang on, I'm going to start the 
		landing cycle...

The blast of the retrorockets is deafening, drowning out Artoo's 
electronic squeals.  Suddenly, there is a cracking sound as if limbs 
were being broken off trees and then a tremendous jolt as the 
spacecraft stops.  Luke pulls a switch and his canopy pops open.

EXT. DAGOBAH - DUSK

The mist-shrouded X-wing fighter is almost invisible in the thick fog.  
Luke climbs out onto the long nose of the spacecraft as Artoo pops out 
of his cubbyhole on the back.  The young warrior surveys the fog, which 
is barely pierced by the ship's landing lights.  About all he can make 
out are some giant, twisted trees nearby.  Artoo whistles anxiously.

				LUKE
		No, Artoo, you stay put.  I'll 
		have a look around.

Artoo lets out a short beep.  As Luke moves along the nose, Artoo loses 
his balance and disappears with a splash into the boggy lake.

				LUKE
		Artoo?

Luke kneels and leans over the plane looking for Artoo, but the water 
is still and reveals no sign of the little droid.

				LUKE
		Artoo!  Where are you?

A small periscope breaks the surface of the water and a gurgly beep is 
heard.  The periscope starts to move to shore.  Relieved, Luke starts 
running along the nose of the fighter to its tip.

				LUKE
		Artoo!  You be more careful.

The outline of the shore is now more than ten feet away.

Luke jumps off the plane into the water, scrambles up to the shore, and 
turns to look for Artoo.  The periscope still steadily moves toward 
shore.

				LUKE
		Artoo - that way!

Suddenly, through the thick fog layer, a dark shape appears, moving 
toward the little droid.  The dark, sinuous bog beast dives beneath the 
swampy water, making a loud clunk against Artoo's metal hull.  The 
droid disappears from sight, uttering a pathetic electronic scream.

Holding his ignited lightsaber before him, Luke wades a few feet into 
the murky pool, looking for any sign of his little friend.

				LUKE
		Artoo!

The black surface is still as death itself... until a few bubbles begin 
to appear.  Then, phheewaat!! The runt-size robot is spit out of the 
water, makes a graceful arc, and comes crashing down into a patch of 
soft gray moss.

				LUKE
		Oh, no!  Are you all right?  Come 
		on.  You're lucky you don't taste 
		very good.  Anything broken?

Luke helps Artoo to his feet and begins wiping the mud and roots from 
his round metal body.  Artoo responds with feeble, soggy beeps.

				LUKE
		If you're saying coming here was 
		a bad idea, I'm beginning to agree 
		with you.  Oh, Artoo, what are we 
		doing here?  It's like... something 
		out of a dream, or, I don't know.  
		Maybe I'm just going crazy.

As Luke glances around at the spooky swamp jungle that surrounds him, 
Artoo ejects a stream of muddy water from one of his cranial ports.

EXT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - VADER'S CHAMBER

Admiral Piett hesitates in the entryway to Vader's private cubicle.

After a moment, he steps into the room and pauses at the surprising 
sight before him.

Darth Vader, his back turned, is silhouetted in the gloom on the far 
side of the chamber.  A black, insectlike droid attends him.  Among the 
various apparatuses surrounding them, a respirator tube now retracts 
from Vader's uncovered head.  The head is bald with a mass of ugly scar 
tissue covering it.  The black droid then lowers the mask and helmet 
onto Vader's head.  When it is in place, the Dark Lord turns to face 
Piett.

				VADER
		Yes, Admiral?

				PIETT
Our ships have sighted the 
Millennium Falcon, lord.  But... 
it has entered an asteroid field 
and we cannot risk...

				VADER
			(interrupting)
		Asteroids do not concern me, 
		Admiral.  I want that ship and 
		not excuses.

				PIETT
		Yes, lord.

EXT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON

The pirate starship rests in a dark, dripping asteroid cave.  It is so 
dark that the cave's exact dimensions are impossible to determine.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Han and Chewie busily shut down the engine and all electronic systems.  
Threepio and Leia watch worriedly.

				HAN
		I'm going to shut down everything 
		but the emergency power systems.  

				THREEPIO
		Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, 
		but... does that include shutting 
		me down, too?

Chewie barks "yes".  But Han thinks otherwise.

				HAN
		No, I need you to talk to the 
		Falcon, find out what's wrong with 
		the hyperdrive.

Suddenly, the ship lurches, causing all the loose items in the cockpit 
to go flying.  Chewie howls.

				THREEPIO
		Sir, it's quite possible this 
		asteroid is not entirely stable.

				HAN
		Not entirely stable?  I'm glad you're 
		here to tell us these things.  Chewie, 
		take the professor in the back and 
		plug him into the hyperdrive.

				THREEPIO
		Oh!  Sometimes I just don't 
		understand human behavior.  After 
		all, I'm only trying to do my job 
		in the most...

The sliding door closes behind the indignant Threepio as Chewie and he 
move back to the hold.  Suddenly, the ship lurches again, throwing Leia 
across the cabin into Han's arms.  Then, abruptly, the motion stops as 
suddenly as it started.  With some surprise, Han and Leia realize they 
are in each other's arms.

				LEIA
		Let go.

				HAN
		Sshh!

				LEIA
		Let go, please.

Leia flushes, averting her eyes.  She's not exactly fighting to get 
free.  But, of course, Han blows it...

				HAN
		Don't get excited.

The anger rises in Leia.

				LEIA
		Captain, being held by you isn't 
		quite enough to get me excited.

				HAN
		Sorry, sweetheart.  We haven't 
		got time for anything else.

Han grins quickly wickedly at Leia as he turns and exits through the 
door.  Leia's confused emotions show clearly on her lovely face.

EXT. DAGOBAH - BOG CLEARING - DUSK

The mist has dispersed a bit, but it is still a very gloomy-looking 
swamp.

Luke pulls an equipment box from the shore to the clearing.  He ignites 
a little fusion furnace and warms his hands before it.  Taking a power 
cable, he plugs it into Artoo's noselike socket.

				LUKE
		Ready for some power?  Okay.  
		Let's see now.  Put that in 
		there.  There you go.

The droid whistles his appreciation.  Luke then opens a container of 
processed food and sits before the thermal heater.

				LUKE
			(sighs)
		Now all I have to do is find this 
		Yoda... if he even exists.

Nervously, he looks around at the foreboding jungle.

				LUKE
		Still... there's something familiar 
		about this place.  I feel like... 
		I don't know...

				STRANGE VOICE
		Feel like what?

Luke jumps out of his skin.  Artoo screeches in terror.  The young 
warrior grabs for his lightsaber as he spins around, looking for the 
speaker.  Mysteriously standing right in front of Luke is a strange, 
bluish creature, not more than two feet tall.  The wizened little thing 
is dressed in rags.  It motions toward Luke's sword.

				LUKE
			(looking at the 
			 creature)
		Like we're being watched!

				CREATURE
		Away with your weapon!  I mean 
		you no harm.

After some hesitation, Luke puts away his weapon, although he really 
doesn't understand why.  Artoo watches with interest.

				CREATURE
		I am wondering, why are you here?

				LUKE
		I'm looking for someone.

				CREATURE
		Looking?  Found someone, you have, 
		I would say, hmmm?

The little creature laughs.

				LUKE
			(Trying to keep from 
			 smiling)
		Right.

				CREATURE
		Help you I can.  Yes, mmmm.

				LUKE
		I don't think so.  I'm looking 
		for a great warrior.

				CREATURE
		Ahhh!  A great warrior.
			(laughs and shakes 
			 his head)
		Wars not make one great.

With the aid of a walking stick, the tiny stranger moves over to one of 
the cases of supplies.  He begins to rummage around.

Artoo moves to the edge of the case - standing almost eye level to the 
creature who is carelessly handling the supplies - and squeaks his 
disapproval.

Their tiny visitor pick up the container of food Luke was eating from 
and takes a bite.

				LUKE
		Put that down.  Hey!  That's my 
		dinner!

The creature spits out the bite he has taken.  He makes a face.

				CREATURE
		How you get so big, eating food 
		of this kind?

He flips the container in Luke's direction and reaches into one of 
Luke's supply cases.

				LUKE
		Listen, friend, we didn't mean to 
		land in that puddle, and if we 
		could get our ship out, we would, 
		but we can't, so why don't you just...

				CREATURE
			(teasing)
		Aww, cannot get your ship out?

The creature spots something of interest in Luke's case.  Luke loses 
patience and grabs the case away.  The creature retains his prize - a 
tiny power lamp - and examines it with delight.

				LUKE
		Hey, you could have broken this.
		Don't do that.  Ohhh... you're 
		making a mess.  Hey, give me that!

				CREATURE
			(retreating with 
			 the lamp)
		Mine!  Or I will help you not.

Clutching its treasure, the creature backs away from Luke, drawing 
closer to Artoo.  As Luke and the creature argue, one of Artoo's little 
arms slowly moves out toward the power lamp, completely unnoticed by 
the creature.

				LUKE
		I don't want your help.  I want 
		my lamp back.  I'll need it to 
		get out of this slimy mudhole.

				CREATURE
		Mudhole?  Slimy?  My home this is.

Artoo grabs hold of the lamp and the two little figures are immediately 
engaged in a tug-of-war over it.

Artoo beeps a few angry, "Give me thats."

				CREATURE
		Ah, ah, ah!

				LUKE
		Oh, Artoo, let him have it!

				CREATURE
		Mine!  Mine!

				LUKE
		Artoo!

				CREATURE
		Mine!

The creature lets go with one hand and pokes Artoo lightly with one 
finger.  Artoo reacts with a startled squeal, and lets go.

				CREATURE
		Mine!

				LUKE
			(fed up)
		Now will you move along, little 
		fella?  We're got a lot of work 
		to do.

				CREATURE
		No!  No, no!  Stay and help you, 
		I will.
			(laughs)
		Find your friend, hmm?

				LUKE
		I'm not looking for a friend. 
		I'm looking for a Jedi Master.

				CREATURE
		Oohhh.  Jedi Master.  Yoda.  You 
		seek Yoda.

				LUKE
		You know him?

				CREATURE
		Mmm.  Take you to him, I will.
			(laughs)
		Yes, yes.  But now, we must eat.
		Come.  Good food.  Come.

With that, the creature scurries out of the clearing, laughing merrily.  
Luke stares after him.  All he sees is the faint light from the small 
power lamp moving through the fog.  Luke makes his decision and starts 
after the creature.

				CREATURE
			(in the distance)
		Come, come.

Artoo, very upset, whistles a blue streak of protest.

				LUKE
		Stay here and watch after the 
		camp, Artoo.

Artoo beeps even more frantically.  But as Luke disappears from view, 
the worried little droid grows quieter, and utters a soft electronic 
sigh.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - MAIN HOLD AREA

Threepio whistles and beeps a strange dialect into the control panel in 
front of him.  The control panel whistles back a few mystifying beeps.

				THREEPIO
		Oh, where is Artoo when I need 
		him?

Han enters the hold area and kneels on the floor near the control box.

				THREEPIO
		Sir, I don't know where your ship 
		learned to communicate, but it 
		has the most peculiar dialect.  I 
		believe, sir, it says that the 
		power coupling on the negative 
		axis has been polarized.  I'm 
		afraid you'll have to replace it.

				HAN
		Well, of course I'll have to replace 
		it.

He hands a wire coil up to Chewie who is working near the ceiling.

				HAN
		Here!  And Chewie...

Chewie brings his head back through the trap door in the ceiling and 
whines.  Han glances back at Threepio, then speaks quietly to Chewie so 
only he can hear.

				HAN
			(continuing)
		... I think we'd better replace 
		the negative power coupling.

Leia finishes welding the valves she has been working on and attempts 
to reengage the system by pulling a lever attached to the valve.  It 
doesn't budge.  Han notices her struggle, and moves to help her.  She 
rebuffs him.

				HAN
		Hey, Your Worship, I'm only 
		trying to help.

				LEIA
			(still struggling)
		Would you please stop calling me 
		that?

Han hears a new tone in her voice.  He watches her pull on the lever.

				HAN
		Sure, Leia.

				LEIA
		Oh, you make it so difficult 
		sometimes.

				HAN
		I do, I really do.  You could be 
		a little nicer, though.
			(he watches her 
			 reaction)
		Come on, admit it.  Sometimes you 
		think I'm all right.

She lets go of the lever and rubs her sore hand.

				LEIA
		Occasionally...
			(a little smile, 
			 haltingly)
		... when you aren't acting like 
		a scoundrel.

				HAN
			(laughs)
		Scoundrel?  Scoundrel?  I like 
		the sound of that.

With that, Han takes her hand and starts to massage it.

				LEIA
		Stop that.

				HAN
		Stop what?

Leia is flushes, confused.

				LEIA
		Stop that!  My hands are dirty.

				HAN
		My hands are dirty, too.  What 
		are you afraid of?

				LEIA
			(looking right 
			 into his eyes)
		Afraid?

Han looks at her with a piercing look.  He's never looked more 
handsome, more dashing, more confident.  He reaches out slowly and 
takes Leia's hand again from where it is resting on a console.  He 
draws it toward him.

				HAN
		You're trembling.

				LEIA
		I'm not trembling.

Then with an irresistible combination of physical strength and 
emotional power, the space pirate begins to draw Leia toward him... 
very slowly.

				HAN
		You like me because I'm a scoundrel.
		There aren't enough scoundrels in 
		your life.

Leia is now very close to Han and as she speaks, her voice becomes an 
excited whisper, a tone completely in opposition to her words.

				LEIA
		I happen to like nice men.

				HAN
		I'm a nice man.

				LEIA
		No, you're not.  You're...

He kisses her now, with slow, hot lips.  He takes his time, as though 
he had forever, bending her body backward.  She has never been kissed 
like this before, and it almost makes her faint.  When he stops, she 
regains her breath and tries to work up some indignation, but finds it 
hard to talk.

Suddenly, Threepio appears in the doorway, speaking excitedly.

				THREEPIO
		Sir, sir!  I've isolated the 
		reverse power flux coupling.

Han turns slowly, icily, from their embrace.

				HAN
		Thank you.  Thank you very much.

				THREEPIO
		Oh, you're perfectly welcome, sir.

The moment spoiled, Han marches out after Threepio.

EXT. SPACE - ASTEROID FIELD

The Imperial fleet moves through the asteroid-filled void, intently 
seeking its prey.

INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE

Asteroids collide, creating a fireworks display outside the bridge 
window.  Darth Vader stands, staring out the window above the control 
deck.  Then slowly turns toward the bridge.  Before him are the 
hologram images of twenty battleship commanders.  One of these images, 
the commander of a ship that has just exploded, is fading away quickly.  
Another image, in the center and a little apart from the others, is 
faded and continually disrupted by static.  It is the image of Captain 
Needa, commander of the Star Destroyer most hotly on the tail of the 
Millennium Falcon.  Admiral Piett and an aide stand behind the Dark 
Lord.

				NEEDA
			(in hologram)
		... and that, Lord Vader, was the 
		last time they appeared in any of 
		our scopes.  Considering the amount 
		of damage we've sustained, they 
		must have been destroyed.

				VADER
		No, Captain, they're alive.  I 
		want every ship available to 
		sweep the asteroid field until 
		they are found.

The Imperial star captains fade out one by one as Vader turns to 
Admiral Piett.

				PIETT
Lord Vader.

				VADER
		Yes, Admiral, what is it?

The admiral is scared, his face white as a sheet.

				PIETT
		The Emperor commands you make 
		contact with him.

				VADER
		Move the ship out of the asteroid 
		field so that we can send a clear 
		transmission.

				PIETT
		Yes, my lord.

EXT. ASTEROID FIELD - VADER'S STAR DESTROYER

Vader's Imperial Star Destroyer moves against the vast sea of stars 
away from the rest of the fleet.

INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - VADER'S CHAMBER

The Dark Lord, Darth Vader, is alone in his chamber.  A strange sound 
enters the room and a light begins to play across Vader's black figure.  
He looks up and bows quickly.

A twelve-foot hologram of the Galactic Emperor materializes before 
Vader.  The Emperor's dark robes and monk's hood are reminiscent of the 
cloak worn by Ben Kenobi.  His voice is even deeper and more 
frightening than Vader's.

				VADER
		What is thy bidding, my master?

				EMPEROR
		There is a great disturbance in 
		the Force.

				VADER
		I have felt it.

				EMPEROR
		We have a new enemy - Luke 
		Skywalker.

				VADER
		Yes, my master.

				EMPEROR
		He could destroy us.

				VADER
		He's just a boy.  Obi-Wan can no 
		longer help him.

				EMPEROR
		The Force is strong with him.  The 
		son of Skywalker must not become a 
		Jedi.

				VADER
		If he could be turned, he would 
		become a powerful ally.

				EMPEROR
		Yes.  Yes.  He would be a great 
		asset.  Can it be done?

				VADER
		He will join us or die, my 
		master.

Vader kneels.  The supreme Emperor passes a hand over the crouched Lord 
of the Sith and fades away.

EXT. DAGOBAH - CREATURE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A heavy downpour of rain pounds through the gnarled trees.  A strange 
baroque mud house sits on a moss-covered knoll on the edge of a small 
lagoon.  The small, gnomish structure radiates a warm glow from its 
thick glass windows.  As rain tap-dances a merry tune on Artoo's head, 
the stubby little droid rises up on his tip-toes to peek into one of 
the glowing portals.

INT. CREATURE'S HOUSE

Artoo, peeking in the window, sees the inside of the house - a very 
plain, but cozy dwelling.  Everything is in the same small scale as the 
creature.  The only thing out of place in the miniature room is Luke, 
whose height makes the four-foot ceiling seem even lower.  He sits 
cross-legged on the floor of the living room.

The creature is in an adjoining area - his little kitchen - cooking up 
an incredible meal.  The stove is a steaming hodgepodge of pots and 
pans.  The wizened little host scurries about chopping this, shredding 
that, and showering everything with exotic herbs and spices.  He rushes 
back and forth putting platters on the table in front of Luke, who 
watches the creature impatiently.

				LUKE
		Look, I'm sure it's delicious.  
		I just don't understand why we 
		can't see Yoda now.

				CREATURE
		Patience!  For the Jedi it is 
		time to eat as well.  Eat, eat.  
		Hot.  Good food, hm? Good, hmm?

Moving with some difficulty in the cramped quarters, Luke sits down 
near the fire and serves himself from the pot.  Tasting the unfamiliar 
concoction, he is pleasantly surprised.

				LUKE
		How far away is Yoda?  Will it 
		take us long to get there?

				CREATURE
		Not far.  Yoda not far.  Patience.
		Soon you will be with him.
			(tasting food from 
			 the pot)
		Rootleaf, I cook.  Why wish you 
		become Jedi?  Hm?

				LUKE
		Mostly because of my father, I 
		guess.

				CREATURE
		Ah, your father.  Powerful Jedi 
		was he, powerful Jedi, mmm.

				LUKE
			(a little angry)
		Oh, come on.  How could you know 
		my father?  You don't even know 
		who I am.
			(fed up)
		Oh, I don't know what I'm doing 
		here.  We're wasting our time.

The creature turns away from Luke and speaks to a third party.

				CREATURE
			(irritated)
		I cannot teach him.  The boy has 
		no patience.

Luke's head spins in the direction the creature faces.  But there is no 
one there.  The boy is bewildered, but it gradually dawns on him that 
the little creature is Yoda, the Jedi Master, and that he is speaking 
with Ben.

				BEN'S VOICE
		He will learn patience.

				YODA
		Hmmm.  Much anger in him, like his father.

				BEN'S VOICE
		Was I any different when you 
		taught me?

				YODA
		Hah.  He is not ready.

				LUKE
		Yoda!  I am ready.  I... Ben!  I 
		can be a Jedi.  Ben, tell him I'm 
		ready.

Trying to see Ben, Luke starts to get up but hits his head on the low 
ceiling.

				YODA
		Ready, are you?  What know you 
		of ready?  For eight hundred years 
		have I trained Jedi.  My own counsel 
		will I keep on who is to be trained!
		A Jedi must have the deepest 
		commitment, the most serious mind.
			(to the invisible 
			 Ben, indicating Luke)
		This one a long time have I watched.
		All his life has he looked away...
		to the future, to the horizon.
		Never his mind on where he was.
		Hmm?  What he was doing.  Hmph.  
		Adventure.  Heh!  Excitement.  Heh!  
		A Jedi craves not these things.
			(turning to Luke)
		You are reckless!

Luke looks down.  He knows it is true.

				BEN'S VOICE
		So was I, if you'll remember.

				YODA
		He is too old.  Yes, too old to 
		begin the training.

Luke thinks he detects a subtle softening in Yoda's voice.

				LUKE
		But I've learned so much.

Yoda turns his piercing gaze on Luke, as though the Jedi Master's huge 
eyes could somehow determine how much the boy had learned.  After a 
long moment, the little Jedi turns toward where he alone sees Ben.

				YODA
			(sighs)
		Will he finished what he begins?

				LUKE
		I won't fail you - I'm not afraid.

				YODA
			(turns slowly toward 
			 him)
		Oh, you will be.  You will be.

EXT. SPACE - STAR DESTROYERS - ASTEROID FIELD

The Imperial fleet around Vader's ship is surrounded by the asteroid 
storm.  Asteroids big and small pelt the vast exteriors of the menacing 
ships.  One of the smaller Imperial vessels is hit by a huge asteroid 
and explodes in a brilliant flash of light.

INT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

The cockpit is quiet and lit only by the indicator lights on the 
control panel.  Princess Leia sits in the pilot's seat.

She runs her hand across the control panel as she thinks of Han and the 
confusion he has created within her.  Suddenly, something outside the 
cockpit window catches her eye.  The reflection of the panel lights 
obscures her vision until a soft suctionlike cup attaches itself to the 
windscreen.  Leia
moves closer to see what it might be.  Large, yellow eyes flash open 
and stare back at her.  Startled, she jumps back into her seat, her 
heart pounding.  There is a scurry of feet and a loud screech, and in 
an instant the eyes are gone.  The young princess catches her breath, 
jumps out of her chair, and races from the cockpit.

INT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - HOLD AREA

The lights go bright for a second then out again.  Threepio and 
Chewbacca watch as Han finishes with some wires.

				THREEPIO
		Sir, if I may venture an opinion...

				HAN
		I'm not really interested in your 
		opinion, Threepio.

Leia rushes into the cabin just as Han drops the final floor panel into 
place.

				LEIA
			(out of breath)
		There's something out there.

				HAN
		Where?

				LEIA
		Outside, in the cave.

As she speaks, there comes a sharp banging on the hull.  Chewie looks 
up and barks anxiously.

				THREEPIO
		There it is.  Listen!  Listen!

				HAN
		I'm going out there.

				LEIA
		Are you crazy?!

				HAN
		I just got this bucket back 
		together.  I'm not going to let 
		something tear it apart.

He and Chewie grab their breath masks off a rack and hurry out.  Leia 
follows.

				LEIA
		Then I'm going with you.

				THREEPIO
		I think it might be better if I 
		stay here and guard the ship.
			(hears another 
			 mysterious noise)
		Oh, no.

EXT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON

It is very dark inside the huge asteroid cave, too dark to see what is 
attacking the ship.

Leia stamps her foot on the floor of the cave.

				LEIA
		This ground sure feels strange.
		It doesn't feel like rock at all.

Han kneels and studies the ground, then attempts to study the outline 
of the cave.

				HAN
		There's an awful lot of moisture 
		in here.

				LEIA
		I don't know.  I have a bad feeling 
		about this.

				HAN
		Yeah.

Chewie barks through his face mask, and points toward the ship's 
cockpit.  A five-foot-long shape can be seen moving across the top of 
the Falcon.  The leathery creature lets out a screech as Han blasts it 
with a laser bolt.

				HAN
			(to Leia)
		Watch out!

The black shape tumbles off the spaceship and onto the ground in front 
of the princess.  Han bends down to investigate the dead creature.

				HAN
		Yeah, that's what I thought.
		Mynock.  Chewie, check the rest 
		of the ship, make sure there 
		aren't any more attached.  They're 
		chewing on the power cables.

				LEIA
		Mynocks?

				HAN
		Go on inside.  We'll clean them 
		off if there are any more.

Just then, a swarm of the ugly creatures swoops through the air.  Leia 
puts her arms over her head to protect herself as she runs toward the 
ship.  Chewie shoos another Mynock away with his blaster.  Several of 
the batlike creatures flap their wings loudly against the cockpit 
window of the Falcon.  Inside, Threepio shudders at their presence.

				THREEPIO
		Ohhh!  Go away!  Go away!  Beastly 
		little thing.  Shoo!  Shoo!

Han looks around the strange, dripping cave.

				HAN
		Wait a minute...

He unholsters his blaster and fires at the far side of the huge cave.  
The cavern begins to shake and the ground starts to buckle.

Chewie barks and moves for the ship, followed closely by Leia and Han.  
The large wings of the Mynocks flap past them as they protect their 
faces and run up the platform.

INT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - ENTRY AREA

As soon as Han and Leia are on board, Chewie closes the main hatch.  
The ship continues to shake and heave.

				HAN
		All right, Chewie, let's get 
		out of here!

The Wookiee heads for the cockpit as Han, followed by Threepio, rushes 
to the hold area and checks the scopes on the control panel.  Leia 
hurries after.

				LEIA
		The Empire is still out there.
		I don't think it's wise to...

Han rushes past her and heads for the cockpit.

				HAN
			(interrupting)
		No time to discuss this in
		committee.

And with that he is gone.  The main engines of the Falcon begin to 
whine.  Leia races after him, bouncing around in the shaking ship.

				LEIA
			(angry)
		I am not a committee!

INT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Han is already in the pilot's seat pulling back on the throttle.  The 
cave-quake has greatly diminished.

				LEIA
		You can't make the jump to light-
		speed in this asteroid field...

				HAN
		Sit down, sweetheart.  We're 
		taking off!

As the ship begins to move forward, Chewie barks.  He notices something 
out the window ahead.  Threepio sees it too.

				THREEPIO
		Look!

				HAN
		I see it, I see it.

Suddenly, a row of jagged white stalagmites and stalactites can be seen 
surrounding the entrance.  And as the Falcon moves forward, the 
entrance to the cave grows ever smaller.  Han pulls hard on the 
throttle, sending his ship surging forward.

				THREEPIO
		We're doomed!

				LEIA
		The cave is collapsing.

				HAN
		This is no cave.

				LEIA
		What?

Leia's mouth drops open .  She sees that the rocks of the cave entrance 
are not rocks at all, but giant teeth, quickly closing around the tiny 
ship.  Chewie howls.

INT. SPACE SLUG MOUTH

The Millennium Falcon, zooming through the monster's mouth, rolls on 
its side and barely makes it between two of the gigantic white teeth 
before the huge jaws slams closed.

EXT. CAVE ENTRANCE - GIANT ASTEROID

The enormous space slug moves its head out of the cave as the Falcon 
flies out of its mouth.  The monster tilts its head, watching the 
starship fly away.

EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GIANT ASTEROID

The Falcon races out of the asteroid crater and into the deadly rain of 
the asteroid storm.

EXT. DAGOBAH - DAY

With Yoda strapped to his back, Luke climbs up one of the many thick 
vines that grow in the swamp.  Panting heavily, he continues his course 
- climbing, flipping through the air, jumping over roots, and racing in 
and out of the heavy ground fog.

				YODA
		Run!  Yes.  A Jedi's strength 
		flows from the Force.  But beware 
		of the dark side.  Anger... fear... 
		aggression.  The dark side of 
		the Force are they.
		Easily they flow, quick to join 
		you in a fight.  If once you 
		start down the dark path, forever 
		will it dominate your destiny, 
		consume you it will, as it did 
		Obi-Wan's apprentice.

				LUKE
		Vader.  Is the dark side stronger?

				YODA
		No... no... no.  Quicker, easier, 
		more seductive.

				LUKE
		But how am I to know the good side 
		from the bad?

				YODA
		You will know.  When you are calm, 
		at peace.  Passive.  A Jedi uses 
		the Force for knowledge and 
		defense, never for attack.

				LUKE
		But tell me why I can't...

				YODA
			(interrupting)
		No, no, there is no why.  Nothing 
		more will I teach you today.
		Clear your mind of questions.  
		Mmm.  Mmmmmmmm.

Artoo beeps in the distance as Luke lets Yoda down to the ground.  
Breathing heavily, he takes his shirt from a nearby tree branch and 
pulls it on.

He turns to see a huge, dead, black tree, its base surrounded by a few 
feet of water.  Giant, twisted roots form a dark and sinister cave on 
one side.  Luke stares at the tree, trembling.

				LUKE
		There's something not right here.

Yoda sits on a large root, poking his Gimer Stick into the dirt.

				LUKE
		I feel cold, death.

				YODA
		That place... is strong with the 
		dark side of the Force.  A domain 
		of evil it is.  In you must go.

				LUKE
		What's in there?

				YODA
		Only what you take with you.

Luke looks warily between the tree and Yoda.  He starts to strap on his 
weapon belt.

				YODA
		Your weapons... you will not 
		need them.

Luke gives the tree a long look, than shakes his head "no."  Yoda 
shrugs.  Luke reaches up to brush aside some hanging vines and enters 
the tree.

INT. DAGOBAH - TREE CAVE

Luke moves into the almost total darkness of the wet and slimy cave.  
The youth can barely make out the edge of the passage.  Holding his lit 
saber before him, he sees a lizard crawling up the side of the cave and 
a snake wrapped around the branches of a tree.  Luke draws a deep 
breath, then pushes deeper into the cave.

The space widens around him, but he feels that rather than sees it.  
His sword casts the only light as he peers into the darkness.  It is 
very quiet here.

Then, a loud HISS! Darth Vader appears across the blackness, 
illuminated by his own just-ignited laser sword.  Immediately, he 
charges Luke, saber held high.  He is upon the youth in seconds, but 
Luke sidesteps perfectly and slashes at Vader with his sword.

Vader is decapitated.  His helmet-encased head flies from his shoulders 
as his body disappears into the darkness.  The metallic banging of the 
helmet fills the cave as Vader's head spins and bounces, smashes on the 
floor, and finally stops. For an instant it rests on the floor, then it 
cracks vertically.  The black helmet and breath mask fall away to 
reveal... Luke's head.

Across the space, the standing Luke gasps at the sight, wide-eyed in 
terror.

The decapitated head fades away, as in a vision.

EXT. DAGOBAH - CAVE - DUSK

Meanwhile, Yoda sits on the root, calmly leaning on his Gimer Stick.

EXT. SPACE - VADER'S STAR DESTROYER

Vader's Imperial Star Destroyer moves through space, guarded by its 
convoy of TIE fighters.

INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE - CONTROL DECK

Vader stands in the back control area of his ship's bridge with a 
motley group of men and creatures.  Admiral Piett and two controllers 
stand at the front of the bridge and watch the group with scorn.

				PIETT
		Bounty hunters.  We don't need 
		that scum.

				FIRST CONTROLLER
		Yes, sir.

				PIETT
		Those Rebels won't escape us.

A second controller interrupts.

				SECOND CONTROLLER
		Sir, we have a priority signal 
		from the Star Destroyer Avenger.

				PIETT
		Right.

The group standing before Vader is a bizarre array of galactic fortune 
hunters  There is Bossk, a slimy, tentacled monster with two huge, 
bloodshot eyes in a soft baggy face; Zuckuss and Dengar, two battle-
scarred, mangy human types; IG-88, a battered, tarnished chrome war 
droid; and Boba Fett, a man in a weapon-covered armored space suit.

				VADER
		... there will be a substantial 
		reward for the one who finds the 
		Millennium Falcon.  You are free 
		to use any methods necessary, but 
		I want them alive.  No disintegrations.

				BOBA FETT
		As you wish.

At that moment, Admiral Piett approaches Vader in a rush of excitement.

				PIETT
		Lord Vader!  My lord, we have 
		them.

EXT. IMPERIAL STAR DESTROYER, AVENGER - ASTEROID BELT

The Millennium Falcon speeds through deep space, closely followed by a 
firing Imperial Star Destroyer.  A large asteroid about the same size 
as the Falcon tumbles rapidly toward the starship.  The tiny Falcon 
banks to avoid the giant asteroid as smaller rocks pelt its surface.  
Then the small craft roars under the asteroid which explodes harmlessly 
on the hull of the vast Star Destroyer.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

The ship shudders as flak explodes near the cockpit window.  Threepio 
checks a tracking scope an the side control panel while Leia watches 
tensely out the window.

				THREEPIO
		Oh, thank goodness we're coming 
		out of the asteroid field.

Chewie barks excitedly as the rain of asteroids begins to subside.  A 
bolt from the Star Destroyer sets up a fiery explosion on the back side 
of the Falcon, causing it to lurch to one side.

EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - STAR DESTROYER, AVENGER - ASTEROID FIELD

The Falcon is hit hard by another bolt from the Star Destroyer which 
creates a huge explosion near the cockpit of the smaller ship.  The 
Falcon tilts steeply, then rights itself.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Han corrects the angle of his ship.

				HAN
		Let's get out of here.  Ready for 
		light-speed?  One... two... three!

Han pulls back on the hyperspace throttle and - nothing happens.  Flak 
bursts continue to rock the ship.

				HAN
			(frantic)
		It's not fair!

Chewie is very angry and starts to growl and bark at his friend and 
captain.  Again, Han desperately pulls back on the throttle.

				HAN
		The transfer circuits are working.
		It's not my fault!

Chewie puts his head in his hands, whining.

				LEIA
			(almost expecting 
			 it)
		No light-speed?

				HAN
		It's not my fault.

				THREEPIO
		Sir, we just lost the main rear 
		deflector shield.  One more direct 
		hit on the back quarter and we're 
		done for.

Han pauses for a moment, makes a decision, and pulls back on a lever.

				HAN
		Turn her around.

Chewie barks in puzzlement.

				HAN
		I said turn her around!  I'm 
		going to put all power in the 
		front shield.

				LEIA
		You're going to attack them?!

				THREEPIO
		Sir, the odds of surviving a 
		direct assault on an Imperial 
		Star Destroyer...

				LEIA
		Shut up!

EXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - ASTEROID FIELD

The Falcon banks, makes a steep, twisting turn.  In the next moment it 
is racing toward the Star Destroyer, looking very small against the 
massive surface of the Imperial ship.  As it moves across the surface 
of the Star Destroyer, the Falcon bobs and weaves to avoid the numerous 
flak bursts.

INT. STAR DESTROYER, AVENGER - BRIDGE

The tiny Falcon heads directly for the Avenger's bridge.  The Imperials 
stationed there are stunned to see the small spaceship racing low 
across the hull, headed directly at the huge windows of the bridge 
area.  Alarms go off everywhere.  The Destroyer's commander, Captain 
Needa, can scarcely believe his eyes.

				NEEDA
		They're moving to attack 
		position!  Shields up!

Needa and his men duck as the Falcon nears the bridge window.  At the 
last minute, the Falcon veers off and out of sight.  All is quiet.

				NEEDA
		Track them.  They may come 
		around for another pass.

				TRACKING OFFICER
		Captain Needa, the ship no longer 
		appears on our scopes.

				NEEDA
		They can't have disappeared.  No 
		ship that small has a cloaking 
		device.

				TRACKING OFFICER
		Well, there's no trace of them, 
		sir.

				COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER
		Captain, Lord Vader demands an 
		update on the pursuit.

				NEEDA
			(drawing a breath)
		Get a shuttle ready.  I shall 
		assume full responsibility for 
		losing them, and apologize to Lord 
		Vader. Meanwhile, continue to 
		scan the area.

				COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER
		Yes, Captain Needa.

EXT. DAGOBAH - BOG - DAY

Luke's face is upside-down and showing enormous strain.  He stands on 
his hands, with Yoda perched on his feet.  Opposite Luke and Yoda are 
two rocks the size of bowling balls.  Luke stares at the rocks and 
concentrates.  One of the rocks lifts from the ground and floats up to 
rest on the other.

				YODA
		Use the Force.  Yes...

Yoda taps Luke's leg.  Quickly, Luke lifts one hand from the ground.  
His body wavers, but he maintains his balance.  Artoo, standing nearby, 
is whistling and beeping frantically.

				YODA
		Now... the stone.  Feel it.

Luke concentrates on trying to lift the top rock.  It rises a few feet, 
shaking under the strain.  But, distracted by Artoo's frantic beeping, 
Luke loses his balance and finally collapses.  Yoda jumps clear.

				YODA
		Concentrate!

Annoyed at the disturbance, Luke looks over at Artoo, who is rocking 
urgently back and forth in front of him.

Artoo waddles closer to Luke, chirping wildly, then scoots over the 
edge of the swamp.  Catching on, Luke rushes to the water's edge.  The 
X-wing fighter has sunk, and only the tip of its nose shows above the 
lake's surface.

				LUKE
		Oh, no.  We'll never get it out 
		now.

Yoda stamps his foot in irritation.

				YODA
		So certain are you.  Always with 
		you it cannot be done.  Hear you
		nothing that I say?

Luke looks uncertainly out at the ship.

				LUKE
		Master, moving stones around is 
		one thing.  This is totally 
		different.

				YODA
		No!  No different!  Only different 
		in your mind.  You must unlearn 
		what you have learned.

				LUKE
			(focusing, quietly)
		All right, I'll give it a try.

				YODA
		No!  Try not.  Do.  Or do not.  
		There is no try.

Luke closes his eyes and concentrates on thinking the ship out.

Slowly, the X-wing's nose begins to rise above the water.  It hovers 
for a moment and then slides back, disappearing once again.

				LUKE
			(panting heavily)
		I can't.  It's too big.

				YODA
		Size matters not.  Look at me.  
		Judge me by my size, do you?  
		Hm?  Mmmm.

Luke shakes his head.

				YODA
		And well you should not.  For my 
		ally in the Force.  And a powerful 
		ally it is.  Life creates it, makes 
		it grow.  Its energy surrounds us 
		and binds us.  Luminous beings 
		are we...
			(Yoda pinches 
			 Luke's shoulder)
		... not this crude matter.
			(a sweeping gesture)
		You must feel the Force around you.
			(gesturing)
		Here, between you... me... the 
		tree... the rock... everywhere!  
		Yes, even between this land and 
		that ship!

				LUKE
			(discouraged)
		You want the impossible.

Quietly Yoda turns toward the X-wing fighter.  With his eyes closed and 
his head bowed, he raises his arm and points at the ship.

Soon, the fighter rises above the water and moves forward as Artoo 
beeps in terror and scoots away.

The entire X-wing moves majestically, surely, toward the shore.  Yoda 
stands on a tree root and guides the fighter carefully down toward the 
beach.

Luke stares in astonishment as the fighter settles down onto the shore.  
He walks toward Yoda.

				LUKE
		I don't... I don't believe it.

				YODA
		That is why you fail.

Luke shakes his head, bewildered.

EXT. SPACE - IMPERIAL FLEET

The fleet around Vader's Star Destroyer now includes Needa's Star 
Destroyer, the Avenger.

INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE

				VADER
		Apology accepted, Captain Needa.

Clutching desperately at his throat, Captain Needa slumps down, then 
falls over on his back, at the feet of Darth Vader.  Two stormtroopers 
pick up the lifeless body and carry it quickly away as Admiral Piett 
and two of his captains hurry up to the Dark Lord.

				PIETT
		Lord Vader, our ships have 
		completed their scan of the area 
		and found nothing.  If the 
		Millennium Falcon went into light-
		speed, it'll be on the other side 
		of the galaxy by now.

				VADER
		Alert all commands.  Calculate 
		every possible destination along 
		their last know trajectory.

				PIETT
		Yes, my lord.  We'll find them.

				VADER
		Don't fail me again, Admiral.

Vader exits as the admiral turns to an aide, a little more uneasy than 
when he arrived.

				PIETT
		Alert all commands.  Deploy the fleet.

EXT. SPACE - IMPERIAL FLEET

Vader's ship moves away, flanked by its fleet of smaller ships.  the 
Avenger glides off into space in the opposite direction.  No one on 
that ship or on Vader's is aware that, clinging to the side of the 
Avenger, is the pirateship, the Millennium Falcon.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

				THREEPIO
		Captain Solo, this time you have 
		gone too far.
			(Chewie growls)
		No, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca.
		Why doesn't anyone listen to me?

				HAN
			(to Chewie)
		The fleet is beginning to break 
		up.  Go back and stand by the 
		manual release for the landing claw.

Chewie barks, struggles from his seat, and climbs out of the cabin.

				THREEPIO
		I really don't see how that is 
		going to help.  Surrender is a 
		perfectly acceptable alternative 
		in extreme circumstances.  The 
		Empire may be gracious enough...

Leia reaches over and shuts off Threepio, mid-sentence.

				HAN
		Thank you.

				LEIA
		What did you have in mind for 
		your next move?

				HAN
		Well, if they follow standard 
		Imperial procedure, they'll dump 
		their garbage before they go to 
		light-speed, then we just float 
		away.

				LEIA
		With the rest of the garbage.
		Then what?

				HAN
		Then we've got to find a safe 
		port somewhere around here.  Got 
		any ideas?

				LEIA
		No.  Where are we?

				HAN
		The Anoat system.

				LEIA
		Anoat system.  There's not much 
		there.

				HAN
		No.  Well, wait.  This is 
		interesting.  Lando.

He points to a computer mapscreen on the control panel.  Leia slips out 
of her chair and moves next to the handsome pilot.  Small light points 
representing several systems flash by on the computer screen.

				LEIA
		Lando system?

				HAN
		Lando's not a system, he's a man.
		Lando Calrissian.  He's a card 
		player, gambler, scoundrel.  You'd 
		like him.

				LEIA
		Thanks.

				HAN
		Bespin.  It's pretty far, but I 
		think we can make it.

				LEIA
			(reading from the 
			 computer)
		A mining colony?

				HAN
		Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.  Lando 
		conned somebody out of it.  We 
		go back a long way, Lando and me.

				LEIA
		Can you trust him?

				HAN
		No.  But he has no love for the
		Empire, I can tell you that.

Chewie barks over the intercom.  Han quickly changes his readouts and 
stretches to look out the cockpit window.

				HAN
			(into intercom)
		Here we go, Chewie.  Stand by.
		Detach!

Han leans back in his chair and gives Leia an invisible smile.  She 
thinks for a moment, shakes her head; a grin creeps across her face and 
she gives him a quick kiss.

				LEIA
		You do have your moments.  Not 
		many, but you have them.

EXT. SPACE - IMPERIAL STAR DESTROYER

As the Avenger Star Destroyer moves slowly into space, the hatch on its 
underbelly opens, sending a trail of junk behind it.  Hidden among the 
refuse, the Falcon tumbles away.  In the next moment, the Avenger roars 
off into hyperspace.  The Falcon's engines are ignited, and it races 
off into the distance.  Amidst the slowly drifting junk, Boba Fett's 
ship appears and moves after the Falcon.

EXT. DAGOBAH - BOG - CLEARING - DAY

In the clearing behind Yoda's house, Luke again stands upside-down, but 
his face shows less strain and more concentration than before.  Yoda 
sits on the ground below the young warrior.  On the other side of the 
clearing, two equipment cases slowly rise into the air.  Nearby Artoo 
watches, humming to himself, when suddenly he, too, rises into the air.  
His little legs kick desperately and his head turns frantically, 
looking for help.

				YODA
		Concentrate... feel the Force 
		flow.  Yes.  Good.  Calm, yes.  
		Through the Force, things you 
		will see.  Other places.  The 
		future... the past.  Old friends 
		long gone.

Luke suddenly becomes distressed.

				LUKE
		Han!  Leia!

The two packing boxes and Artoo fall to the ground with a crash, then 
Luke himself tumbles over.

				YODA
			(shaking his head)
		Hmm.  Control, control.  You must 
		learn control.

				LUKE
		I saw... I saw a city in the 
		clouds.

				YODA
		Mmm.  Friends you have there.

				LUKE
		They were in pain.

				YODA
It is the future you see.

				LUKE
		Future?  Will they die?

Yoda closes his eyes and lowers his head.

				YODA
		Difficult to see.  Always in 
		motion is the future.

				LUKE
		I've got to go to them.

				YODA
		Decide you must how to serve 
		them best.  If you leave now, 
		help them you could.  But you 
		would destroy all for which they 
		have fought and suffered.

Luke is stopped cold by Yoda's words.  Gloom shrouds him as he nods his 
head sadly.

EXT. BESPIN SYSTEM - MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAWN

The powerful pirate starship blasts through space as it heads toward 
the soft pink planet of Bespin.

EXT. BESPIN SURFACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON

It is down on the gaseous planet.  Huge billowing clouds form a canyon 
as the ship banks around them, heading toward the system's Cloud City.

Suddenly, two twin-pod cloud cars appear and move toward the Falcon.  
The cloud cars draw up alongside the starship.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

One of the cloud cars opens fire on the Falcon, its flak rocking the 
ship.  Chewie barks his concern.

				HAN
			(into transmitter)
		No, I don't have a landing 
		permit.  I'm trying to reach 
		Lando Calrissian.

More flak bursts outside the cockpit window and rattles the ship's 
interior.  Leia looks worried.

				HAN
			(into transmitter)
		Whoa!  Wait a minute!  Let me 
		explain.

				INTERCOM VOICE
		You will not deviate from your 
		present course.

				THREEPIO
		Rather touchy, aren't they?

				LEIA
		I thought you knew this person.

Chewie barks and growls at his boss.

				HAN
			(to Chewie)
		Well, that was a long time ago.
		I'm sure he's forgotten about 
		that.

				INTERCOM VOICE
		Permission granted to land on 
		Platform Three-two-seven.

				HAN
			(into transmitter)
		Thank you.

Angry, Han snaps off the intercom.  Chewie looks at him and grunts.  
Han turns to the worried princess and her droid.

				HAN
		There's nothing to worry about.
		We go way back, Lando and me.

Leia doesn't look convinced.

				LEIA
		Who's worried?

EXT. CLOUD CITY - MILLENNIUM FALCON - CLOUD CARS

The clouds part to reveal a full view of the city as it bobs in and out 
of the cloud surface.  The cloud cars and the Falcon head for the 
gleaming white metropolis.

EXT. CLOUD CITY - LANDING PLATFORM - MILLENNIUM FALCON

With the cloud cars still guarding it, the Falcon lands on one of the 
Cloud City's platforms.

EXT. LANDING PLATFORM - DOOR OF MILLENNIUM FALCON

Han and Leia stand at the open door, armed.  Behind them, Chewie, also 
armed, surveys the scene warily.

				THREEPIO
		Oh.  No one to meet us.

				LEIA
		I don't like this.

				HAN
		Well, what would you like?

				THREEPIO
		Well, they did let us land.

				HAN
		Look, don't worry.  Everything's 
		going to be fine.  Trust me.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR - DAY

Lando Calrissian, a suave, dashing black man in his thirties, leads a 
group of aides and some Cloud City guard rapidly toward the landing 
platform.

The group, like the other citizens of the city, is a motley collection 
of aliens, droids, and humans of all descriptions.  Lando has a grim 
expression on his face as he moves onto the landing platform.

EXT. LANDING PLATFORM - DOOR OF MILLENNIUM FALCON

				HAN
		See?  My friend.
			(to Chewie)
		Keep your eyes open, okay?

Chewie growls as Han walks down the ramp.  Lando and his men head 
across the bridge to meet the space pirate.

EXT. CLOUD CITY - LANDING PLATFORM

Lando stops ten feet from Han.  The two men eye each other carefully.  
Lando shakes his head.

				LANDO
		Why, you slimy, double-crossing, 
		no-good swindler!  You've got a 
		lot of guts coming here, after 
		what you pulled.

Han points to himself innocently, mouthing, "Me?"

Lando moves threateningly toward Han.  Suddenly, he throws his arms 
around his startled, long-lost friend and embraces him.

				LANDO
			(laughs)
		How you doing, you old pirate? 
		So good to see you!  I never thought 
		I'd catch up with you again.  Where 
		you been?

The two old friends embrace, laughing and chuckling.

EXT. LANDING PLATFORM - DOOR OF MILLENNIUM FALCON.

				THREEPIO
Well, he seems very friendly.

				LEIA
			(wary)
		Yes... very friendly.

EXT. CLOUD CITY - LANDING PLATFORM

				LANDO
		What are you doing here?

				HAN
			(gestures toward 
			 the Falcon)
		Ahh... repairs.  I thought you 
		could help me out.

				LANDO
			(in mock panic)
		What have you done to my ship?

				HAN
		Your ship?  Hey, remember, you 
		lost her to me fair and square.

Chewie growls a reserved greeting.  Lando suddenly notices the princess 
and smiles.

				LANDO
		Hello.  What have we here?  
		Welcome.  I'm Lando Calrissian.
		I'm the administrator of this 
		facility.  And who might you be?

				LEIA
		Leia.

				LANDO
		Welcome, Leia.

Lando bows before Leia and kisses her hand.

				HAN
		All right, all right, you old 
		smoothie.

Han takes Leia by the hand and steers her away from Lando.

				THREEPIO
		Hello, sir.  I am See-Threepio, 
		human-cyborg relations.  My 
		facilities are at your...

Before Threepio can finish his self-introduction, Lando has turned to 
follow Han and Leia, who are walking toward the city.

				THREEPIO
		Well, really!

Lando, his aide, Lobot, and Han lead the way across the bridge, 
followed by Threepio, Chewie and Leia.

				LANDO
		What's wrong with the Falcon?

				HAN
		Hyperdrive.

				LANDO
		I'll get my people to work on it.

				HAN
		Good.

Lando turns to Leia.

				LANDO
		You know, that ship saved my life 
		quite a few times.  She's the 
		fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR

The group has crossed the narrow bridge and entered the city.  They 
walk down the lovely Art Deco passageway, rounding several corners and 
passing many small plazas as they go.  Threepio lags a bit behind.

				HAN
		How's the gas mine?  Is it 
		paying off for you?

				LANDO
		Oh, not as well as I'd like.
		We're a small outpost and not 
		very self-sufficient.  And I've 
		had supply problems of every kind.
		I've had labor difficulties...
			(catches Han 
			 grinning at him)
		What's so funny?

				HAN
		You.  Listen to you - you sound 
		like a businessman, a responsible 
		leader.  Who'd have thought that, 
		huh?

Lando is reflective.  He looks at Han a moment.

				LANDO
		You know, seeing you sure 
		brings back a few things.

				HAN
		Yeah.

				LANDO
			(shakes his head)
		Yeah.  I'm responsible these days.
		It's the price you pay for being 
		successful.

Han and Lando laugh together, and the group moves on through the 
corridor.

The lagging Threepio passes a Threepio-type silver droid who is coming 
out of a door.

				THREEPIO
		Oh!  Nice to see a familiar face.

				SECOND THREEPIO
			(mumbles)
		E chu ta!

				THREEPIO
		How rude!

Threepio stops, watching the silver droid move away.  Then he hears the 
muffled beeping and whistling of an R2 unit coming from within the 
room.

INT. CLOUD CITY - ANTEROOM

Curious, Threepio enters the room.

				THREEPIO
		That sounds like an R2 unit in 
		there.  I wonder if...

Threepio walks through the doorway to the main room.  He looks in.

				THREEPIO
		Hello?  How interesting.  Oh, my.

				MAN'S VOICE
			(from within)
		Who are you?

				THREEPIO
		Oh, I'm terribly sorry.  I... I 
		didn't mean to intrude.  No, no, 
		please don't get up.  No!

A laser bolt to Threepio's chest sends him flying in twenty directions.  
Smoldering mechanical arms and legs bounce off the walls as the door 
whooshes closed behind him.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR

Lando, Han, and Leia continue down the corridor unaware of Threepio's 
dreadful accident.  Chewbacca glances around, sniffs the air, but 
shrugs his shoulders and follows the group.

EXT. DAGOBAH - BOG - DUSK

In the bright lights of the fighter, Luke loads a heavy case into the 
belly of the ship.  Artoo sits on top of the X-wing, settling down into 
his cubbyhole.  Yoda stands nearby on a log.

				YODA
		Luke!  You must complete the 
		training.

				LUKE
		I can't keep the vision out of my 
		head.  They're my friends.  I've 
		got to help them.

				YODA
		You must not go!

				LUKE
		But Han and Leia will die if I 
		don't.

				BEN'S VOICE
		You don't know that.

Luke looks toward the voice in amazement.  Ben has materialized as a 
real, slightly shimmering image near Yoda.  The power of his presence 
stops Luke.

				BEN
		Even Yoda cannot see their fate.

				LUKE
		But I can help them!  I feel 
		the Force!

				BEN
		But you cannot control it.  This 
		is a dangerous time for you, 
		when you will be tempted by the 
		dark side of the Force.

				YODA
		Yes, yes.  To Obi-Wan you listen.
		The cave.  Remember your failure 
		at the cave!

				LUKE
		But I've learned so much since 
		then.  Master Yoda, I promise to 
		return and finish what I've begun. 
		You have my word.

				BEN
		It is you and your abilities the 
		Emperor wants.  that is why your 
		friends are made to suffer.

				LUKE
		And that is why I have to go.

				BEN
		Luke, I don't want to lose you to 
		the Emperor the way I lost Vader.

				LUKE
		You won't.

				YODA
		Stopped they must be.  On this 
		all depends.  Only a fully trained 
		Jedi Knight with the Force as his 
		ally will conquer Vader and his 
		Emperor.  If you end your training 
		now, if you choose the quick and 
		easy path, as Vader did, you will 
		become an agent of evil.

				BEN
		Patience.

				LUKE
		And sacrifice Han and Leia?

				YODA
		If you honor what they fight for
		... yes!

Luke is in great anguish.  He struggles with the dilemma, a battle 
raging in his mind.

				BEN
		If you choose to face Vader, you 
		will do it alone.  I cannot 
		interfere.

				LUKE
		I understand.
			(he moves to his 
			 X-wing)
		Artoo, fire up the converters.

Artoo whistles a happy reply.

				BEN
		Luke, don't give in to hate - 
		that leads to the dark side.

Luke nods and climbs into his ship.

				YODA
		Strong is Vader.  Mind what you 
		have learned.  Save you it can.

				LUKE
		I will.  And I'll return.  I promise.

Artoo closes the cockpit.  Ben and Yoda stand watching as the roar of 
the engines and the wind engulf them.

				YODA
			(sighs)
		Told you, I did.  Reckless is 
		he.  Now matters are worse.

				BEN
		That boy is our last hope.

				YODA
			(looks up)
		No.  There is another.

EXT. SPACE - PLANET DAGOBAH

Luke's tiny X-wing rockets away from the green planet of Dagobah and 
off into space.

INT. CLOUD CITY - LIVING QUARTERS - DAY

Within the quarters assigned her on Cloud City, Leia paces in 
agitation.  She has changed from her cold-weather pants and jacket to a 
lovely dress.  Her hair is down, tied back with ribbons.  She moves 
from a large, open window and turns to see Han entering through the 
doorway.

				HAN
		The ship is almost finished.
		Two or Three more things and 
		we're in great shape.

				LEIA
		The sooner the better.  Something's 
		wrong here.  No one has seen or 
		knows anything about Threepio.
		He's been gone too long to have 
		gotten lost.

Han takes Leia by the shoulders and gently kisses her forehead.

				HAN
		Relax.  I'll talk to Lando and 
		see what I can find out.

				LEIA
		I don't trust Lando.

				HAN
		Well, I don't trust him, either.
		But he is my friend.  Besides, 
		we'll soon be gone.

				LEIA
		And then you're as good as gone, 
		aren't you?

Not speaking, Han considers her words and gazes at her troubled face.

INT. CLOUD CITY - JUNK ROOM

The room is piled high with broken and discarded machine parts.  Four 
Ugnaughts, small hoglike creatures, separate the junk and throw some 
pieces onto a conveyer belt which moves briskly toward a pit of molten 
metal.  Pieces of Threepio's golden body move down the belt.  Chewie 
enters the room and spots an Ugnaught picking up and inspecting 
Threepio's head.  The Wookiee barks a command, startling the Ugnaught, 
then reaches to grab the head.  But the Ugnaught tosses it away from 
him to another Ugnaught.  This game of keep-away goes on until 
Threepio's head falls from their grip and bounces with a clang onto the 
ground.

INT. CLOUD CITY - LIVING QUARTERS - DAY

The door zaps open.  Chewbacca walks in, carrying a packing case of 
Threepio, arms and legs hanging over the edge.

				LEIA
		What happened?

Chewie sets the case on a table, grunting and groaning an explanation.

				HAN
		Where?  Found him in a junk pile?

				LEIA
		Oh, what a mess.  Chewie, do you 
		think you can repair him?

The giant Wookiee studies the array of robot parts.  He looks at the 
princess and shrugs sadly.

				HAN
		Lando's got people who can fix 
		him.

				LEIA
		No, thanks.

There is a buzz and the door slides open, revealing Lando.

				LANDO
		I'm sorry.  Am I interrupting 
		anything?

				LEIA
		Not really.

				LANDO
		You look absolutely beautiful.
		You truly belong here with us 
		among the clouds.

				LEIA
			(coolly)
		Thank you.

				LANDO
		Will you join me for a little 
		refreshment?

Han looks at Lando suspiciously, but Chewie barks at the mention of 
food and licks his lips.

				LANDO
		Everyone's invited, of course.

Leia takes Lando's proffered arm, and the group turns to go.  Lando 
spots Threepio's remains.

				LANDO
		Having trouble with you droid?

Han and Leia exchange a quick glance.

				HAN
		No.  No problem.  Why?

Han and Leia move arm-in-arm through the door, followed by Lando and 
Chewie.  The door slides closed behind them.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR - DAY

Leia walks between Han and Lando as Chewie follows a short distance 
behind.  Long shafts of light pour across the corridor between tall, 
pure-white columns.

				LANDO
		So you see, since we're a small 
		operation, we don't fall into 
		the... uh... jurisdiction of the 
		Empire.

				LEIA
		So you're part of the mining 
		guild then?

				LANDO
		No, not actually.  Our operation 
		is small enough not to be noticed... 
		which is advantageous for everybody 
		since our customers are anxious 
		to avoid attracting attention to 
		themselves.

The group walks into another corridor and heads for a huge doorway at 
the far end.

				HAN
		Aren't you afraid the Empire's 
		going to find out about this 
		little operation and shut you down?

				LANDO
		That's always been a danger looming 
		like a shadow over everything we've 
		built here.  But things have 
		developed that will insure security.
		I've just made a deal that will 
		keep the Empire out of here forever.

INT. CLOUD CITY - DINING ROOM

The mighty doors to the dining room slide open and the group enters the 
dining room.  At the far end of a huge banquet table sits Darth Vader.  
Standing at his side and slightly behind him is Boba Fett, the bounty 
hunter.

Faster than the wink of an eye, Han draws his blaster and pops off a 
couple of shots directly at Vader.  The Dark Lord quickly raises his 
hand, deflecting the bolts into one of the side walls, where they 
explode harmlessly.  Just as quickly, Han's weapon zips into Vader's 
hand.  The evil presence calmly places the gun on the table in front of 
him.

				VADER
		We would be honored if you would 
		join us.

Han gives Lando a mean look.

				LANDO
		I had no choice.  They arrived 
right before you did.  I'm sorry.
		
				HAN
		I'm sorry, too.

EXT.  LUKE'S X-WING - BESPIN SYSTEM

Luke's X-wing races through thick clouds toward Cloud City.

INT.  LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT

Luke is grim-faced as he pilots his course toward Bespin's shining 
city.  Artoo's beeps and whistles are transmitted onto the scope.

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		No, Threepio's with them.

Artoo whistles another worried inquiry.

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		Just hang on.  We're almost there.

INT. CLOUD CITY - LARGE CELL

Chewbacca is in a Cloud City prison cell.  The stark room is flooded 
with hot light.  To add to Chewie's misery, a high-pitched whistle 
screeches loudly.  Chewie is going mad.  He hits the wall with giant 
fists as he paces back and forth across the cell floor.  The upper 
lights go off abruptly.  The prisoner rubs his eyes and moves to a 
wall, where he listens for a moment.  Then, moaning to himself, he 
moves to a platform where the disassembled pieces of Threepio lie.  He 
picks up the golden droid's head and meditates on it for a moment, 
barking a few philosophical remarks.  Chewie sticks the robot's head on 
its torso and starts adjusting wires and circuits.

Suddenly, the lights in Threepio's eyes spark to life as Chewie touches 
two connectors together.  Threepio immediately begins to speak, but his 
voice is so slow and so low as to be nearly unintelligible.

				THREEPIO
		Mmmm.  Oh, my.  Uh, I, uh - Take 
		this off!  I, uh, don't mean to 
		intrude here.  I, don't, no, no, 
		no... Please don't get up.  No!

Chewie looks at Threepio in bewilderment, then scratches his furry 
head.  He gets an idea and adjusts some connections, whereupon Threepio 
immediately begins speaking normally.

				THREEPIO
		Stormtroopers?  Here?  We're in 
		danger.  I must tell the others.
		Oh, no!  I've been shot!

INT. CLOUD CITY - PRISON ENTRY AREA

Darth Vader strides through the room as two stormtroopers prepare an 
elaborate torture mechanism.  Han is strapped to a rack which tilts 
forward onto the torture device.  Vader activates the mechanism, 
creating two bursts of sparks, one of which strikes Han's face.

The door opens, and Vader leaves the torture room just as Han screams a 
sharp, piercing cry of agony.  Darth Vader moves to the holding 
chamber, where Lando and Boba Fett await him.

INT. CLOUD CITY - HOLDING CHAMBER

				LANDO
		Lord Vader.

				VADER
			(to Fett)
		You may take Captain Solo to 
		Jabba the Hut after I have 
		Skywalker.

Han's screams filter through the torture room door.

				BOBA FETT
		He's no good to me dead.

				VADER
		He will not be permanently damaged.

				LANDO
		Lord Vader, what about Leia and 
		the Wookiee?

				VADER
		They must never again leave this 
		city.

				LANDO
		That was never a condition of our 
		agreement, nor was giving Han to 
		this bounty hunter!

				VADER
		Perhaps you think you're being 
		treated unfairly.

				LANDO
		No.

				VADER
		Good.  It would be unfortunate if 
		I had to leave a garrison here.

Vader turns and sweeps into the elevator with Boba Fett.  Lando walks 
swiftly down another corridor, muttering to himself.

				LANDO
		This deal's getting worse all 
		the time.

INT. CLOUD CITY - LARGE CELL

Chewie now has a little more of Threepio back together.  One arm is 
connected, but the legs are yet to be attached.  There is one small 
problem, however.  It seems the Wookiee has managed to put the droid's 
head on backwards.

				THREEPIO
		Oh, yes, that's very good.  I like 
		that.  Oh!  Something's not right 
		because now I can't see.  Wait.  
		Wait!  Oh, my!  what have you done?  
		I'm backwards, you stupid furball.  
		Only an overgrown mophead like you 
		would be stupid enough...

Threepio is cut off in mid-sentence as Chewie angrily deactivates a 
circuit and the droid shuts down.  The Wookiee smells something and 
sits up.  The door to the chamber slides open and a ragged Han Solo is 
shoved into the room by two stormtroopers.  Barking his concern, the 
huge Wookiee gives Han a big hug.  Han is very pale, with dark circles 
under his eyes.

				HAN
		I feel terrible.

Chewie helps Han to a platform and then turns as the door slides open 
revealing Leia.  She, too, looks a little worse for wear.  The troopers 
push her into the cell, and the door slides closed.  She moves to Han, 
who is lying on the platform, and kneels next to him, gently stroking 
his head.

				LEIA
		Why are they doing this?

				HAN
		They never even asked me any 
		questions.

The cell door slides open.  Lando and two of his guards enter.

				LEIA
		Lando.

				HAN
		Get out of here, Lando!

				LANDO
		Shut up and listen!  Vader has 
		agreed to turn Leia and Chewie 
		over to me.

				HAN
		Over to you?

				LANDO
		They'll have to stay here, but at 
		least they'll be safe.

				LEIA
		What about Han?

				LANDO
		Vader's giving him to the bounty 
		hunter.

				LEIA
		Vader wants us all dead.

				LANDO
		He doesn't want you at all.  He's 
		after somebody called Skywalker.

				HAN
		Luke?

				LANDO
		Lord Vader has set a trap for him.

Leia's mind is racing.

				LEIA
		And we're the bait.

				LANDO
		Well, he's on his way.

Han's rage peaks.

				HAN
		Perfect.  You fixed us all pretty 
		good, didn't you?
			(spits it out)
		My friend!

Han hauls off and punches Lando.  The two friends are instantly engaged 
in a frantic close-quarters fight.  The guards hit Han with their rifle 
butts and he flies across the room.  Chewie growls and starts for the 
guards.  They point their laser weapons at the giant Wookiee, but Lando 
stops them.

				LANDO
		Stop!  I've done all I can.  I'm 
		sorry I couldn't do better, but 
		I have my own problems.

				HAN
		Yeah, you're a real hero.

Lando and the guards leave.  Han wipes the blood from his chin as Leia 
and Chewie help him up.

				LEIA
			(dabs at his wound)
		You certainly have a way with 
		people.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER

Four armor-suited stormtroopers stand at the ready in the large 
chamber, which is filled with pipes and chemical tanks.  In the middle 
of the room is a round pit housing a hydraulic platform.  Darth Vader 
and Lando stand near the platform.

				VADER
		This facility is crude, but it 
		should be adequate to freeze 
		Skywalker for his journey to the 
		Emperor.

An Imperial soldier appears.

				IMPERIAL SOLDIER
		Lord Vader, ship approaching.
		X-wing class.

				VADER
		Good.  Monitor Skywalker and allow 
		him to land.

The soldier bows and leaves the chamber.

				LANDO
		Lord Vader, we only use this 
		facility for carbon freezing.  If 
		you put him in there, it might 
		kill him.

				VADER
		I do not want the Emperor's prize 
		damaged.  We will test it... on 
		Captain Solo.

Lando's face registers dismay.

EXT. SPACE - BESPIN SYSTEM -  LUKE'S X-WING

Luke's X-wing moves through the clouds as it nears the city.

INT.  LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT

Encountering no city guards, Luke scans the display panel with concern.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER

There is a great activity on the carbon-freezing platform.  Six 
Ugnaughts frantically prepare the chamber for use.  A special 
coffinlike container is put in place.  With Boba Fett in the lead, a 
squad of six stormtroopers brings in Han, Leia and Chewie.  Strapped to 
Chewie's back, with only his head, torso, and one arm assembled, is 
Threepio.  Threepio's head faces the opposite direction from Chewie's 
and the droid is constantly twisting around in a vain effort to see 
what is happening.  His one attached arm is animate and expressive, 
intermittently pointing, gesturing, and covering his eyes.  The 
remaining pieces of his body are randomly bundled to the Wookiee's back 
so that his legs and other arm stick out at odd angles from the pack.

				THREEPIO
		If only you had attached my legs, 
		I wouldn't be in this ridiculous 
		position.  Now, remember, Chewbacca, 
		you have a responsibility to me, 
		so don't do anything foolish.

				HAN
			(to Lando)
		What's going on... buddy?

				LANDO
		You're being put into carbon freeze.

Boba Fett moves away from the group to Darth Vader.

				BOBA FETT
		What if he doesn't survive?  He's 
		worth a lot to me.

				VADER
		The Empire will compensate you 
		if he dies.  Put him in!

Realizing what is about to happen, Chewie lets out a wild howl and 
attacks the stormtroopers surrounding Han.  Within seconds, other 
Imperial reinforcements join the scuffle, clubbing the giant Wookiee 
with their laser weapons.

From the instant of Chewie's first move, Threepio begins to scream in 
panic while he tries to protect himself with his one arm.

				THREEPIO
		Oh, no!  No, no, no!  Stop, 
		Chewbacca, stop...!

The stormtroopers are about to bash Chewie in the face.

				HAN
		Stop, Chewie, stop!  Do you hear 
		me?  Stop!

				THREEPIO
		Yes, stop, please!  I'm not ready 
		to die.

Han breaks away from his captors.  Vader nods to the guards to let him 
go and the pirate breaks up the fight.

				HAN
		Chewie!  Chewie, this won't help 
		me.  Hey!

Han gives the Wookiee a stern look.

				HAN
		Save your strength.  There'll be 
		another time.  The princess - you 
		have to take care of her.  You 
		hear me?

Han winks at the Wookiee, who wails a doleful farewell.

In a flash the guards have slipped binders on Chewbacca, who is too 
distraught to protest.  Han turns to Princess Leia.  They look 
sorrowfully at one another, then Han moves toward her and gives her a 
final, passionate kiss.

				LEIA
		I love you!

				HAN
		I know.

Tears roll down Leia's face as she watches the dashing pirate walk to 
the hydraulic platform.  Han looks one final time at his friends - and 
then, suddenly, the platform drops.  Chewie howls.  Leia turns away in 
agony.

Lando winces in sorrow; it makes a life-changing impression on him.

Instantly, fiery liquid begins to pour down in a shower of sparks and 
fluid as great as any steel furnace.  Holding Leia, Chewie half-turns 
away from the sight, giving Threepio a view of the procedure.

				THREEPIO
		What... what's going on?  Turn 
		round, Chewbacca, I can't see.  
		Oh... they've encased him in 
		carbonite.  He should be quite 
		well-protected - if he survives 
		the freezing process, that is.

Chewie is in no mood for technical discussion; he gives the droid an 
angry glance and bark.

A huge mechanical tong lifts the steaming metal-encased space pirate 
out of the vat and stands him on the platform.  Some Ugnaughts rush 
over and push the block over onto the platform.  They slide the 
coffinlike structure to the block and lift the metal block, placing it 
inside.  They then attach an electronic box onto the structure and step 
away.  Lando kneels and adjusts some knobs, measuring the heat.  He 
shakes his head in relief.

				VADER
		Well, Calrissian, did he survive?

				LANDO
		Yes, he's alive.  And in perfect 
		hibernation.

Vader turns to Boba Fett.

				VADER
		He's all yours bounty hunter.
		Reset the chamber for Skywalker.

				IMPERIAL OFFICER
		Skywalker has just landed, my 
		lord.

				VADER
		Good.  See to it that he finds 
		his way here.  Calrissian, take 
		the princess and the Wookiee to 
		my ship.

				LANDO
		You said they'd be left in the 
		city under my supervision.

				VADER
		I am altering the deal.  Pray I 
		don't alter it any further.

Lando's hand instinctively goes to his throat as he turns to Leia, 
Chewie, and Threepio.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR - DAY

As Luke and Artoo move carefully down a deserted corridor, they hear a 
group of people coming down a side hallway.  Artoo lets out an excited 
series of beeps and whistles.  Luke glares at the tiny droid, who stops 
in his tracks with a feeble squeak.

Boba Fett enters from a side hallway followed by two guards pushing the 
floating, encased body of Han Solo.  Two stormtroopers, who follow, 
immediately spot Luke and open fire on him.  The youth draws his weapon 
and blasts the two troopers before they can get off a second shot.  The 
two guards whisk Han into another hallway as Fett lowers his arm and 
fires a deadly laser at Luke, which explodes to one side and tears up a 
huge chunk of wall.

Luke rushes to a side hallway, but by the time he reaches it, Fett, 
Han, and the guards are gone.  A think metal door blocks the passage.  
Luke turns to see Leia, Chewie, Threepio, and Lando being herded down a 
second hallway by several other stormtroopers.  Leia turns just in time 
to see Luke.

				LEIA
		Luke!  Luke, don't - it's a 
		trap!  It's a trap!

Before she can finish, she is pulled through a doorway and disappears 
from sight.  Luke races after the group, leaving little Artoo trailing 
behind.

INT. CLOUD CITY - ANTEROOM

Luke runs into an anteroom and stops to get his bearings.  Leia and the 
others are nowhere to be seen.  Behind Luke, Artoo scoots down the 
corridor toward the anteroom when suddenly a giant metal door comes 
slamming down, cutting off Luke's exit.  Several more doors clang shut, 
echoing through the chamber.

INT. CLOUD CITY - HALLWAY LEADING TO ANTEROOM

Artoo stands with his nose pressed against the giant metal door.  He 
whistles a long sigh of relief and, a little dazed, wanders off in the 
other direction.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER - ANTEROOM

Luke cautiously walks forward among hissing pipes and steam.  Seeing an 
opening above him, he stops to look up.  As he does, the platform he 
stands on begins to move.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER

Luke rises into the chamber, borne by the platform.  The room is 
deathly quiet.  Very little steam escapes the pipes and no one else 
seems to be in the large room.  Warily, Luke walks toward the stairway.

Steam begins to build up in the chamber.  Looking up through the steam, 
Luke sees a dark figure standing on a walkway above him.  Luke holsters 
his gun and moves up the stairs to face Vader.  He feels confident, 
eager to engage his enemy.

				VADER
		The Force is with you, young 
		Skywalker.  But you are not a 
		Jedi yet.

Luke ignites his sword in answer.  In an instant, Vader's own sword is 
lit.  Luke lunges, but Vader repels the blow.  Again Luke attacks, and 
the swords of the two combatants clash in battle.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR

Leia, Lando, and Chewie, with Threepio on his back, march along, 
guarded by six stormtroopers.  The group reaches an intersection where 
Lobot and a dozen of Lando's guards stand at attention.

The guards immediately aim their weapons at the startled stormtroopers.  
Taking the stormtroopers' weapons from them, Lobot hands one to Leia 
and one to Lando.

				LANDO
		Well done.  Hold them in the 
		security tower - and keep it 
		quiet.  Move.

As Lando's guards quickly march the stormtroopers away, Lando begins to 
undo Chewie's binding.

				LEIA
		What do you think you're doing?

				LANDO
		We're getting out of here.

				THREEPIO
		I knew all along it had to be a 
		mistake.

Chewie turns on Lando and starts to choke him.

				LEIA
		Do you think that after what you 
		did to Han we're going to trust 
		you?

Lando tries to free himself from Chewie.

				LANDO
			(choking)
		I had no choice...

Chewie barks ferociously.

				THREEPIO
			(to Chewie)
		What are you doing?  Trust him, 
		trust him!

				LEIA
		Oh, so we understand, don't we, 
		Chewie?  He had no choice.

				LANDO
		I'm just trying to help...

				LEIA
		We don't need any of your help.

				LANDO
			(choking)
		H-a-a-a...

				LEIA
		What?

				THREEPIO
		It sounds like Han.

				LANDO
		There's still a chance to save 
		Han... I mean, at the East 
		Platform...

				LEIA
		Chewie.

Chewie finally releases Lando, who fights to get his breath back.

				THREEPIO
			(to Lando)
		I'm terribly sorry about all this. 
		After all, he's only a Wookiee.

EXT. CLOUD CITY - EAST LANDING PLATFORM - BOBA FETT'S SHIP

The two guards slide Han's encased body into an opening in the side of 
the bounty hunter's ship.  Boba Fett climb aboard on a ladder next to 
the cargo hold.

				BOBA FETT
		Put Captain Solo in the cargo 
		hold.

And with that, the door slams shut.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR

Lando, Leia, and Chewie run down a Cloud City corridor when suddenly 
they spot Artoo who rushes toward them, beeping wildly.

				THREEPIO
		Artoo!  Artoo!  Where have you 
		been?

Chewie turns around to see the stubby droid, causing Threepio to be 
spun out of sight of his friend.

				THREEPIO
		Turn around, you wooly...! 
			(to Artoo)
		Hurry, hurry!  We're trying to 
		save Han from the bounty hunter!

Whistling frantically to Threepio, Artoo scoots along with the racing 
group.

				THREEPIO
		Well, at least your still in 
		one piece!  Look what happened to 
		me!

EXT. EAST LANDING PLATFORM - SIDE BAY

An elevator door slides open and Lando, Leia, and Chewbacca race for a 
large bay overlooking the East Landing Platform.

Just as they arrive, Boba Fett's ship takes off against a cloudy sunset 
sky.  

In wild anguish, Chewie howls and starts firing at the ship.

				THREEPIO
		Oh, no!  Chewie, they're behind 
		you!

A laser bolt explodes near the princess.  Everyone turns to see what 
Threepio has already spotted coming from the other direction; a squad 
of stormtroopers running toward them.  Artoo peeks out from the 
elevator.

Leia and Chewbacca start firing at the troopers as Lando makes a break 
for the elevator.  Laser bolts continue to explode around the princess 
and the Wookiee, but they refuse to budge.  Lando sticks his head out 
of the elevator and motions for the pair to run, but they barely 
notice.  They seem possessed, transported, as all the frustration of 
captivity and anger of loss pour through their death-dealing weapons.

But after a few moments, they begin to move through the rain of laser 
fire toward the elevator.  Once they are inside, the door slams shut 
and the stormtroopers race forward.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER

Luke and Vader are locked in combat on the platform overlooking the 
chamber.  Their swords clash, the platform sways.  Luke aggressively 
drives Vader back, forcing Vader to use defensive tactics.

				VADER
		You have learned much, young one.

				LUKE
		You'll find I'm full of surprises.

Vader makes two quick moves, hooking Luke's sword out of his hand and 
sending it flying.  Another lightning move at Luke's feet forces the 
youth to jump back to protect himself.  Losing his balance, Luke rolls 
down the stairs to the circular carbon-freezing platform.  There he 
sprawls on the floor, surprised and shaken.  Just in time he looks up 
to see Vader, like a giant black bird, flying right at him.  Luke rolls 
away as Vader lands.  Crouching, Luke keeps his gaze steadily on his 
enemy.

				VADER
		Your destiny lies with me, 
		Skywalker.  Obi-Wan knew this to 
		be true.

				LUKE
		No!

Behind Luke the hydraulic elevator cover has opened noiselessly.  All 
the while, Luke slowly, cautiously moves back, away from the Dark Lord.

Suddenly, Vader attacks so forcefully that Luke loses his balance and 
falls back into the opening.  There is a rumble, and in an instant 
freezing steam rises to obscure Vader's vision.   Vader turns aside and 
deactivates his sword.

				VADER
		All to easy.  Perhaps you are not 
		as strong as the Emperor thought.

Through the steam behind Vader something blurs upward.  Liquid metal 
begins to pour into the pit.

Vader turns around - and then looks up.  He sees Luke, who has leaped 
fifteen feet straight up and who now hangs from some hoses on the 
carbonite outlet.

				VADER
		Impressive... most impressive.

Luke jumps down to the platform where he is separated from Vader by the 
steaming carbonite pit.  He raises his hand.  His sword, which had 
fallen on another part of the platform, swiftly jumps into his 
outstretched hand and is instantly ignited.  Vader immediately lights 
his sword as well.

				VADER
		Obi-Wan has taught you well.  You 
		have controlled your fear... now 
		release your anger.

Luke is more cautious, controlling his anger.  He begins to retreat as 
Vader goads him on.  As Luke takes a defensive position, he realizes he 
has been foolhardy.  A quick sword exchange and Luke forces Vader back.  
Another exchange and Vader retreats.  Luke presses forward.

				VADER
		Only your hatred can destroy me.

Breathing hard, Luke jumps in the air, turning a somersault over Vader.  
He lands on the floor and slashes at Vader as the room continues to 
fill up with steam.

Vader retreats before Luke's skillful sword.  Vader blocks the sword, 
but looses his balance and falls into the outer rim of pipes.  The 
energy Luke has used to stop Vader has brought him to the point of 
collapse.  Luke moves to the edge and looks down, but sees no sign of 
Vader.  He then deactivates his sword, hooks it on his belt, and lowers 
himself into the pit.

INT. CLOUD CITY - TUNNEL AND REACTOR CONTROL ROOM

Moving through a tunnellike entrance, Luke cautiously approaches the 
reactor room.  He ignites his sword and moves into the room and toward 
a large window as Vader enters.

Luke raises his sword and moves forward to attack.

Behind Luke a large piece of machinery detaches itself from the wall 
and comes smashing forward toward his back.  Luke turns and cuts it in 
half just as another machine comes hurtling at him.  Using the Force, 
Luke manages to deflect it and send it flying as if it had hit an 
invisible shield.

A large pipe detaches and comes flying at Luke.  He deflects it.  
Sparking wires pull out of the wall and begin to whip at the youth.  
Small tools and equipment come flying at him.  Bombardment from all 
sides, Luke does his best to deflect everything, but soon he is 
bloodied and bruised.  Finally, one machine glances off his and goes 
flying out the large window.  A fierce wind blows into the room, 
unmoving, stands the dark, rocklike figure of Vader.

A piece of machinery hits Luke and he is knocked out of the window.

INT. GANTRY - OUTSIDE CONTROL ROOM - REACTOR SHAFT

Luke falls onto the gantry, rolls, and hangs over the edge, holding his 
deactivated sword in hand.  He puts the sword on his belt and begins to 
scramble up.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR LEADING TO LANDING PLATFORM

Leia, Lando, Chewie and the droids come round a corner and head for the 
door to the landing platform.  They glimpse the Millennium Falcon for a 
moment before the door slams shut.  The group ducks into an alcove as 
stormtroopers arrive at the end of the corridor.  The troopers send a 
rain of laser bolts at the group.  Chewie returns their fire as Lando 
punches desperately at the door's control panel.

				LANDO
		The security codes has been changed!

				THREEPIO
		Artoo, you can tell the computer 
		to override the security system.

Threepio points to a computer socket on the control panel.  Artoo beeps 
and scoots toward it.  Lando meanwhile has connected up to the panel's 
intercom.

				LANDO
		Attention!  This is Lando
		Calrissian.  The Empire has takes 
		control of the city.  I advise 
		everyone to leave before more 
		Imperial troops arrive.

Artoo takes off a computer cover and sticks his computer arm into the 
socket.  Suddenly, a short beep turns into a wild scream.  Artoo's 
circuits light up, his head spins wildly, and smoke begins to seep out 
underneath him.  Quickly, Chewie pulls him away.

				LANDO
		This way.

Lando, Leia, Artoo, and Chewie flee down the corridor.  As he scoots 
along with them, Artoo sends some angry beeps Threepio's way.

				THREEPIO
		Don't blame me.  I'm an interpreter. 
		I'm not supposed to know a power 
		socket from a computer terminal.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR

In a panic, Cloud City residents are trying to get out of the city.  
Some carry boxes, others packages.  They run, then change direction.  
Some are shooting at stormtroopers, others simply try to hide.

Other stormtroopers pursue Lando, Leia, and Chewie who are firing back 
at them.  Artoo works on another door to the landing platform while 
Threepio berates him for his seeming ineptitude.

				THREEPIO
		What are you talking about?  We're 
		not interested in the hyperdrive 
		on the Millennium Falcon.  It's 
		fixed!  Just open the door, you 
		stupid lump.

Chewie, Leia, and Lando retreat along the corridor.  A triumphant beep 
from Artoo - and the door snaps open.

				THREEPIO
			(to Artoo)
		I never doubted you for a second.
		Wonderful!

Artoo lays a cloud fog, obscuring everything, as the group dashes 
outside.

EXT. LANDING PLATFORM - CLOUD CITY - DUSK

They race for the Millennium Falcon as a battalion of stormtroopers 
reaches the main door.  Lando and Leia hold off the troops as the 
droids get on board with Chewie.  As Chewie bounds to the ship the 
Threepio on his back, Threepio hits his head on the top of the ramp.

				THREEPIO
		Ouch!  Oh!  Ah!  That hurt.  Bend 
		down, you thoughtless... Ow!

Chewie starts up the ship.  The giant engines begin to whine as Lando 
and Leia race up the ramp under a hail of laser fire.

				LANDO
		Leia!  Go!

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - CORRIDOR

Artoo drags the partially assembled Threepio down the corridor of the 
Falcon.

				THREEPIO
		I thought that hairy beast would 
		be the end of me.  Of course, I've 
		looked better.

Artoo beeps understandingly.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Chewie works the controls as Leia sits in Han's seat and Lando watches 
over their shoulders.  As Chewie pulls back on the throttle, the ship 
begins to move.

EXT. CLOUD CITY - LANDING PLATFORM - DUSK

The Millennium Falcon lifts gracefully into the twilight sky and roars 
away from the city.  Troops fire after it and TIE fighters take off in 
pursuit.

INT. GANTRY - OUTSIDE CONTROL ROOM - REACTOR SHAFT

Luke moves along the railing and up to the control room.

Vader lunges at him and Luke immediately raises his lit sword to meet 
Vader's.  Sparks fly as they duel, Vader gradually forcing Luke 
backward toward the gantry.

				VADER
		You are beaten.  It is useless 
		to resist.  Don't let yourself 
		be destroyed as Obi-Wan did.

Luke answers by rolling sideways and thrusting his sword at Vader so 
viciously that he nicks Vader on the shoulder.  The black armor sparks 
and smokes and Vader seems to be hurt, but immediately recovers.

Luke backs off along the narrow end of the gantry as Vader comes at 
him, slashing at the young Jedi with his sword.  Luke makes a quick 
move around the instrument complex attached to the end of the gantry.  
Vader's sword comes slashing down, cutting the complex loose; it begins 
to fall, then is caught by the rising wind and blown upward.

Luke glances at the instrument complex floating away.  At that instant, 
Vader's sword comes down across Luke's right forearm, cutting off his 
hand and sending his sword flying.  In great pain, Luke squeezes his 
forearm under his left armpit and moves back along the gantry to its 
extreme end.  Vader
follows.  The wind subsides.  Luke holds on.  There is nowhere else to 
go.  

				VADER
		There is no escape.  Don't make 
		me destroy you.  You do not yet 
		realize your importance.  You 
		have only begun to discover your 
		power.  Join me and I will complete 
		your training.  With our combined 
		strength, we can end this destructive 
		conflict and bring order to the 
		galaxy.

				LUKE
		I'll never join you!

				VADER
		If you only knew the power of the 
		dark side.  Obi-Wan never told 
		you what happened to your father.

				LUKE
		He told me enough!  It was you 
		who killed him.

				VADER
		No.  I am your father.

Shocked, Luke looks at Vader in utter disbelief.

				LUKE
		No.  No.  That's not true!  
		That's impossible!

				VADER
		Search your feelings.  You know 
		it to be true.

				LUKE
		No!  No!  No!

				VADER
		Luke.  You can destroy the Emperor.
		He has foreseen this.  It is your 
		destiny.  Join me, and together 
		we can rule the galaxy as father 
		and son.  Come with me.  It is the 
		only way.

Vader puts away his sword and holds his hand out to Luke.

A calm comes over Luke, and he makes a decision.  In the next instant 
he steps off the gantry platform into space.  The Dark Lord looks over 
the platform and sees Luke falling far below.  The wind begins to blow 
at Vader's cape and the torrent finally forces him back, away from the 
edge.  The wind soon fades and the wounded Jedi begins to drop fast, 
unable to grab onto anything to break his fall.

INT. REACTOR SHAFT

Suddenly Luke is sucked into an exhaust pipe in the side of the shaft.  
When Vader sees this, he turns and hurries off the platform.

INT. EXHAUST PIPE

Luke tumbles through the exhaust pipe.

He slides to the end of the slickly polished pipe and stops as his feet 
hit a circular grill and knock it open.  Luke claws at the surface of 
the pipe, trying to keep from sliding out into space.

EXT. BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY - WEATHER VANE - DUSK

Unable to hang onto the pipe, Luke tumbles out, emerging at the 
undermost part of Cloud City.  Reaching out desperately, he manages to 
grab onto on electronic weather vane.

				LUKE
		Ben... Ben, please!

Luke tries to pull himself up on the weather vane but slips back down.  
He hooks one of his legs around the fragile instruments.  All the 
while, a powerful current of air rushes out at him from the exhaust 
pipe.

				LUKE
		Ben.  Leia!

There is an ominous cracking sound from the base of the
weather vane and a piece breaks off, falling into the clouds far below.

				LUKE
		Hear me!  Leia!

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Leia seems to be lost in a fog, her expression troubled.  Chewie is 
busy operating the ship.  Lando stands next to the Wookiee, watching a 
readout on the control panel.

				LEIA
		Luke... We've got to go back.

Chewie growls in surprise.

				LANDO
		What?

				LEIA
		I know where Luke is.

				LANDO
		But what about those fighter?

Chewie barks in agreement with Lando.

				LEIA
		Chewie, just do it.

				LANDO
		But what about Vader?

Chewie turns on Lando, the newcomer, with an ominous growl.

				LANDO
		All right, all right, all right.

EXT. CLOUD CITY - MILLENNIUM FALCON - DUSK

The Falcon makes a graceful banking turn back toward Cloud City.

EXT. CLOUD CITY - LANDING PLATFORM

Vader enters the landing platform and watches as the speck that is the 
Falcon disappears.  The wind blows at his cape.

He turns to two aides who are standing near the entrance to the landing 
platform.

				VADER
		Bring my shuttle.

EXT. BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY - WEATHER VANE

Nearly unconscious, Luke hangs upside-down on the weather vane as his 
body shifts in the wind.

EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY

The Falcon dives to the underside of the floating city.  Three TIE 
fighter close in on the starship.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON

Leia tries to remain calm.

				LANDO
			(pointing out the 
			 cockpit window)
		Look, someone's up there.

				LEIA
		It's Luke.  Chewie, slow down.
		Slow down and we'll get under him.
		Lando, open the top hatch.

Lando rushes out of the cockpit.

EXT. BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY - WEATHER VANE

Luke hangs by one arm from the crossbar of the weather vane.  He slips 
from the bar and grabs onto the pole of the vane as the Falcon banks 
toward him.  The Falcon positions itself under Luke as Lando moves up 
through the opening of the hatch.  Luke begins to slide and finally 
falls from the vane into space.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Out the cockpit window, Leia sees Luke falling from the bottom of the 
city.  The ship gains on him.

				LEIA
		Okay.  Easy, Chewie.

The Falcon closes in on Luke.

EXT. BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY

Three TIE fighters race toward the Falcon, firing away.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - HATCH

The hatch pops open with a hiss of pressure.  Lando reaches out to help 
the battered warrior inside the ship.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Flak bursts all around it as the Falcon banks away from the city.  Leia 
and Chewie struggle with the controls.

				LEIA
			(into intercom)
		Lando?

				LANDO
			(over intercom)
		Okay, let's go.

EXT. BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY

The Falcon races away.  It is closely followed by three TIE fighters, 
all of which keep up a heavy laser assault on the fleeing starship.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Explosions erupt all around the cockpit, buffeting the ship wildly.  
Chewie howls as he frantically tries to control the ship.

Leia and Chewie turns to see Luke, bloody and battered, enter the 
cockpit supported by Lando.  Leia jumps up and hugs him while Chewie 
barks in joyous relief.

				LUKE
		Oh, Leia.

				LANDO
		All right, Chewie.  Let's go.

Leia helps Luke from the cockpit as another huge blast rocks the ship.

EXT. SPACE - CLOUD CITY - DAY

The Falcon, still followed by the three TIE fighters, races away from 
the cloud-covered city.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - SLEEPING QUARTERS

Luke rests on a cot, his injured arm wrapped in a protective cuff.  
Leia gently wipes his face.  The ship lurches again.

				LEIA
		I'll be back.

She kisses him, then leaves the quarters.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

All over the ship muted alarm buzzers sound.  Lando anxiously watches 
the flashing lights on the control panel and hurriedly adjusts some 
switches.  Seated next to him, Chewie points out a new blip appearing 
on the panel.  Leia, watching over their shoulders, recognizes the 
shape.

				LEIA
		Star Destroyer.

				LANDO
		All right, Chewie.  Ready for 
		light-speed.

				LEIA
		If your people fixed the 
		hyperdrive.

Another explosion rocks the ship.  Leia notices as a green light on the 
panel next to her flashes on.

				LEIA
		All the coordinates are set.
		It's now or never.

Chewie barks in agreement.

				LANDO
		Punch it!

The Wookiee shrugs and pulls back on the light-speed throttle.  The 
sound of the ion engine changes...it is winding up.  Faces are tense, 
expectant.  But nothing happens, and the engine goes off.  Chewie lets 
out a frustrated howl.  The flak still violently rocks the ship.

				LANDO
		They told me they fixed it.  I 
		trusted them to fix it.  It's not 
		my fault!

Chewie gets up from his chair and starts out of the cockpit.  He gives 
Lando and angry shove as he storms past him.

EXT. SPACE

In the distance the TIE fighters continue their chase, still shooting 
lasers.  Vader's Star Destroyer moves behind them, determinedly 
following the Falcon.

INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE

Vader stands on the bridge looking out the window as Admiral Piett 
approaches him.

				PIETT
		They'll be in range of our 
		tractor beam in moments, my lord.

				VADER
		Did your men deactivate the 
		hyperdrive on the Millennium 
		Falcon?

				PIETT
		Yes, my lord.

				VADER
		Good.  Prepare the boarding party 
		and set your weapons for stun.

				PIETT
		Yes, my lord.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON

Beeping while he works, Artoo is busy connecting some wires to Threepio 
who now has one leg attached. 

Chewie enters through the doorway, grunting to himself.

				THREEPIO
		Noisy brute.  Why don't we just 
		go into light-speed?

Artoo beeps in response.

				THREEPIO
		We can't?  How would you know the 
		hyperdrive is deactivated?

Artoo whistles knowingly.

				THREEPIO
		The city's central computer told 
		you?  Artoo-Detoo, you know better 
		than to trust a strange computer.
		Ouch!  Pay attention to what 
		you're doing!

Chewie is in the pit.  He is trying to loosen something with an 
enormous wrench.  Frustrated, he uses the wrench like a club and hits 
the panel...

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Leia and Lando, seated in front of the control panel, are suddenly 
sprayed by a shower of sparks.

INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE

Vader stands on the bridge, watching as the Millennium Falcon is chased 
by the TIE fighters.  As his Destroyer draws nearer, Vader's breathing 
gets slightly faster.

				VADER
		Luke.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - SLEEPING QUARTERS

Luke realizes that Vader's ship is very near.  He feels resigned to his 
fate.  He senses that he is beaten, more emotionally than physically.

				LUKE
		Father.

INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE

				VADER
		Son, come with me.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - SLEEPING QUARTERS

				LUKE
			(moaning)
		Ben, why didn't you tell me?

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Lando and Leia are at the controls of the Falcon.  Meanwhile, in the 
ship's hold, Chewie continues to work frantically on the hyperdrive 
mechanism.

				LANDO
			(into intercom)
		Chewie!

EXT. SPACE

The Falcon races through space followed very closely by the TIE 
fighters and the huge Imperial Star Destroyer.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Luke enters the cockpit and looks out the window.  He is almost 
unconscious with pain and depression.

				LUKE
		It's Vader.

INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE

				VADER
		Luke... it is your destiny.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

				LUKE
		Ben, why didn't you tell me?

INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE

				PIETT
		Alert all commands.  Ready for 
		the tractor beam.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - HOLD

Artoo races to a control panel and starts working on a circuit board.  
Furious, Threepio stands on one leg, yelling.

				THREEPIO
		Artoo, come back at once!  You 
		haven't finished with me yet!
		You don't know how to fix the 
		hyperdrive.  Chewbacca can do 
		it.  I'm standing here in pieces, 
		and you're having delusions of 
		grandeur!

Artoo moves a circuit on a control panel.  Suddenly, the control panel 
lights up.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Leia and Lando are thrown into their seats as the Millennium Falcon 
unexpectedly shoot into hyperspace.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - HOLD

The ship tilts up and Artoo topples into the pit on top of Chewie.

				THREEPIO
		Oh, you did it!

EXT. SPACE

The Falcon soars into infinity and away from the huge Star Destroyer 
which seems, by contrast, to stand still.

INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE

Admiral Piett and another captain glance at Vader in terror.  Vader 
turns slowly and walks off the bridge, his hands held behind his back 
in a contemplative gesture.

EXT. SPACE - REBEL CRUISER

The Millennium Falcon is attached to a huge Rebel cruiser by a docking 
tube.  Rebel fighters move about the giant cruiser, and a Rebel 
transport ship hovers near the fleet.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Lando sits in the pilot's seat as he talks into the comlink.  Chewie 
busily throws a variety of switches in preparation for takeoff.

				LANDO
			(into comlink)
		Luke, we're ready for takeoff.

				LUKE
			(over comlink)
		Good luck, Lando

				LANDO
			(into comlink)
		When we find Jabba the Hut and 
		that bounty hunter, we'll contact 
		you.

INT. STAR CRUISER - MEDICAL CENTER

Luke speaking into the comlink as a medical droid works on his hand.  
Leia stands near him while Threepio and Artoo look out the window.

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		I'll meet you at the rendezvous 
		point on Tatooine.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

				LANDO
			(into comlink)
		Princess, we'll find Han.  I 
		promise.

INT. STAR CRUISER - MEDICAL CENTER

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		Chewie, I'll be waiting for your 
		signal.

Chewie's wail comes over the comlink.

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		Take care, you two.  May the 
		Force be with you.

Luke looks down at his hand.  A metalized type of bandage has been 
wrapped around his wrist.  The medical droid makes some adjustments in 
a tiny electronic unit, then pricks each one of Luke's fingers.

				LUKE
		Ow!

Luke wriggles his fingers, makes a fist, and relaxes it.  His hand is 
completely functional.

He gets up and walks over to Leia.  There is a new bond between them, a 
new understanding.  Leia is thinking about Han; Luke is thinking about 
his uncertain and newly complicated future.  Together they stand at the 
large window of the medical center looking out on the Rebel Star 
Cruiser and a dense, luminous galaxy swirling in space.

Luke puts his arm around Leia.  The droids stand next to them, and 
Threepio moves closer to Artoo putting his arm on him.  The group 
watches as the Millennium Falcon moves into view, makes a turn, and 
zooms away into space.

EXT. SPACE - REBEL STAR CRUISER

While Luke, Leia, and the droids stand, looking out the window of the 
star cruiser, two escort fighters join the large ship.  Slowly, the 
cruiser turns and moves away into space.

                                    THE FORCE AWAKENS



           Luke Skywalker has vanished. In his absence,
           the sinister FIRST ORDER has risen from the
           ashes of the Empire and will not rest until
           Skywalker, the last Jedi, has been destroyed.
           With the support of the REPUBLIC, General
           Leia Organa leads a brave RESISTANCE. She is
           desperate to find her brother Luke and gain
           his help in restoring peace and justice to
           the galaxy.

           Leia has sent her most daring pilot on a secret
           mission to Jakku, where an old ally has
           discovered a clue to Luke's whereabouts....


          PAN across the star field to a bright moon. A RUMBLING is
          FELT. A VAST STAR DESTROYER -- unlike any we have seen --
          HURTLES PAST US, of seemingly endless length, eclipsing the
          moon. After a long beat, FOUR TRANSPORT SHIPS fly from a
          hangar. We HOLD ON THEM NOW, as they fly off toward a distant
          planet. Jakku. MUSIC BUILDS AND WE...

          CUT TO BLACK.

          A GROWING ROAR of MEAN ENGINES -- gnarled RADIO CALLS, the
          SHUDDERING of a ship's hull. Then FLASHES OF LIGHT: for an
          instant we see a STORMTROOPER -- then BLACKNESS. Then ANOTHER
          STORMTROOPER, then it's gone.

          The FLICKERING CONTINUES until the LIGHTS ARE CONSTANT. We

                         ARE IN:

          INT. TROOP TRANSPORT VEHICLE - NIGHT

          TWENTY STORMTROOPERS. Holding on at attention, moving to
          the ship's rhythm, in the tense moments before a raid. A
          FILTERED COMMAND and they LOCK AND LOAD their heavy blaster
          rifles. The BRUTAL NOISE is replaced by SUDDEN, SHOCKING

                         QUIET:

          EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT

          WIDE SHOT of a small, peaceful village. Distant sounds of
          native animals. A single wind chime.
          Suddenly a DROID RISES INTO FRAME, CLOSE: ROUND and SKITTERY,
          orange and white, this is BB-8.
          Focuses on something past camera. He BEEPS -- FAST, MORSE
          CODE-LIKE SOUNDS, clearly worried. Moves EVEN CLOSER TO
          CAMERA -- is MORE worried -- BEEPS more -- then TURNS AND

          ROLLS OFF FAST --

          INT. LARGE HUT - NIGHT

          CLOSE ON A HAND: a small LEATHER SACK is placed in the palm.
          The hand closes. Another OLDER HAND covers it.
          In a primitive HUT, an old explorer, LOR SAN TEKKA, (rugged,
          kind) has handed the mysterious sack to POE DAMERON (32, in
          a pilot's jacket). Poe has charisma, a natural spark:

           LOR SAN TEKKA
           This will begin to make things right.
           I've traveled too far, and seen too
           much, to ignore the despair in the
           galaxy. Without the Jedi, there can
           be no balance in the Force.

                          POE
           Well, because of you now we have a
           chance. The General's been after
           this for a long time.

           LOR SAN TEKKA
           "The General." To me, she's royalty.
           Well, she certainly is that.

                          POE
          BB-8 ENTERS FRANTIC, BEEPS. Concerned, Poe turns to Lor San
          Tekka.

                          POE (CONT'D)
           We've got company.

          EXT. LARGE HUT - NIGHT

          The men exit fast. Poe moves TO CAMERA, raises QUADNOCULARS.
          POE'S POV: LIGHTS on the horizon -- approaching ENEMY SHIPS.
          POE lowers the quadnocs -- PUSH IN ON HIS UNNERVED EYES. A

          GROWING, FRIGHTENING THUNDER.

                          POE
           You have to hide.

           LOR SAN TEKKA
           You have to leave. Go!
          Poe turns to him. Conflicted. Finally nods, hurries off.
          BB-8 follows.

          EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT

          TRACK FAST with Poe as he and BB-8 hurry through the village,
          various ARMED VILLAGERS taking position, prepared to defend.

          EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT

          A ROAR of WIND and DUST: the TRANSPORTS LAND. Stormtroopers
          come out FIRING BLASTERS -- the VILLAGERS FIRE BACK -- many
          are HIT!

          EXT. RISE ADJACENT TO VILLAGE - NIGHT

          Poe runs to an X-WING fighter, parked at a distance from the
          village, hidden behind a ROCK OUTCROPPING.

                          POE
           Come on, BB-8! Hurry!
          Poe sends BB-8 into the droid socket / co-pilot seat -- he
          moves to the cockpit -- the CONTROLS COME TO LIFE. As the
          CANOPY CLOSES, Poe shoots a quick look back: the ENEMY ARRIVES

          IN THE DISTANCE.
          Poe urgently works the controls -- BB-8 BEEPS.
          The X-WING LANDING LIGHTS COME ON, ENGINES WHINE TO LIFE!
          But just then:
          Poe's ship is suddenly HIT BY BLASTERFIRE! Poe turns to
          look: two STORMTROOPERS CHARGE HIS WAY, FIRING!

                          POE (CONT'D)
           I see 'em!
          BB-8 BEEPS nervously as Poe GRABS HIS CONTROLS and FIRES AT
          THEM, using the X-wing's drop-down antipersonnel blaster!
          The two Troopers are BLOWN AWAY in the large BLAST HITS!
          Poe tries to start the ship now, but the ENGINES SPUTTER.
          Concerned, he opens his canopy, jumps down, moves to the
          back of his ship: BAD DAMAGE ON THE REAR ENGINE PANEL.
          They're in trouble.

          EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT

          Lor San Tekka moves sadly through the village as STORMTROOPERS
          wielding FLAME THROWERS destroy structures. Surrendering
          Villagers are ROUNDED UP. Penned ANIMALS panic.

          EXT. RISE ADJACENT TO THE VILLAGE - NIGHT

          Back at the X-wing, Poe kneels beneath his ship, pulls from
          the leather sack a SMALL, OLD ARTIFACT which he inserts into
          BB-8 -- the droid's MULTI-READER ENVELOPS it.

                          POE
           You take this. It's safer with you
           than it is with me. You get as far
           away from here as you can. Do you
           hear me?
           (BB-8 BEEPS, hesitates)
           I'll come back for you! It will be
           alright.

                         

                         
          BB-8 watches Poe run off. BEEP-WHINES nervously, then turns
          and heads off. Turns back once to look at Poe, then ROLLS
          AWAY. Poe uses his blaster rifle to fire at incoming troopers
          from cover.

          EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT

          The Troopers and villagers in battle -- as one Trooper is
          HIT and goes down. Another -- OUR TROOPER -- KNEELS to help.
          The hit trooper raises a torn, bloody glove -- his HUMAN
          HAND visible -- and MARKS OUR STORMTROOPER'S MASK WITH BLOOD
          just before he dies. Our Trooper, stands -- overwhelmed by
          the battle.

          AN IMPOSING SHUTTLE CRAFT -- VERTICAL WINGSPAN 90 FEET TALL --

          LANDS NEAR THE TRANSPORT VEHICLES.
          The shuttle craft door OPENS -- through the wind and smoke,
          KYLO REN exits the ship: a TALL, DARK FIGURE, he strides
          through the chaos toward San Tekka.
          A senior Trooper moves to our blood-marked Trooper, and orders

                         HIM:

                          SENIOR TROOPER
           Stay here.
          Our Trooper nods.
          Kylo Ren stops before the outraged Lor San Tekka, dwarfing
          him. Only now does it become apparent that Kylo Ren wears a
          DARK MASK, marked by battle. Inset metal lines reflect FIRE.

                          KYLO REN
           Look how old you've become.

           LOR SAN TEKKA
           Something far worse has happened to
           you.
          Our blood-marked TROOPER is placed in line with other
          stormtroopers.

                          KYLO REN
           You know what I've come for.

                         

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED: LOR SAN TEKKA
           I know where you come from. Before
           you called yourself Kylo Ren.

                          KYLO REN
           The map to Skywalker. We know you've
           found it, and now you're going to
           give it to the First Order.
          Adjacent to the village, Poe enters frame -- sees the Ren/San
          Tekka exchange continue.

           LOR SAN TEKKA
           The First Order rose from the dark
           side... you did not.

                          KYLO REN
           I'll show you the dark side.

           LOR SAN TEKKA
           You may try, but you cannot deny the
           truth that is your family.
          Suddenly Kylo Ren raises his LIGHTSABER -- IGNITES IT --

          PERPENDICULAR SMALLER BLADES AT THE HILT, A UNIQUE BUZZ --

          YELLOW/RED ENERGY, SPITTING SPARKS AND SMOKE --

                          KYLO REN
           You're so right.
          And as he RIPS IT DOWN ACROSS SAN TEKKA!
          Poe, RUNNING, SEES THIS AND YELLS, AIMS HIS BLASTER AND FIRES
          AT KYLO REN! Instantly:
          Kylo Ren RAISES HIS HAND -- POE'S BLAST FREEZES -- THE BOLT

          OF ENERGY STRAINING AND VIBRATING IN MID AIR!
          Kylo Ren sees Poe, who suddenly CANNOT MOVE, but strains to.
          He is grabbed by Stormtroopers who drag him past the
          VIBRATING, FROZEN BLAST, to Kylo Ren.
          A Stormtrooper begins a brutal PAT DOWN. Kylo Ren moves
          closer. Poe just glares. The Stormtrooper KICKS OUT Poe's
          legs -- he lands hard on his knees.
          Kylo Ren kneels to look at Poe.

                          POE
           So who talks first? You talk first?

                          KYLO REN
           The old man gave it to you.

                          POE

                          (INDICATES KYLO'S

                          MASK)
           It's just very hard to understand
           you with all the...

                         

                         

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:

                          KYLO REN

                          (TO TROOPERS)
           Search him.

                          POE
           ... Apparatus.
          The Troopers roughly pull Poe away. A Stormtrooper begins a
          brutal PAT DOWN. Kylo Ren moves closer.
          Poe just glares as the pat down ends.

                          STORMTROOPER #1
           Nothing, sir.

                          KYLO REN
           Put him on board.
          Kylo Ren regards the Stormtroopers with the rounded up
          Villagers, then turns to the CHROME-SKINNED, FEMALE BLACK-

          CAPED HEAD STORMTROOPER, CAPTAIN PHASMA.

                          CAPTAIN PHASMA
           Sir, the villagers.

                          KYLO REN
           Kill them all.
          Phasma nods, steps forward:

                          CAPTAIN PHASMA
           On my command!
          The Troopers, including OURS, aim at the Villagers.

           CAPTAIN PHASMA (CONT'D)
           Fire!
          Poe is roughly PULLED into a transport ship, the ramp LIFTS.
          All around our Trooper BLASTERFIRE ERUPTS -- but we're WIDE
          ENOUGH to see he ISN'T FIRING. PUSH IN until the FIRING
          STOPS. All the Stormtroopers SPREAD OUT TO SEARCH -- except
          ours.
          Kylo Ren heads back toward his ship. But then he STOPS.
          Feels something. TURNS AND LOOKS AT OUR STORMTROOPER for a
          LONG MOMENT. Our Trooper can barely meet his gaze; knows
          he's doomed.
          Kylo Ren then heads off -- passes the FROZEN BLAST, which,
          after a beat, GOES FREE AND SLAMS INTO A NEARBY STRUCTURE,
          scaring the hell out of our Stormtrooper.

          EXT. EDGE OF JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT

          A Stormtrooper climbs down from the cockpit of Poe's X-wing,

                         BACKS AWAY:

                         

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:

                          STORMTROOPER #2
           Nothing here. Go ahead!
          Three other Stormtroopers FIRE LASER CANNONS at the X-wing --
          destroying the ship in a LARGE EXPLOSION.

          EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT

          BB-8 rolls across the sand, looks back: the X-wing FIREBALL.
          BB-8, afraid, continues on his own in a mysterious, dark
          desert. We see a FORM -- an animal, its RED EYES LIFTING
          from the sand, watching the rolling droid, who just keeps
          going.
          In a WIDE SHOT, we HEAR HIM BEEPING to himself, lonely and
          frightened.

          EXT. SPACE - NIGHT

          With the SANDY PLANET OF JAKKU as backdrop, Troop Transports
          and Kylo Ren's Shuttle approach a massive STAR DESTROYER.

          INT. STAR DESTROYER HANGAR - NIGHT

          Poe, shackled, is ushered from the transport through the
          hangar. He is awed by the imposing space.

                          POE
           All right. All right!
          Our Stormtrooper passes, moves fast:

          INT. TROOP TRANSPORT VEHICLE - NIGHT

          Our Stormtrooper enters the dark, vehicle. He removes his
          helmet. His head comes up and we PUSH IN ON HIS FACE FOR
          THE FIRST TIME. This is FN-2187. He is 23, likable. But
          in this moment, terrified, desperate.
          After a beat, behind him, CAPTAIN PHASMA enters. FN-2187
          knows he's in trouble.

                          CAPTAIN PHASMA
           FN-2187. Submit your blaster for
           inspection.

                          FN-2187
           Yes, Captain.

                          CAPTAIN PHASMA
           And who gave you permission to remove
           that helmet?

                          FN-2187
           I'm sorry, Captain.

                          CAPTAIN PHASMA
           Report to my division at once.

                         

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:
          Phasma heads off. Shattered, FN-2187 replaces his helmet.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. JUNKED VESSEL CORRIDOR - DAY

          A metal sheet is pulled open to reveal the wrapped up face
          of A SCAVENGER, perhaps alien, in GOGGLES, FACE MASK and
          GLOVES. Backpack with a STAFF strapped to it. Uses TOOLS
          to remove various MECHANISMS from inside the wall. We are
          in an upside-down, canted CORRIDOR. The Scavenger finds a
          valuable piece, drops it in a SATCHEL.
          Swings the bag back and begins CLIMBING DOWN on a cable,
          between treacherous WALLS OF MACHINERY, headed to:

          INT. JUNKED VESSEL - LARGER SPACE - LATER

          Alone and tiny in this massive, sideways wreck, the Scavenger
          descends, climbing down a two-hundred foot-long cable. LANDS
          HARD onto rusty metal.

          INT. JUNKED VESSEL - ENGINES - DAY

          The Scavenger carries the satchel and another large, found
          piece, over enormous pipes in the vast space, heads through
          the dust toward a distant SLIT OF SUNLIGHT.

          EXT. JUNKED VESSEL ENGINE - DAY

          The Scavenger arrives from the darkness and pulls off goggles
          and gear, revealing the grimy face of a beautiful, young
          WOMAN. This is REY, 19.
          She opens her canteen, shakes out the two final drops into
          her mouth. HITS THE SIDE of the canteen again and again for
          whatever she can get. CUT WIDE:
          Rey is rendered minuscule, standing at the bottom of an EPIC

          ENGINE OF A DECAYING, CRASHED STAR DESTROYER -- DISTANT SOUND
          of her canteen-hitting. She sets her things on a piece of
          sheet metal and sits next to it, sliding down the sand dune.
          She RIDES DOWN THE MOUNTAIN OF SAND. WE HOLD FOR A LONG
          TIME, looking down, as she recedes from us, toward the distant
          SALT FLATS below. Random SCATTERED DEBRIS. Her SPEEDER,
          tiny from here.
          Rey moves to her junker SPEEDER, jumps on, fires the sputtery
          engine and DRIVES OFF.

          EXT. DESERT - SPACESHIP GRAVEYARD - DAY

          Rey races along the desert floor: a GRAVEYARD OF CRASHED

          SPACESHIPS.

          EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY

          Rey's speeder PASSES us, heading for a dusty, desert town.
          Refueling, small trade, scavengers.

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:
          CRASH! Rey's sack carrying her heavy FOUND OBJECTS hits the
          sand. Working like a tough seaman, Rey hauls the sack from
          her speeder toward the town.

          EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - CLEANING TABLE - DAY

          TIGHT ON REY'S HANDS as she SCRUBS CLEAN her day's salvage.
          Rey glances up: she looks at an old woman, also cleaning
          some salvage.
          Rey watches her, gets lost in the simple moment. A small,
          passing alien UNDERLING barks something to her in another
          language. She returns to work.

          INT. NIIMA TRADING STRUCTURE - DAY

          Rey looks up to a SERVICE WINDOW: two feet above her, behind
          a protective screen, is her boss, UNKAR PLUTT (50, blobfish,
          unclean). He examines her pieces. Then he offers:

                          UNKAR
           What you've brought me today is
           worth... Hmmm... One quarter
           portion.
          Though disappointed, Rey barely shows it. She nods thanks.
          Unkar pushes through his transfer drawer a SEALED PACKET:
          DRIED GREEN MEAT in one section, BEIGE POWDER in another.
          She takes it.
          She swallows her resentment and heads off.

          EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY

          The IMMENSE SETTING SUN against the FLAT TERRAIN. Rey's
          SPEEDER races, almost insignificant, across frame.

          INT. REY'S DWELLING - DAY

          She SCRATCHES MARKS into the rusty wall. Another MARK;
          another DAY. And there are THOUSANDS of marks.
          A SIZZLING SOUND over: A DRIED DESERT FLOWER in a rusty ENGINE
          PIECE. A rough, stuffed HANDMADE DOLL, made from what looks
          like orange Rebellion flight suit material and twine.
          Rey's lonely, ramshackle dwelling. Everything reclaimed.
          She cooks for one. Does everything for one. She opens the
          POWDER, moves to the makeshift WOK, where the GREEN MEAT
          SIZZLES. Pours the powder into milky WATER in a tin. Stirs
          it. It GROWS INTO A LOAF as she puts the meat on an old
          plate. Grabs the loaf.

          EXT. REY'S DWELLING - DUSK

          Rey sits, eats like a starving child. Every last drop.
          Licks the metal plate. Looks out at the horizon. A single
          silent ship heads off, a shimmering, thin contrail. She
          wipes her mouth. Picks up an old, broken REBELLION HELMET.

                         

                          (CONTINUED)
          CONTINUED: just 'cause.
          Puts it on,
          WIDE SHOT of Rey sitting, alone and isolated, on the leg of
          an ANCIENT, FALLEN AT-AT in which she lives.
          Then, a distant ELECTRONIC SQUEAL -- instantly she's up,
          helmet too big, she rips it off. Hears ANOTHER BEEPING
          SQUEAL. She hurries to her QUARTERSTAFF and runs off.
          Rey climbs a dune. RISE WITH HER, revealing BB-8, caught in
          a NET but fighting back, being held by a TEEDO (a small,
          brutish desert tyrant), who rides a LUGGABEAST. The teedo
          YELLS at BB-8, who BEEPS madly, struggling to free himself.
          Rey watches this injustice for a beat, finally YELLING OUT:

                          REY
           Tal'ama parqual!
          The Teedo and BB-8 STOP, GO SILENT, turn to her.

                          REY (CONT'D)
           Parqual zatana!
          A half beat and the Teedo YELLS SOMETHING BACK, threatening.
          BB-8's head swivels to him, then back to Rey, like watching
          a tennis match.
          Rey angrily moves to them, pulling a knife from her pouch.
          Rey starts CUTTING BB-8 out of the netting. The Teedo freaks
          out, YELLING. Rey suddenly stands, turns to the Teedo and
          says, fiercely:

                          REY (CONT'D)

           NOMA.
          The Teedo barks a sort of "AHHHHH!" (As if to say, "GO TO
          HELL!"), Then heads off on his beast. This prompts BB-8 to
          start BEEP-YELLING at the departing bully, provocatively.

                          REY (CONT'D)
           Shhhh.
          BB-8 quiets instantly. The two watch the Teedo head off.
          Finally, BB-8 BEEPS a question. She KNEELS to him.

                          REY (CONT'D)
           That's just Teedo. Wants you for
           parts. He has no respect for anyone.
           Your antenna's bent.
           (considers BB-8 for
           the first time,

                          STRAIGHTENS THE

                          ANTENNA)
           Where do you come from?

                          (BB-8 BEEPS)
           Classified. Really? Me too. Big
           secret.
           (points to horizon)
           Niima Outpost is that way, stay off
           Kelvin Ridge.

                         CONTINUED:

                          REY (CONT'D)
           Keep away from the Sinking Fields in
           the north, you'll drown in the sand.
           (stands, heads off)

                         
          BB-8 starts after her, BEEPS. She turns sharply, he stops.

                         

                         

                          REY (CONT'D)
           Don't follow me. Town is that way.
           (he BEEPS again)
           No!
          She heads off again. Finally he BEEPS to her -- something
          SWEET this time. That he is alone, scared, has no one else.
          This makes her stop. She turns and looks at him. Not liking
          him. But a gesture of her head says, reluctantly, "Come
          on." BB-8 quickly moves to her. They head off together.

                          REY (CONT'D)
           In the morning, you go.

                          (HE BEEPS)
           You're welcome.
          The two disappear behind a dune.

          EXT. STAR DESTROYER - DAY

          Three TIE fighters head to the massive ship high above Jakku.

          INT. STAR DESTROYER HOLDING CELL - DAY

          POE, shackled to a chair, BEATEN, wakes up.

                          KYLO REN
           I had no idea we had the best pilot
           in the Resistance on board.
           Comfortable?
          Through battered lips:

                          POE
           Not really.

                          KYLO REN
           I'm impressed. No one has been able
           to get out of you what you did with
           the map.

                          POE
           Might wanna rethink your technique.
          Kylo Ren says nothing, reaches out to him. Poe flinches in
          the chair as Kylo Ren reaches for his face, not touching
          him. Poe is soon in agony, remains in horrible silence --

                          KYLO REN
           Where is it?

          Poe can't take it -- he BEGINS TO SCREAM and we CUT TO:

          INT. STAR DESTROYER CORRIDOR - DAY

          WHOOOSH! The cell door SLIDES UP. Kylo Ren exits, fierce,
          confronts GENERAL HUX (34, scary) who awaits him:

                          KYLO REN
           It's in a droid. A BB unit.

                          GENERAL HUX
           Well then. If it's on Jakku, we'll
           soon have it.

                          KYLO REN
           I leave that to you.

          EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY

          BB-8 is dropped to the sand.

                          REY
           Don't give up. He still might show
           up. Whoever it is you're waiting
           for. Classified. I know all about
           waiting.
          BB-8 BEEPTALKS a question.

                          REY (CONT'D)
           For my family. They'll be back.
           One day. Come on.
          She tries to force a smile, but can't, really. She heads
          off. BB-8 BEEPS... then heads after her.

          INT. NIIMA TRADING STRUCTURE - DAY

          Rey stands with BB-8 in front of Unkar Plutt, at his window.
          He reviews her goods. He glances quickly at BB-8.

                          UNKAR
           These five pieces are worth... Let
           me see here... One half portion.

                          REY

                          (OBJECTS)
           Last week they were a half portion
           each.
          She hates him. He leans forward.

                         

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

                          REY
           What about him?

                          UNKAR
           I'll pay for him.
          BB-8 doesn't like this at all. Rey is awkward, but curious.

                          UNKAR (CONT'D)
           Sixty portions.
          CLOSE ON HER. Stunned. Literally hungry for this amount of
          food, her stomach practically rumbles.
          BB-8 sees her interest and BEEPS furiously, not liking this
          conversation at all.
          She looks at Unkar. Looks down at BB-8. Considers it all.
          Finally, she hears herself say:

                          REY
           Actually... the droid's not for sale.

                          (TO BB-8)
           Come on.
          Unkar furious. Rey, then BB-8, head out. Recovering, Unkar
          watches her go with dark eyes. He picks up a communicator:

                          UNKAR
           Follow the girl and get that droid.
          He SLAMS the service window door SHUT.

          An exhausted, handcuffed Poe is walked down the corridor by

           This is a rescue, I'm helping you

           Because it's the right thing to do.

                          POE
           (it hits him)
           You need a pilot.

                          FN-2187
           I need a pilot.
          And Poe, seeing this is for real, smiles a hero's smile.

                          POE
           We're gonna do this.

                          FN-2187

          FN-2187 and Poe (wincing, sore) drop into the back-to-back

          INT. TIE FIGHTER COCKPIT - DAY


                          POE
           I got it!

          EXT. STAR DESTROYER - DAY

          The TIE Fighter blasts from the ship --

          INT. TIE FIGHTER - DAY

          Poe pilots -- amazed, almost enjoying it.

                          POE
           Woooahhh! This thing really moves.
           All right, we gotta take out as many
           cannons as we can or we're not gonna
           get very far!

                          FN-2187
           All right!

                          POE
           I'm gonna get us in position, just
           stay sharp!

          EXT. STAR DESTROYER - DAY

          The TIE Fighter ARCS BACK, DIVES THROUGH THE OPENING BETWEEN
          THE LEVELS OF THE MASSIVE SHIP, then FLIES DOWN AND BACK,
          along the ship's belly --

          INT. TIE FIGHTER - DAY

          Poe flies toward the CANONS --

                          POE
           Up ahead! Up ahead! You see it?
           I've got us dead centered. It's a
           clean shot.

                          FN-2187
           Okay, got it.
          FN-2187 gets a target, FIRES!

          EXT. STAR DESTROYER - DAY

          LASERS BLAST from the TIE Fighter -- A SERIES OF CANNONS
          EXPLODE! Our TIE Fighter SLICES THROUGH the debris!

          INT. TIE FIGHTER - DAY

          FN-2187 YELLS in celebration:

                          FN-2187
           YES! You see that?! DID YOU SEE

           THAT?

                          POE
           I saw it! Hey, what's your name?

                          FN-2187

           FN-2187!
          Poe reacts, this tells him volumes about FN-2187's history.

                          POE
           FN-whaa?

                          FN-2187
           That's the only name they ever gave
           me!

                          POE
           Well I ain't using it! FN, huh?
           Finn. I'm gonna call you Finn!
           That all right?
          Even in the madness, Finn can't suppress his smile.

                          FINN
           "Finn." Yeah, "Finn", I like that!
           I like that!

                          POE
           I'm Poe. Poe Dameron.

                          FINN
           Good to meet you, Poe!

                          POE
           Good to meet you too, Finn!

          INT. STAR DESTROYER MAIN BRIDGE - DAY

          General Hux looks over the shoulder of LIEUTENANT MITAKA, at
          a console.

                          LIEUTENANT MITAKA
           Sir, they've taken out our turbolasers--

                          GENERAL HUX
           Use the ventral cannons.

           Yes, sir. Bringing them online --

           KYLO REN (O.S.)
           General Hux. Is it the Resistance
           pilot?
          Hux turns: Kylo Ren enters fast, looms large, angry.

                          GENERAL HUX
           Yes, and he had help.

                          (VEXED)
           From one of our own.
          PUSH IN ON REN as Hux says:

           GENERAL HUX (CONT'D)
           We're checking the registers now to
           identify which Stormtrooper it was.

                          KYLO REN
           ... The one from the village. FN-

           2187.
          Hux is unnerved that Ren knows -- he chalks it up to Ren's
          Force ability. Kylo Ren heads off.

                          LIEUTENANT MITAKA
           Sir. Ventral cannons hot.

                          GENERAL HUX
           Fire.

          EXT. STAR DESTROYER - DAY

          Massive WARHEAD LAUNCHERS SPIN and FIRE BLASTS toward the
          TIE fighter, which flies EVASIVE MANEUVERS -- most blasts
          hit the DEBRIS from the TURBOLASER DESTRUCTION.
          The TIE fighter then PULLS A BIG TURN, BACK TOWARD JAKKU,

          THE SANDY PLANET WHERE POE LEFT BB-8.

                          POE
           That's right. He's a BB unit! Orange
           and white: one of a kind.

          Captain Phasma and General Hux stand before a holographic

                          CAPTAIN PHASMA
           FN-2187 reported to my division, was
           evaluated and sent to Reconditioning.

           General. They've been hit.

                          GENERAL HUX
           Destroyed?

                          TECHNICIAN #1

                          (GETTING READINGS)
           Disabled. They were headed back to
           Jakku -- the fighter's projected to
           crash in the Goazon badlands.

                          GENERAL HUX
           They were going back for the droid --
           send a squad to the wreckage.

          EXT. JAKKU DESERT - DAY

          TIGHT ON FINN'S FACE: His EYES OPEN. He goes from unconscious
          to terrified, fast. He sits up, looks around. CUT BACK
          WIDE: he sits in the middle of an EPIC DESERT, DUNES FOREVER.
          A BLACK CHUTE blows in the wind behind him, scattered debris.
          Then he sees, over distant dunes, RISING BLACK SMOKE. He
          gets up -- moves toward it, calling out:

                          FINN
           Poe! Poe!
          Finn scrambles over the massive dune to the TIE FIGHTER,
          SMOKING AND ON FIRE, small debris around it. He thinks he
          sees POE'S ARM -- he pulls on it, but it's JUST POE'S JACKET.
          He throws that off and tries to find a way in -- even a way
          to LOOK INSIDE, but the smoke and heat make it impossible.

                          FINN (CONT'D)
           Poe!!! POE!
          Suddenly the ship BEGINS TO SINK -- like it's being CONSUMED
          INTO QUICKSAND -- Finn is slipping in too --

                          FINN (CONT'D)

           POE!!! POE!!!
          It becomes clear fast: if Finn doesn't get away, he's gonna
          get sucked in too! So Finn scampers away from the TIE FIGHTER
          as it SINKS INTO THE SAND! We're in the Sinking Fields. A
          few moments and IT'S GONE.
          Finn's out of breath. Horrified. Then A GIANT EXPLOSION
          ERUPTS FROM below, SENDING SAND AND DEBRIS EVERYWHERE!
          Finn sees this, disoriented, scared, exhausted and defeated.
          And all alone.

          EXT. DESERT - DAY

          ENDLESS DUNES BEHIND HIM, Finn walks, removing pieces of his
          Stormtrooper gear, using Poe's FLIGHT JACKET for shade.

          EXT. DESERT - DAY

          Exhausted, Finn continues his trek across the endless, sandy
          nothingness.

          EXT. DESERT - DAY

          Finn, parched and losing hope, he walks to the edge of a
          massive dune, looks out into the epic valley below. Miles
          ahead: NIIMA OUTPOST.

          INT. STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE - DAY

          General Hux and Kylo Ren walk the length of the bridge.

                          GENERAL HUX
           Supreme Leader Snoke was explicit.
           Capture the droid if we can, but
           destroy it if we must.

                          KYLO REN
           How capable are your soldiers,
           General?

                          GENERAL HUX

                          (WITH VITRIOL)
           I won't have you question my methods.

                          KYLO REN
           They're obviously skilled at
           committing high treason. Perhaps
           Leader Snoke should consider using a
           clone army.

                          GENERAL HUX

                          (YOU SON-OF-A-BITCH)
           My men are exceptionally trained --
           programmed from birth--

                          KYLO REN
           Then they should have no problem
           retrieving the droid. Unharmed.

                          GENERAL HUX
           Careful, Ren. That your "personal
           interests" not interfere with orders
           from Leader Snoke.

                          KYLO REN
           I want that map. For your sake, I
           suggest you get it.
          Ren heads off. Hux hates him.

          EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY

          Sun-scorched and exhausted, Finn stumbles out of the desert
          into the Outpost. In a heatstroke daze he moves past enormous
          old SHIP PARTS, MERCHANTS, SCAVENGERS and TENTED STALLS.

                          FINN
           Water... water... water..
          He sees a WATER TROUGH where a filthy, slobbering hippo-like
          creature (a HAPPABORE) DRINKS. Finn moves to it, uses his
          hands to desperately DRINK the filthy water. After a couple
          swallows he SPITS IT OUT, disgusted.

                          FINN (CONT'D)
           -- Awgh, GAH!
          But he's parched and immediately RETURNS FOR MORE.
          ACROSS THE MARKETPLACE, REY kneels with an emphatically

          BEEPING BB-8.
          Just then, TWO of UNKAR'S THUGS approach and stop her. One
          clearly tells her that they're taking the droid. BB-8 reacts
          nervously as Rey resists them -- one pulls a SACK over BB-8
          while the other grabs Rey's arm -- in the tussle, Rey KNOCKS
          OVER METAL URNS for sale --
          Finn, still drinking, is PUSHED OVER by the happabore. He
          falls to the ground, then turns to look when he HEARS
          CRASHING. He sees, through the tents, REY FIGHTING.
          He moves UP CLOSER to help this young woman being accosted --
          but he STOPS when Rey begins to FIGHT BACK -- scrappy and
          feral, she KICKS, BITES and HITS. Finn is taken aback as
          she DEFEATS the attackers, who hit the sand, hard.
          Finn just watches, stunned.
          Rey moves to the COVERED BB-8 -- PULLS THE SACK OFF OF HIM.
          Finn cannot believe his eyes. IT'S POE'S DROID!
          Rey talks to BB-8, who, nervous now, looks around and...
          SEES FINN! BB-8 STARTS BEEPING like crazy. Then something
          insane happens: REY LOOKS AT FINN.

                          REY
           (To BB-8) Who? Him?
          Finn is confused. Rey stands, staring at Finn, defiant.
          Finn can feel trouble coming -- and Rey begins CHARGING AT
          HIM, quarterstaff in hand.
          Realizing he's the target, Finn begins to RUN -- away from
          her, through the tent marketplace. Rey goes after him -- he
          turns a corner -- then another -- then BAM! She's got
          ahead of him and SLAMS HIM TO THE GROUND WITH HER STAFF!
          Finn is on his back, out of breath and freaked out. She
          holds the staff on him threateningly:

                          REY
           What's your hurry, thief?

                          FINN
           What--?! Thief?
          BB-8 ROLLS UP FAST, MOVES TO FINN -- a WELDING ARM TELESCOPES

          FROM HIS BODY AND SHOCKS FINN!

                          FINN (CONT'D)
           OW! HEY! What?!

                          REY
           The jacket! This droid says you
           stole it!

                          FINN
           I've had a pretty messed up day,
           alright?! So I'd appreciate it you
           stop accusing me -- OW!!!
           (BB-8 has ZAPPED him

                          AGAIN)

           STOP IT!

                          REY
           Where'd you get it? It belongs to
           his master.
          Finn looks at her -- then the agitated droid, Finn's mind
          racing. He puts it all together. Frustrated, but sighs
          heavily, needing to respond somehow. So he makes a hard
          decision: to tell the truth.

                          FINN
           It belonged to Poe Dameron. That
           was his name, right?
          Rey and BB-8 react, surprised and wanting more.

                          FINN (CONT'D)
           He was captured... by the First Order!
           I helped him escape but our ship
           crashed.

                          (RELIVING IT)
           Poe didn't make it.
           (sees BB-8 is sad,

                          ROLLS OFF)
           Look, I tried to help him. I'm
           sorry...
          BB-8 heads off to the side, depressed. Rey watches BB-8,
          then considers Finn again. Says, a bit impressed:

                          REY
           So you're with the Resistance?

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:
          Finn's mind races again. He makes an easy decision: to lie.

                          FINN
           Obviously. Yes. I am. I'm with
           the Resistance, yeah.

                          (WHISPERS)
           I'm with the Resistance.
          Rey lowers her staff, Finn stands. Rey studies him:

                          REY
           I've never met a Resistance fighter
           before.

                          FINN
           Well, this is what we look like.
           Some of us. Others look different.

                          REY
           BB-8 says he's on a secret mission,
           he has to get back to your base.

                          FINN
           Apparently he's carrying a map that
           leads to Luke Skywalker, and
           everyone's after it.
          She turns to him, concerned, curious. And asks:

                          REY
           Luke Skywalker? I thought he was a
           myth.
          Just then BB-8 BEEPS MADLY at something he sees.

                          REY (CONT'D)
           What is it?
          Rey moves to him, peeks around a tent corner. Now Finn moves
          to see: at a distance, TWO STORMTROOPERS TALKING TO UNKAR'S
          THUGS -- who POINT THEIR WAY!
          Finn urgently grabs her hand and heads for the tents:

                          REY (CONT'D)
           (re: her hand)
           What are you doing?!

                          FINN
           Come on!
          Suddenly LASER BLASTS RIP PAST THEM, HIT THE CLEANING UNIT,
          SPEWING STEAM! Rey SCREAMS -- MORE BLASTS as they run!

          EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY

          Finn and Rey holding hands, the three race, ZIGZAGGING through
          a maze of tents:

           Come on, BB-8!

                          REY
           Let go of me!

                          FINN
           No, we gotta move!

                          REY
           (pulls her hand back)
           I know how to run without you holding
           my hand! BB-8 stay close! This
           way!
          Now Finn and BB-8 follow Rey -- ANOTHER BLAST just missing
          them! They disappear through a tent.
          TRACK FAST WITH STORMTROOPERS, through the tent maze. They
          come out of a tent, HAVING MOMENTARILY LOST THEIR TARGET.

                          STORMTROOPER
           Call in the air strike!
          REY, FINN AND BB-8 duck into another tent:

          INT. NIIMA OUTPOST - TENT - DAY

          Rey, Finn and BB-8 move through RUSTY WARES and take cover.
          Quiet, urgent:

                          REY
           They're shooting at both of us!

                          FINN
           Yeah, they saw you with me! You're
           marked!

                          REY
           Well, thanks for that!

                          FINN
           I'm not the one who chased you down
           with a stick! Does anyone have
           blasters around here?!

                          REY

                          (TO BB-8)
           Are you okay?
          Finn QUIETS HER WITH A GESTURE, HEARING SOMETHING.
          PUSH IN ON FINN -- whatever he hears alarms him greatly --
          he GRABS HER HAND AGAIN -- PULLS HER AWAY --

                          REY (CONT'D)
           Stop taking my hand!

          EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - TENT - DAY

          Finn pulls Rey from the tent -- BB-8 FOLLOWS --
          As they race from the tent a TIE FIGHTER SCREAMS INTO VIEW

          FROM BEHIND THE TENTS! A SECOND FOLLOWS CLOSE BEHIND. IT

          FIRES AT THEM -- A MASSIVE BLAST SENDS REY AND FINN FLYING --

          BB-8 ROLLING!

                         

                         
          WIDE SHOT: TWO TIE FIGHTERS SCREAM OVER the town, the
          EXPLOSION throws sand and debris fifty feet into the air.
          Rey is thrown HARD to the ground -- she is rattled, truly
          afraid. Then she turns: FINN lies nearby, unconscious.
          Suddenly afraid, she scrambles to him, rolls him over. BB-8
          ROLLS OVER, BEEPING in concern.

                          REY
           Hey!
          As Finn comes to, he sees her. Through his fog:

                          FINN
           -- Are you okay?
          And that very question touches her -- having never in her
          life been asked it.

                          REY
           Yeah.
           (extends her hand)
           Follow me.
          Grateful, Finn takes it. They're off.
          LOCALS run amok as TIE fighters DIVE BOMB. REY, Finn and BB-

          8 SPRINT, BLASTER EXPLOSIONS GET CLOSER AND CLOSER!

          EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - SPACEPORT - DAY

          Rey, STAFF strapped to her back, leads the way as she, Finn
          and BB-8 race into the spaceport. Finn glances back: TWO
          TIE FIGHTERS BANK their return. They YELL:

                          FINN
           We can't outrun them!
          Rey POINTS to a parked, four-engine SHIP ahead:

                          REY
           We might in that quad-jumper!

                          FINN
           We need a pilot!

                          REY
           We've got one!

           (then, indicates one

                          OFF-CAMERA)
           What about that ship?

                          REY
           That one's garbage!
          They run for the JUMPER but the passing TIE FIGHTERS FIRE AT
          IT, BLOWING IT APART IN A HUGE FLAME BALL! Rey, coming to a
          quick stop, RIGHT UP TO CAMERA:

                          REY (CONT'D)
           The garbage'll do!
          She turns and runs back -- Finn and BB-8 follow as they all
          run toward the piece of junk -- and we see it for the first
          time: THE MILLENNIUM FALCON!
          TIE fighters BANK AROUND AGAIN. Finn, Rey and BB-8 run up
          the ramp of the semi-tarped Falcon.

          INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY

          Finn, Rey and BB-8 enter the ship -- she hits a control and
          the door DESCENDS CLOSED as she races to the cockpit:

                          REY
           Gunner position's down there!

                          FINN

                          (CLIMBS DOWN)
           Y'ever fly this thing?

          INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY

          Rey tosses her staff aside, jumps into the pilot's seat,
          frantically flips switches. BB-8 rolls in behind her as the
          ENGINES WHINE to life:

                          REY
           No! This ship hasn't been flown in
           years!

          INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNNER POSITION - DAY

          Finn buckles into the gunner seat -- to his shock the SEAT
          WHIPS TO THE LEFT, startling him -- he grabs the controls to
          steady himself.

                          FINN
           Great.
           (reacts to seat)
           Whoa! I can do this, I can do this--

          INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY

          Rey bucks herself up. Doesn't believe her quick words:

          Rey pulls the yoke:

          THE FALCON ENGINES LIGHT UP BRIGHT!

          EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - SPACEPORT - DAY

          The FALCON RISES, WILDLY -- ITS TARPS FLY OFF -- THE SHIP

          SPINS AND TILTS, SLAMS INTO AND CRUMBLES THE TOWN'S ARCHWAY!
          From the tents, Unkar Plutt runs out, SCREAMS:

                          UNKAR

           HEY!!!! THAT'S MIIIIIIINE!!!
          The Falcon BLASTS AWAY, two TIE FIGHTERS chase it, fast!

          INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY

          Rey pilots, headed for the sky!
          Finn SWINGS into frame, trying to work the GUNS.

                          FINN
           Whoa! Hey! Oh! Stay low! Stay
           low!

                          REY

           WHAT?

                          FINN
           Stay low! It confuses their tracking!
          For a crazy instant Rey LETS GO OF THE YOKE, stretches to
          the co-pilot controls -- THE FALCON CANTS!

                          REY
           BB-8, hold on!
          Rey finally REACHES the switches, returns to the yoke,
          stabilizing the ship, afraid of this next move.

                          REY

           I'M GOING LOW!!!

          EXT. DESERT - DAY

          BEHIND THE FALCON as it DRAMATICALLY BANKS AT AN UPWARD ARC,
          UPSIDE-DOWN, then SWOOPS PERILOUSLY LOW across the sand.
          Two TIE FIGHTERS SCREAM past us!

          INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY

          In the cylindrical corridor, BB-8 ROLLS TO THE CEILING!
          Rey looks back for a flash as the TIE Fighters pass -- They
          are ROCKED BY A BLAST!

          Finn flicks switches -- The GUN TARGETING LIGHTS UP:

                          FINN
           I'm working on it! Are the shields
           up?
          Rey strains, reaching for something in the co-pilot seat.

                          REY
           Not so easy without a co-pilot!
          Finn struggles with the gun controls and SWEEPING CHAIR:

                          FINN
           Try sitting in this thing!
          Finn finally FIRES BACK at the two TIE FIGHTERS!

          EXT. DESERT - DAY

          Finn's shots MISS. The TIE FIGHTERS ARC BACK IN PURSUIT and
          SCREAM PAST US toward the Falcon! Both TIES FIRING!

          INT. TIE FIGHTER COCKPIT - DAY

          The BLACK-SUITED PILOT FIRES at the Falcon.

          INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNNER POSITION - DAY

          The Falcon is ROCKED by another BLAST!

                          (TO HERSELF)
           I hope.

          EXT. DESERT - DAY

          The Falcon speeds through a ROCK FORMATION, GRAZING THE ROCK,
          TAKING OUT A CHUNK -- the two TIE Fighters in pursuit, FIRING!
          The Falcon BANKS SO HARD, the edge of the ship RIPS A LINE
          IN THE SAND as it turns, REVEALING THE SHIP GRAVEYARD AHEAD.

          INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY

          BB-8 EXTENDS MAGNETIC CABLES to brace himself in a corridor.

          Rey maneuvers the ship deeper into the graveyard.

          EXT. DESERT - SPACESHIP GRAVEYARD - DAY

          The TIE FIGHTER CRASHES amid the DEBRIS, THREE SCAVENGERS
          instantly there to consume the new bounty.
          The Falcon, pursued by the ONE REMAINING TIE FIGHTER, slaloms
          through the MASSIVE WRECKAGE, GRAZING THE OLD SHIPS as she
          goes, pieces flying.
          The TIE FIGHTER FIRES -- HITTING THE FALCON'S LOWER TURRET,

          SPINNING IT, JAMMING IT INTO FORWARD POSITION!

          The ship is HIT AGAIN -- afraid, Rey's mind races as she
          scans the area -- and gets an idea.

                          REY
           Get ready!

          Rey pilots the ship up AND INTO THE REAR OF A CRASHED SUPER

          Rey, scared, girds herself as she quickly runs out of space
          in the wreck.

          The Falcon makes a HARD RIGHT TURN out of the Destroyer.
          Rey then CUTS POWER AND FLIPS THE SHIP SO BACK FACES FRONT!
          FINN CAN NOW SEE THE PURSUING TIE FIGHTER! He FIRES,

          DESTROYING IT!
          REY GUNS THE ENGINES again, FLIPS THE FALCON and FLIES AWAY
          as the TIE FIGHTER CRASHES!

                          FINN
           Whooo!
          The Falcon ROARS OFF, victorious, leaving the ship graveyard

          BB-8 looks at him: really? Finn is reminded: HE'S LIED TO
          HER. She looks at Finn with a sweet smile.

                          FINN
           Rey...
          But before Finn can say anything they JUMP: across the lounge,
          STEAM BURSTS from under the grating.

                          REY
           Help me with this! Quick!
          They hurry to the grating, PULL IT UP together. BB-8 rolls
          over, watches.

                          FINN
           Whoa! What's going on?
          She goes below as BB-8 BEEPS concern.

          EXT. SPACE - DAY

          The First Order Star Destroyer above Jakku.

          INT. STAR DESTROYER BRIDGE - DAY

          Lieutenant Mitaka moves to Ren, who looks out across the
          star field. Mitaka swallows, uneasy with his task.

           Sir. We were unable to acquire the
           droid on Jakku.
          Ren turns to look at him, he says nothing.

           LIEUTENANT MITAKA (CONT'D)
           It escaped capture aboard a stolen
           Corellian YT model freighter.

                          KYLO REN
           The droid... stole a freighter?

                          LIEUTENANT MITAKA
           Not exactly, sir. It had help.
          Ren says nothing. Which says everything. Mitaka sweats.

           LIEUTENANT MITAKA (CONT'D)
           We have no confirmation, but we
           believe FN-2187 may have been helped
           in the escape--
          Ren IGNITES HIS LIGHTSABER, TURNS AND SLASHES AT THE CONSOLE
          BEHIND HIM! HOLD ON Mitaka, who reacts, looks away -- winces.
          The horrible SOUNDS of Ren's rage continues. Finally Mitaka
          looks up. The metallic wall behind Ren is RIPPED with glowing
          scars.

                          KYLO REN
           Anything else?
          Mitaka hates to say the following, but:

                          LIEUTENANT MITAKA
           The two were accompanied by a girl.
          Ren reaches out -- Mitaka is suddenly, violently PULLED TOWARD
          REN, into his black glove:

                          KYLO REN
           What girl?

                          REY
           BB-8 said the location of the
           Resistance Base is "need to know" --

           This?
          She catches it and goes under again, leaving Finn and BB-8
          alone. He contemplates telling her the truth. This is his
          moment. But instead he knees to BB-8, says quietly, urgently:

                          FINN (CONT'D)
           You gotta tell us where the base is.

                          (BB-8 BEEPS)
           I don't speak that. Alright, between
           us, I'm not with the Resistance,
           okay?
           (BB-8 backs up)
           -- I'm just trying to get away from
           the First Order -- but you tell us
           where your base is, I'll get there
           first -- deal?!
           (BB-8 COCKS his head)
           Droid, please.
          Rey pops up again:

                          REY
           Pilex driver, hurry!
          Finn moves for the tool.

                          REY (CONT'D)
           So where's your base?

                          FINN

          She and Finn look to BB-8 -- who considers the whole
          situation, then BEEPS.

           Yeah, the Ileenium system, that's

          A smiling Finn gives BB-8 a THUMBS UP. BB-8 quickly extends
          his WELDING TORCH and TURNS IT UPWARD, then retracts it.

                          REY

          Bb-8 has moved to Finn -- TIPS HIS HEAD, shows him the tool.
          He throws her the tape, she disappears below:

          Han gives Chewie a nod to check out the ship. Chewie heads
          off one way, Han in another.
          The grating above LIFTS OFF -- hands in surrender, they look
          up at Han, who's training his blaster on them, threatening.

           Who stole it from me! Well, you
           tell him Han Solo just stole back
           the Millennium Falcon for good.
          Han walks away, takes in the ship: it's his again. Doesn't
          see that Rey is awed. His back to all of them, he smiles.

                          HAN
           Yeah, I knew him. I knew Luke.
          Suddenly: a distant, METALLIC KA-CHUNK!

                          HAN (CONT'D)
           Don't tell me a Rathtar's gotten

                          LOOSE--
          Han hurries out -- they all follow, (Chewie, Rey, Finn, then
          BB-8), Finn with WILD CONCERN:

                          FINN
           Wait -- a what?! Did you just say
           Rathtars? Hey!

          INT. CARGO SHIP - HANGAR - DAY

          The Falcon is parked in this giant freighter's hangar. Han
          moves to a CONTROL PANEL, they all follow him.

                          FINN
           You're not hauling Rathtars on this
           freighter, are you?

                          HAN
           I'm hauling Rathtars.
          On the CONTROL PANEL: IMAGES ON SCREENS FROM ALL AROUND THE
          SHIP. Including the EXTERIOR, where a TRANSPORT SHIP is
          LANDING ON THE FREIGHTER. Han is fearful.

                          HAN (CONT'D)
           Oh great. It's the Guavian Death
           Gang -- they must've tracked us from
           Nantoon.
          Han heads off as:

                          REY
           What's a Rathtar?

          INT. CARGO SHIP - CARGO CONTAINER CORRIDOR - DAY

          Han leads our group down a LONG NARROW HALL lined with cargo
          containers.

                         CONTINUED: HAN
           They're big and dangerous...

                          FINN
           Y'ever heard of the Trillia Massacre?!

                          REY
           No.

                          FINN
           Good.
          They turn a corner:

                          HAN
           I got three of 'em going to King
           Prana.

                          FINN
           THREE?! How'd you get them on board?

                          HAN
           I used to have a bigger crew.
          Chewie GROAN-TALKS, concurring.

          CUT TO: LOOKING UP AS A HATCH OPENS IN THE FLOOR. HAN AND

          CO. ARE THERE.

                          HAN
           Get below deck and stay there until
           I say so -- don't even think about
           taking the Falcon.

                          REY
           What about BB-8?

                          HAN
           He stays with me -- until I get rid
           of the gang, then you can have him
           back and be on your way.

                          FINN
           What about the Rathtars... where are
           you keeping them?
          A TERRIFYING BAM: a GROTESQUE RATHTAR GIANT TONGUE SLAMS
          into the CARGO CONTAINER window behind Finn, whose heart
          stops.

                          HAN
           There's one.

                          REY
           What are you gonna do?

                          HAN
           Same thing I always do: talk my way
           out of it.

                          (CHEWIE MOAN-TALKS)
           Yes, I do. Every time.

          INT. CARGO SHIP - NARROW CORRIDOR - DAY

          A PORTAL opens. The GUAVIAN DEATH GANG enters. One man in
          a SUIT (BALA-TIK), and five SECURITY SOLDIERS in badass
          UNIFORMS with ROUND-FACE HELMETS. They turn into and stop
          at one end of the corridor. Han, Chewie and BB-8 forty feet
          away in the middle of the long hall.

                          BALA-TIK
           Han Solo. You are a dead man.
          Han smiles innocently, friendly. BB-8 nervously looks back
          and forth at the gang, and Han.

                          HAN
           Bala-Tik. What's the problem?

                          BALA-TIK
           The problem is we loaned you fifty
           thousand for this job.

                         INTERCUT WITH:

          INT. CARGO SHIP - BELOW FLOOR GRATING - DAY

          They look up, trying to get a view.

                          REY
           Can you see them?

                          FINN
           No.
          They start crawling down the crawl space.

                          BALA-TIK
           I heard you also borrowed fifty
           thousand from Kanjiklub.

                          HAN
           You know you can't trust those little
           freaks! How long've we known each
           other?
          Rey and Finn arrive under the gang. They WHISPER:

                          REY
           They have blasters...

                          FINN
           A lot of 'em.
          We RISE THROUGH THE FLOOR to see the GANG and Han and company
          in the distance.

                          BALA-TIK
           The question is how much longer will
           we know each other? Not long. We
           want our money back now.

                          HAN
           Ya think hunting Rathtars is cheap?
           I spent that money.

                          BALA-TIK
           Kanjiklub wants their investment
           back, too.

                          HAN
           I never made a deal with Kanjiklub!

                          BALA-TIK
           Tell that to Kanjiklub.
          The SOUND of a PORTAL OPENING. Han's face GOES WHITE as he
          turns to the OTHER END OF THE CORRIDOR, where KANJIKLUB
          MEMBERS APPEAR. A GANG in a MEDIEVAL BANDITO style.
          Han smiles uncomfortably at the Kanjiklub members. Its
          LEADER, TASU LEECH, out front. Han tries to play it off:

                          HAN
           Tasu Leech. Good to see you.
          Tasu speaks an alien language, we SUBTITLE:

                          TASU LEECH
           Wrong again, Solo. It's over for
           you.
          Tasu COCKS HIS WEAPON, there for blood. BB-8 is nervous.
          Finn and Rey react to the sounds of the new gang -- start
          CRAWLING BACK the other way to see them.

                          HAN
           Boys. You're both gonna get
           what I promised! Have I ever
           not delivered for you before?

                          BALA-TIK
           Yeah.

                          TASU LEECH
           Twice!
          Han realizes he's right.

                          HAN
           What was the second time?

                          BALA-TIK
           Your game is old. There's no one in
           the galaxy left for you to swindle.

                          TASU LEECH
           Nowhere left for you to hide.

           That BB unit... the First Order is
           looking for one just like it. And
           two fugitives.
          Finn and Rey SUDDENLY STOP CRAWLING, tense.
          BB-8 hides behind Han's leg. PUSH IN ON Han as he realizes:
          Finn and Rey are in real trouble.

                          HAN
           First I've heard of it.
          Below the grating, Finn and Rey look at each other, afraid.
          Above, another Kanjiklubber (RAZOO QIN-FEE) says (SUBTITLED):

                          RAZOO QIN-FEE
           Search the freighter.
          One of the Kanjiklubbers begins moving down the corridor,
          AIMING A FLASHLIGHT DOWN BELOW, searching for:
          FINN AND REY, in a QUIET PANIC BELOW: THEY START CRAWLING
          FAST in the opposite direction they came.
          Rey crawls off fast, Finn follows. They quickly arrive at
          a JUNCTION BOX AREA, Rey looking at the controls.

                          REY
           Wait wait wait wait. If we close
           the blast doors in that corridor, we
           can trap both gangs!

                          FINN
           Close the blast doors from here?

                          REY
           Resetting the fuses should do it.
          Rey begins RESETTING the FUSES, SPARKS shooting from them as
          they do. Finn quickly joins in.
          Rey and Finn FINISH resetting the fuses boxes. Rey smiles
          optimistically. Finn looks hopeful too.
          DOWN AN EMPTY ROW OF LARGE CONTAINERS, which OPEN -- and a
          GIANT RATHTAR -- an ENORMOUS, FIERCE AND RAVENOUS LAND OCTOPUS --

          SLITHERS OUT OF ITS CAGE!
          BACK UP TOP as BANKS OF LIGHTS BEGIN GOING OFF, ONE BY ONE.
          The GANGS look around.
          Han's eyes go wide -- he gets it -- and it's bad. QUIETLY:

                          HAN
           ... I got a bad feeling about this...
          Suddenly all the LIGHTS COME ON AGAIN -- even down below,
          where Rey realizes it hasn't gone as planned.

                          REY
           Oh no.

                          FINN
           Oh no, what?

                          REY

                          (PALE)
           Wrong fuses.

          IN ANOTHER CORRIDOR, BACK WITH THE GANGS:

                          BALA-TIK
           Kill them! And take the droid!
          The gangs AIM THEIR WEAPONS JUST AS A RATHTAR APPEARS BEHIND

          THE GUAVIAN DEATH GANG, GRABBING TWO MEMBERS! THE OTHERS
          SCREAM AND RUN! The gang FIRES BACK -- BLASTS FLY!
          Han and Chewie react, flinching -- then turn to Kanjiklub as
          a RATHTAR APPEARS BEHIND THEM, ROARING DEAFENINGLY! The
          Gang turns -- others run, FIRE AT IT.

          INT. CARGO SHIP CORRIDOR A - DAY

          Han, Chewie and BB-8 race down the hall -- A MEMBER OF THE
          KANJIKLUB GANG comes around the corner. Han PUNCHES him
          with one blow, throws him toward the Rathtar. They keep
          steppin....

          INT. CARGO SHIP - BELOW FLOOR GRATING - DAY

          Rey and Finn hurriedly crawl through the space below decks.

                          FINN
           This was a mistake!

                          REY
           Huge!

          INT. CARGO SHIP CORRIDOR A - DAY

          Two Guavian Death Gang members run through the ship -- passing
          Tasu Leech, who sees another Kanjiklub member down the
          corridor -- who gets GRABBED BY A TENTACLE! Tasu tries to
          help him, but he gets PULLED UP AND AWAY! Tasu hears a
          distant terror-scream of a Rathtar, and runs the other way.
          Other Kanjiklub members YELL at him to avoid that direction --
          they all turn a corner -- a RATHTAR IS THERE AND GRABS THE
          TWO OTHERS! Tasu FIRES at the beast and RUNS OFF -- and we
          land on a FLOOR HATCH, which opens. Rey and Finn climb out,
          quickly.

                         
          They turn a corridor --

                          REY
           What do they look like?

                          FINN
           They look like that.
          Finn yanks her away. They race around another corner -- a

          RATHTAR IS THERE!

                          FINN (CONT'D)
           This way!

                          REY

          They scream and run off -- but Finn is GRABBED, PULLED AWAY

          FAST!

                          REY (CONT'D)

           FINN!
          But the Rathtar's fast and TURNS A CORNER, losing Rey --

           REY!

          INT. CARGO SHIP CORRIDOR E - DAY

          TIGHT ON FINN as he's being yanked down the hall, SCREAMING
          as he struggles to get loose!
          Rey turns the corner -- Finn is gone -- nowhere to be seen.

                          REY

           FINN!!!!
          Without Finn, she is instantly distraught -- then she
          realizes: SHE'S JUST PASSED A CONTROL PANEL! Her eyes light
          up as she moves to it: a BANK OF VIDEO MONITORS OF THE SHIP --
          and there's Finn, being dragged by a Rathtar toward an OPEN
          BLAST DOOR. Rey's hand on the button, she waits... then

          SLAMS THE BUTTON!

          INT. CARGO SHIP CORRIDOR B - DAY

          The BLAST DOOR INSTANTLY CLOSES ON ONE OF THE RATHTAR'S
          TENTACLES! It SCREAMS IN PAIN, ITS SEVERED TENTACLE STILL
          WRAPPED AROUND FINN'S LEG! Finn scrambles up, desperately
          shaking the sticky tentacle off his leg!
          Rey arrives, runs to Finn, beaming to see him alive -- he is
          adrenaline-rushed, in shock:

                          REY
           Finn!

          ANOTHER CORRIDOR - Finn and Rey run towards the Falcon.

          INT. CARGO SHIP CORRIDOR D - DAY

          Han, Chewie and BB-8 take cover, Han exchanging BLASTER FIRE
          with GANG MEMBERS AT THE OTHER END OF THE HALL.

                          HAN
           I got the door. Cover us!
          Chewie GROAN-AGREES. Chewie FIRES DOWN THE HALL as Han
          CROSSES THE CORRIDOR, BB-8 following nervously. As Chewie
          exchanges blaster fire, Han works the controls.
          THE HATCH OPENS (FALCON in the distance) -- just as CHEWIE
          IS HIT IN THE SHOULDER BY ENEMY FIRE! He goes down with a

          LOUD GROAN!

                          HAN (CONT'D)
           Chewie! You okay?
          Han GRABS CHEWIE'S BOWCASTER, FIRES at the DOOR CONTROLS,

          BADASS!

           Wow. Come on! Come on!

          INT. CARGO SHIP HANGAR - DAY

          Run with Finn and Rey as they turn into the hangar, toward
          the Falcon. Han helps WOUNDED CHEWIE up the ramp, sees them.

                          REY
           Han!
          Finn and Rey race past BB-8 -- as they go up the ramp, Han
          says to Rey:

                          HAN
           You, close the door behind us!

                          (TO FINN)
           You take care of Chewie!
          Han and Rey race up the ramp as Finn heads up with Chewie,
          who SCREAMS WILDLY IN PAIN!

          INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY

          Han stands at the navicomputer, hitting switches. Rey enters
          fast, moves past him to Chewie's seat.

           Hey, where are you going?

           I hate that guy.
          Han sits as, Rey hitting buttons:

                          REY
           And you could use a co-pilot.

                          HAN
           I got one, he's back there.

          Han and Rey in the seats:

           From inside the hangar? Is that
           even possible?

                          HAN
           I never ask that question until after
           I've done it.
          A RATHTAR JUMPS ONTO THE WINDSHIELD -- REY SCREAMS! Its
          GIANT MOUTH CHEWING AT THE GLASS! Han works the controls:

                          HAN (CONT'D)
           This is not how I thought this day
           was gonna go -- angle the shields --

          IN THE LOUNGE, Chewie is in pain -- Finn going through a

          The ship is hit.

          He hits a switch -- but NOTHING.

                          HAN (CONT'D)
           What?!
          But Rey reaches over, hits a switch, matter-of-factly.

                          REY
           Compressor.
          Han doesn't like it but she's right -- he hits the switch
          again and the HYPERDRIVE FIRES! The hangar is FILLED WITH
          LIGHTSPEED BLAST as the ATTACKING GANG MEMBERS ARE BLASTED
          BACK LIKE DRY LEAVES. In the cockpit the RATHTAR RIPS AWAY
          as THE STARS STRETCH LIKE ELASTIC and we CUT TO:

          EXT. CARGO SHIP - DAY

          Camera ROTATES as the Falcon DISAPPEARS IN A STREAK, leaving
          the cargo ship behind.

          INT. CARGO SHIP - DAY

          PUSH IN on a HANGAR DOOR where Bala-Tik arrives at the window,
          SEETHING. Makes a CALL:

                          BALA-TIK
           Inform the First Order that Han Solo
           has the droid they want. And it's
           aboard the Millennium Falcon.

          EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY

          A pair of TIE fighters roar towards a magnificent PLANET,
          frozen WHITE. This is the STARKILLER BASE, a natural planet
          that has been hacked and modified into something sinister.
          Over this we HEAR a DEEP, almost SOOTHING VOICE. A voice
          very much in control, of power:

           SNOKE (V.O.)
           The droid will soon be delivered to
           the Resistance...

          INT. STARKILLER PLANET - ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT

          KYLO REN and General Hux in a dark space, looking UPWARD at
          someone addressing them.
          We're in a massive and dark ASSEMBLY ROOM. Hundreds of DESKS
          in a stadium arc, focused on a platform where we see SUPREME
          LEADER SNOKE. Not entirely human, at nearly twenty-five
          feet tall. All of him a STONY GREY. Old, wounded, fragile
          and powerful, all at the same time.

                         

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

                          SNOKE
           ... Leading them to the last Jedi.
           If Skywalker returns, the new Jedi
           will rise.

           General! Our strategy must now
           change.

                          GENERAL HUX
           The weapon. It is ready. I believe
           the time has come to use it. We
           shall destroy the government that
           supports the Resistance, the Republic.
           Without their friends to protect
           them, the Resistance will be
           vulnerable, and we will stop them
           before they reach Skywalker.
          Snoke considers. Almost seems to die for a moment. Then:

                          SNOKE
           Go. Oversee preparations.

                          GENERAL HUX
           Yes, Supreme Leader.
          General Hux, proud, cocksure, exits. Kylo Ren watches him
          go. Snoke SITS. A new intimacy in his voice.

                          SNOKE
           There's been an awakening. Have you
           felt it?

                          KYLO REN
           Yes.

                          SNOKE
           There's something more. The droid
           we seek is aboard the Millennium
           Falcon. In the hands of your father,
           Han Solo.
          Kylo Ren reacts with subtle, but real, surprise.

                          KYLO REN
           He means nothing to me.

                          SNOKE
           Even you, master of the Knights of
           Ren, have never faced such a test.

           By the grace of your training, I
           will not be seduced.

                          SNOKE
           We shall see. We shall see.
          A gentle, satisfied nod from Snoke, and Kylo Ren, obsessed,
          filled up, exits. Snoke watches him disappear, a grotesque
          evil SMILE growing -- as he DISINTEGRATES -- Snoke has been
          a HOLOGRAM all along.

          EXT. LIGHTSPEED SPACE - DAY

          RACING with the Falcon through the STRINGLIGHT of lightspeed.

          INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY

          CHAOS: INTERCUT between the COCKPIT where Han and Rey pilot,
          ALARMS SOUNDING, problems everywhere, and the LOUNGE where
          CHEWIE YELPS as Finn nervously works to BANDAGE HIS SHOULDER.

          SPARKS!

                          HAN
           Electrical overload!

                          REY
           I can fix that!

                          HAN

          INT. LOUNGE:

          CHEWIE HOWLS IN PAIN! Finn hangs in there, wraps a bandage
          on Chewie's shoulder: Chewie ROARS. BB-8 scurries off.

                          FINN
           Chewie, come on! I need help with
           this giant hairy thing! Stop moving!
           Chewie!

          INT. FALCON COCKPIT:


                          HAN
           You hurt Chewie, you're gonna deal
           with me!

          INT. LOUNGE:

                          FINN
           Hurt him?! He almost killed me six
           times!
           (Chewie GRABS HIM by
           the collar, ROARS)
           Which is fine.

          INT. FALCON COCKPIT:


                          HAN
           This hyperdrive blows there's gonna
           be pieces of us in three different
           systems.
          Han at the controls when all the alarms STOP. Rey, satisfied,
          sits in the co-pilot seat. Han is confused.

                          HAN (CONT'D)
           What'd you do?

                          REY
           I by-passed the compressor.
          He looks at her. A little, appreciative laugh. Han exits,
          walking past BB-8.

                          HAN
           Move, Ball.

          INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - LOUNGE AREA - DAY

          Han kneels at Chewie, who lies awake but recovering. Han
          checks his friend's wound with care. Chewie MOAN-TALKS.

                          HAN
           Nah, don't say that, you did great.
           Just rest.
          Han turns to Finn, who sits at the HOLOCHESS set, BB-8 beside
          him. This is awkward for Han, but damn, he means it:

                          HAN (CONT'D)
           Good job, kid. And thanks.

                          FINN
           You're welcome.
          Finn has accidentally hit a button on the chess set, and the
          PIECES appear, looking up at Finn, curiously. The pieces
          start to FIGHT as Finn fiddles with the controls, trying to
          turn it off.

                          HAN
           So, fugitives, huh?

                          REY

           ... I'm just a scavenger.
          Han gives Finn a skeptical once-over as Finn finally manages
          to TURN THE CHESS SET OFF as Rey enters. Han looks to BB-8.

                          HAN

          BB-8 rolls forward -- and suddenly PROJECTS A HOLOGRAPHIC

          MAP, FILLING THE ROOM. PLANETS, STARS, SYSTEMS.
          They all react. Chewie sits to look up. Han moves through
          stars, becomes reflective.

                          HAN
           This map's not complete. It's just
           a piece. Ever since Luke disappeared,
           people have been looking for him.

                          REY
           Why'd he leave?

                          HAN
           He was training a new generation of
           Jedi. One boy, an apprentice turned
           against him, destroyed it all. Luke
           felt responsible... He walked away
           from everything.

                          FINN
           Do you know what happened to him?

                          HAN
           There're a lot of rumors. Stories.
           The people who knew him the best
           think he went looking for the first
           Jedi temple.

                          REY
           The Jedi were real?

                          HAN
           I used to wonder that myself. Thought
           it was a bunch of mumbo-jumbo --
           magical power holding together good,
           evil, the dark side and the light.

          An alarm rings on the control station, prompting Han to toggle
          some switches. BB-8 cuts off the hologram. Chewie rises
          and moans to Han, but Han motions for Chewie to lay back

                         DOWN:

          The Falcon CRESTS OVER an ENDLESS GREEN FOREST TO REVEAL a

                          HAN
           Rey. I've been thinkin' about
           bringing on some more crew, Rey. A
           second mate. Someone to help out.
           Someone who can keep up with Chewie
           and me, appreciates the Falcon.

           Are you offering me a job?

                          HAN
           I wouldn't be nice to you. It doesn't
           pay much.

                          REY
           You're offering me a job.

                          HAN
           I'm thinking about it.
          Rey wants to say yes. But something stops her. A line she
          can't cross.

                          HAN (CONT'D)
           Well?

                          REY
           If you were, I'd be flattered. But
           I have to get home.
          Han looks at her, questioningly.

                          HAN
           Jakku?
          Rey looks off, in thought. Yeah, Jakku.

                          REY

                          (BEAT)
           I've already been away too long.

                          HAN

                          (TO CHEWIE)
           Chewie, check out the ship as best
           you can.

                          HAN (CONT'D)
           It's too bad. Chewie kind of likes
           you.
          Han heads off. HOLD on Rey.

          EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY

          Han walks them to the castle.

                          FINN
           Solo, why are we here again?

                          HAN
           To get your droid on a clean ship.

                          REY
           Clean?

           Do you think it was luck that Chewie
           and I found the Falcon? If we can
           find it on our scanners, the First
           Order's not far behind. Want to get
           BB-8 to the Resistance? Maz Kanata
           is our best bet.

                          FINN
           We can trust her, right?

                          HAN
           Relax, kid. She's run this watering
           hole for a thousand years. Maz is a
           bit of an acquired taste, so let me
           do the talking. And whatever you
           do, don't stare...

           REY AND FINN
           At what?

                          HAN
           Any of it.
          The door opens. Music. Madness. And...

          INT. MAZ'S CASTLE - MAIN ROOM - DAY

          We ENTER THE LOUD, CROWDED MESS of a hall -- PUSHING PAST a
          room full of rough and odd ALIENS AND HUMANS, who gamble,
          drink, scheme, negotiate, argue -- until we end up on the
          BACK of a tiny, thousand year-old, four foot tall ALIEN, who
          suddenly STARTS, as if SENSING something -- the Alien TURNS
          TO US: she is FEMALE, wearing large ADJUSTABLE GOGGLES.
          This is MAZ KANATA.

                          MAZ
           Han Solo!
          Everyone turns to look. It's ALL QUIET in here.

                          HAN
           (Sotto) Oh boy. (Louder, waving)
           Hey, Maz!
          NOISE returns. Maz walks to them, pushes someone away.

                          MAZ
           Where's my boyfriend?

                          HAN
           Chewie's working on the Falcon.

                          MAZ
           I like that Wookiee. I assume you
           need something. Desperately. Let's
           get to it.

                         

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:
          Maz walks off, gesturing for them to follow. Finn and Rey
          are confused. Han indicates for them to follow. They do --
          passing the enormous GRUMMGAR, who sits with vixen BAZINE
          NETAL, who watches them suspiciously.
          A SMALL DROID (GA-97), who turns its head to see BB-8
          following Rey across the room. GA-97, now animated, makes a
          small TRANSMITTING SOUND, which is subtitled.

                          GA-97
           Alert the Resistance. Their missing
           droid is here!
          And we CUT TO:

          IN A DARK ALCOVE - MOMENTS LATER
          Bazine enters a shadowy space, stealthily makes a call on a
          communicator. Clearly, BAZINE IS A SPY. Subtitled:

                          BAZINE
           Inform the First Order... I've found
           the droid.

          EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY

          A massive Star Destroyer hovers over the hacked ice planet.

          INT. STAR DESTROYER - KYLO REN'S CHAMBERS - DAY

          A dark space. Kylo Ren, CLOSE TO CAMERA, addresses someone
          OFF-CAMERA whom we do not see.

                          KYLO REN
           Forgive me. I feel it again. The
           pull to the light. Supreme Leader
           senses it. Show me again, the power
           of the darkness, and I will let
           nothing stand in our way. Show me,
           Grandfather, and I will finish what
           you started.
          As his emotion builds, he stands and heads off -- we FOLLOW
          HIM, PIVOTING TO REVEAL who he was talking to: THE BURNT,

          ASHEN, GHOSTLY DEFORMED MASK OF DARTH VADER.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. MAZ'S CASTLE - TABLE - DAY

          Maz is putting together some FOOD as she says:

                          MAZ
           A map to Skywalker himself? You're
           right back in the mess.

                          HAN
           Maz, I need you to get this droid to
           Leia.

           Hmm. No. You've been running away
           from this fight for too long. Han,
           nyakee nago wadda. Go home!

                          HAN
           Leia doesn't want to see me.

                          FINN
           Please, we came here for your help.

                          REY
           What fight?

                          MAZ
           The only fight: against the dark
           side. Through the ages, I've seen
           evil take many forms. The Sith.
           The Empire. Today, it is the First
           Order. Their shadow is spreading
           across the galaxy. We must face
           them. Fight them. All of us.

                          FINN
           There is no fight against the First
           Order! Not one we can win. Look
           around. There's no chance we haven't
           been recognized already. I bet you
           the First Order is on their way right--
          Finn stops, seeing Maz adjusting her goggles, scrutinizing
          him -- her eyes get HUGE.

                          FINN (CONT'D)
           What's this? What are you doing?
          Maz adjusts the goggles again. Her eyes get impossibly
          BIGGER. She grunts recognition. She hoists herself on the
          tabletop, knocking over food and plates, crawling towards
          Finn.

                          FINN (CONT'D)
           Solo, what is she doing?

                          HAN
           I don't know, but it ain't good.

                          MAZ
           If you live long enough you see the
           same eyes in different people. I'm
           looking at the eyes of a man who
           wants to run.

                          FINN
           (eyes on Maz)
           You don't know a thing about me.
           Where I'm from. What I've seen.

           You don't know the First Order like
           I do. They'll slaughter us. We all
           need to run.
          Rey is stunned. Maz, not so much. She crawls back to her
          chair. She points to some pirates in the corner.

                          MAZ
           You see those two? They'll trade
           work for transportation to the Outer
           Rim. There, you can disappear.
          Finn sees them. Considers.

                          REY
           Finn!

                          FINN

                          REY
           What about BB-8? We're not done
           yet. We have to get him back to
           your base.

                          FINN
           I can't.
          Finn stands to leave. He offers the gun back to Han.

                          HAN
           Keep it, kid.
          Finn heads off. Rey gets up to follow. Maz dials her lenses
          back to normal, and turns to Han.

                          MAZ
           Who's the girl?

                         ON FINN
          Who has arrived at the table with the ALIEN SMUGGLERS.

                          FINN
           I was told you could get me to the
           Outer Rim.
          Rey barges into the conversation, interrupting.

                          REY
           What are you doing?
          Finn gets up to talk to her.

                          FINN
           (to Big Head)
           Don't leave without me.

           You can't just go. I won't let you.

                          FINN
           I'm not who you think I am.

                          REY
           Finn, what are you talking about?

                          FINN
           I'm not Resistance. I'm not a hero.
           I'm a Stormtrooper.

                          (STOPS HER)
           Like all of them, I was taken from a
           family I'll never know. And raised
           to do one thing...

                          (EMOTIONAL)
           But my first battle, I made a choice.
           I wasn't going to kill for them. So
           I ran.

                          FINN (CONT'D)
           Right into you. And you looked at
           me like no one ever had. I was
           ashamed of what I was. But I'm done
           with the First Order. I'm never
           going back. Rey, come with me.

                          REY
           Don't go.

                          FINN
           Take care of yourself. Please.
          Rey looks at him, crushed. With quiet resignation, Rey
          watches Finn return to the aliens...
          And all three head off. He gets to the front door and walks
          through it.
          Rey is heartsick, but she turns as she hears the sound of a
          young girl in anguish, crying. She follows the sound into
          the castle, turning so she can't see that Finn has looked
          back at her one last time.

          INT. MAZ' CASTLE - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY

          Rey steps down into the basement corridor. BB-8 follows
          her. Walking carefully and confused, she is not sure why
          she's down here. She can hear the echoing sounds of a young
          girl crying. She heads down the hall... to the very end,
          where there is a door. It is almost as if a SOULFUL VIBRATION
          draws her closer. She looks at the door lock -- AND THE

          DOOR OPENS.
          Hesitant, Rey enters.

          INT. MAZ'S CASTLE - CRYPT ROOM - DAY

          Rey moves into the dark, small, vaulted storage room. Old
          treasures line the floors and walls, but there is something
          specific Rey is drawn to: on a table, an old wooden BOX.
          She moves to it, unsure, afraid, as if an energy from inside
          the box has been calling her here. BB-8 nervously follows.
          Rey reaches out, very slowly, to touch the box. A moment
          heavy with tension.
          Rey OPENS THE BOX and sees inside Luke Skywalker's original
          lightsaber. With hesitation, she reaches towards it, but
          she cannot resist. As her hand makes contact with it, there
          is the piercing sound of a lightsaber igniting. She moves
          her hand away, as REY HEARS A MECHANICAL BREATHING sound.
          The CAMERA MOVES, LIGHTING CHANGES -- and we see behind her
          something impossible: a HALLWAY OF FROM DEEP INSIDE CLOUD
          CITY. Disembodied voices fill the air.

                          YOUNG GIRL

           NO!
          She stands -- looks around, confused by all she sees and
          hears. -- Turns and sees, through a DOORWAY.
          We follow Rey and she runs down the corridor, but it all
          TILTS -- TURNS -- and she lands on the
          WALL -- which is now the GROUND -- dried GRASS.
          She turns to look -- we PIVOT -- and see a BURNING TEMPLE AT
          NIGHT. We PAN to:
          R2-D2 -- who watches the flames -- and a MAN appears (LUKE,
          whose face we do not see). He falls to his knees, reaches
          out to the droid -- with a MECHANICAL RIGHT HAND.
          We PUSH IN ON REY as RAIN BEGINS -- and DAY TURNS TO NIGHT --
          and she LOOKS UP -- we TILT UP --
          To see we're LOOKING UP AT A WARRIOR as he is STABBED BY A
          FIERY LIGHTSABER! He screams and falls to the ground -- we
          FOLLOW HIM, revealing Rey again, now in a nighttime
          battlefield. She gets to her feet, frightened by what she
          sees. We PIVOT AROUND HER to REVEAL KYLO REN, and the six
          other KNIGHTS OF REN, who flank him!
          Come back around to Rey, soaking now, as the RAIN STOPS and
          SUNLIGHT illuminates her -- she turns to look -- we PIVOT --
          and see...
          A little girl. Rey as a child. She is sobbing, hysterical.
          Unkar Plutt's meaty hand holds her thin arm. She is on Jakku,
          watching a starship fly into the sky, abandoning her.

                          YOUNG GIRL
           No, come back!

           Quiet, girl!
          The ship flies towards the desert sun, which is strangely
          eclipsed, as if being eaten by darkness. Rey looks around
          her to see she is..
          In a NIGHTTIME, BARREN, SNOWY WOODS. She's losing her mind,
          confounded and lost and she gets to her feet, her breath
          seen in the frigid air -- and then: THE SOUND OF CLASHING
          LIGHTSABERS! She moves through the woods, toward the sound.
          Rey runs, heart pounding, when KYLO REN EMERGES FROM BEHIND
          A TREE! She stops, SCREAMS, FALLS BACK and LANDS IN:

          INT. MAZ' CASTLE - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY

          She falls back, out of the room, suddenly sitting in the
          hall, out of breath, alarmed and perplexed.
          She HEARS something and turns to look.
          Maz stands at the end of the corridor, realizing what has
          just happened.

                          REY
           What was that? I shouldn't have
           gone in there.

                          MAZ
           That lightsaber was Luke's. And his
           father's before him and now, it calls
           to you!
          Rey stands, fast. Still overwhelmed, emotional, speechless.

                          REY
           I have to get back to Jakku.

                          MAZ
           Han told me.
           (reaches out, hold

                          REY'S HAND)
           Dear child. I see your eyes. You
           already know the truth. Whomever
           you're waiting for on Jakku, they're
           never coming back. But... there's
           someone who still could.

                          REY
           Luke.

                          MAZ
           The belonging you seek is not behind
           you. It is ahead. I am no Jedi,
           but I know the Force. It moves
           through and surrounds every living
           thing. Close your eyes. Feel it.

                         CONTINUED:

                          MAZ (CONT'D)
           The light. It's always been there.
           It will guide you. The saber. Take
           it.
          Rey suddenly stands.

                          REY
           I'm never touching that again. I
           don't want any part of this.
          And Rey runs off, passing Maz.
          Rey's mind is spinning -- she can't take it -- she turns and
          heads off, fast. BB-8 follows her. TIGHT ON MAZ, watching
          her go. Maz SIGHS, feeling for the young girl.

          EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY

          Rey exits the castle, needs to run, but doesn't know where.
          Heads toward the woods.

          EXT. FOREST - DAY

          Rey moves through the foliage, heart racing. Over this, we
          HEAR a RUMBLING -- intense, an OMEN of something horrible to
          come.

          EXT. STARKILLER BASE - ASSEMBLY AREA - DAY

          A massive rally: a thousand STORMTROOPERS, TIE FIGHTERS,
          OFFICERS and VEHICLES. BRUTALIST STRUCTURES, mountainous
          SNOWY LANDSCAPE. Addressing them at a podium, flanked by
          RED FIRST ORDER BANNERS, is HUX. His voice ECHOES:

                          GENERAL HUX
           Today is the end of the Republic!
           The end of a regime that acquiesces
           to disorder! At this very moment,
           in a system far from here the New
           Republic LIES to the GALAXY while
           secretly supporting the treachery of
           the loathsome Resistance. This fierce
           machine which you have built, upon
           which we stand, will bring an end to
           the Senate! To their cherished fleet!
           All remaining systems will bow to
           the First Order! And will remember
           this... as the last day of the
           Republic!

                         

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - DAY

          ENGINEERS perform FINAL FIRING PROTOCOL. There's a sense of
          nervousness -- WILL THIS MASSIVE WEAPON ACTUALLY WORK?

          EXT. STARKILLER BASE - ASSEMBLY AREA - DAY


                          GENERAL HUX

           FIRE!
          And Hux TURNS to give the signal as we CUT BACK WIDE -- a
          ROAR OF BOOTS ON PAVEMENT as the thousand Stormtroopers TURN
          to face an endless snowy landscape. WHAT IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN?!

          EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY

          A view PAST THE RALLY. For a moment, nothing. Then, eerily

          SILENT, AN IMPOSSIBLE BLAST OF FIRE LIGHT -- LIKE AN ATOMIC

          BOMB TEST TIMES A ZILLION -- BLASTS FROM MILES AWAY, INTO
          THE SKY! Seconds later, a TERRIBLE EXPLOSIVE ROAR!
          The Troopers -- everyone -- is nearly PUSHED BACK by the
          FORCE of it -- the magnitude! Many have to COVER THEIR EYES!
          For MILES around the FIREBEAM, ICE AND SNOW MELTS INSTANTLY!
          Runoff tunnels FLOODED with AN OCEAN OF FRESH WATER. AIRBORNE
          CREATURES by the thousands burst from trees and take flight.
          Hux watches, his eyes WILD WITH POWER AND EVIL. From HIS
          eyes, CUT TO:

          INT. STAR DESTROYER BRIDGE - DAY

          TIGHT ON KYLO REN as he watches the Starkiller firing.

          EXT. MAZ' CASTLE - DAY

          Finn boards the Alien Freighter. The SOUND FROM THE SKY
          makes him turn back. He sees the PATH OF FIRE and his blood
          runs cold, his heart sinks.

          EXT. REPUBLIC SYSTEM - NIGHT

          At a massive distance we see PLANETS THE REPUBLIC CAPITAL

          SYSTEM -- INCREASINGLY LIT, THEN POWERFULLY HIT BY THE VAST

          FIREBLAST WHICH OBLITERATES IT ALL!

          EXT. REPUBLIC CITY - NIGHT

          The galaxy CENTER OF GOVERNMENT at NIGHT. Impressive
          structures. Senators and dignitaries look in uncomprehending
          horror to the night sky. LIGHT GROWING --
          FROM A GREAT DISTANCE a CIRCLE OF FIRE -- LIKE A SMALL SUN

          APPEARING FROM NOWHERE AND GROWING CLOSE AND MASSIVE, TURNING
          NIGHT TO DAY! And in seconds THE FIRE BLOCKS OUT EVERYTHING

          ELSE, AND THE ENTIRE PLANET OF HOSNIAN PRIME IS INCINERATED!

          EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY

          A crowd of ALIENS files out from inside, all eyes on the
          FIRE IN THE SKY. Dozens of LANGUAGES exclaiming fear and
          horror. Find Han and Chewie moving out, looking up.

                         

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:

           FINN (O.S.)
           It was the Republic.
          Han and Chewie turn as Finn arrives, moving quickly through
          the crowd. With dread:

                          FINN (CONT'D)
           The First Order, they've done it.
           Where's Rey?

          EXT. FOREST - DAY

          Rey races through the forest and finally comes to a stop,
          overwhelmed and exhausted. At an emotional breaking point,
          she has no idea where to go, who to turn to. Then she HEARS
          A BEEP -- turns to see BB-8, catching up with her.

                          REY
           What are you doing?

                          (HE BEEPS)
           You have to go back.
           (he BEEPS again)

                          REY (CONT'D)
           BB-8. No, you can't -- you have to
           go back, you're too important.
           They'll help you.
          Then, ANOTHER SOUND -- LOUDER NOW -- they LOOK UP AGAIN: in
          front of the system attack, A FLEET OF FIRST ORDER SHIPS
          ROAR OVERHEAD, TOWARD THE CASTLE! Rey's heart sinks: HER

          FRIENDS ARE IN DANGER!

          INT. MAZ'S CASTLE - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY

          Maz leads Han, Finn and Chewie down the hall, fast:

                          MAZ
           I've had this for ages...

          MAZ'S CASTLE - TREASURE ROOM - DAY
          Maz opens the box -- holds out the lightsaber to Finn:

                          MAZ
           Kept it locked away.

                          HAN
           Where'd you get that?

                          MAZ
           A good question for another time.

                          (TO FINN)
           Take it! Find your friend!
          Finn grabs it as the room is SHAKEN by an above ground attack.

                          MAZ (CONT'D)
           Those beasts! They're here!

          EXT. FOREST - DAY

          Rey and BB-8 race fast back toward the castle -- EXPLOSION
          SOUNDS can be HEARD from the direction they're headed!

          EXT. FOREST - DAY

          Rey races through the trees -- sees Maz' castle -- BEING
          DESTROYED BY FIRST ORDER SHIPS! Aliens RUNNING, GETTING
          OBLITERATED by SCREAMING TIE FIGHTERS! Other TIE FIGHTERS
          and TRANSPORTERS LAND, STORMTROOPERS in attack.
          Just then, filtered RADIO CALLS get Rey's attention: nearby
          STORMTROOPERS have spotted her, AND FIRE!

                          STORMTROOPER
           FN-417, hold position!
          Rey takes cover, grabs her BLASTER -- but IT WON'T FIRE!
          She panics, then realizes:

                          REY
           Safety!
          SHE SWITCHES OFF THE SAFETY and FIRES BACK! HITS TWO TROOPERS
          and retreats, calls to BB-8:
          BB-8 follows Rey AWAY FROM THE CASTLE, firing back at more
          chasing Troopers!

          EXT. MAZ' CASTLE RUINS - DAY

          Kylo Ren moves through the DEBRIS. A Stormtrooper approaches:

                          STORMTROOPER #4
           Sir, the droid was spotted heading
           west, with a girl.
          Kylo Ren LOOKS BACK SHARPLY, in Rey's direction --

          EXT. FOREST - DAY

          Rey and BB-8 move swiftly, terrified -- she stops them:

                          REY
           You have to keep going, stay out of
           sight, I'll try to fight 'em off.
           (BB-8 BEEPS; bravely
           through her fear)
           I hope so, too.
          BB-8 BEEPS and heads off -- Rey RUNS and TAKES COVER behind
          a massive, mossy tree. TIGHT on her TERRIFIED FACE --

          EXT. CASTLE DEBRIS - DAY

          Han, Chewie, Finn and Maz, exhausted, CLIMB UP, peek through
          debris.

                         

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:

                          HAN
           Come on, Chewie!
          Maz turns to Finn:

                          MAZ
           Rey and BB-8, they need you. Now
           go.

                          FINN
           I need a weapon.
          Maz grabs his wrist -- holds up his hand -- THE SABER.

                          MAZ
           You have one!
          He looks at her questioningly -- he's supposed to use the
          lightsaber?! He TURNS IT ON.
          HAN AND CHEWIE RUN, TAKE COVER from BLASTS, FIRING BACK at
          Stormtroopers, taking some out!

                          HAN
           Hey, can I try that?
          Han borrows Chewbacca's bowcaster, fires on Stormtroopers
          and sends them flying.

                          HAN (CONT'D)

                          (TO CHEWBACCA)
           I like this thing.
          FINN SURPRISES A STORMTROOPER WITH THE LIGHTSABER, then
          another! Untrained, he's athletic, brave, impressive. One
          Stormtrooper has a MACE --

                          STORMTROOPER
           Traitor!
          FINN and the TROOPER WITH THE MACE battle. The Mace Trooper
          KNOCKS FINN DOWN! The Stormtrooper is about to end him,
          when THE STORMTROOPER IS SHOT AND FALLS!
          Wide-eyed Finn sees Han run over, having fired the blast!
          Han helps him up.

                          HAN
           You okay, Big deal?

                         

                          FINN
           Thanks!
          But TEN STORMTROOPERS come over a RISE, BLASTERS AIMED.

                          STORMTROOPER
           Don't move! TK-338, we have targets
           in custody!

          No way out, they DROP THEIR WEAPONS: TIGHT on the LIGHTSABER
          as it HITS THE GROUND. A STORMTROOPER HAND picks it up.
          Han's MIND RACES as a SQUAD OF TROOPERS appears behind them.
          Finn, Han and Chewie are MARCHED by Stormtroopers back toward
          a transport, hands on their heads.
          But then -- A FAMILIAR ROAR RIPPING ACROSS THE LAKE -- Han
          turns -- they all do: coming toward them across the water, X-

          WINGS AND RESISTANCE SPACECRAFT APPEAR, BEGIN FIRING AT THE

          FIRST ORDER SHIPS!

          PUSH IN ON HAN, HOPE SURGING -- CHEWIE TALKS.

           It's the Resistance.
          One X-WING in particular -- MARKED IN BLACK -- SWOOPS DOWN

           We're with you, Poe!
          The Stormtroopers around Finn, Han and Chewie SCATTER, TOSSED
          in EXPLOSIONS! The LIGHTSABER LANDS AGAIN -- FINN PICKS IT

          UP.

                          HAN
           Quick!
          Chewie picks up his Bowcaster, Han takes the blaster. Shoots
          a Trooper.

          EXT. FOREST - DAY

          In the darkened woods, Rey, terrified, keeps her blaster
          aimed. Her eyes dart around for her pursuer.
          And then: THE UNIQUE SOUND OF KYLO REN'S RASPING LIGHTSABER
          COMING TO LIFE -- A SOUND she's HEARD BEFORE in the FORCEBACK.
          Rey's heart skips a beat: she's even more scared now.
          Kylo Ren appears from behind a tree -- Rey FIRES again and
          again -- Kylo Ren moves toward her, USING HIS LIGHTSABER TO

          DEFLECT EVERY BLAST.
          She FIRES ferociously, but Kylo Ren keeps coming! His hand
          rises -- Rey suddenly STOPS -- GASPS -- UNABLE TO MOVE.

                          KYLO REN
           The girl I've heard so much about.
          He walks AROUND HER, slowly, she won't let herself cry.

           KYLO REN (CONT'D)
           The droid.
          He comes around to see her face. After a scary beat he WHIPS

          HIS SABER UP TO HER EYES, ILLUMINATING HER FACE.

           KYLO REN (CONT'D)
           Where is it?

          WIDE SHOT: THE EPIC BATTLE BETWEEN RESISTANCE AND FIRST

          ORDER TROOPS, REFLECTED IN THE STILL LAKE.

           Request air support!

          EXT. FOREST - DAY

          Kylo Ren TURNS OFF HIS SABER, reaches up... and REACHES
          TOWARDS REY'S FACE. She can't move, strains in agony. After
          a beat, surprised by what he finds, he removes his hand.
          She is relieved but still afraid.

                          KYLO REN
           The map. You've seen it.
          Rey is horrified. He TOUCHES HER FACE again: the pain, tears
          stream. Kylo Ren, taking more from her mind...
          She stares at him, TERRIFIED, straining in agony --
          Kylo Ren, mid-interrogation, TURNS TOWARD THE SOUND OF THE
          EXPLOSIONS. Stormtroopers APPROACH through the woods.

                          STORMTROOPER #5
           Sir, Resistance fighters! We need
           more troops.
          Kylo Ren TURNS BACK TO Rey, his hand still on her face.

           Pull the division out. Forget the
           droid. We have what we need.
          A GESTURE from Kylo Ren and REY LOSES CONSCIOUSNESS, FALLS

          FROM FRAME!

          EXT. CASTLE DEBRIS - DAY

          The BLACK-MARKED X-WING SWOOPS DOWN again, FIRING, EXPLODING
          another TIE Fighter! On the ground:

                          STORMTROOPER
           Pull back the tree line!
          Han and Chewie dodge debris, FIRING and TAKING OUT TROOPERS.
          FINN takes out 2 TROOPERS with the blaster, then, out of
          breath, turns to see: Kylo Ren in the forest, CARRYING REY
          IN HIS ARMS, INTO HIS SHUTTLE! Finn's heart SHATTERS --
          Han stops -- turns -- sees Kylo Ren entering his shuttle.
          Han is ROCKED.

                          FINN

           NO!! REY!!!
          Heroically, Finn runs toward the shuttle through LASER BLASTS
          AND EXPLOSIONS, but the shuttle TAKES OFF -- Finn irrationally

          CHASES IT, SCREAMS DESPERATELY:

                          FINN (CONT'D)
           No, no, no, no... REY!!
          In crazed frustration, Finn stops running, watches the
          receding First Order ships, Rey their captive.

          EXT. FOREST - DAY

          BB-8 moves fast, then stops and looks up as the First Order
          ships RETREAT, OFF PLANET. A considered beat, and BB-8 heads

          BACK FOR THE CASTLE.

          EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE RUINS - DAY

          Post battle. Finn runs to Han:

                          FINN
           He took her! Did you see that? He
           took her. She's gone!

                          HAN

                          (WALKS PAST)
           Yeah, yeah, I know...
          And he and Chewie head off.

          EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE RUINS - DAY

          Han moves toward a RESISTANCE TRANSPORT landing in the debris.
          BB-8 rolls up beside him, in wait for the transport.
          ON HAN'S FACE, knowing exactly what's about to happen.
          Finally, the transport door opens.
          And standing there is LEIA.
          She sees Han and is stunned. A silent beat, husband and
          wife reunited for the first time in years. In the smoke and
          embers, no one says a word.
          Then C-3PO walks out from the transport, into the field:

                          C-3PO
           Goodness! Han Solo! It is I, See-
           Threepio!
           (sees Han, stops)
           You probably don't recognize me
           because of the red arm.
           (sees Leia,

                          INCREASINGLY AWKWARD)
           Look who it is! Did you see who?
           Oh. Excuse me, Prin-- uh, General.
           Sorry. Come along, BB-8. Quickly.

                          (BB-8 BEEPS)
           Yes, I must get my proper arm
           reinstalled.
          He hurries off. Finally, alone again.

                          HAN
           You changed your hair.

                          LEIA
           Same jacket.

                          HAN
           No, new jacket.
          Chewie glad to see Leia, greets her with a hug. Chewie MOANS
          a few words, looks at Han then boards the ship.
          It is complicated and loving and painful. Han says, quietly:

                          HAN (CONT'D)
           ... I saw him. Leia, I saw our son.
           He was here.
          Leia hears this.
          Maz watches through the smoke.

          EXT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

          LARGE GRASS MOUNDS cover HANGARS, beneath the odd, giant
          trees. BOOM DOWN as RESISTANCE GROUND CREW direct an X-WING
          to a LANDING. In the FOREGROUND, another X-wing canopy OPENS,
          a PILOT climbs out. PAN TO REVEAL the landed Millennium
          Falcon. Finn runs down the ramp, UP TO CAMERA, desperate,
          searching.
          Then BB-8 SPEEDS RIGHT PAST HIM, almost knocking him down --
          Finn watches as BB-8 rolls over to the PILOT GETTING OUT OF
          THE BLACK-MARKED X-WING. The Pilot's helmet comes off.

          IT IS POE!
          Finn can't believe what he's seeing. And Poe, kneeling in
          WARM REUNION with BB-8, listens and reacts to something the
          droid tells him. Poe looks up and sees Finn -- and he can't
          believe it either! Poe smiles, points at Finn. From a
          distance, Finn gestures in sheer amazement that Poe is alive.

                          FINN
           Poe. Poe Dameron.
          They move to each other -- and embrace.

                          FINN (CONT'D)
           You're alive!

                          POE
           So are you!

                          FINN
           What happened to you?

                          POE
           What happened? I got thrown from
           the crash, woke up at night -- no
           you, no ship, nothing--
          BB-8 BEEPS -- Poe listens, turns to Finn.

                          POE (CONT'D)
           BB-8 says that you saved him.

                          FINN
           No, no, no. It wasn't just me.

                          POE
           You completed my mission, Finn.
           That's my jacket?

          INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

          MOVE FAST with Finn and Poe. Finn takes in this makeshift
          command center, buried deep among vines and roots. They
          arrive at Leia, who stands with a group of Resistance
          Officers, including ADMIRALS ACKBAR and STATURA:

                          POE
           General Organa. Sorry to interrupt,
           this is Finn, he needs to talk to

                          LEIA
           (takes Finn's hand)
           And I need to talk to him. That was
           incredibly brave, what you did.
           Renouncing the First Order, saving
           this man's life --

                          FINN
           (surprised she knows)
           Thank you, ma'am -- but a friend of
           mine was taken prisoner--

                          LEIA
           Han told me about the girl, I'm sorry.
          Finn is startled -- Poe jumps in:

                          POE
           Finn's familiar with the weapon that
           destroyed the Hosnian system. He
           worked on the base.

                          LEIA
           We're desperate for anything you can
           tell us.

                          FINN
           That's where my friend was taken --
           I've got to get there, fast.

                          LEIA
           And I will do everything I can to
           help, but first you must tell us all

          enters, studying it, dispirited. PAN as she moves, REVEALING
          HAN. C-3PO is here and some others.

                          C-3PO
           General, I regret to inform you, but
           this map recovered from BB-8 is only
           partially complete. And even worse,
           it matches no charted system on
           record. We simply do not have enough
           information to locate Master Luke.

                          LEIA
           I can't believe I was so foolish to
           think that I could just find Luke
           and bring him home.

                          HAN
           Leia...

                          LEIA
           Don't do that.

                          HAN
           Do what?
           She heads off.

                          LEIA
           Anything.
           Flummoxed, Han follows looking at C-3PO.

          LOW WITH BB-8 as he rolls over and finds, under a dark and
          dusty tarp in a corner, R2-D2. BB-8 BEEPS at R2, pulls off
          the tarp and tries to start a conversation. But R2 DOESN'T
          RESPOND AT ALL. BB-8 tries again. Nothing. BB-8 NUDGES
          R2. Nothing. Then:

           C-3PO (O.S.)
           BB-8. You're wasting your time.
          BB-8 looks up at C-3PO, who stands there. C-3PO SIGHS.

           C-3PO (CONT'D)
           It is very doubtful that R2 would
           have the rest of the map in his backup
           data.

                          (BB-8 BEEPS)
           I am afraid not. R2-D2 has been in
           low power mode ever since Master
           Luke went away. Sadly, he may never
           be his old self again.

          INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

          Leia hears the change in Han's voice and softens. She turns.

                          HAN
           Listen to me, will you? I know every
           time you... every time you look at
           me, you're reminded of him.

                          LEIA
           You think I want to forget him? I
           want him back!
          Han looks at her with sympathy.

                          HAN
           There was nothing we could've done.
           (hard for him to say)
           There was too much Vader in him.

                          LEIA
           That's why I wanted him to train
           with Luke. I just never should have
           sent him away. That's when I lost
           him. That's when I lost you both.

           We both had to deal with it in our
           own way. I went back to the only
           thing I was ever good at.

                          LEIA
           We both did.

                          HAN
           We lost our son, forever.

                          LEIA
           No.

                          (LONG BEAT)
           It was Snoke.
          Han takes this in.

                          LEIA (CONT'D)
           He seduced our son to the dark side.
           But we can still save him. Me.
           You.

           Luke is a Jedi... you're his father.

          Rey wakes, disoriented. She is in an angled, upright
          restraining rig. Looks over, startled to see Kylo Ren, mask
          in place, standing there.

                          REY
           Where am I?

                          KYLO REN

           You're my guest.

                          REY
           Where are the others?

                          KYLO REN
           You mean the murderers, traitors and
           thieves you call friends?
           (Rey stares at him)
           You'll be relieved to hear that I
           have no idea.

          Rey studies him. She's fearful... but curious.

           KYLO REN (CONT'D)
           You still want to kill me.

                          REY
           That happens when you're being hunted
           by a creature in a mask.
          Kylo Ren stops, considers her... then reaches up, unlatches
          and REMOVES HIS MASK. Rey reacts, stunned. It takes a moment
          before she regains her own mask of defiance.

                          KYLO REN
           Tell me about the droid.

                          REY
           (a nervous beat)
           He's a BB unit with a selenium drive
           and a thermal hyperscan vindicator --

                          KYLO REN
           He's carrying a section of a
           navigational chart. We have the
           rest, recovered from archives of the
           Empire. We need the last piece.
           And somehow, you convinced the droid
           to show it to you. You. A scavenger --
          Rey reacts -- afraid -- how does he know?

           KYLO REN (CONT'D)
           You know I can take whatever I want.
          Trepidation flashes across Rey's eyes. Kylo Ren moves closer,
          his hand rising toward her. She recoils, but has nowhere to
          go. Kylo Ren nearly TOUCHES HER FACE...
          THEY'RE BOTH SURPRISED: they react to a feeling that passes
          between them -- AN ENERGY THEY RECOGNIZE IN EACH OTHER.
          And then it's gone. Adversaries again. Rey can't move,
          quietly strains in agony, trying to resist Ren's probing.

           KYLO REN (CONT'D)
           ... You're so lonely... so afraid to
           leave...
           (then, slight smile)
           At night, desperate to sleep... you
           imagine an ocean. I see it -- I see
           the island...
          Tears stream down her face as she resists. She tries to
          break free, but can't budge.

           KYLO REN (CONT'D)
           And Han Solo. You feel like he's
           the father you never had. He would've
           disappointed you.

                         CONTINUED:
          His hand still on her face, her eyes fierce through the agony:

                          REY
           -- Get out of my head --
          But this just makes Kylo lean closer.

                          KYLO REN
           I know you've seen the map. It's in
           there... and now you'll give it to
           me. Don't be afraid. I feel it
           too.
          Where her strength comes from, she doesn't know, but:

                          REY
           I'm not giving you anything.

                          KYLO REN
           We'll see.
          He peers into her eyes intensely. She meets his gaze --

          DESPITE THE PAIN SHE IS STRONG.
          On Ren's face as HIS CONFIDENCE BEGINS TO MELT AWAY. He has
          slammed up against a barrier in her mind. He looks less
          certain by the moment as Rey seems to GROW IN STRENGTH. The
          FEROCITY of confrontation builds until it hits critical mass

          AND REY DOES THE UNTHINKABLE! SHE ENTERS HIS HEAD, AMAZED

          AT WHAT SHE IS SEEING!

                          REY
           ... You... you're afraid... that you
           will never be as strong as... Darth
           Vader!
          KYLO REN SUDDENLY WITHDRAWS HIS HAND, as if her face were
          FIRE HOT. TAKES A STEP BACK, CONFUSED, RATTLED. Rey's body
          is released, she breathes deeply, her powerful eyes still on
          Kylo Ren, who starts to leave.
          And we PRELAP:

           SNOKE (V.O.)
           This scavenger, resisted you?

          INT. STARKILLER PLANET - ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT

          Kylo Ren, mask off, stands before Snoke.

                          KYLO REN
           She's strong with the Force, untrained
           but, stronger than she knows.
          And while Ren's mind no doubt goes to Luke:

                          SNOKE
           And the droid?

                         

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:
          Kylo Ren hesitates to reveal the truth. Then:

           GENERAL HUX (O.S.)
           Ren believed it was no longer valuable
           to us.
          Ren turns back -- Hux enters the large space, moves to the
          platform beside Ren.

           GENERAL HUX (CONT'D)
           That the girl was all we needed. As
           a result, the droid has most likely
           been returned to the hands of the
           enemy. They may have the map already.
          Snoke is visibly furious.

                          SNOKE
           Then the Resistance must be destroyed
           before they get to Skywalker.

                          GENERAL HUX
           We have their location. We tracked
           their reconnaissance ship to the
           Ileenium system.

                          SNOKE
           Good. Then we will crush them once
           and for all. Prepare the weapon.
          Kylo Ren is stunned by the moment -- that isn't what he meant
          at all --

                          KYLO REN
           Supreme Leader. I can get the map
           from the girl. I just need your
           guidance.

                          SNOKE
           If what you say about this girl is
           true, bring her to me.

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - HOLDING CELL - DAY

          SLOW PUSH IN ON REY, shackled, mind still racing over what's
          happened between her and Kylo Ren. She is flooded with
          emotions, feeling her potential, her strength, that in this
          moment of being restrained, perhaps anything is possible.
          She turns to the Stormtrooper Guard. Studies him for an
          intense beat. Then says:

                          REY
           You will remove these restraints.
           And leave this cell, with the door
           open.
          The Stormtrooper Guard looks at her. A beat.

           What did you say?
          Rey's eyes stay trained on him. She shifts in her seat, her
          confidence wavering, but she repeats, with authority:

                          REY
           You will remove these restraints.
           And leave this cell, with the door
           open.
          The Stormtrooper Guard, rifle aimed, MOVES FOR HER.
          Rey's heart pounds -- is she about to be killed, freed, or
          laughed at? The tension unbearable when the Guard says:

                          TROOPER GUARD #2
           I'll tighten those restraints,
           scavenger scum!

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - CORRIDOR 1 - DAY

          LOW ANGLE: Kylo Ren, masked, rounds a corner, PASSES US.

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - HOLDING CELL - DAY

          Rey stares intently at the trooper. Calms herself. And
          tries again.

                          REY
           You will remove these restraints.
           And leave this cell, with the door
           open.

                          TROOPER GUARD #2
           I will remove these restraints. And
           leave this cell, with the door open.
          He reaches down and UNLATCHES THE RESTRAINTS. HE THEN TURNS
          AND STARTS TO HEAD OUT, her back to him as he exits. SHE IS
          IN SHOCK. Then tries, quickly:

                          REY
           And you will drop your weapon.

                          TROOPER GUARD #2
           And I'll drop my weapon.
          The Trooper Guard DROPS HIS WEAPON without turning back --
          Rey HEARS the gun fall. She's incredulous. The guard has

          LEFT THE CELL, ITS DOOR OPEN.
          REY, in ABSOLUTE DISBELIEF, MOVES QUICKLY OUT OF FRAME!

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - HOLDING CELL - DAY

          Kylo Ren enters the cell -- we PUSH IN ON HIM as he takes in
          the empty cell -- AND IMMEDIATELY UNDERSTANDS WHAT HAS

          HAPPENED.

          WIDE ANGLE, empty corridor, toward the cell: we only HEAR
          the horrible SOUNDS. DESTRUCTION. YELLING. A few pieces
          of red hot DEBRIS BOUNCES into the corridor.
          Two STORMTROOPERS, crossing at the far end of the hall, STOP
          TO WATCH this display of pure FURY. They retreat, and fast.

          Workers at their controls. Vast snowy landscape seen outside.

           Yes, sir. Weapon charging.

          A vast view of the planet -- a MASSIVE SOLARVAC ARRAY
          surrounds a port TEN MILES IN DIAMETER.
          MILLIONS OF PANELS turn on the ARRAY -- a wave of BRILLIANT
          REFLECTIONS. Suddenly, like a planetary-scale TESLA COIL
          LINE OF ENERGY, THE POWER OF THE SUN begins to TRAVEL DOWN
          to the Starkiller Base planet.

          Finn, now a member of the inner circle of the Resistance, is
          huddled with the group around the MAP TABLE, which displays
          a WIREFRAME HOLOGRAM of a ROLLING VIEW OF THE SURFACE OF
          STARKILLER BASE. With Finn are Han, Leia, Poe, C-3PO,
          Statura, Ackbar, Brance, SNAP, MAJOR EMATT (60), NIEN NUNB,

           They've somehow created a hyper
           lightspeed weapon built within the
           planet itself.

                          BRANCE
           A laser cannon?

           This was the Death Star.
          Poe hits another control -- the Death Star SHRINKS -- AND
          SHRINKS AND SHRINKS, as the SURFACE AREA OF THE STARKILLER

          BASE IS DRAWN INTO A LARGER IMAGE, REVEALING THE ENTIRE BASE
          PLANET. The Death Star is a minuscule SATELLITE in
          comparison.

           This is Starkiller Base.

                          ADMIRAL ACKBAR
           How is it possible to power a weapon
           of this size?

                          FINN
           It uses the power of the sun. As
           the weapon is charged, the sun is
           drained until it disappears.
          An OFFICER runs up, hands Leia a DATACARD.

                          LEIA
           (eyes on datacard)
           The First Order: they're charging
           the weapon again, now.
           (then, heart sinking)
           Our system is the next target.

                          C-3PO
           Oh my. Without the Republic fleet,
           we're doomed.
          They all react to this horrible news.

                          HAN
           Okay, how do we blow it up?
           (all eyes on him)
           There's always a way to do that.

           In order for that amount of power to

           some kind of thermal oscillator...

                          FINN
           There is one.
          All eyes on Finn as he moves around the hologram to a location

           If we can destroy that oscillator,
           it might de-stabilize the core and
           cripple the weapon.

                          MAJOR EMATT

          A quiet CLEARING on the forest TREELINE. Suddenly the

          He fumbles for his blaster but Chewie shoots first. WIDE

          Chewie drags him out of sight. Han and Finn peer around a
          corner, wary.

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - ATRIUM AREA - DAY

          TIGHT ON REY'S FACE as she peers nervously around a corner.
          Rey runs down a long, glossy hall, taking cover in an alcove,
          the Trooper Guard's rifle HELD TIGHT.
          From this alcove, she can see down another LONG, PERPENDICULAR
          WALKWAY -- on one side, a STONE AND STEEL WALL. On the other
          side, a VAST ATRIUM, with a railing-free DROP OFF, the white
          pill-light design descending HUNDREDS OF FEET.
          At the end of this walkway is an OPEN HANGAR DOOR, revealing
          HUNDREDS OF TIE FIGHTERS parked outside.
          TIGHT on Rey's face as her plan is clear. But the problem:
          between her and the ship she wants to steal, is a GROUP OF
          STORMTROOPERS. Guards, in conversation.
          As she tries to think about what to do next, we see, FAR
          BEHIND HER in the perpendicular hall, ANOTHER GROUP OF STORM-
          and SNOWTROOPERS headed her way!
          Rey's mind races -- another peek out and she RUNS FAST, across
          the walkway, and CLIMBS DOWN -- her fingertips disappearing
          over the edge just as the Troopers approach and continue.
          WIDE SHOT as Rey holds on carefully as the guards walk off,
          not seeing her over the edge, a death drop below her.
          But then she SEES SOMETHING and has a brainstorm. She
          strenuously cross-climbs to an invisible SERVICE HATCH, which
          She opens, and climbs INSIDE THE WALL, closing the hatch
          behind her.

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - INSIDE THE WALLS - DAY

          A REMARKABLE IMAGE, inside the inner workings of the base.
          Tiny by comparison, Rey climbs amid the incredible
          infrastructure, a drop to infinity beneath her. She is
          between the LIGHT SOURCE and the WHITE PILL SHAPES, as she
          makes her way ACROSS.

          WIDE SHOT of the Stormtrooper GUARDS, above the drop off

          she climbs across the space, beneath them, toward her exit!

                          REY
           (shrugs, smiles, though
           nearly in tears)
           ... That it was your idea.
          Finn awkwardly smiles. It's his nature. They embrace.

                          REY (CONT'D)
           Thank you.

                          FINN
           How did you get away?

                          REY
           I can't explain it. And you wouldn't
           believe it.

                          HAN
           Escape now. Hug later.

          The X-Wings DOGFIGHT with the TIE Fighters on the surface of
          the snowy planet. INTERCUT BETWEEN the ships SCREAMING past
          each other, and the COCKPITS of the Resistance and First
          Order fighters. Poe's fighter NEARLY COLLIDES with a close-

          EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY

          The X-wings ROAR across the sky, BLASTING and DODGING the
          TIE Fighters and missiles.
          PULL BACK TO REVEAL Han, Finn, Rey and Chewie, who run out
          here, into the snow, stopping, eyes on the sky, watching the
          lop-sided battle.

          THE FOUR HEROES TURN TO EACH OTHER, RESOLVE IN THEIR EYES.
          A long moment of communication.

                          HAN
           They're in trouble. We can't leave.
           (to Finn, re: Chewie)
           My friend here has a bag full of
           explosives. Let's use 'em.

          INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

          A Resistance Technician turns to Leia:

           KAYDEL KO CONNIX
           General, are you seeing this?

                          VOBER DAND
           Two more X-wings down. That's half
           our fleet destroyed.

                          C-3PO
           And their weapon will be fully charged
           in 10 minutes! It would take a
           miracle to save us now.

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS

          Han and Chewie arrive here to find THREE SECURITY
          STORMTROOPERS approaching a Maintenance Hatch. Instantly,
          Chewie takes out the middle one with his Bowcaster. Han and
          the other two Stormtroopers OPEN FIRE, but Han's aim is true.

          ALARMS START BLARING!

          INT. JUNCTION STATION - NEAR DARKNESS

          Running inside from a parked snowspeeder, Rey opens a service
          hatch. Finn behind her, as she reaches into the mechanics
          of the place, very much like the very first shot we saw of
          Rey.
          And she YANKS a piece of TECH from the machinery and:

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS

          The HATCH OPENS! Han and Chewie, having been on the lookout,
          step inside, weapons poised. Chewie MOANS.

                          HAN
           That girl knows her stuff.

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS

          Han and Chewie divide the explosives. Talk in hushed tones.

                          HAN
           We'll set the charges at every other
           column.
          He GROAN/TALKS to Han, who looks around, reconsiders.

                          HAN (CONT'D)
           You're right. That's a better idea.
           (checks his detonator)
           You take the top.

                          (CHEWIE DOES)
           I'll go down below. Detonator.
           We'll meet back here.
          They head off in opposite directions.

          INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS

          Han finishes placing an explosive. Checks he's all-clear
          and hurries down to the next level. Chewie climbs up a level.

          INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - MAIN ENTRANCE - NEAR DARKNESS

          A SQUAD of Stormtroopers SNAP to alert as Kylo Ren approaches.
          CONTROLS ARE HIT and the huge DOOR OPENS. Without hesitation,
          Kylo walks INTO THE OSCILLATOR.

          INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS

          A COLOSSAL CYLINDRICAL STRUCTURE. DARK CORRIDORS and
          CATWALKS. Kylo Ren comes to a stop. Scans the structure.
          SENSING SOMETHING, he motions the Stormtrooper Squad upwards.

                          KYLO REN
           Find them.
          They rush past him. Kylo Ren turns slowly, and HEADS DOWN.

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS

          The Stormtroopers move up the ramp, weapons ready, checking
          carefully where blind corners intersect from the perimeter.
          They come round to the next higher level and PASS CLOSE TO
          CAMERA. When they've passed, TILT to find CHEWIE, in the
          shadows of the grillwork.

          Once they're gone, he plants another charge.

          EXT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS

          The Snowspeeder comes to a stop outside the structure. Finn
          and Rey stop for a moment, look to the sky: THE SUN IS NEARLY

          GONE.

          INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - LOWER LEVEL - NIGHT

          Han finishes setting a charge and is about to move on when
          he HEARS SOMETHING and conceals himself behind a wide,
          vertical support. He peaks around the edge and his whole
          demeanor changes --
          HAN'S POV: Kylo Ren appears and stops at the railing, looking
          down into the filter.
          Han looks at his son with a tortured storm of feelings.
          WE'RE WITH KYLO REN as he resumes his hunt. He heads directly
          toward WHERE HAN IS HIDING! Kylo Ren has an INCREASING SENSE
          OF HAN'S PRESENCE as he moves closer. He comes to where Han
          was hiding -- but HAN IS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN.
          From his hiding place in a narrow, POWER CHAMBER in the wall,

          HAN WATCHES HIS SON PASS ONLY A FEW FEET IN FRONT OF HIM.
          Han SHIFTS HIS POSITION in the tight compartment, so he can
          watch Ren's progress. Kylo Ren turns onto a FLAT BRIDGE
          THAT BISECTS the open space.
          Unaware of his father, Kylo Ren walks purposefully across to
          the opposite side. Han watches his son walk off -- the CLANK-
          CLANK of Kylo Ren's boots receding.
          This is Han's opportunity to escape but Leia's words echo
          through his mind. He makes a decision and moves out, to the
          edge of the catwalk. He calls out, strongly:

                          HAN
           Ben!
          The name ECHOES as Kylo Ren STOPS, far across the vast
          catwalk. He turns.

                          KYLO REN
           Han Solo. I've been waiting for
           this day for a long time.
          Finn and Rey make their way into the space, opening a HATCH
          that allows A BEAM OF PRECIOUS SUNLIGHT to stream down like
          a spotlight on Han and his son. Finn and Rey get to a railing
          and look down. They can SEE and HEAR Han and Kylo Ren on
          the catwalk below.

                          HAN
           Take off that mask. You don't need
           it.

                          KYLO REN
           What do you think you'll see if I
           do?
          Han moves toward Kylo Ren.

                          HAN
           The face of my son.
          Kylo TAKES OFF HIS MASK. Han is JOLTED -- seeing the face
          of his son for the first time as a man.

                          KYLO REN
           Your son is gone. He was weak and
           foolish, like his father. So I
           destroyed him.

                          HAN
           That's what Snoke wants you to believe
           but it's not true. My son is alive.
          SEVERAL LEVELS BELOW them, CHEWIE comes to the rail to watch.

          INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - LOWER LEVEL - NEAR DARKNESS

          Kylo flares.

                          KYLO REN
           No. The Supreme Leader is wise.
          UP ABOVE, Finn, Chewie and Rey watch, rapt. Stormtroopers
          dot the perimeter of the structure, watching the scene.
          ON THE BRIDGE, Han moves closer, stern:

                          HAN
           Snoke is using you for your power.
           When he gets what he wants, he'll
           crush you -- you know it's true.
          Kylo hesitates. Somehow, he does know it.

                          KYLO REN
           It's too late.

                          HAN
           No it's not. Leave here with me.
           Come home. We miss you.
          For the first time, Kylo Ren seems truly conflicted. Tears
          flood his stoic eyes...

                          KYLO REN
           I'm being torn apart. I want to be
           free of this pain.

          INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - DARKNESS FALLS

          Han takes one step toward his son, but stops himself.

                          KYLO REN
           I know what I have to do, but I don't
           know if I have the strength to do
           it. Will you help me?
          Han hears his son's voice again, pained and vulnerable.

                          HAN
           Yes. Anything.
          Kylo Ren unholsters his lightsaber and SLOWLY EXTENDS IT to
          Han, within a foot of Han's chest. Han almost can't believe
          it. The moment seems to last forever. And just then, the
          LAST BEAM OF SUNLIGHT streaming through the open hatch

          VANISHES.
          Han actually smiles -- and reaches out for the dark weapon --
          but with the light now gone, KYLO REN'S EYES FILL WITH

          DARKNESS, HE IGNITES THE LIGHTSABER -- THE FIERY BLADE SHOOTS

          OUT, RIGHT THROUGH HAN'S CHEST AND BACK!

                          KYLO REN
           Thank you.
          ABOVE, Finn and Rey GASP -- SCREAM --

                          FINN

                          (ALSO PANTING)
           No, no.
          Han's last moment is looking into his son's face. HAN'S
          KNEES BUCKLE. The blade tilts down with him... until KYLO
          REN EXTINGUISHES IT AND HAN HOLDS onto the catwalk -- his
          life slipping away.
          Finally Han FALLS BACK, OFF THE CATWALK, INTO THE DEPTHS OF

          THE STRUCTURE!

          Kylo Ren is somehow WEAKENED by this wicked act. Himself
          horrified. His SHOCK is broken only when --
          CHEWIE CRIES OUT IN AGONY! Chewie furiously FIRES AT KYLO
          REN, HITTING HIM IN THE SIDE! Kylo Ren falls back, stunned.

          then they SEE KYLO REN, WHO RECOGNIZES THEM BOTH, WITH
          ASTONISHMENT. He rises to his full height and heads for
          them with long strides.
          Stormtroopers begin to BLAST AWAY AT REY AND FINN! CRAZED,

          From a distance the oscillator is ablaze and fractured from
          the explosives. Then Rey and Finn appear, coming over a
          rising, running into a bare-tree snowy forest.

                          FINN
           The Falcon's this way.
          Finn and Rey, overcome with emotion, race through the snowy
          forest -- until Finn SLOWS AND STOPS. Rey stops too, both
          out of breath. They look at each other. They both know:
          they can't run.

          EXT. STARKILLER BASE - FOREST - NIGHT

          Kylo Ren moves through the trees -- until he STOPS. Takes
          out the saber, ignites it.
          A still figure amidst the gusts of wind and snow.

          STANDING THIRTY FEET AWAY, FACING HIM, ARE FINN AND REY.
          Finn holds LUKE'S LIGHTSABER, Rey the Stormtrooper BLASTER.

          After a beat, Rey moves forward with the blaster -- AIMS IT!
          Kylo Ren RAISES A HAND -- Rey struggles under his FORCE POWER --
          she can't fire -- he strains too, especially with the WOUND
          Chewie inflicted. Kylo Ren GESTURES POWERFULLY -- Rey's
          BLASTER FLIES OUT OF HER HAND -- another GESTURE and Rey
          FLIES BACK and SLAMS INTO A TREE thirty feet away!
          She drops -- LANDS HARD in the snow. Dazed, hurt.

           no no no...
          Finn turns to her, afraid and concerned. But the SOUND OF
          KYLO REN'S LIGHTSABER moving makes Finn TURN BACK TO KYLO
          REN, lit by the glowing YELLOW AND RED BLADE.

                          KYLO REN

           TRAITOR!
          In reply, Finn TURNS ON LUKE'S LIGHTSABER -- upon seeing the

           KYLO REN (CONT'D)
           That lightsaber. It belongs to me!

                          FINN
           Come get it.
          Despite his fear, Finn raises his blade in welcome. Kylo
          Ren CHARGES at him - Finn terrified -- Kylo Ren LUNGES but
          Finn DEFLECTS Ren's SPARK-SPITTING blade!
          Kylo Ren TURNS, ATTACKS, CUTS -- amazingly Finn BLOCKS,
          COUNTER-ATTACKS -- clearly IMPRESSES KYLO REN, who only enjoys
          this challenge more!
          Rey RECOVERS, gets her bearings. Her eyes focus on the two
          men fighting, through the trees.
          Kylo Ren is obviously hampered by his wound, yet he attacks
          with a primal SAVAGERY -- Finn BLOCKS, turning DEFENSIVE
          moves into OFFENSIVE ones. And he ACTUALLY GETS A HIT IN!
          LUKE'S SABER GRAZING KYLO REN'S ARM! Kylo MOVES BACK --
          wounded, but more enraged than weakened. Kylo Ren CHARGES
          AGAIN -- their WEAPONS POUND, SPARKS FLY, their blades LOCK,
          the men are CLOSE, LIT BY the powerful, CRASHING sabers:
          And Kylo Ren PUSHES FINN BACK, attacks with pure ferocity --
          Finn is stunned -- unprepared for this fierceness.
          Rey sees this -- Kylo Ren unleashes a MERCILESS SERIES OF
          BLOWS, pushing Finn further and further back until he loses
          balance.

          -- AND SPEEDS PAST HIM!

          KYLO REN TURNS TO SEE LUKE'S LIGHTSABER LAND IN THE HAND OF

          REY, WHO STANDS, FACING HIM, HAVING REACHED FOR IT HERSELF,

          BUT UTTERLY STUNNED THAT IT LANDED IN HER HAND! SHE IS

          SHOCKED -- AND SO IS KYLO REN!
          Holding it with both hands, SHE IGNITES LUKE'S LIGHTSABER

          FOR THE FIRST TIME, HER EYES BLAZING.
          Kylo Ren IGNITES HIS SABER.
          It's REY who charges now -- Kylo Ren immediately on the
          defensive. They BATTLE POWERFULLY -- He is clearly rocked
          by her raw, innate skill.

          INT. X-WING - NIGHT


                          NIV LEK
           We just lost R-1!

                          JESS
           We're overwhelmed! What do we do?
           It isn't working!
          Another pilot looks down -- SEES THE EXPLOSION -- coming
          from the OSCILLATOR. Relatively small, it's an opening:

                          YOLO ZIFF
           Black Leader, there's a brand new
           hole in that oscillator. Looks like
           our friends got in!

                          POE
           Red Four! Red Six! Cover us!

           LT. BASTIAN
           I'm on it!

                          ELLO ASTY
           Roger!

                          POE
           Everybody else, hit the target hard!
           Give it everything you got!
          And the X-WINGS DIVE and BLAST the OSCILLATOR --

          EXT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR - NIGHT

          Another two X-wings -- including Poe's -- soar through the
          trench leading to the oscillator structure!

                          POE
           I need some help here! I need some
           help!

           LT. BASTIAN
           I'm coming in!

                          JESS
           Watch out!

                          ELLO ASTY
           I'm hit!
          The alien pilot's X-wing is blasted to pieces.

                          POE
           All teams - I'm going in! Pull up
           and cover me!

                          NIV LEK
           Copy that, Black Leader! Good luck,
           Poe!
          The trailing X-wings peel off as Poe's black fighter darts
          into the fiery breach.

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - NEAR DARKNESS

          Outside, the SUN ALMOST COMPLETELY GONE -- PULL BACK THROUGH

          THE WINDOW TO REVEAL A STARKILLER TECHNICIAN:

                          STARKILLER TECHNICIAN
           Weapon at full capacity in thirty
           seconds.

                          GENERAL HUX
           Prepare to fire.

          EXT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR - NIGHT

          Poe's X-wing weaves through the breach. A pursuing TIE
          fighter does not clear the gap, leaving Poe to circle the
          interior of the unguarded structure, firing volley after
          volley of torpedoes.

          EXT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR - NIGHT

          The remaining X-Wings -- including Poe's -- BLAST the place --
          and the structure begins to CRATER, deep underground

          EXPLOSIONS!

          EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

          Amid the BARE WHITE TREES, ONLY TWO LIGHTSABERS -- LUKE'S
          BLUE AND REN'S YELLOW-RED -- ILLUMINATE the FLURRIES OF SNOW
          as Rey and Kylo Ren BATTLE HARD.
          She seems to be, impossibly, STRONGER THAN HE IS for half a
          dozen blows -- until he FINDS HIS STRENGTH and FIGHTS BACK --
          MOVING FORWARD and PUSHING REY BACK, into the forest.
          Suddenly a COLOSSAL CHUNK OF THE FOREST RIGHT BEHIND REY
          DROPS AWAY! Rey is suddenly fighting on the EDGE OF A

          MASSIVE, BRAND NEW CLIFF!

                          KYLO REN
           You need a teacher! I can show you
           the ways of the Force!

                          REY
           The Force.
          Rey closes her eyes for a long beat. When Rey opens them,
          she is centered, fortified, and she POUNDS BACK, SINGLE HANDED
          SWIPES, hitting Ren's gnarly, spitting saber with incredible
          FORCE. It's so fast now, so furious, that Kylo Ren FALLS
          BACK -- She ATTACKS HARDER!
          Ren gets up again but she HITS HIS SABER'S HILT -- HIS BLADE
          GOES FLYING OFF, TUMBLING INTO THE SNOW -- and she SLASHES

          AGAIN AND AGAIN AND HITS KYLO REN SQUARE IN THE HEAD AND

          CHEST. HE GOES DOWN, SUDDENLY A FEARFUL MAN, A LARGE BURN
          SCAR SLASHED ACROSS HIS FACE! He still reaches for his saber.
          And she could kill him -- right now, with ONE VICIOUS STRIKE!
          But she stops. Realizing she stands on a greater edge than
          even the cliff -- the edge of the dark side. The earth
          SHAKES. The earth splits. A gully forms.

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

          The area where the RALLY was held is now COLLAPSING into a
          giant sink hole! We WHIP PAN to a YOUNG TECHNICIAN, who
          watches this out the control room window in horror. He
          hurries off, passing COLONEL DATOO, who admonishes:

                          COLONEL DATOO
           Lieutenant, get back to your station!

                          YOUNG TECHNICIAN
           (stops, fleetingly)
           Just look. We won't survive -- even
           Hux has gone!
          As he hurries off, WE HEAR:

           GENERAL HUX (V.O.)
           Supreme Leader.

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT

          Hux stands before SNOKE'S IMAGE. Relative quiet here, but
          distant SOUNDS OF DESTRUCTION. Hux tries to keep it together
          but is horrified, heartsick:

                          GENERAL HUX
           The fuel cells have ruptured. The
           collapse of the planet has begun.
          Snoke takes this in. Furious, desolate... knowing.

                          SNOKE
           Leave the base at once and come to
           me with Kylo Ren.

                          (GRIM)
           It is time to complete his training.

          EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

          Rey turns, runs a hundred feet through the forest to:
          FINN, who lies, near death, not far from where the GROUND
          FELL AWAY. Rey falls to her knees near him, turns him over,
          sees his cauterized but possibly fatal wound.

                          REY
           Finn! Finn...
          Tears come to her eyes as she lifts him, holds his lifeless
          body in her arms. Snow flurries around them as she cries,
          holding this boy who she just met, who she already adores.
          They are left here to die -- nearby MORE TREES DROP as the
          planet continues to COLLAPSE. And just as it seems like all
          is lost... Her wet eyes look up to see:

          LIGHTS RISE FROM THE NEWLY-FORMED CANYON -- IT'S A SHIP WE
          KNOW -- IT'S THE MILLENNIUM FALCON -- and its lights

          ILLUMINATE REY, WHOSE FACE FILLS WITH HOPE!
          CHEWIE IS AT THE CONTROLS. He ROARS to them!

          EXT. FALCON - NIGHT

          Chewie exits the ship.
          MOMENTS LATER Chewie CARRIES FINN up the ramp. Rey hurries
          with them back into the ship --

          INT. FALCON - NIGHT

          Chewie carries Finn inside, followed by Rey.

          EXT. SPACE - NIGHT

          And we FLY WITH THE FALCON as it leaves the planet -- we can
          see CHEWIE AND REY PILOTING, the COLLAPSING PLANET BEHIND
          US. The Resistance X-wings, led by Poe, follow the Falcon.

          INT. X-WING - NIGHT


                          POE
           All teams! I got eyes on them!

                          SNAP
           Yes!
          The X-wings ROAR OFF, skyward as the MUSIC SOARS, the PLANET
          IMPLODES -- THE SUNLIGHT IT CONTAINS BURSTS FORTH, and as we
          get further and further distance from what was Starkiller
          Base, we witness the REBIRTH OF A SUN. Light restored to a
          corner of the galaxy.
          The Millennium Falcon and the X-wings RIP THROUGH SPACE,
          headed home.

                          POE
           Our job's done here. Let's go home!

          EXT. D'QAR - DAY

          ESTABLISHING SHOT as the Falcon on the landing strip.

          EXT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

          The Falcon has landed among the remaining Resistance ships.
          Poe is there, watching as Chewie scuttles down the ramp
          carrying an unconscious Finn. Medical Personnel and Officers,
          meet them, usher them inside.

                          MEDIC
           Easy, easy. He's hurt. We've got a
           heartbeat.
          Rey walks down the ramp and sees, for the first time, Leia.
          C-3PO and BB-8 behind her. The crowds are cheering.
          Rey is so sad for Leia, so sorry.
          The two women move for each other. And Leia takes Rey's
          face in her hands. Despite her heartbreak, she is grateful.
          She embraces Rey. A mother's embrace.
          Rey cries, too, in this emotional first meeting.

          INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

          Chewbacca sits quietly, as do many in the base, mourning
          their losses.
          As BB-8 approaches R2-D2, the long dormant droid suddenly
          stirs. The droids beep at each other.

                          C-3PO
           R2-D2! You've come back! You found
           what? How dare you call me that!

                          (MORE)

                         

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:

           C-3PO (CONT'D)
           (he swats R2-D2, who

                          CONTINUES BEEPING)
           Find Master Luke how? Come, R2! We
           must go tell the others at once!

          INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

          Leia stands alone and in silence, heartbroken.

           C-3PO (O.S.)
           General? Excuse me, General?
          Leia turns to see droids.

           C-3PO (CONT'D)
           R2-D2 may contain some much needed
           good news.

                          LEIA
           Tell me.
          Rey stands with Leia, Poe C-3PO, BB-8 and a handful of
          Resistance Officers. Suddenly R2-D2 PROJECTS A HOLOGRAM! A

          LARGE NAVIGATIONAL MAP WITH A SPECIFIC MISSING CHUNK!
          BB-8 BEEPS -- Poe turns to him --

                          POE
           Yeah, all right, buddy, hold on --
          Poe runs over -- removes the ancient data device that Lor
          San Tekka had given him from a base computer. He inserts it
          back inside BB-8, who then PROJECTS HIS MAP -- which he
          SHRINKS DOWN TO SIZE -- and the two droids MOVE SLIGHTLY --

          TOGETHER -- THE TWO HOLOGRAMS UNITE, BB-8'S PIECE FILLING IN

          R2-D2'S PERFECTLY!
          Everyone REACTS -- amazed --

                          C-3PO
           Oh! The map! It is complete!

                          LEIA
           (hand on her heart)
           -- Luke --
          Suddenly there are CHEERS AND EMBRACES.
          C-3PO leans down to R2-D2 and says, quietly, sweetly:

                          C-3PO
           (to R2-D2)
           Oh my dear friend. How I've missed
           you.

          INT. RESISTANCE BASE - I.C.U. - DAY

          A NEW DAY. Finn, unconscious in an I.C.U. POD. His fate
          uncertain. Rey sits with him. Deeply worried. Finally she
          leans in, close to him. She kisses him and says, quietly,
          despite her fear:

                          REY
           We'll see each other again. I believe
           that. Thank you, my friend.

          EXT. D'QAR - DAY

          Chewie does last minute checks of the Falcon. Rey stands
          with Leia a beat and then turns to head to the Falcon. As
          Rey walks off, she hears Leia call out:

                          LEIA
           Rey.
          Rey turns around.

                          LEIA (CONT'D)
           May the Force be with you.
          This fills Rey up. She smiles gratefully. Rey crosses to
          the Falcon.

          INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY

          Rey sits in the pilot seat, Chewie as co-pilot. Rey looks
          at him compassionately.
          Rey FLICKS SWITCHES and --

          EXT. D'QAR - DAY

          The Millennium Falcon RISES.
          Leia, with Poe, BB-8, and C-3PO (with his proper arm
          replaced), watches the next generation of Jedi begin her
          journey.

          EXT. SPACE - DAY

          The Falcon FLIES through space and BLASTS to LIGHTSPEED.

          EXT. AHCH-TO - DAY

          A pristine and mighty OCEAN. Endless BLUE, dotted with
          random, beautiful, mountainous BLACK ROCK ISLANDS, dotted
          with countless GREEN TREES.
          The Millennium Falcon FLIES INTO VIEW, BANKS toward one of
          the ISLANDS.

          EXT. AHCH-TO ISLAND - DAY

          Rey, her staff strapped to her back, begins her hike up the
          considerable mountain, glancing back at Chewie and R2-D2,
          who watch her from the bottom of the ramp. A deep breath
          and Rey continues her journey.

          EXT. AHCH-TO ISLAND - STONE STAIRS - DAY

          Built within the rock and foliage of this idyllic island are
          seemingly endless ANCIENT STONE STEPS. Rey continues to
          climb them, determined, despite her fatigue.

          EXT. AHCH-TO ISLAND - STONE STRUCTURES - DAY

          Rey arrives at a clearing. Small, modest, primitive stone
          structures. But no one around. Rey walks past them, sees,
          senses no one.

          And then she stops. Feels something. She turns.
          Standing forty feet away from her, his back to us, is a MAN,
          in a CLOAK AND ROBE.

          Rey stares, knowing exactly who it is. But she just stares
          for what seems like forever. Until he finally TURNS, SLOWLY,
          to her. Pulls back his hood.

          IT IS LUKE SKYWALKER.

          Older now, white hair, bearded. He looks at Rey. A kindness
          in his eyes, but there's something tortured, too. He doesn't
          need to ask her who she is, or what she is doing here. His
          look says it all.

          In response, Rey pulls something from the pack.

          LUKE'S LIGHTSABER.
          And she holds it out to him. An offer. A plea. The galaxy's
          only hope.

          HOLD ON LUKE SKYWALKER'S INCREDIBLE FACE, amazed and
          conflicted at what he sees, as our MUSIC BUILDS, the promise
          of an adventure, just beginning...

                         

                         

                          THE END
Star Wars: Episode 1:The Phantom Menace



TITLE CARD : A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....

A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main title, followed by
a roll up, which crawls up into infinity.

EPISODE 1 THE PHANTOM MENACE

Turmoil has engulfed the Galactic Republic. The taxation of trade routes to
outlaying star systems is in dispute.
Hoping to resolve the matter with a blockade of deadly battleships, the
greedy Trade Federation has stopped all shipping to the small planet of
Naboo.
While the congress of the Republic endlessly debates this alarming chain of
events, the Supreme Chancellor has secretly dispatched two Jedi Knights,
the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy, to settle the
conflict.....

PAN DOWN to reveal a small space cruiser heading TOWARD CAMERA at great
speed. PAN with the cruiser as it heads towardthe beautiful green planet of
Naboo, which is surrounded by hundreds of Trade Federation battleships.

INT. REPUBLIC CRUISER - COCKPIT


In the cockpit of the cruise, the CAPTAIN and PILOT maneuver closer to one
of the battleships.

QUI-GON : (off screen voice) Captain.

The Captain turns to an unseen figure sitting behind her.

CAPTAIN : Yes, sir?
QUI-GON : (V.O) Tell them we wish to board at once.
CAPTAIN : Yes, sir.

The CAPTAIN looks to her view screen, where NUTE GUNRAY, a Neimoidian trade
viceroy, waits for a reply.

CAPTAIN : (cont'd) With all due respect for the Trade Federation, the
Ambassodors for the Supreme Chancellor wish to board immediately.
NUTE : Yes, yes, of coarse...ahhh...as you know, our blockade is perfectly
legal, and we'd be happy to recieve the Ambassador...Happy to.

The screen goes black. Out the cockpit window, the sinister battleship
looms ever closer.

EXT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - DOCKING BAY - SPACE (FX)

The small space cruiser docks in the enormous main bay of the Federation
battleship.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - DOCKING BAY - SPACE

A PROTOCOL DROID, TC-14, waits at the door to the docking bay. Two WORKER
DROIDS, PK-4 and EG-9 watch.

PK-4 : They must be important if the Viceroy sent one of those useless
protocol gearheads to greet them.

The door opens, and the Republic cruiser can be seen in the docking bay.
Two darkly robed figures are greeted by TC-14.

TC-14 : I'm TC-14 at your service. This way, please.

They move off down the hallway.

EG-9 : A Republic cruiser! That's trouble...don't you think?
PR-4 : I'm not made to think.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM

A door slides open, and the two cloaked shapes are led PAST CAMERA into the
formal conference room by TC-14.

TC-14 : I hope you honoured sirs with the most comfortable here. My master
will be with you shortly.

The droid bows before OBI-WAN KENOBI and QUI- GON JINN. He backs out the
door and it closes. The JEDI lower their hoods and look out a large window
at the lush green planet of Naboo. QUI-GON sixty years old, has long white
hair in a ponytail. He is tall and striking, with blue eyes. OBI-WAN is
twenty five, with very short brown hair, pale skin, and blue eyes. Several
exotic, bird-like creatures SING in a cage near the door.

OBI-WAN : I have a bad feeling about this.
QUI-GON : I don't sense anything.
OBI-WAN : It's not about the mission, Master, it's
somethging...elsewhere...elusive.
QUI-GON : Don't center on your anxiety, Obi-Wan. Keep your concentration
here and now where it belongs.
OBI-WAN : Master Yoda says I should be mindful of the future...
QUI-GON : .....but not at the expense of the moment. Be mindful of the
living Force, my young Padawan.
OBI-WAN : Yes, Master...how do you think the trade viceroy will deal with
the chancellor's demands?
QUI-GON : These Federation types are cowards. The negotiations will be
short.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

NUTE GUNRAY and DAULTRAY DOFINE stand, stunned, before TC-14.

NUTE : (shaken) What?!? What did you say?
TC-14 : The Ambassadors are Jedi Knights, I believe.
DOFINE : I knew it! They were sent to force a settlement, eh. Blind me,
we're done for!

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY

A hologram of NUTE , surrounded by BATTLE DROIDS, appears in the conference
room hallway.

NUTE : They must be dead by now. Blast, what's left of them.

The hologram fades off, as a BATTLE DROID, OWO-1, cautiously opens the
door. A deadly green cloud billows from the room. BATTLE DROIDS cock their
weapons as a figure stumbles out of the smoke. It is TC-14 , carrying the
tray of drinks.

TC14 : Oh, excuse me, so sorry.

The PROTOCOL DROID passes the armed camp just as two flashing laser swords
fly out of the deadly fog, cutting down several BATTLE DROIDS before they
can fire.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

The bridge is a cocophony of alarms. NUTE and RUNE watch OWO-1 on the
viewscreen.

OWO-1 : Not sure exactly what...

OWO-1 is suddenly cut in half in mid-sentence. RUNE gives NUTE a worried
look.

NUTE : What in blazes is going on down there?
RUNE : Have you ever encountered a Jedi Knight before, sir?
NUTE : Well, not exactly, but I don't...(panicked) Seal off the bridge.
RUNE : That won't be enough, sir.

The doors to the bridge SLAM shut.

NUTE : I want destroyer droids up here at once!!!
RUNE : We will not survive this.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY - OUTSIDE BRIDGE

QUI-GON cuts several BATTLE DROIDS in half, creating a shower of sparks and
metal parts. OBI-WAN raises his hand, sending several BATTLE DROIDS
crashing into the wall.

QUI-GON makes his way to the bridge door and begins to cut through it.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

The CREW is very nervous as sparks start flying around the bridge door.
QUI-GON and OBI-WAN are on the view screen.

NUTE : Close the blast doors!!!

The huge, very thick blast door slams shut, followed by a second door, then
a third. There is a hissing sound as the huge doors seal shut. QUI-GON tabs
the door with his sword. The screen goes black as a red spot appears in the
center of the blast door.

RUNE : ...They're still coming through!

On the door, chunks of molten metal begin to drop away.

NUTE : Impossible!! This is impossible!!
RUNE : Where are those destroyer droids?!

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY - OUTSIDE BRIDGE

Ten ugly destroyer WHEEL DROIDS roll down the hallway at full speed. Just
before they get to the bridge area, they stop and transform into their
battle configuration. QUI-GON can't see them but senses their presence.

QUI-GON : Destroyer droids!
OBI-WAN : Offhand, I'd say this mission is past the negotiaion stage.

The WHEEL DROIDS, led by P-59, rush the entry area from three hallways,
blasting away with their laser guns. They stop firing and stand in a
semi-circle as the smoke clears. OBI-WAN and QUI-GON are nowhere to be
seen.

P-59 : Switch to bio...There they are!

The Jedi materialize at the far end of the hallway and dash through the
doorway that slams shut. The WHEEL DROIDS blast away at the two JEDI with
their laser swords.

OBI-WAN : They have shield generators!
QUI-GON : It's a standoff! Let's go!

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

NUTE and RUNE stand on the bridge, watching the view screen as the WHEEL
DROIDS' POV speeds to the doorway.

RUNE : We have them on the run, sir...they're no match for destroyer
droids.
TEY HOW : Sir, they've gone up the ventilation shaft.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - MAIN BAY

QUI-GON and OBI-WAN appear at a large vent in a giant hanger bay. They are
careful not to be seen. Thousands of BATTLE DROIDS are loading onto landing
craft.

QUI-GON : Battle droids.
OBI-WAN : It's an invisible army.
QUI-GON : It's an odd play for the Trade Federation. We've got to warn the
Naboo and contact Chancellor Valorum. Let's split up. Stow aboard separate
ships and meet down on the planet.
OBI-WAN : You were right about one thing, Master. The negotiations were
short.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

TEY HOW recieves a transmission.

TEY HOW : Sir, a transmission from the planet.
RUNE : It's Queen Amidala herself.
NUTE : At last we're getting results.

On the view screen, QUEEN AMIDALA appears in her throne room. Wearing her
elaborate headdress and robes, she sits, surrounded by the GOVERNING
COUNCIL and FOUR HANDMAIDENS, EIRTAE, YANE, RABE, and SACHE.

NUTE : (cont'd) Again you come before me, Your highness. The Federation is
pleased.
AMIDALA : You will not be pleased when you hear what I have to say,
Viceroy...Your trade boycott of our planet has ended.

NUTE smirks at RUNE.

NUTE : I was not aware of such a failure.
AMIDALA : I have word that the Senate is finally voting on this blockade of
yours.
NUTE : I take it you know the outcome. I wonder why they bother to vote.
AMIDALA : Enough of this pretense, Viceroy! I'm aware the Chancellor's
Ambassadors are with you now, and that you have beencommanded to reach a
settlement.
NUTE : I know nothing about any Ambassadors...you must be mistaken.

AMIDALA, surprised at his reaction, studies him carefully.

AMIDALA : Beware, Viceroy....the Federation is going too far this time.
NUTE : Your Highness, we would never do anything without the approval of
the Senate. You assume too much.
AMIDALA : We will see.

The QUEEN fades off, and the view screen goes black.

RUNE : She's right, the Senate will never....
NUTE : It's too late now.
RUNE : Do you think she suspects an attack?
NUTE : I don't know, but we must move quickly to disrupt all communications
down there.

INT. NABOO PALACE - THRONE ROOM

The QUEEN, EIRTAE, SACHE and her Governor, SIO BIBBLE, stand before a
hologram of SENATOR PALPATINE, a thin, kindly man.

PALPATINE : ...How could that be true? I have assurances from the
Chancellor...his Ambassaodrs did arrive. It must be
the...get...negotiate...

The hologram of PALPATIONE sputters and fades away.

AMIDALA : Senator Palpatine?!? (turns to Panaka) What's happening?

CAPTAIN PANAKA turns to his SARGEANT

CAPT. PANAKA : Check the transmission generators...
BIBBLE : A malfunction?
CAPT. PANAKA : It could be the Federation jamming us. Your Highness.
BIBBLE : A communications disruption can only mean one thing. Invasion.
AMIDALA : Don't jump to conclusions, Governor. The Federation would not
dare go that far.
CAPT. PANAKA : The Senate would revoke their trade franchise, and they'd be
finished.
AMIDALA : We must continue to rely on negotiation.
BIBBLE : Negotiation? We've lost all communications!...and where atre the
Chancellors Ambassadors? How can we negotiate? We must prepare to defend
ourselves.
CAPT. PANAKA : This is a dangerous situation, Your Highness. Our security
volunteers will be no match against a battle-hardened Federation army.
AMIDALA : I will not condone a course of action that will lead us to war.

EXT. SPACE LANDING CRAFT - TWILIGHT (FX)

Six landing craft fly in formation toward the surface of the planet Naboo.

EXT. NABOO SWAMP - SHALLOW LAKE - TWILIGHT

Three landing craft slowly descend through the cloud cover of the
perpetually gray twilight side of the planet. One by one, the Federation
warships land in the eerie swamp.
OBI-WAN's head emerges from the mud of a shallow lake. For in the
background, the activities of the invasion force can be seen in the mist.
OBI-WAN takes several deep breaths, then dissapears again under the muddy
swamp. Troop Transports (MTT's) emerge from the landing craft.

EXT. NABOO EDGE OF SWAMP / GRASS PLAINS - TWILIGHT (FX)

The droid invasion force moves out of the swamp and onto a grassy plain.
OOM-9, in his tank, looks out over the vast ARMY marching across the
rolling hills. A small hologram of RUNE and NUTE stands on the tank.

RUNE : ...and there is no trace of the Jedi. They may have gotton onto one
of your landing craft.
OOM-9 : If they are down here, sir, we'll find them. We are moving out of
the swamp and are marching on the cities. We are meeting no resistance.
NUTE : Excellent.

EXT. NABOO SWAMP - TWILIGHT

QUI-GON runs through the strange landscape, glancing back to see the
monstrous troop transports, emerging from the mist. Animals begin to run
past him in a panic.
An odd, frog-like Gungan, JAR JAR INKS, squats holding a clam he has
retrieved from the murky swamp. The shell pops open. JAR JAR's greta tongue
snaps out and grabs the clam, swallowing it in one gulp.
JAR JAR looks up and sees QUI-GON and the other creatures running like the
wind toward him. One of the huge MTT's bears down on the JEDI like a
charging locomotive. JAR JAR stands transfixed, still holding the clam
shell in one hand.

JAR JAR : Oh, noooooooooo!

JAR JAR drops the shell and grabs onto QUI-GON as he passes. The JEDI is
caught by surprise.

JAR JAR : (Cont'd) Hey, help me! Help me!!
QUI-GON : Let go!

The machine is about tp crush them as QUI-GON drags JAR JAR behind him.
Just as the transport is about to hit them, QUI-GON drops, and JAR JAR goes
splat into the mud with him. The transport races overhead.
QUI-GON and JAR JAR pull themselves out of the mud. They stand watching the
war machine dissapear into the mist. JAR JAR grabs QUI-GON and hugs him.

JAR JAR : Oyi, mooie-mooie! I luv yous!

The frog-like creature kisses the JEDI.

QUI-GON : Are you brainless? You almost got us killed!
JAR JAR : I spake.
QUI-GON : The ability to speak does not make you intelligent. Now get outta
here!

QUI-GON starts to move off, and JAR JAR follows.

JAR JAR : No...no! Mesa stay...Mesa yous humble servaunt.
QUI-GON : That wont be necessary.
JAR JAR : Oh boot tis! Tis demunded byda guds. Tis a live debett, tis. Mesa
culled Jaja Binkss.

In the distance, two STAPS burst out of the mist at high speed, chasing
OBI-WAN.

QUI-GON : I have no time for this now...
JAR JAR : Say what?

The two STAPS barrell down on OBI-WAN.

JAR JAR : (cont'd) Oh, nooooo! Weesa ganna....

QUI-GON throws JAR JAR into the mud.

QUI-GON : Stay down!

His head pops up.

JAR JAR : ...dieeee!

The two troops fire laser bolts at OBI-WAN. QUI-GON deflects the bolts
back, and the STAPS blow up. One-two. OBI-WAN is exhausted and tries to
catch his breath.

OBI-WAN : Sorry, Master, the water fried my weapon.

OBI-WAN pulls out his burnt laser sword handle. QUI-GON inspects it, as JAR
JAR pulls himself out of the mud.

QUI-GON : You forgot to turn your power off again, didn't you?

OBI-WAN nods sheeplishly.

QUI-GON : (cont'd) It won't take long to recharge, but this is a lesson I
hope you've learned, my young Padawan.
OBI-WAN : Yes, Master.
JAR JAR : Yousa sav-ed my again, hey?
OBI-WAN : What's this?
QUI-GON : A local. Let's go, before more of those droids show up.
JAR JAR : Mure? Mure did you spake??!?

OBI-WAN and QUI-GON start to run. JAR JAR tries to keep up.

JAR JAR : (cont'd) Ex-squeeze me, but da moto grande safe place would be
Otoh Gunga. Tis where I grew up...Tis safe city.

They all stop.

QUI-GON : A city! (JAR JAR nods his head) Can you take us there?
JAR JAR : Ahhh, will...on second taut...no, not willy.
QUI-GON : No??!
JAR JAR : Iss embarrissing, boot... My afrai my've bean banished. My
forgoten der Bosses would do terrible tings to my. Terrible tings if my
goen back dare.

A PULSATING SOUND is heard in the distance.

QUI-GON : You hear that?

JAR JAR shakes his head yes.

QUI-GON : (cont'd) That's the sound of a thousand terrible things heading
this way...
OBI-WAN : When they find us, they will crush us, grind us into little
pieces, then blast us into oblivion!
JAR JAR : Oh! Yousa point is well seen. Dis way! Hurry!

JAR JAR turns and runs into the swamp.

EXT. NABOO SWAMP LAKE - TWILIGHT

QUI-GON, OBI-WAN and JAR JAR run into a murky lake and stop as JAR JAR
tries to catch his breath. The TRANSPORTS ARE HEARD in the distance.

QUI-GON : Much farther?
JAR JAR : Wesa goen underwater, okeyday?

QUI-GON and OBI-WAN pull out small capsule from their utility belts that
turn into breathing masks.

JAR JAR : (cont'd) My warning yous. Gungans no liken outlaunders. Don't
expict a wern welcome.
OBI-WAN : Don't worry, this has not been our day for warm welcomes.

JAR JAR jumps, does a double somersault with a twist, and dives into the
water.
Breath masks on, QUI-GON and OBI-WAN wade in after him.

EXT. NABOO LAKE - UNDERWATER

QUI-GON and OBI-WAN swim behind JAR JAR, who is very much at home in the
water. Down they swim into murky depths. In the distance the glow of Otoh
Gunga, an underwater city made up of large bubbles, becomes more distinct.
They approach the strange, art nouveau habitat. JAR JAR swims magically
through one of the bubble membranes, which seals behind him. OBI-WAN and
QUI-GON follow.

INT. OTOH GUNGA - CITY SQUARE

GUNGANS in the square scatter when they see the strange JEDI. Four GUARDS
armed with long electro-poles ride two-legged KAADUS into the square. The
GUARDS, led by CAPTAIN TARPALS, point their lethal poles at the dripping
trio.

JAR JAR : Heyo-dalee, Cap'n Tarpals, Mesa back!
CAPT. TARPALS : Noah gain, Jar Jar. Yousa goen tada Bosses. Yousa in big
dudu this time.

CAPT. TARPALS gives JAR JAR a slight zap with his power pole. JAR JAR jumps
and moves off, followed by the two JEDI.

JAR JAR : How wude.

INT. OTOH GUNGA - HIGH TOWER BOARD ROOM

The Bosses' Board Room has bubble walls, with small lighted fish swimming
around outside like moving stars. A long circular judge's bench filled with
GUNGAN OFFICIALS dominates the room. OBI-WAN and QUI-GON stand facing BOSS
NASS, who sits on a bench higher than the others.

BOSS NASS : Yousa cannot bees hair. Dis army of mackineeks up dare tis new
weesong!
QUI-GON : That droid army is about to attack the Naboo. We must warn them.
BOSS NASS : Wesa no like da Naboo! Un dey no like uss-ens. Da Naboo tink
day so smarty den us-ens. Day tink day brains so big.
OBI-WAN : After those droids take control of the surface, they will come
here and take control of you.
BOSS NASS : No, mesa no tink so. Mesa scant talkie witda Naboo, and no
nutten talkie it outlaunders. Dos mackineeks no comen here! Dey not know of

OBI-WAN : You and the Naboo form a symbiont circle. What happens to noe of
you will affect the other. You must understand this.
BOSS NASS : Wesa wish no nutten in yousa tings, outlaunder, and wesa no

QUI-GON : (waves his hand) Then speed us on our way.
BOSS NASS : Wesa gonna speed yousaway.
QUI-GON : We need a transport.
BOSS NASS : Wesa give yousa una bongo. Da speedest way tooda Naboo tis goen
through da core. Now go.
QUI-GON : Thank you for your help. We go in peace.

QUI-GON and OBI-WAN turn to leave.

OBI-WAN : Master, whats a bongo?
QUI-GON : A transport, I hope.

The JEDI notice JAR JAR in chains to one side, waiting to hear his verdict.
QUI-GON stops. JAR JAR gives him a forlorn look.

JAR JAR : Daza setten yous up. Goen through da planet core is bad bombin!!
QUI-GON : Thank you, my friend.
JAR JAR : Ahhh...any hep hair would be hot.

JAR JAR's soulful look is counterpointed by a sheepish grin.

OBI-WAN : We are short of time, Master.
QUI-GON : We'll need a navigator to get us through the planet's core. This
Gungan my be of help.

QUI-GON walks bact to BOSS NASS.

QUI-GON : (cont'd) What is to become of Jar Jar Binks here?
BOSS NASS : Binkss brokeen the nocombackie law. Hisen to be pune-ished.
QUI-GON : He has been a great help to us. I hope the punishment will not be
too severe.
BOSS NASS : Pounded unto death.
JAR JAR : (grimacing) Oooooh...Ouch!

OBI-WAN looks concerned. QUI-GON is thinking.

QUI-GON : We need a navigator to get us through the planet's core. I have
saved Jar Jar Binks' life. He owes me what you call a "life.debt."
BOSS NASS : Binks. Yousa havena liveplay with thisen hisen?

JAR JAR nods and joins the JEDI. QUI-GON waves his hand.

QUI-GON : Your gods demand that his life belongs to me now.
BOSS NASS : Hisen live tis yos, outlauder. Begone wit him.
JAR JAR : Count mesa outta dis! Better dead here, den deader in da

EXT. NABOO CITY - UNDERWATER - SUB (FX)

A strange little submarine propels itself away from the Otoh Gunga, leaving
the glow of the settlement in the distance.

INT. SUB COCKPIT - UNDERWATER

OBI-WAN in the co-pilots seat, JAR JAR guides the craft.

JAR JAR : Dis is nusen.
OBI-WAN : Master, why do you keep dragging these pathetic life forms along
with us?...Here, take over.
JAR JAR : Hey, ho? Where wesa goen??
QUI-GON : You're the navigator.
JAR JAR : Yo dreamen mesa hopen...,br QUI-GON : Just relax, the Force will
guide us...
JAR JAR : Ooooh, maxibig..."da Force"...Wellen, dat smells stinkowiff.

JAR JAR veers the craft to the left and turns the lights on. The coral
vistas are grand, fantastic, and wonderous.

OBI-WAN : Why were you banished, Jar Jar?
JAR JAR : Tis a long tale, buta small part wawdabe
mesa...ooooh...aaaa.....clumsy.
OBI-WAN : They banished you because you're clumsy?

As the little sub glides into the planet core, a large dark shape begins to
follow.

JAR JAR : Mesa cause-ed mabee one or duey lettal bitty axadentes...yud-say
boom da gasser, un crash Der Bosses heyblibber...den banished.

Suddenly there is a loud CRASH, and the little craft lurches to one side.
QUI-GON looks around and sees a huge, lumimnous OPEE SEA KILLER has hooked
them with its long gooey tongue.

QUI-GON : Full speed ahead.

Instead of full ahead, JAR JAR jams the controls into reverse. The sub
flies into the mouth of the creature.

JAR JAR : Oooops.
OBI-WAN : Give me the controls.

OBI-WAN takes over the controls and the OPEE SEA KILLER instantly releases
the sub from its mouth.

JAR JAR : Wesa free!

As the sub zooms away they see a larger set of jaws, munching on the
hapless KILLER. The jaws belong to the incredible SANDO AQUA MONSTER. The
lights on the tiny sub begin to flicker as they cruise deeper into the
gloom.

QUI-GON : There's always a bigger fish.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

NUTE and RUNE stand before a hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS.

NUTE : The invasion is on schedule, My Lord.
DARTH SIDIOUS : Good. I have the Senate bogged down in procedures. By the
time this incident comes up for a vote, they will have no choice but to
accept your control of the system.
NUTE : The Queen has great faith the Senate will side with her.
DARTH SIDIOUS : Queen Amidala is yound and naive. You will find controlling
her will not be difficult. You have done well, Viceroy.
NUTE : Thank you, My Lord.

DARTH SIDIOUS fades away.

RUNE : You didn't tell him about the missing Jedi?
NUTE : No need to report that to him, until we have something to report.

INT. SUB COCKPIT - UNDERWATER

Sparks are flying, and water is leaking into the cabin. The sound of the
power drive drops.

OBI-WAN : .....we're losing power.

OBI-WAN is working with the sparking wires. JAR JAR panics.

QUI-GON : Stay calm. We're not in trouble yet.
JAR JAR : What yet? Monstairs out dare! Leak'n in here, all'n sink'n, and
nooooo power! You nutsen! WHEN YOUSA TINK WESA IN TROUBLE?!!!?
OBI-WAN : Power's back.

The lights flicker on, revealing an ugly COLO CLAW FISH right in front of
them.

JAR JAR : Monstairs back!

The large COLO CLAW FISH is surprised and rears back. The sub turns around
and speeds away.

JAR JAR : (cont'd) Wesa in trouble now??
QUI-GON : Relax.

QUI-GON puts his hand on JAR JAR's shoulder. JAR JAR relaxes into a coma.

OBI-WAN : You overdid it.

The COLO CLAW FISH leaps after the fleeing sub as it shoots out of the
tunnel and into the waiting jaws of the SANDO AQUA MONSTER.

OBI-WAN (cont'd) This is not good!

JAR JAR regains consciousness.
JAR JAR : Wesa dead yet?? Oie Boie!

JAR JAR's eyes bulge, and he faints again. The sub narrowly avoids the
deadly teeth of the AQUA MONSTER. The COLO CLAW FISH chasing them isn't so
lucky. It is munched in half by the larger predator. The little sub slips
away.

QUI-GON : Head for that outcropping.

EXT. THEED - MAIN ROAD INTO THEED - DAY (FX)

The long columns of the DROID ARMY move down the main road leading to
Theed, the Naboo capital.

EXT. THEED PLAZA - DAY (FX)

As the QUEEN watches helplessly from a window in the palace, a transport
carrying NUTE and RUNE lands in Theed Plaza. They exit the transport.

NUTE : Ah, victory!

INT. NABOO LAKE - UNDERWATER - SUB (FX)

The little sub continue to propel itself toward the surface, which is
brightly lit.

JAR JAR : Wesa dude it!

EXT. THEED - ESTUARY - DAY

Paradise. Billowing clouds frame a romantic body of water. There is a LOUD
RUSH OF BUBBLES, and a small sub bobs to the surface.
The current in the estuary begins to pull the sub backward into a fast
moving river. OBI-WAN switches off the two remaining bubble canopies.
QUI-GON stands up to look around. JAR JAR lets out a sigh of relief.

JAR JAR : Wesa safe now.
QUI-GON : Get this thing started.
JAR JAR : Dissen berry good. Hey?
OBI-WAN : What is it?

JAR JAR looks back to where they're drifting. He sees they are headed for a
huge waterfall.

JAR JAR : What!!?? Oie boie!

OBI-WAN tries to start the engine. The long props behind the sub slowly
begin to rotate. OBI-WAN struggles until finally, a few feet short of the
waterfall, the sub starts and is able to generate enough power to stop
drifting backward in the powerful current. The sub slowly moves forward. In
the background, QUI-GON takes a cable out of his belt. The engine coughs
and dies. They start drifting backward again. JAR JAR panics.

JAR JAR : (cont'd) Iyiiyi, wesa die'n here, hey!

QUI-GON shoots the thin cable, and it wraps itself around a railing on the
shore. The sub pulls the cable taut, and the little craft hangs
precariously over the edge of the waterfall.

QUI-GON : Come on...

OBI-WAN climbs out of the sub and pulls himself along the cable. QUI-GON
starts in after him.

QUI-GON : (cont'd) Come on, Jar Jar.
JAR JAR : No! Too scary!
OBI-WAN : Get up here!
JAR JAR : No a mighty no!

JAR JAR looks back and sees he is hanging over the waterfall.

JAR JAR : (cont'd) Oie boie...mesa comen. Mesa comen!

JAR JAR starts to climb out of the sub. OBI-WAN is on shore and helps to
pull QUI-GON out of the water.

OBI-WAN : That was close.
BATTLE DROID 3B3 : (O.S) Drop your weapons!

The TWO JEDI turn around to see a BATTLE DROID standing in front of them.
JAR JAR climbs up on shore between the JEDI.

BATTLE DROID 3B3 : I said drop your weapons

QUI-GON ignites his laser sword, and in a brief flash, the DROID is cut
down by the JEDI. A stray laser bolt hits the cable and the sub breaks
lose, crashing down the waterfall.
The JEDI move on. JAR JAR reluctantly follows and looks back at the mess.

JAR JAR : Whoa!!!

EXT. THEED - PALACE - DAY

The waterfalls of Theed sparkle in the noonday sun.

INT. THEED - PALACE THRONE ROOM - DAY

QUEEN AMIDALA, SIO BIBBLE, and FIVE OF HER HANDMAIDENS (EIRTAE, YANE,
PADME, RABE, SACHE) are surrounded by TWENTY DROIDS. CAPTAIN PANAKA and
FOUR NABOO GUARDS are also held at gunpoint. NUTE and RUNE stand in the
middle of the room.

BIBBLE : ...how will you explain this invasion to the Senate?
NUTE : The Naboo and the Federation will forge a treaty that will
legitimize our occupation here. I've been assured it will be ratified by
the Senate.
AMIDALA : I will not co-operate.
NUTE : Now, now, your Highness. You are not going to like what we have in
store for your people. In time, their suffering will persuade you to see
our point of view. Commander. (OOM-9 steps forward) Process them.
OOM-9 : Yes, sir! (turns to his sergeant) Take them to Camp Four.

The SERGEANT marches the GROUP out of the throne room.

EXT. PALACE - PLAZA - DAY

QUEEN AMIDALA, PADME, EIRTA, YANE, RABE, SACHE, CAPTAIN PANAKA, SIO
BIBBLE,
and FOUR GUARDS are led out of the palace by ten BATTLE DROIDS. The plaza
is filled with tanks and BATTLE DROIDS, which they pass on their way to the
detention camp. Unbeknownst to them, QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, and JAR JAR sneak
across on a walkway above the plaza and jump from a balcony to begin an
attack to rescue the QUEEN.

FOUR BATTLE DROIDS are instantly cut down. MORE DROIDS move forward and are
also cut down by the JEDIS' flashing lightsabres until there is only the
DROID SERGEANT left. The SERGEANT starts to run but is pulled back to
QUI-GON by the Force, until finally he is dispatched by the JEDI.

JAR JAR : Yousa guys bombad!

QUEEN AMIDALA and the OTHERS are amazed. JAR JAR is getting used to this.
They move between two buildings.

QUI-GON : Your Highness, we are the Ambassadors, for the Supreme
Chancellor.
BIBBLE : Your negotiations seem to have failed, Ambassador.
QUI-GON : The negotiations never took place. Your Highness, we must make
contact with the republic.

CAPTAIN PANAKA steps forward.

CAPT. PANAKA : They've knocked out all our communications.
QUI-GON : Do you have transports?
CAPT. PANAKA : In the main hanger. This way.

THEY disappear down an alleyway as the ALARMS are sounded

INT. CENTRAL HANGER - HALLWAY - DAY

CAPTAIN PANAKA cracks open a side door to the central hanger. QUI-GON looks
in over his shoulder. OBI-WAN, JAR JAR, and the rest of the group are
behind him. They see several Naboo spacecraft guarded by about FIFTY BATTLE
DROIDS. ALARMS can be heard in the distance.

CAPT. PANAKA : There are too many of them.
QUI-GON : That won't be a problem. (to Amidala) Your Highness, under the
circumstances, Isuggest you come to Coruscant with us.
AMIDALA : Thank you, Ambassador, but my place is here with my people.
QUI-GON : They will kill you if you stay.
BIBBLE : They wouldn't dare.
CAPT. PANAKA : They need her to sign a treaty to make this invasion of
theirs legal. They can't afford to kill her.
QUI-GON : The situation here is not what it seems. There is something else
behind all this, Your Highness. There is no logic in the Federation's move
here. My feelings tell me they will destroy you.
BIBBLE : Please, Your Highness, reconsider. Our only hope is for the Senate
to side with us... Senator Palpatine will need your help.
CAPT. PANAKA : Getting past their blockade is impossible, Your Highness.
Any attempt to escape will be dangerous.
BIBBLE : Your Highness, I will stay here and do what I can...They will have
to retain the Council of Governors in order to maintain control. But you
must leave...

The QUEEN turns to PADME and EIRTAE.

AMIDALA : Either choice presents a great risk...to all of us...
PADME : We are brave, Your Highness.
QUI-GON : If you are to leave, Your Highness, it must be now.
AMIDALA : Then, I will plead our case before the Senate. (to Bibble) Be
careful, Governor.

INT. CENTRAL HANGER - DAY

The door opens to the main hanger. QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, JAR JAR, CAPTAIN
PANAKA, TWO GUARDS, and THREE HANDMAIDENS (PADME, EIRTAE, RABE),
followed
by QUEEN AMIDALA, head for a sleek chrome spacecraft. SIO BIBBLE, YANE and
SACHE stay behind. The HANDMAIDENS begin to cry.

CAPT. PANAKA : We need to free those pilots.

CAPTAIN PANAKA points to TWENTY GUARDS, GROUND CREW, and PILOTS held in a
corner by SIX BATTLE DROIDS.

OBI-WAN : I'll take care of that. OBI-WAN heads toward the group of
captured pilots.

QUI-GON and the QUEEN, CAPTAIN PANAKA, JAR JAR, and the rest Of the GROUP
approach the GUARDS at the ramp of the Naboo craft.

GUARD DROID : Where are you going?
QUI-GON : I'm Ambassador for the Supreme Chancellor, and I'm taking those
people to Coruscant.
DROID GUARD : You're under arrest!

The DROID GUARD draws his weapon, but before any of the DROIDS can fire,
they are cut down. OTHER GUARDS run to their aid. OBI-WAN attacks the
GUARDS around the PILOTS. QUI-GON stands, fighting off DROIDS as the OTHERS
rush on board the spacecraft. OBI-WAN, the FREED PILOTS (including RIC
OLIE), GUARDS and GROUND CREW MEMBERS rush on board the ship. The OTHER
PILOTS and GUARDS race to SIO BIBBLR. After everyone has made it onto the
ship, QUI-GONjumps on board. ALARMS sound. MORE DROIDS rush into the hanger
and fire as the ship takes off.

EXT. THEED - HANGER ENTRY - DAY (FX)

The ship exits the hanger. BATTLE DROIDS standing in the hanger shoot at
them.

EXT. SPACE (FX)

The sleek spacecraft speeds away from the planet of Naboo and heads for the
deadly Federation blockade.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - COCKPIT

The PILOT, RIC OLIE, navigates toward the massive battleship, QUI-GON and
CAPTAIN PANAKA watch.

RIC OLIE : ....our communications are still jammed.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - DROID HOLD

JAR JAR is led into a low, cramped doorway by OBI-WAN.

OBI-WAN : Now stay here, and keep out of trouble.

OBI-WAN closes the door. JAR JAR looks around and sees a long row of five
short, dome-topped ASTRO DROIDS (R-2 units). The all look alike, except for
thier paint color, and they all seem to be shut down.

JAR JAR : Ello, boyos. (no response) Disa wanna longo trip...hey?

JAR JAR taps a bright red R-2 UNIT on the head, and its head pops up a bit.
He lets out a gasp as he lifts the head.

JAR JAR : (Cont'd) Tis opens?...Oooops! Many springs and things come flying
out.

JAR JAR quickly closes it again, very embarrassed.

JAR JAR : (Cont'd) Yoi! Just yoken!
RIC OLIE : Powers back! That little droid did it. He bypassed the main
power drive. Deflector shield up, at maximum.

The lone BLUE DROID finishes his repairs and goes back into the ship. The
Naboo spacecraft races away from the Federation battleship.

RIC OLIE : There's not enough power to get us to Coruscant...the hyperdrive
is leaking.
QUI-GON : We'll have to land somewhere to refuel and repair the ship.

QUI-GON studies a star chart on a monitor.

OBI-WAN : Here, Master. Tatooine... It's small, out of the way, poor... The
Trade Federation has no presence there.
CAPT. PANAKA : How can you be sure?
QUI-GON : It's controlled by the Hutts...
CAPT. PANAKA : The Hutts??
OBI-WAN : It's risky...but there's no alternative.
CAPT. PANAKA : You can't take Her Royal Highness there! The Hutts are
gangsters... If they discovered her...
QUI-GON : ...It would be no different than if we landed on a system
controlled by the Federation...except the Hutts aren't looking for her,
which gives us an advantage.

CPATAIN PANAKA takes a deep breath in frustration.

EXT. SPACE - NABOO SPACECRAFT (FX)

The Naboo spacecraft races away.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM

NUTE and RUNE sit around a conference table with a hologram of DARTH
SIDIOUS.

NUTE : We control all the cities in the North and are searching for any
other settlements...
DARTH SIDIOUS : Destroy all high-ranking officials,
Viceroy...slowly...quietly. And Queen Amidala, has she signed the treaty?
NUTE : She has disappeared, My Lord. One Naboo cruiser got pat the
blockade.
DARTH SIDIOUS : Viceroy, find her! I want that treaty signed.
NUTE : My Lord, it's impossible to locate the ship. It's out of our range.
DARTH SIDIOUS : ...not for a Sith...

A second SITH LORD appears behind DARTH SIDIOUS.

DARTH SIDIOUS : (Cont'd) ...Viceroy, this is my apprentice. Lord Maul. He
will find your lost ship.
NUTE : Yes, My Lord. The hologram fades off.
NUTE : (Cont'd) This is getting out of hand...now there are two of them.
RUNE : We should not have made this bargain. What will happen when the Jedi
become aware of these Sith Lords?

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - QUEENS CHAMBERS

QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, CAPTAIN PANAKA, and the LITTLE BLUE DROID stand before
QUEEN AMIDALA and her THREE HANDMAIDENS, PADME, EIRTAE and RABE.

CAPT. PANAKA : ...An extremely well put together little droid. Without a
doubt, it saved the ship, as well as our lives.
AMIDALA : It is to be commended...what is its number?

The LITTLE BLUE DROID lets out a series of bleeps.CAPTAIN PANAKA leans over
and scrapes some dirt off of the side of the DROID and read the number:

CAPT. PANAKA : R2-D2, Your Highness.
AMIDALA : Thank you, Artoo Detoo. You have proven to be very loyal...Padme!

PADME bows before the QUEEN.

AMIDALA : (Cont'd) Clean this droid up the best you can. It deserves our
gratitude...(to Panaka) Continue, Captain.

CAPTAIN PANAKA looks nervously to OBI-WAN and QUI-GON.

QUI-GON : Yor Highness, we are heading for a remote planet called Tatooine.
It is a system far beyond the reach of the Trade Federation. There we will
be able to make needed repairs, then travel on to Coruscant.
CAPTAIN PANAKA : Your Highness, Tatooine is very dangerous. It's controlled
by an alliance of gangs called the Hutts. I do not agree with the Jedi on
this.
QUI-GON : You must trust my judgement, Your Highness.

AMIDALA and PADME exchange looks. PADME moves next to the DROID.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - MAIN AREA

PADME sits in the Main Area, cleaning R2-D2, the brave little Astra Droid.
JAR JAR pops out of an open door.

JAR JAR : Hidoe!

Both PADME and ARTOO jump and let out a little SCREAM. The Gungan is
embarrassed that he frightened them.

JAR JAR : (Cont'd) Sorry, nomeanen to scare yousa.
PADME : That's all right.
JAR JAR : I scovered oily back dare. Needen it?
PADME : Thank you. This little guy is quite a mess.

JAR JAR hands PADME the oil can.

JAR JAR : Mesa Ja Ja Binksss... PADME : I'm Padme, I attend Her Highness,
You're a Gungan, aren't you? (Jar Jar nods) How did you end up here with
us?
JAR JAR : Me no know...mesa day starten pitty okeyday witda brisky morning

mesa knowen it...pow! Mesa here. (he shrugs)...getten berry berry skeered.

ARTOO BEEPS a sympathetic beep.

INT. ANBOO SPACECRAFT - COCKPIT

OBI-WAN, QUI-GON, and CAPTAIN PANAKA watch over RIC OLIE'S shoulder. A
large yellow planet appears directly ahead. RIC OLIE searches his scopes.

OBI-WAN : Tahyt's it. Tatooine.
RIC OLIE : There's a settlement...a spaceport, looks like.
QUI-GON : Land near the outskirts. We don't want to attract any attention.

EXT. TATOOINE - SPACE (FX)

The ship heads toward the planet of Tatooine.

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - NABOO SPACECRAFT - DAY (FX)

The Naboo spacecraft lands in the desert in a swirl of dust. The spaceport
of Mos Espa is seen in the distance.

EXT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - MAIN AREA

OBI-WAN is hoisting the hyperdrive out of a floor panel. JAR JAR rushes up
to him and falls to his knees.

JAR JAR : Obi-Wan, sire, pleeese, no mesa go!
OBI-WAN : Sorry, Qui-Gon's right. You'll make things less obvious.

JAR JAR walks back to ARTOO in the hallway as QUI-GON (dressed as a farmer)
enters the main area.

OBI-WAN : (Cant'd) The Hyperdrive generator is gone. We will need a new
one.

QUI-GON moves closer to OBI-WAN and speaks quietly to him.

QUI-GON : Don't let them send ant transmissions. Be wary...I sense a
disturbance in the Force.
OBI-WAN : I fell it also, Master.

QUI-GON goes into the hallway to meet up with ARTOO and JAR JAR. They head
to the exit ramp.

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - SPACESHIP - DAY

They start their trek across the desert toward the city of Mos Espa. In the
distance, a strange looking caravan makes its way toward the spaceport.

JAR JAR : Dis sun doen murder tada skin.

From the spaceship, CAPTAIN PANAKA and PADME run toward them.

CAPT. PANAKA : Wait!

QUI-GON stops as they catch up. PADME is dresses in rough peasant's garb.

CAPT. PANAKA : (Cont'd) Her Highness commands you to take her handmaiden
with you. She wishes for her to observe the local...
QUI-GON : No more commands from Her Highness today, Captain. This spaceport
is not going to be pleasant...
CAPT. PANAKA : The Queen wishes it. She is curious about this planet.
PADME : I've been trained in defense... I can take care of myself.
CAPT. PANAKA : Don't make me go back and tell her you refuse.
QUI-GON : I don't have time to argue. But this is not a good idea. Stay
close to me.

He gives PADME a stern look.

EXT. MOS ESPA - STREET - DAY

The little GROUP walks down the main street of Mos Espa. They pass
dangerous looking citizens of all types. PADME looks around in awe at this
exotic enviroment.

QUI-GON : ...moisture farms for the most part, but also a few indigenous
tribes and scavengers. The few spaceports like this one are havens for
those who do not wish to be found...
PADME : ....like us. JAR JAR is in a constant state of panic.

ARTOO whistles along, with perfect confidence.

JAR JAR : Dissen berry berry bad. (steps in ooze)
Ooooh...icky...icky...goo.

EXT. MOS ESPA - JUNK DEALER PLAZA - DAY

The GROUP comes to a little plaza surrounded by several junk spaceship
dealers.

QUI-GON : We'll try one of the smaller dealers.

They head for a little junk shop that has a huge pile of broken spaceships
stacked up behind it.

INT. WATTO'S JUNK SHOP - DAY

QUI-GON, JAR JAR, PADME, and ARTOO enter the dingy junk shop and are
greeted by WATTO, a pudgy blue alien who flies on short little wings like a
hummingbird.

WATTO : (subtitled) Hi chuba da naga? (What do you want?)
QUI-GON : I need parts for a J-type 327 Nubian.
WATTO : Ah yes, ah yes. Nubian. We have lots of that. What kinda junk?
(subtitled) Peedenkel! Naba dee unko (Boy, get in here! Now!)
QUI-GON : My droid here has a readout of what I need.

A disheveled boy, ANAKIN SKYWALKER, runs in from the junk yard. He is about
nine years old, very dirty, and dressed in rags. WATTO raises a hand, and
ANAKIN flinches.

WATTO : (subtitled) Coona tee-tocky malia? (What took you so long?)
ANAKIN : (subtitled) Mel tassa cho-passa... (I was cleaning the bin like
you...)
WATTO : (subtitled) Chut-Chut! Ganda doe wallya. (Never mind! Watch the
store) Me dwana no bata. (I've got some selling to do here.) (to Gui-Gon)
Soooo, let me take- a thee out back. Ni you'll find what you need.

ARTOO and QUI-GON follow WATTO toward the junk yard, leaving JAR JAR with
PADME and the young boy ANAKIN. JAR JAR picks up a gizmo, trying to figure
out its purpose. QUI-GON takes the part out of his hand and puts it back.

QUI-GON : Don't touch anything.

JAR JAR makes a rude face to QUI-GON's back and sticks out his long tongue.
ANAKIN sits on the counter, pretending to clean a part, staring at PADME.
She is the most beautiful creaure he has ever seen in his life. PADME is a
little embarrassed by his stare, but she musters up an amused smile.
Finally, he gets the courage to speak.

ANAKIN : Are you an angel?
PADME : What?
ANAKIN : An angel. I've heard the deep space pilots talk about them. They
live on the Moons of Iego I thimk. They are the most beautiful creatures in
the universe. They are good and kind, and so pretty they make even the most
hardened spice pirate cry.

PADME looks at him, not knowing what to say. PADME : I've never heard of
angels.

ANAKIN : You must be one...maybe you just don't know it.
PADME : You're a funny little boy. How do you know so much?
ANAKIN : Since I was very little, three, I think. My Mom and I were sold to
Gardulla the Hutt, but she lost us, betting on the Podraces, to Watto,
who's a lot better master than Gardulla, I think.
PADME : You're...a slave?

ANAKIN looks at PADME defiantly.

ANAKIN : I am a person! My name is Anakin.
PADME : I'm sorry. I don't fully understand. (looking around)This is a
strange world to me.

ANAKIN studies her intently.

ANAKIN : You are a strange girl to me.

JAR JAR pushes the nose on what appears to be a LITTLE DROID, and it
instantly comes to life, grows legs and arms, and starts marching around,
knocking over everything. JAR JAR hold on but can't stop it.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Hit the nose!

JAR JAR hits the nose, and the DROID collapses back into its original
state. ANAKIN and PADME laugh. ANAKIN watches PADME straighten her hair.

EXT. WATTO'S JUNK YARD - BEHIND SHOP - DAY

WATTO reads a small portable monitor he is holding. He stands before a
hyperdrive.

WATTO : ...Here it is...a T-14 hyperdrive generator!! Thee in luck, I'm the
only one hereabouts who has one...but thee might as well buy a new ship. It
would be cheaper, I think...Sying of which, how's thee going to pay for all
this?
QUI-GON : I have 20,000 Republic dataries.
WATTO : Republic credits?!? Republic credits are no good out here. I need
something more real...
QUI-GON : I don't have anything else. (raising his hand) But credits will
do fine.
WATTO : No they won'ta. QUI-GON, using his mind power, waves his hand
again.
QUI-GON : Credits will do fine.
WATTO : No, they won'ta. What you think you're some kinda Jedi, waving your
hand around like that? I'm a Toydarian. Mind tricks don'ta work on me-only
money. No money, no parts! No deal! And no one else has a T-14 hyperdrive,
I promise you that.

INT. WATTO'S JUNK SHOP - DAY

JAR JAR pulls a part out of a stack of parts to inspect it, and they all
come tumblimg down. He struggles to catch them, only to knock more down.
ANAKIN and PADME are oblivious.

ANAKIN : ...wouldn't have lasted long if I weren't so good at fixing
things. I'm making my own droid...

QUI-GON hurries into the shop, followed by ARTOO. QUI-GON : We're leaving.
JAR JAR follows QUI-GON. PADME gives ANAKIN a loving look.

PADME : I'm glad I met you,....ah...
ANAKIN : ...Anakin.
PADME : Anakin.
ANAKIN : Anakin Skywalker.
PADME : Padme Naberrie.

PADME turns, and ANAKIN looks sad as he watches her leave.

ANAKIN : I'm glad I met you too.

WATTO enters the junk yard, shaking his head.

WATTO : (subtitled) Ootmians! Tinka me chasa hopoe ma booty na nolia.
(Outlanders! They think because we live so far from the center, we don't
know nothing.)
ANAKIN : (subtitled) La lova num botaffa. (They seemed nice to me.) WATTO :
(subtitled) Fweepa niaga. Tolpa da bunky dunko. (Clean the racks, then you
can go home.)

ANAKIN lets out a "yipee" and runs out the back.

EXT. MOS ESPA - STREET - ALCOVE - DAY

QUI-GON, ARTOO, JAR JAR, and PADME have found a quiet spot between two
buildings. The busy street beyond is filled with dangerous looking
creatures. QUI-GON is talking on his com-link, while JAR JAR nervously
watches the street. OBI-WAN is in the main hold of the Naboo craft.

QUI-GON : ...Obi-Wan, you're sure there isn't anything of value left on
board?
OBI-WAN : (V.O) A few containers of supplies, the Queen's wardrobe, maybe.
Not enough for you to barter with. Not in the ammounts you're talking
about.
QUI-GON : All right. Another solution will present itself. I'll check back.

QUI-GON puts his comlink away and starts out into the main street. JAR JAR
grabs his arm.

JAR JAR : Noah gain...da beings hereabouts cawazy. Wesa be robbed un
crunched.
QUI-GON : Not likely. We have nothing of value, that's our problem.

EXT. MOS ESPA - STREET - MARKET - DAY

QUI-GON, PADME, JAR JAR, and ARTOO move out into the street. JAR JAR is
walking behind the others. They walk by an outdoor cafe filled with a rough
gang of aliens, one of which is especially ugly, SEBULBA, a spider-like
creature. JAR JAR stops for a moment in front of a stall selling dead frogs
hanging on a wire. He looks around to see if anyone is looknig, then sticks
out his tongue, and gets hold of one, pulling it into his mouth.
Unfortunately, the frog is tied tightly to the wire. The vendor suddenly
appears.

VENDOR : Hey, that will be seven truguts!!

JAR JAR opens his mouth in surprise, and the frog snaps away, ricochets
around the market, and lands in Sebulba's soup, splashing him. As JAR JAR
moves away from the VENDOR, SEBULBA jumps up on the table and grabs the
hapless Gungan.

SEBULBA : (subtitled) Chuba!! (You!!) JAR JAR : Who, mesa?? SEBULBA :
(subtitled) Ni chuba na?? (Is this yours??)

SEBULBA holds the frog up to the Gungan threateningly. SEVERAL OTHER
CREATURES start to gather. SEBULBA shoves JAR JAR to the ground. The Gungan
desperately tries to scramble to safety.

JAR JAR : (to himself) Why mesa always da one??
ANAKIN : (V.O) Because you're afraid.

JAR JAR turns to see ANAKNI pushing his way next to him. The boy stands up
to SEBULBA in a very self-assured way.

ANAKIN : (subtitled) Chess ko, Sebulba...Coo wolpa tooney rana. (Careful,
Sebulba...This one's very connected.)

SEBULBA stops his assault on JAR JAR and turns to ANAKIN.

SEBULBA : (subtitled) Tooney rana nu pratta dunko, shag. (Connected?? Whada
you mean, slave?)
ANAKIN : (subtitled) Oh da Hutt...cha porko ootman geesa...me teesa rodda
co pana pee choppa chawa. (As in Hutt...big time outlander, this one... I'd
hate to see you diced before we race again.)
SEBULBA : (subtitled) Neek me chowa, wermo, mo killee ma klounkee(Next time
we race, wermo, it will be the end of you!) Una noto wo shag, me wompity du
pom pom. (If you weren't a slave, I'd squash you right now.)

SEBULBA turns away.

ANAKIN : (subtitled) Eh, chee bana do mullee ra. (Yeah, it'd be a pity if
you had to pay for me.)

QUI-GON, PADME and ARTOO arrive.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Hi! Your buddy here was about to be turned into orange
goo. He picked a fight with a Dug. An especially dangerous Dug called
Sebulba.
JAR JAR : Nosir, nosir. Mesa hate crunchen. Dat's da last ting mesa wanten.
QUI-GON : Nevertheless, the boy is right...you were heading for trouble.
Thank you, my young friend.

PADME looks at ANAKINB and smiles; he smiles back. They start walking down
the crowded street.

JAR JAR : Mesa doen nutten!
ANAKIN : Fear attracts the fearful. He was trying to overcome his fear by
squashing you...be less afraid.
PADME : And that works for you.
ANAKIN : To a point. (he smiles)

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - SPACESHIP - DAY

OBI-WAN stands in front of the Naboo spacecraft as the wind picks up and
begins to whip at his robe. CAPTAIN PANAKA exits the ship and joins him.

OBI-WAN : This storm's going to slow them down.
CAPT. PANAKA : It looks pretty bad. We'd better seal the ship.

CAPTAIN PANAKA'S comlink sounds off.

CAPT. PANAKA : (Cont'd) Yes? CAPT. PANAKA : We'll be right there.

EXT. MOS ESPA - STREET - FRUIT STAND - DAY

ANAKIN and the GROUP stop at a fruit stand run by a jolly, but very poor,
old lady named JIRA.

ANAKIN : How are you feeling today, Jira?
JIRA : The heat's never been kind to me, you know, Annie!
ANAKIN : Guess what? I've found that cooling unit I've been searching for.
It's pretty beat up, but I'll have it fixed up for you in no time, I
promise.
JIRA : You're a fine boy, Annie.
ANAKIN : I'll take four pallies today. (to Padme) You'll like these...

ANAKIN reaches in his pocket and comes up with three coins. He drops one.
QUI-GON picks it up, revealing for a moment, his lightsabre.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Whoops, I thought I had more...Make thgat three, I'm not
hungry.

The wind picks up. SHOP OWNERS are starting to close up their shops as JIRA
gives them their pallies.

JIRA : Gracious, my bones are aching...storm's coming on, Annie. You'd
better get home quick.
ANAKIN : (to QUI-GON) Do you have shelter?
QUI-GON : We'll hed back to our ship.
ANAKIN : Is it far?
PADME : On the outskirts.
ANAKIN : You'll never reach the outskirts in time...sandstorms are very,
very dangerous. Come with me. Hurry!

The GROUP follows ANAKIN as he rushes down the windy street.

EXT. MOS ESPA - SLAVE QUARTERS - STREET - SANDSTORM - DAY

The wind is blowing hard as QUI-GON, JAR JAR, and PADME follow ANAKIN down
the street and into a slave hovel.

INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY

QUI-GON, JAR JAR, ARTOO, and PADME enter a small living space.

ANAKIN : Mom! Mom! I'm home.
JAR JAR : Dissen cozy.

Anakin's mother, SHMI SKYWALKER, a warm, friendly woman of forty, enters
from her work area and is startled to see the room full of people.

SHMI : Oh, my!! Annie, what's this?
ANAKIN : These are my friends, Mom. This is Padme, and...gee, I don't know
any of your names.
QUI-GON : I'm Qui-Gon Jinn, and this is Jar Jar Binks. ARTOO lets out a
little beep.
PADME : ...and our droid, Artoo-Detoo.
ANAKIN : I'm building a droid. You wanna see?
SHMI : Anakin! Why are they here?
ANAKIN : A sandstorm, Mom. Listen.

The wind HOWLS outside.

QUI-GON : Your son was kind enough to offer us shelter.
ANAKIN : Come on! Let me show you Threepio!

ANAKIN leads PADME into the other room. ARTOO follows, beeping all the way.
QUI-GON takes five small capsules from his utility belt and hands them to
SHMI.

QUI-GON : I have enough food for a meal.
SHMI : Oh, tank you. Thank you so much. I'm sorry if I was abrupt. I'll
never get used to Anakin's surprises.
QUI-GON : He's a very special boy. SHMI looks at him as if he's discovered
a secret.
SHMI : Yes, I know.

INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - BEDROOM - DAY

ANAKIN shows off his ANDROID, which is lying on his workbench. There is one
eye in the head; the body, arms, and legs have no outer coverings.

ANAKIN : Isn't he great?! He's not finished yet.
PADME : He's wonderful!
ANAKIN : You reall like him? He's a protocol droid...to help Mom. Watch!

ANAKIN pushes a switch, and the DROID sits up. Anakin rushes around, grabs
an eye and puts it in one of the sockets.

THREEPIO : How do you do, I am See-Threepio, Human Cyborg Relations. How
might I serve you?
PADME : He's perfect.
ANAKIN : When the storm is over, you can see my racer. I'm building a
Podracer!

PADME smiles at his enthusiasm. ARTOO lets out a flurry of beeps and
whistles.

THREEPIO : I beg your pardon....what do you mean I'm naked?

ARTOO BEEPS

THREEPIO : (Cont'd) My parts are showing? Oh, my goodness. How
embarrassing!

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - QUEENS CHAMBERS

AMIDALA, EIRTAE, RABE, and OBI-WAN watch a very bad transmission of a SIO
BIBBLE hologram.

BIBBLE : ...cut off all food supplies until you return...the death toll is
catastrophic...we must bow to their wishes, Your Highness...Please tell us
what to do! If you can hear us, Your Highness, you must contact me...

AMIDALA looks upset...almost nervous.

OBI-WAN : It's a trick. Send no reply... Send no transmission of any kind.

INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY

QUI-GON listens to his comlink. OBI-WAN is in the cockpit.

OBI-WAN : ...the Queen is upset...but absolutly no reply was sent.
QUI-GON : It sounds like bait to establish a connection trace.
OBI-WAN : What if it is true and the people are dying?
QUI-GON : Either way, we're running out of time.

EXT. CORUSCANT - BALCONY OVERLOOKING CITY - NIGHT

DARTH SIDIOUS and DARTH MAUL look out over the vast city.

DARTH MAUL : Tatooine is sparsely populated. If the trace was correct, I
will find them quickly, Master.
DARTH SIDIOUS : Move against the Jedi first...you will then have no
difficulty taking the Queen back to Naboo, where she will sign the treaty.
DARTH MAUL : At last we will reveal ourselves to the Jedi. At last we will
have revenge.
DARTH SIDIOUS : You have been well trained, my young apprentice, they will
be no match for you. It is too late for them to stop us now. Everything is
going as planned. The Republic will soon be in my command.

The hologram of DARTH MAUL fades off as DARTH SIDIOUS looks out over the
city. EXT. MOS ESPA - SANDSTORM - DAY

The giant sandstorm engulfs the town, including the Naboo spaceship on the
outskirts of the city center, where Watto's ship is; and the slave
quarters, where drifts of sand begin building up against Anakin's house.

INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY

QUI-GON, ANAKIN, SHMI, JAR JAR, and PADME are seated around a makeshift
table, having dinner as the wind howls outside.
JAR JAR slurps his soup rather loudly. Everyone looks at him. He turns a
little brighter red.

SHMI : All slaves have transmitters placed inside their bodies somewhere.
ANAKIN : I've been working on a scanner to try and locate them, but no
luck.
SHMI : Any attempt to escape...
ANAKIN : ...and they blow you up...poof!

PADME and JAR JAR are horrified.

JAR JAR : How wude.
PADME : I can't believe there is still slavery in the galaxy. The
Republic's anti-slavery laws...
SHMI : The Republic doesn't exist out here...we must survive on our own.

An awkward silence. ANAKIN attempts to end the embarrassment.

ANAKIN : Have you ever seen a Podrace?

PADME shakes her head no. She notices the concern of SHMI. JAR JAR snatches
some food from a bowl at the other end of the table with his tongue.
QUI-GON gives him a dirty look.

QUI-GON : They have Podracing on Malastare. Very fast, very dangerous.
ANAKIN : I'm the only human who can do it.

SHMI looks askance at her son.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Mom, what? I'm not bragging. It's true. Watto says he's
never heard of a human doing it.
QUI-GON : You must have Jedi reflexes if you race Pods.

ANAKIN smiles. JAR JAR attempts to snare another bit of food from the bowl
with his tongue, but QUI-GON, in a flash, grabs it between his thumb and
forefinger. JAR JAR is startled.

QUI-GON : (Cont'd) Don't do that again.

JAR JAR tries to acknowledge with some silly mumbling. QUI-GON lets go of
the tongue, and it snaps back into JAR JAR's mouth.

ANAKIN : I...I was wondering...something...
QUI-GON : What?
ANAKIN : Well, ahhh...you're a Jedi Knight, aren't you?
QUI-GON : What makes you think that?
ANAKIN : I saw your laser sword. Only Jedi carry that kind of weapon.

QUI-GON leans back and slowly smiles.

QUI-GON : Perhaps I killed a Jedi and stole it from him.
ANAKIN : I don't think so... No one can kill a Jedi Knight.
QUI-GON : I wish that were so...
ANAKIN. I had a dream I was a Jedi. I came back here and freed all the
slaves...have you come to free us?
QUI-GON : No, I'm afraid not...
ANAKIN : I think you have...why else would you be here?

QUI-GON thinks for a moment.

QUI-GON : I can see there's no fooling you...(leans forward) You mustn't
let anyone know about us...we're on our way to Coruscant, the central
system in the Republic, on a very important mission, and it must be kept
secret.
ANAKIN : Coruscant...wow...how did you end up here in the outer rim?
PADME : Our ship was damaged, and we're stranded here until we can repair
it.
ANAKIN : I can help! I can fix anything!
QUI-GON : I believe you can, but our first job is to aquire the parts we
need...
JAR JAR : Wit no-nutten mula to trade.
PADME : These junk dealers must have a weakness of some kind.
SHMI : Gambling. Everything here revolves around betting on those awful
races.
QUI-GON : Podracing... Greed can be a powerful ally.. if it's used
properly.
ANAKIN : I've built a racer! It's the fastest ever...There's a big race
tomorrow, on Boonta Eve. You could enter my pod. It's all but finished...
SHMI : Anakin, settle down. Watto won't let you...
ANAKIN : Watto doesn't know I've built it. (to Qui-Gon) You could make him
think it's your's, and you could get him to let me pilot it for you.

QUI-GON looks to SHMI. She is upset.

SHMI : I don't want you to race, Annie...It's awful. I die every time Watto
makes you do it.

ANAKIN : But Mom, I love it...and they need help...they're in trouble. The
prize money would more than pay for the parts they need. JAR JAR : Wesa ina
pitty bad goo.
GUI-GON : Your mother's right. Is there anyone friendly to the Republic who
might be able to help us?

SHMI shakes her head no.

ANAKIN : We have to help them, Mom...you said that the biggest problem in
the universe is no one helps each other...
SHMI : Anakin, don't...

JAR JAR belches. There is silence for a moment as they eat.

PADME : I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want to put your son in danger. We will
find another way...
SHMI : No, Annie's right, there is no other way... I may not like it, but
he can help you...he was meant to help you.
ANAKIN : Is that a yes? That is a yes!

The storm continues to rage outside the slave hovel.

EXT. MOS ESPA - JUNK DEALER PLAZA - DAY

The storm has passed. VENDORS and STREET PEOPLE clean up the mess and
rebuild their food stalls. JAR JAR sits on a box in front of Watto's parts
shop, watching all the activity with growing nervousness. ARTOO is standing
next to him. PADME stops QUI-GON as he is about to enter the shop.

PADME : Are you sure about this? Trusting our fate to a boy we hardly know.
The Queen will not approve.
QUI-GON : The Queen does not need to know.
PADME : Well, I don't approve.

QUI-GON turns and starts into the shop.

INT. WATTO'S JUNK SHOP - DAY

WATTO and ANAKIN are in the middle of an animated discussion in Huttese.

WATTO : Patta go bolla!
ANKAIN : No batta!
WATTO : Pedunky. Maa kee cheelya.
ANAKIN : Bayno, Bayno!

QUI-GON walks in, and WATTO and ANAKIN join him.

WATTO : The boy tells me you wanta sponser hi insa race. You can't afford
parts. How can you do this? Not on Republic credits, I think. (he laughs)
QUI-GON : My ship will be the entry fee.

QUI-GON pulls a small object that looks like a watch out of his pocket, and
a hologram of the Naboo spacecraft appears about a foot long in front of
WATTO. He studies it.

WATTO : Not bad...not bad...a Nubian.
QUI-GON : It's in good order, except for the parts we need.
WATTO : ...but what would the boy ride? He smashed up my Pod in the last
race. It will take some time to fix it.

ANAKIN is embarrassed and steps forward.

ANAKIN : Ahhhh....it wasn't my fault really...Sebulba flashed me with his
vent ports. I actually saved the Pod...mostly.
WATTO : (laughing) That you did. The boy is good, no doubts there.
QUI-GON : I have...acquired a Pod in a game of chance. "The fastest ever
built."
WATTO : I hope you didn't kill anyone I know for it. (laughs) So, you
supply the Pod and the entry fee; I supply the boy. We split the winnings
fifty-fifty, I think.
QUI-GON : Fifty-fifty!?! If it's going to be fifty-fifty, I suggest you
front the cash for the entry. If we win, you keep all the winnings, minus
the cost of the parts I need...If we lose, you keep my ship.

WATTO thinks about this. ANAKIN tries not to be nervous.

QUI-GON : (Cont'd) Either way, you win.
WATTO : (subtitled) Deal! Yo bana pee ho-tah, meedee ya. (Your friend is a
follish one, methinks.)

EXT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - TATOOINE DESERT - DAY

OBI-WAN stands outside the Naboo spacecraft, speaking into his comlink.
QUI-GON is on the back porch of the hovel.

OBI-WAN : What if this plan fails, Master? We could be stuck here for a
long time.
QUI-GON : (V.O) A ship without a power supply will not get us anywhere, and
there is something about this boy...

EXT MOS ESPA - SLAVE QUARTERS - PORCH - DAY

QUI-GON puts the comlink away as SHMI comes onto the porch

PADME, ANAKIN, JAR JAR, and ARTOO work on the engines of the Podracer in
the courtyard below.

QUI-GON : You should be proud of your son. He gives without any thought of
reward.
SHMI : He knows nothing of greed. He has...
QUI-GON : He has special powers.
SHMI : Yes...
QUI-GON : He can see things before they happen. That's why he appears to
have such quick reflexes. It is a Jedi trait.
SHMI : He deserves better than a slave's life.
QUI-GON : The Force is unusally strong with him, that much is clear. Who
was his father?
SHMI : There was no father, that I know of...I carried him, I gave him
birth...I can't explain what happened. Can you help him?
QUI-GON : I'm afraid not. Had he been born in the Republic, we would have
identified him early, and he would have become Jedi, no doubt...he has the
way. But it's too late for him now, he's too old.

EXT. MOS ESPA - SLAVE QUARTERS - BACK YARD - DAY

KITSTER (a young boy about Anakin's age), SEEK (a boy of ten), AMEE (a girl
of six), and WALD (a Greedo Type, six years old) join ANAKIN, JAR JAR,
ARTOO, and PADME securing some wiring.

ANAKIN : Padme and Jar Jar, this is my friend Kitster, and seek, Amee, and
Wald.

All whistle, hoot, and speak a greeting.

KITSTER : Wow, a real Astro Droid...how'd you get so lucky?
ANAKIN : This isn't the half of it. I'm entered in the Boonta Race
tomorrow!
KITSTER : What? With this??
WALD : (subtitled) Annie, Jesko na joka. 9You are such a joke, Annie.)
AMEE : You've been working on that thing for years. It's never going to
run.
SEEK : Come on, let's go play ball. Keep it up, Annie, and you're gonna be
bug squash.

SEEK, WALD, and AMEE take off, laughing. JAR JAR is fiddling with one of
the energy binder plates.

ANAKIN : Hey! Jar Jar! Stay away from those energy binders...
JAR JAR : Who, mesa?
ANAKIN : If your hand gets caught in that beam, it will go numb for hours.

JAR JAR peeks at the energy plate; it makes a little electronic pop, zaps
him in the mouth and jumps back. JAR JAR tries to say something, but his
mouth is numb and his words are garbled.

JAR JAR : Ouch-dats muy bigo Oucho. (Gibberish)
KITSTER : But you don't even know if this thing will run.
ANAKIN : It will.

QUI-GON approaches the GROUP and gives ANAKIN a small battery. JAR JAR gets
his hand caught in the afterburner and tries to tell Anakin, but can't get
words out that make sense.

QUI-GON : I think it's time we found out. Use this power charge. ANAKIN :
Yes, sir!!

ANAKIN jumps into the little capsule behind the two giant engines. He puts
the power pack back into the dashboard. EVERYONE backs away, except for JAR
JAR who calls for help. Finally PADME frees him and the engines ignite with
a ROAR. EVERYONE cheers.

EXT. MOS ESPA - SLAVE QUARTERS - PORCH - DAY

SHMI, watching from the porch, smiles sadly.

EXT. SLAVE QUARTERS - BALCONY - NIGHT

ANAKIN sits on the balcony rail of his hovel as QUI-GON tends to a cut. The
BOY leans back to look at the vast blanket of stars in the sky.

QUI-GON : Sit still, Annie. Let me clean this cut.
ANAKIN : There are so many! Do they all have a system of planets?
QUI-GON : Most of them.
ANAKIN : Has anyone been to them all?
QU-IG0N : (laughs) Not likely.
ANAKIN : I want to be the first one to see them all... Ouch!

QUI-GON wipes a patch of blood off ANAKIN'S arm.

QUI-GON : There, good as new...

SHMI yells from inside the hovel.

SHMI : (O.S.) Annie, bedtime!

QUI-GON scrapes ANAKIN's blood onto a comlink chip.

ANAKIN : What are you doing?
QUI-GON : Checking your blood for infections.
ANAKIN : I've never seen...
SHMI : (O.S.) Annie! I'm not goiung to tell you again!
QUI-GON : Go on, you have a big day tomorrow. (beat) Goodnight.

ANAKIN rolls his eyes and runs into the hovel. QUI-GON takes the blood
stained chip and inserts it into the comlink, then calls OBI-WAN.

QUI-GON : (Cont'd) Obi-Wan...
OBI-WAN : Yes, Master.
QUI-GON : Make an analysis of this blood sample I'm sending you.
OBI-WAN : Wait a minute...
QUI-GON : I need a midi-chlorian count.
OBI-WAN : All right. I've got it.
QUI-GON : What are your readings?
OBI-WAN : Something must be wrong with the transmission.
QUI-GON : Here's a signal check.
OBI-WAN : Strange. The transmission seems to be in good order, but the
reading's off the chart...over twenty thousand.
QUI-GON : (almost to himself) That's it then.
OBI-WAN : Even Master Yoda doesn't have a midi-chlorian count that high!
QUI-GON : No Jedi has.
OBI-WAN : What does it mean?
QUI-GON : I'm not sure.

The JEDI KNIGHT looks up and sees SHMI in the doorway watching him.
Embarrassed, she goes back into the kitchen while QUI-GON ponders the
situation.

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT MESA - NIGHT

The sinister looking Sith spacecraft lands on top of a desert mesa at dus,
scattering a herd of banthas. DARTH MAUL walks to the edge of the mesa and
studies the landscape with a pair of electrobinoculars. He picks out the
lights of three different cities in the distance, then pushes buttons on
his electronic armband.

Six football-sized PROBE DROIDS float out of the ship and head off in three
different directions toward the cities.

DARTH MAUL stands on the mesa and watches them through his
electrobinoculars.

EXT. MOS ESPA - SLAVE QUARTERS - PORCH - SUNRISE

Padme exits the hovel.

EXT. MOS ESPA - SLAVE QUARTERS - BACK YARD - SUNRISE

As the twin suns rise, ARTOO is busy painting the racing Pod. ANAKIN is
asleep. PADME passes ARTOO.

PADME : I hope you're about finished.

ARTOO whistles a positive reply. PADME sees KITSTER riding toward them on
an EOPIE, a strange camel-lile creature. He is leading a second EOPIE
behind him. PADME goes over to ANAKIN. He looks very vulnerable as he
sleeps. She watches him, then touches him on the cheek. ANAKIN wakes up,
yawns, and looks at her, a little puzzled.

ANAKIN : You were in my dream...you were leading a huge army into battle.
PADME : I hope not; I hate fighting. Your mother wants you to come in and
clean up. We have to leave soon. ANAKIN stands up and stretches just as
KITSTER arrives.

ANAKIN : Hook 'em up, Kitster. (to Padme) I won't be long. Where's Qui-Gon?

PADME : He and Jar Jar left already. They're with Watto at the arena.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY

RACE CREWS mill about outside the Main Hanger.

INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY

The hanger is a large building with a dozen or so Podracers being readied
for the race. ALIEN CREWS and PILOTS rush about, making last minute fixes
on their vehicles. WATTO, QUI-GON, and JAR JAR walk through the activity.

WATTO : ...I want to see your spaceship the moment the race is over.
QUI-GON : Patienc, my blue friend. You'll have your winnings before the
suns set, and we'll be far away from here.
WATTO : Not if your ship belongs to me, I think...I warn you, no funny
business.
QUI-GON : You don't think Anakin will win?

WATTO stops before an orange racer. Sitting to one side, having his
shoulders and neck massaged by TWIN YOBANAS, is SEBULBA.

WATTO : Don't get me wrongo. I have great faith in the boy. He's a credit
to your race, but Sebulba there is going to win, I think.
QUI-GON : Why?
WATTO : He always wins. (laughs) I'm betting heavily on Sebulba.
QUI-GON : I'll take that bet.
WATTO : (suddenly stops laughing) What??!! What do you mean?
QUI-GON : I'll wager my new racing pod against...say...the boy and his
mother.
WATTO : A Pod for slaves. I don't think so...well, poerhaps. Just one...the
mother, maybe...the boy isn't for sale.
QUI-GON : The boy is small, he can't be worth much.

WATTO shakes his head.

QUI-GON : (Cont'd) For the fastest Pod ever built?!

WATTO shakes his head again.

QUI-GON : (Cont'd) Both, or no bet.
WATTO : No Pod's worth two slaves...not by a long shot...one slave or
nothing.
QUI-GON : The boy, then...

WATTO pulls out a small cube from his pocket.

WATTO : We'll let fate decide. Blue it's the boy, red his mother...

WATTO tosses the cube down. QUI-GON lifts his hand slightly; it turns blue.
QUI-GON smiles. WATTO is angry.

WATTO : (Cont'd) You won the small toss, outlander, bou you won't win the
race, so...it makes little difference.

ANAKIN and PADME enter the hanger on one of the EOPIES, pulling an engine.
KITSTER, on the other EOPIE, is pulling another engine. With THREEPIO
walking alongside, ARTOO trundles behind, pulling the Pod with SHMI sitting
on it. WATTO passes ANAKIN as he leaves.

WATTO : (Cont'd) (subtitled) Bonapa keesa pateeso, o wanna meetee chobodd.
(Better stop your friends betting, or I'll end up owning him, too.)

WATTO walks off, laughing.

ANAKIN : What did he mean by that?

QUI-GON : I'll tell you later.

ARTOO beeps at THREEPIO.

THREEPIO : Oh my! Space travel sounds rather perilous.

ARTOO emits a series of beeps.

THREEPIO : I can assure you they will never get me onto one of those
dreadful starships!
KITSTER : (to Anakin) This is so wizard! I'm sure you'll do it this time,
Annie.
PADME : Do what?
KITSTER : Finish the race, of course!
PADME : You've never won a race?
ANAKIN : Well...not exactly...
PADME : Not even finished?!

ANAKN looks sheepish.

ANAKIN : ...but Kitster's right, I will this time.
QUI-GON : Of course you will.

EXT. MOS ESPA - STREET - DAY

One of Darth Maul's PROBE DROIDS slowly floats down the main street of
Tatooine. It looks in shops and studies PEOPLE as it searches for OBI-WAN,
QI-GON, or the QUEEN.

EXT. MOS ESPA - DESERT RACE ARENA - DAY

An EXTREME HIGH WIDE ANGLE reveals a vast arena in the Tatooine desert. A
large semi-circular amphitheatre that holds at least a hundred thousand
people dominates the landscape. Large viewing platforms loom over the
racetrack. INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA ANNOUNCER'S BOX - DAY (FX)

A two-headed ANNOUNCER describes the scene.

FODE/BEED : -
A: Toogi! Toogie! (Greetings) Toong mee cha kulkah du Boonta magi! tah oos

classic. The most hazardous of all Podraces.)
B : That's absolutly right. And a big turnout here, from all corners of the
Outer Rim territories. I see the contestants are making their way out onto
the starting grid.

EXT. MOS ESPA - DESERT RACE ARENA - DAY

On the left side of the tracks across from the grandstands, a line of
Podracers emerges from the large hanger, surrounded by several CREW
MEMBERS. Pods are pulled by a wide variety of CREATURES and are led by
aliens carrying flags. The PILOTS stand facing the royal box.

FODE/BEED : -
(O.S) A : La Yma beestoo (Yes, there they are!)
B : I see Ben Quadinaros from the Tund system.
A : ...eh Gasgano doowa newpa Ord Petrovia! (And Gasgano in thenew Ord

Pixelito. By far the favorite today.)
B : And a late entry, Anakin Skywalker, a local boy.
A : Wampa peedunkee unko ( I hope he has better luck this time.)
B : I see the flaggers are moving onto the track.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - GRANDSTAND - DAY

Colorful canopies shade some of the SPECTATORS. VENDORS sell barbecued
creature parts and colorful drinks.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - ROYAL BOX - DAY (FX)

All the PILOTS bow from the waist as JABBA THE HUTT enters the box and
waves to the crowd.

FODE/BEED : -
A : O grandio lust, Jabba Du Hutt, amu intoe tah parena. (His honor, our
glorious host, Jabba the Hutt has entered the arena.)

The crowd ROARS. SEVERAL OTHER SLUG-LIKE HUTTS follow, along with humans
and aliens. Several SLAVE GIRLS on a chain are led alongside JABBA.

JABBA : (subtitled) Chowbaso! Tam ka chee Boonta rulee ya, kee madda

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - STARTING GRID - DAY

SEBULBA, who is right next to ANAKIN, stands and waves to his fans. A small
pep band plays as his fans wave and cheer.

KITSTER attaches the giant engins to Anakin's Pod with a long cable. SHMI
gives ANAKIN a big hug and kiss. She looks him right in the eye.

SHMI : Be safe.
ANAKIN : I will, Mom. I promise.

She leaves as ANAKIN checks the cable hitches.

JABBA : ...Mawhonic tuta Hok, Teemto Pagalies tuta Moonus Mandel, Anakin
SKywalker tuta Tatoonine....

The CROWD YELLS. ANAKIN waves to the crowd, as JABBA continues with his
introductions. SEBULBA moves over to one of Anakin's engines. KITSTER and
JAR JAR unhitch the EOPIES, and KITSTER leads them away. ARTOO beeps that
everything is OK. JAR JAR pats ANAKIN on the back.

JAR JAR : Dis berry loony, Annie. May da guds be kind, mesa palo.

PADME comes up and gives ANAKIN a little kiss on the cheeek. SEBULBA bangs
on a part protruding from Anakin's engine. He looks around to see if anyone
has noticed.

PADME : You carry all our hopes.
ANAKIN : I won't let you down.

PADME moves away as SEBULBA edges his way next to ANAKIN and gives him a
sinister grin.

SEBULBA : Bazda wahota, shag. Dobiella Nok. Yoka to Bantha poodoo. 9You
won't walk away from this one, slave scum! You're Bantha poodoo.)
ANAKIN : (subtitled) Cha skrundee da pat, sleemo. (Don't count on it,
slime-ball.)

ANAKIN looks the evil SEBULBA in the eye with a cold stare. QUI-GON
approaches, and SEBULBA backs off toward his racer.

JABBA : (sutitled)...Ka bazza kundee hodrudda! (...Let the challenge
begin!)

The CROWD lets out a LOUD CHEER. QUI-GON helps ANAKIN into his Pod. The boy
straps himself into the tiny racer.

QUI-GON : Are you all set, Annie? (Anakin nods) Remember, concentrate on
the moment. Feel. Don't think. Trust your instincts. (he smiles) May the
Force be with you.

QUI-GON steps away as ANAKIN puts on his goggles. The PILOTS flip switches,
and powerful energy binders shoot between the engines. ANAKIN flips a
switch, and his engine starts. The incredible ROAR of high-powered engines
igniting echoes throughout the arena. One driver, ODY MANDRELL, yells at a
droid (DUM-4) to get away from the front of his engine. The crowd is tense.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - STARTING GRID - DAY

The giant power-house engines torque as the PILOTS gun them. The PILOTS
flip switches, and poerful energy binders shoot between the engines. Aliens
carrying large flags move off the track. JAR JAR covers his eyes.

JAR JAR : Mesa no watch. Dissen ganna be messy!
FODE/BEED : -
A : Ya pawa culka doe rundee! (The power couplings are being activated)
B : Hey, it looks like they're clearing the grid.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - VIEWING PLATFORM - DAY

SHMI looks nervously to QUI-GON as he enters a veiwing platform. PADME and
JAR JAR are already on board. The platform rises like an elevator.

SHMI : Is he nervous?
QUI-GON : He's fine.
PADME : You Jedi are far too reckless. The Queen...
QUI-GON : The Queen trusts my judgment, young handmaiden. You should too.
PADME : You assume too much.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA ANNOUNCER'S BOX - DAY (FX)

FODE/BEED : -
B : Start your engines.

The earth-pounding ROAR of the engines revving is deafening.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - ROYAL BOX - DAY (FX)

Jabba bites off the head of a frog and spits it at a gong, signaling the
start of the race.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - STARTING GRID - DAY

On a bridge over the track, a great green light at the center flashes. The
Podracers shoot forward with a high-pitches scream. ANAKIN'S engine floods
and coughs - then dies. All the other Podracers except one swerve around
him and dissapear down the track. The slave boy struggles to get his racer
started. The two-headed announcer reports.

FODE/BEED : - (O.S.)
A : An dare ovv! (And they're off!)
B : Oh...wait. Little Skywalker has stalled.

PADME and JAR JAR are very dissapointed with ANAKIN. QUI-GON puts his arm
around a very worried SHMI to comfort her. Finally, Anakin's engines
ignite. He zooms away after the receeding pack of competitors, leaving one
quadra-Pod racer still trying to get started. The two-headed ANNOUNCER
describes the race as it progresses.

FODE/BEED : - (O.S.)
B : And there goes Skywalker... He'll be hard pressed to catch up with the
leaders today.

EXT. MOS ESPA - RACETRACK - DAY (FX)

The Podracers fly across the desert. SEBULBA is running neck and neck with
MAWHONIC. They round the first turn in the track, side by side. SEBULBA
drives his Pod into his rival, forcing him into the wall of a large rock
formation. MAWHONIC crashes in a spectacular display of fire and smoke.
ANAKIN is much faster than the back-end stragglers and passes them easily.
One of the drivers, GASGANO, won't let ANAKIN by. ANAKIN tries to pass him
on one side and is cut off. He then tries to pass him on the other side
ansd is cut off. As they come up on a cliff drop-off, ANAKIN backs off,
then guns it as GASGANO goes over the cliff. ANAJIN accelerates so fast
that he sails right over the top of GASGANO and speeds away.
Four TUSKEN RAIDERS perched above the race course fire their rifles at the
Pods racing in the canyon below them. One shot ricochets off the back of
Anakin's Pod.

FODE/BEED : -
B : Looks like a few Tusken Riaders have campe out on the canyon dune turn.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - VIEWING PLATFORM - DAY

JABBA THE HUTT and the crowd watch the progress of the race on small,
hand-held view screens. JAR JAR is looking over the shoulder of a strange
alien named FANTA.

JAR JAR : Where's Skywalker?

FANTA moves the view screen out of Jar Jar's view. PADME, SHMI, and QUI-GON
watch another screen and look worried.
ARTOO, down in the pits with KITSTER, lets out a worried sigh. The driver
of the quadra-Pod looks worried.

EXT. MOS ESPA - RACETRACK - DAY (FX)

ANAKIN is powering around corners and over hills and cliffs, passing other
racers right and left. SEBULBA is in the lead. He is being challenged by
another racer, XELBREE.
SEBULBA slows a little, and as XELBREE pulls alongside, he opens a side
vent on the racer's engine and the exhaust starts to cut through the
alien's engine.
The blast cuts along the engine until finally it EXPLODES. SEBULBA deftly
veers away.
ANAKIN works his way through a dense mass of racers as they zoom over a
dune sea, kicking up dust. His Pod shakes violently as he goes over a jump.
One of the Podracers, ODY, catches one of his engines in the sand, and the
whole thing EXPLODES.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - VIEWING PLATFORM - DAY

QUI-GON sits quietly, meditating. PADME and SHMI search the landscape for
any sign of the racers. JAR JAR is still annoying FANTA for information.
The crowd SCREAMS. WATTO is laughing with his friends, confident in
Anakin's defeat.
The quadra-Pod engines start just as the racers come around the corner. The
DRIVER, BEN QUADINAROS, puts it in gear, and the four engines go off in all
directions, EXPLODING in a spectacular display. The Pod drops to the ground
as SEBULBA enters the arena, closely followed by all the OTHER RACERS.
KITSTER strains to see as ARTOO beeps excitedly. The announcer continues.

FODE/BEED : - (O.S)
B ; There goes Quadinaros' power couplings.
A : Sebulba! Ka pa me cheespa wata! (Here comes Sebulba in record time.)

QUI-GON, PADME, SHMI, and JAR JAR yell for joy as ANAKIN passes. JAR JAR is
very nervous and pounds on the back of his alien neighbor, FANTA. JAR JAR :
What gooie-on?
FANTA : Bug off.

Lap two. SEBULBA and the pack race past the main arena. The crowd stands
and YELLS as the Podracers scream off into the distance. QUI-GON and PADME
look worried.

JAR JAR : He musta crash-ud.
PADME : Here he comes!

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - PIT AREA - DAY (FX)

ARTOO lets out an excited whistle, as KITSTER yells.

THREEPIO : He has to complete two more circuits? Oh dear!

EXT. MOS ESPA - RACETRACK - DAY (FX)

Sure enough, coming around the bend is ANAKIN, quickly gaining on the pack.
The two-headed announcer describes the action. The crowd goes wild.

FODE/BEED : - (O.S.)
B : It looks like Skywalker is moving up through the field. He's in...
A : Steeth pa nagoola! (Sixth place, not bad.)

ANAKIN continues to gain on the pack. Tension for SHMI and PADME is
unbearable.
ODY stops in the pits. Droids work on his engines. DUM-4 stands in front of
the engine and is sucked in, causing the engine to die. DUM-4 is spit out
the back of the engine, very bent up. The engine lets out one final wheeze,
then EXPLODES in a puff of smoke.

FODE/BEED : - (O.S.)
A : Ody Mandrell! Coona wa wunda dunko! (Ody Mandrell into the pits for
some attention.)
ODY : Droids!

TERTER is getting close to SEBULBA, who purposely breaks a small part off
his Pod, sending it into Terter's engine, causing him to veer into ANAKIN,
and unhooks one of the main straps on Anakin's engines that links the Pod
to his engines.
ANAKIN struggles to keep control of the little Pod. It whips about wildly.
As the Pod swings near the broken engine strap, ANAKIN grabs for it.
Finally, he catches the strap and manages to unhook it to the Pod.
SEBULBA cuts the engine of OBITOKI with his side exhaust, and the racer
crashes with a cloud of dust. A THIRD RACER, HABBA, flie into the cloud of
dust and crashes into OBITOKI. ANAKIN rounds a corner and heads into the
cloud of smoke. He hits a part of one of the engines but regains control.

FODE/BEED : - (O.S.)
B :At the start of the third and final lap, Sebulba is in the lead, closely
followed by Skywalker...

ANAKIN finally catches up with SEBULBA, and runs neck and neck over the
rough terrain. JAR JAR, QUI-GON, SHMI, and PADME all SCREAM s ANAKIN comes
through the arena. The lights in the tower indicate that this is the third
and last lap. WATTO begins to worry.
SEBULBA uses his side exhaust port to try to cut through Anakin's engines.
ANAKIN manages to avoid having his engine disabled but is forced off
course.

FODE/BEED : - (O.S.)
B : Skywalker is forced onto the service ramp!
A : Oh noah!

On a tight corner, ANAKIN dives to the inside and takes the lead.

FODE BEED : - (O.S.)
B : Amazing... a controlled thrust and he's back on course! What a move!

SEBULBA is furious. He stay's right on Anakin's tail, crowding him and
pushing him through the turns.
SEBULBA pushes ANAKIN harder, and the young boy has a difficult time
keeping control. One of the parts on Anakin's engines begins to shake
loose. ANAKIN sees it and switches over to an auxiliary system. While he is
trying to accomplish this maneuver, SEBULBA races past him.
ANAKIN tries to get around SEBULBA, to no avail. Every move ANAKIN makes,
SEBULBA is able to block.
Finally, ANAKIN fakes a move into the inside as he usually does, then tries
to go around SEBULBA on the outside. They race sid by side down the final
stretch of the track.

FODE/BEED : - (O.S.)
B : He's catching Sebulba.
A : Inkabunga. (Incredible!)

SEBULBA veers toward ANAKIN and bangs into his Pod. He crashes into ANAKIN
over and over. The young boy struggles to maintain control as the steering
rods on the two Pods become hooked together. SEBULBA laughs at ANAKIN.

FODE/BEED : - (O.S.)
B : That little human being is out of his mind.
A : Punda tah punda! (They're neck and neck!)
B : They're side by side!
A : Bongo du bongu! (Shoulder to shoulder!)

As they head for the final stretch, ANAKIN fights to unlock the steering
rods by trying to pull away from SEBULBA. The strain on the steering rod is
tremendous. Suddenly, ANAKIN's steering arm breaks, and his Pos starts
spinning.
The release of tension sends SEBULBA into an ancient statue. One engine
EXPLODES, then the other. SEBULBA skids through the fire-balls, blackened,
but unhurt. He slides to a smoking stop, gets out of his racer, and throws
what's left of a shifter arm on the ground. Suddenly he realizes his pants
are on fire, and he struggles to put them out. ANAKIN flies through the
EXPLOSION as the crowd stands, CHERRING. PADME and JAR JAR jump up and down
with excitment, PADME screaming for joy. ARTOO and KITSTER whistle
hysterically. QUI-GON and SHMI smile. ANAKIN races over the finish line,
the winner.

INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA ANNOUNCERS BOX - DAY (FX)

The two-headed announcer excitedly calls the finish.

FODE/BEED : -
B : It's Skywalker! The crowd are going nuts! Oh Ah Oh Ah (rock head in
tandem with partner)

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - DAY

As ANAKIN stops the Podracer, KISTER turns up, and they embrace. Hundreds
of SPECTATORS join them and put ANAKIN on their shoulders, marching off,
CHEERING AND CHANTING. Darth Maul's PROBE DROIDS move through the crowd.

INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - PRIVATE BOX - DAY

Several ALIENS leave Watto's box, laughing and counting their money. WATTO
sees QUI-GON standing in the doorway.

WATTO : You! You swindled me! You knew the boy was going to win! Somehow
you knew it! I lost everything.

WATTO flies up to QUI-GON and puts his face right up against QUI-GON's.
QUI-GON simply smiles.

QUI-GON : Whenever you gamble, my freind, eventually you'll lose. Bring the
parts to the main hanger. I'll come by your shop later so you can release
the boy.
WATTO : You can't have him! It wasn't a fair bet!
QUI-GON : Would you like to discuss it with the Hutts...I'm sure they can
settle this.
WATTO : No, no! I want no more of your tricks! Take him!

The SITH PROBE DROID watches with great interest.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY

The Main Hanger is almost deserted as RACERS depart.

INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY

JAR JAR gives ANAKIN a great hug, then PADME gives him a hug, then SHMI.

ANAKIN : Ah, gee...enough of this...
SHMI : It's so wonderful, Annie. You have brought hope to those who have
none. I'm so very proud of you...
PADME : We owe you everything.
ANAKIN : Just feeling this good was worth it.

In the background, QUI-GON has harnessed the EOPIES to containers full of
parts.

QUI-GON : Padme. Jar Jar, let's go, we've got to get these parts back to
the ship.

The GROUP walks over to QUI-GON and the EOPIES.
PADME climbs on behind QUI-GON. JAR JAR swings up onto the second EOPIE,
only to slwly slide off the other side. ARTOO whistles. ANAKIN and SHMI
wave as they ride off.

QUI-GON : (Cont'd) I'll return the eopies by midday.

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - NABOO SPACECRAFT - DAY

ARTOO cruises ahead of QUI-GON and PADME, who are riding one of the EOPIES;
JAR JAR ridses the other. They stop in front of the sleek Naboo spacecraft.
OBI-WAN comes out of the ship and joins them.

QUI-GON : Start getting this hyperdrive generator installed. I'm going
back...some unfinished business. I won't be long.
OBI-WAN : Why do I sense we've picked up another pathetic life form...?
QUI-GON : It's the boy who's responsible for getting those parts.

On a hill far overlooking the Naboo spacecraft, the SITH PROBE DROID turns
and speeds away.

EXT. TATOOINE - STREET - SLAVE QUARTERS - DAY

ANAKIN and A GREEDO are rolling around on the floor, fighting. About A
DOZEN OR SO KIDS are standing around them, yelling. Suddenly, a long shadow
is cast over the TWO BOYS; they stop fighting and look up. QUI-GOMN is
towering above them. KITSTER is with them.

QUI-GON : What's this?
ANAKIN : He said I cheated.
QUI-GON : Did you?
ANAKIN : No!
QUI-GON : Do you still think he cheated?
GREEDO : Yes.
QUI-GON : Well, Annie. You know the truth... You will have to tolerate his
opinion, fighting won't change it.

QUI-GON moves off down the street. Anakin follows. The GREEDO wanders over
to WALD who has been watching the goings-on.

WALD : Keep this up, Greedo, and you're gonna come to a bad end.

Farther down the street QUI-GON and ANAKIN head toward Anakin's hovel.
QUI-GON takes a handful of credits from beneath his poncho and hands them
to the boy.

QUI-GON : These are yours. We sold the Pod.
ANAKIN : (suddenly beaming) Yes!

INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY

SHMI is cleaning up as ANAKIN bursts through the door, followed by QUI-GON.

ANAKIN : Mom, he sold the Pod. Look at all the money we have!

ANAKIN pulls a bag of coins out of his pocket.

SHMI : Oh, my goodness, That's wonderful.
QUI-GON : And Anakin has been freed.
ANAKIN : What?!?
QUI-GON : You're no longer a slave.

ANAKIN jumps for joy! SHMI is stunned.

ANAKIN : Did you hear that, Mom? (to Qui-Gon) Was that part of the prize,
or what?
QUI-GON : Let's just say Watto has learned an important lesson about
gambling.
SHMI : Now you can make your dreams come true, Annie. You're free! (turns
to Qui-Gon) Will you take him with you? Is he to become a Jedi?
QUI-GON : Our meeting was not a coincidence. Nothing happens by accident.
You are strong with the Force, but you may not be accepted by the Coucil.
ANAKIN : A Jedi! Mighty blasters, you mean I get to go with you in your
starship and everything?!

QUI-GON kneels down to the boy.

QUI-GON : Anakin, training to be a Jedi will not be a easy challenge. And
if you succeed, it will be a hard life.
ANAKIN : But it's what I want. What I've always dreamed about. Can I go,
Mom?!
QUI-GON : This path has been placed for you, Annie; the choice to take it
is yours alone.

ANAKIN thinks, looks to his mother, then to QUI-GON.

ANAKIN : I want to go.
QUI-GON : Then, pack your things. We haven't much time.
ANAKIN : Yipee!!

ANAKIN hugs his mom and starts for the other room, then stops. SHMI and
QUI-GON give each other a knowing look. ANAKIN has realized something.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) What about Mom? Is she free too? You're coming, aren't
you, Mom
QUI-GON : I tried to free your mother, Annie, but Watto wouldn't have it.
ANAKIN : But the money from selling...
QUI-GON : It's not nearly enough.

SHMI comes over to her son and sits next to him. Taking both of his hands
in hers, she draws him close.

SHMI : Son, my place is here. My future is here. It is time for you to let
go...to let go of me. I cannot go with you.
ANAKIN : I want to stay with you. I don't want things to change.
SHMI : You can't stop change any more than you can stop the suns from
setting. Listen to your feelings; Annie, you know what's right.

ANAKIN takes a deep breath, drops his head. QUI-GON and SHMI exchange a
look of concern. When ANAKIN raises up, there are tears in his eyes.

ANAKIN : I'm going to miss you so much, Mom...
SHMI : I love you, Annie...now hurry.

ANAKIN and SHMI hug. ANAKIN runs into the other room.

SHMI : (Cont'd) Thank you.
QUI-GON : I will watch after him. You have my word. Will you be all right?
SHMI : He was in my life for such a short time.

INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - SECOND ROOM - DAY

ANAKIN has thrown the last of his things in a small backpack. As he leaves,
he stops and pushes the button that wakes his droid up. THREEPIO stares at
him blankly.

ANAKIN : Well, Threepio, I'm free...and I'm going away...in a starship...
THREEPIO : Master, Annie, you are my maker, and I wish you well. Although
I'd like it better if I were a little less naked.
ANAKIN : I'm sorry I wasn't able to finish you, Threepio...give you
coverings and all... I'm going to miss working on you. You've been a great
pal. I'll make sure Mom doesn't sell you or anything. Bye.

THREEPIO stares at ANAKIN as he rushes out of the room.

THREEPIO : Sell me?!?

EXT. MOS ESPA - STREET - SLAVE QUARTERS - DAY

KITSTER runs up to ANAKIN as he and QUI-GON exit Anakin's hovel. SHMI
stands in the doorway. ANAKIN pulls a handful of coins out of his pocket
and gives them to KITSTER.

KITSTER : There are so many of us who want you to stay, Annie... You're a
hero.
ANAKIN : I... (looks to SHMI) I... have to go.

QUI-GON has moved a short way down the street.

KITSTER : Well.
ANAKIN : Well.
KITSTER : Thank's for every moment you've been here. You're my best friend.
ANAKIN : I won't forget.

ANAKIN hugs KITSTER and runs toward QUI-GON, then stops to look back at his
mother standing in the doorway. He turns back to QUI-GON, then turns and
runs back to his mother.

ANAKIN : (starting to cry) I can't do it, Mom. I just can't.

SHMI hugs ANAKIN. QUI-GON watches from the distance. She kneels down and
looks him in the face.

SHMI : Annie, remember when you climbed the great dune in order to chase
the Banthas away so they wouldn't be shot... Remember how you collapses
several times, exhausted thinking you couldn't do it?

ANAKIN shakes his head.

SHMI : (Cont'd) This is one of those times when you have to do something
you don't think you can do. I know how strong you are, Annie. I know you
can do this...
ANAKIN : Will I ever see you again?
SHMI : What does your heart tell you?
ANAKIN : I hope so...yes...I guess.
SHMI : Then we will see each other again.
ANAKIN : I.. will become a Jedi and I will come back and free you, Mom...I
promise.
SHMI : No matter where you are, my love will be with you. Now be brave, and
don't look back... don't look back.
ANAKIN : I love you so much.

SHMI hugs ANAKIN, then turns him around so he is facing QUI-GON, and off he
marches, like the brave little trooper that he is. He marches right past
QUI-GON, starring right ahead, tears in his eyes, determined not to look
back.

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT MESA - DAY

The PROBE DROID beeps and whistles to DARTH MAUL. The SITH LORD gets on a
speeder bike and follows the PROBE DROID into Mos Espa.

EXT MOS ESPA - STREET - FRUIT STAND - DAY

ANAKIN and QUI-GON exit WATTO'S and stop before JIRA'S fruit stand. ANAKIN
hands JIRA some coins.

ANAKIN : I've been freed, and I'm going away. Buy yourself a cooling unit
with this... Otherwise I'll worry about you.

JIRA is astonished. She stares, not knowing what to say.

JIRA : Can I give you a hug
ANAKIN : Sure.

She gives him a hug.

JIRA : I'll miss you, Annie.. there isn't a kinder boy in the galaxy. You
be careful...

ANAKIN runs to join QUI-GON, who has already started down the street. As
they walk along together, QUI-GON notices something out of the corner of
his eye.
Suddenly, without breaking his stride, he ignites his laser sword, swing
around, and lunges forward and cuts a lurking PROBE DROID in half. QUI-GON
inspects the sparking and fizzing DROID.

ANAKIN : What is it?
QUI-GON : Probe droid. Very unusual... not like anything I've seen before.
Come on.

QUI-GON and ANAKIN start running.

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - NABOO SPACECRAFT - DAY

QUI-GON and ANAKIN run toward the Naboo spacecraft. ANAKIN is having a hard
time keeping up.

ANAKIN : Master Qui-Gon,sir, wait!

QUI-GON turns to answer and sees a DARK-CLOAKED FIGURE bearing down on a
speeder bike.

QUI-GON : Anakin, drop!

ANAKIN drops to the ground just as DARTH MAUL sweeps over him. DARTH MAUL
jumps off his speeder bike, and before he has hit the ground, the Sith Lord
has swund a death blow with his laser sword that is barely blocked by
QUI-GON.
ANAKIN picks himself up. The two galactic warriors, Sith and Jedi, are
bashing each other with incredible blows. They move in a continual cloudof
dust, smashing everything around them. This is a fierce fight. ANAKIN gets
up, bewildered by the confrontation.

QUI-GON : (Cont'd) Annie, get to the ship! Take off! Go! Go!

QUI-GON struggles to fend off the relentless onslaught as ANAKIN races to
the ship.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - HALLWAY

ANAKIN runs into the main hallway of the spaceship, where PADME and CAPTAIN
PANAKA are working.

ANAKIN : Qui-Gon's in trouble. He says to take off...now!!
CAPT. PANAKA : Who are you?
PADME : He's a friend.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - COCKPIT

CAPTAIN PANAKA, ANAKIN, and PADME rush into the cockpit where OBI-WAN and
RIC OLIE are checking the hyperdrive.

CAPT. PANAKA : Qui-Gon is in trouble, he says to take off!
PILOT : I don't see anything.
OBI-WAN : Over there! Fly low!

In the distance is a small cloud of dust.

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - NABOO SPACECRAFT - DAY

QUI-GON and DARTH MAUL continue theirsword battle. Leaping over one another
in an incredible display of acrobatics, the two warrios hear the ship fly
over them a few feet off the ground. QUI-GON almost dissapears for a
moment.
Before DARTH MAUL knows what's happening, QUI-GON is on the spacecrat's
ramp.

EXT. TATOOINE - NABOO SPACECRAFT RAMP - DAY

The SITH LORD immediately jumps onto the ramp after QUI-GON, but barely
makes it. His heels hang over the edge of a forty-foot drop. QUI-GON swings
his laser sword with all his might and knocks DARTH AMUL off the ramp and
onto the desert floor. The ramp closes, and the Naboo craft rockets away,
leaving the Sith Lord standing alone.

EXT. SPACE - NABOO SPACECRAFT (FX)

The sleek spacecraft rockets away from the planet Tatooine.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - HALLWAY

ANAKIN and OBI-WAN rush into the hallway to find QUI-GON collapsed on the
floor opposite the entry. ARTOO is looking over him. The JEDI is breathing
hard, wet with sweat and covered in dirt.

ANAKIN : Are you all right?
QUI-GON : I think so... that was a surpirse I wont soon forget.
OBI-WAN : What was it?
QUI-GON : I don't know... but he was well trained in the Jedi arts. My
guess is he was after the Queen...
ANAKIN : Do you think he'll follow us?
QUI-GON : We'll be safe enough once we're in hyperspace, but I have no
doubt he knows our destination.
ANAKIN : What are we going to do about it?

OBI-WAN gives ANAKIN a "who are you?" look. ANAKIN returns an innocent
stare.

QUI-GON : We will be patient. Anakin Skywalker, meet Obi-Wan Kenobi.
ANAKIN : Pleased to meet you. Wow! You're a Jedi too?

OBI-WAN gives the boy a skeptical look.

INT. COCKPIT - SPACE

RIC OLIE pulls back on the hyperdrive. OBI-WAN, QUI-GON, and ANAKIN watch.

QUI-GON : Let's hope this hyperdrive works and Watto didn't get the last
laugh.

The stars streak outside the cockpit window.

EXT. SPACE - NABOO SPACECRAFT (FX)

The ship streaks into hyperspace.

EXT. THEED - STREET - NIGHT (FX)

SEVERAL FEDERATION DROIDS patrol a deserted city street. The Palace can be
seen in the distance.

INT. NABOO PALACE - THRONE ROOM - THEED - NIGHT

NUTE sits in a strange, mechanical walking chair, which approaches SIO
BIBBLE and SEVERAL OTHER NABOO OFFICIALS. RUNE follows a few paces behind.
DROID GUARDS surround SIO BIBBLE and THE OTHERS as FOUR COUNCIL MEMBERS
watch.

NUTE : When are you going to give up this pointless strike? Your Queen is
lost, your people are starving, and you, Governor, are going to die, much
sooner than your people, I'm afraid. Take him away!
BIBBLE : This invasion will gain you nothing. We're a democracy. The people
have decided... They will not live under your tyranny.

BIBBLE is taken away as OOM-9 approaches NUTE.

OOM-9 : My troops are in position to begin searching the swamps for these
rumored underwater villages... they will not stay hidden for long.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - MAIN AREA

The ship is asleep. The lights are dim as PADME walks into the main room.
She goes to a monitor and watches the BIBBLE plea recording. JAR JAR is
stretched out on the floor, snoring. ARTOO is to one side, cooing as he
rests.
PADME appears tired. She senses someone watching her and turns around with
a start. She sees ANAKIN sitting in the corner, shivering and looking
verydejected. She goes over to him. He looks up at her with tears in his
eyes. He is holding his arms to keep himself warm.

PADME : Are you all right?
ANAKIN : It's very cold.

PADME gives him her over-jacket.

PADME : You're from a warm planet, Annie. Too warm for my taste. Space is
cold.
ANAKIN : You seem sad.
PADME : The Queen is...worried. Her people are suffering...dying. She must
convince the Senate to intervene, or...I'm not sure what will happen.
ANAKIN : I'm...I'm not sure what's going to happen to me. I dunno if I'll
ever see you again.. (he pulls something from his pocket) I made this for
you. Sou you'd remember me. I carved it out of a japor snippet... It will
bring you good fortune.

ANAKIN hands a wooden pendant to PADME. She inspects it, then puts it
around her neck.

PADME : It's beautiful, but I don't need this to remember you. Many things
will change when we reach the capital, Annie. My caring for you will always
remain.
ANAKIN : I care for you too. Only I...miss...

ANAKIN is disturbed about something. Tears are in his eyes.

PADME : ...You miss your mother.

ANAKIN looks at her, unable to speak. She hugs him.

ANAKIN looks out the cockpit window in awe.

RIC OLIE : Coruscant...the capital of the Republic...the entire planet is
one big city.
ANAKIN : Wow! It's so huge!

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - DAY (FX)

The ship flies through the cityscape of Coruscant.

EXT. CORUSCANT - SENATE LANDING PLATFORM - DAY

Supreme Chancellor VALORUM, SEVERAL GUARDS, and SENATOR PALPATINE stand on
a landing platform.
The sleek Naboo spacecraft lands on the platform high above the street
level of the galactic capital. The ramp lowers. OBI-WAN, QUI-GON, JAR JAR
and ANAKIN descend the ramp first and bow before PALPATINE and VALORUM.
CAPTAIN PANAKA, TWO GUARDS, QUEEN AMIDALA, then PADME, RABE, EIRTAE,
and
MORE GUARDS descend the ramp. QUEEN AMIDALA stops before the group.
ANAKIN and JAR JAR stand to one side, looking at the huge city. PADME
smiles at ANAKIN. PALPATINE bows before the Queen.

PALPATINE : It is a great gift to see you alive, Your Majesty. May I
present Supreme Chancellor Valorum.
VALORUM : Welcome, Your Highness. It is an honor to finally meet you in
person. I must relay to you how distressed everyone is over the currant
situation. I've called for a special session of the Senate to hear your
position.
AMIDALA : I am grateful for your concern, Chancellor.

PALPATINE starts to lead QUEEN AMIDALA and her RETINUE off the platform
toward a waiting air taxi.

PALPATINE : There is a question of precedure, but I feel confident we can
overcome it...

JAR JAR and ANAKIN start to follow, then stop, noticing that OBI-WAN and
QUI-GON are staying with the SUPREME CHANCELLOR. QUEEN AMIDALA waves to the
duo to follow her. ANAKIN looks back to QUI-GON, and he nods to go ahead.
ANAKIN and JAR JAR join the QUEEN, PALPATINE, PADME, RABE and EIRTAE in the
taxi. PALPATINE gives the Gungan and the boy in the back of the taxi a
skeptical look. JAR JAR leans over to ANAKIN.

JAR JAR : Da Queens- a bein grossly nice, mesa tinks. (he looks around)
Pitty hot!

VALORUM and the JEDI watch the taxi move off into the city.

QUI-GON : I must speak with the Jei Council immediately, Your Honor. The
situation has become more complicated.

INT. PALPATINE'S QUARTERS - ANTEROOM - DAY

QUEEN AMIDALA is sitting listening to PALPATINE. EIRTAE and RABE stand
behind the QUEEN; PADME is nowhere to be sen. ANAKIN and JAR JAR are
waiting in an adjoining room. They can see the Queen but cannot hear what
is being said.

JAR JAR : Dissen all pitty odd to my.
ANAKIN : Don't look at me. I don't know what's going on.

CAPTAIN PANAKA enters, then goes into the room with QUEEN AMIDALA.

INT. PALPATINE'S QUARTERS - LIVING AREA - DAY

PALPATINE is pacing as CAPTAIN PANAKA enters. EIRTAE and RABE stand to one
side.

PALPATINE : ...the Republic is not what it once was. The Senate is full of
greedy, squabbling delegates who are only looking out for themselves and
their home sytems. There is no interest in the common good...no civility,
only politics...its disgusting. I must be frank, Your Majesty, there is
little chance the Senate will act on the invasion.
AMIDALA : Chancellor Valorum seems to think there is hope.
PALPATINE : If I may say so, Your Majesty, the Chancellor has little real
power...he is mired down by baseless accusations of corruption. A
manufactured scandal surrounds him. The bureaucrats are in charge now.
AMIDALA : What options do we have?
PALPATINE : Our best choice would be to push for the election of a stronger
Supreme Chancellor. One who will take control of the bureaucrats, enforces
the laws, and give us justice. You could call for a vote of no confidence
in Chancellor Valorum.
AMIDALA : He has been our strongest supporter. Is there any other way?
PALPATINE : Our only other choice would to be to submit a plea to the
courts...
AMIDALA : There's no time for that. The courts take even longer to decide
things than the Senate. Our people are dying, Senator...more and more each
day. We must do something quickly to stop the Federation.
PALPATINE : To be realistic, Your Highness, I'd say we're going to have to
accept Federation control for the time being.
AMIDALA : There is something I cannot do.

EXT. TEMPLE OF THE JEDI - DAY (FX)

A unique building with it tall spires stands out against the Coruscant
skyline. A small transport passes by the vast temple.

INT. TEMPLE OF THE JEDI - COUNCIL CHAMBERS - DAY

QUI-GON stands in a tall stately room. Twelve JEDI sit in a semi-circle.
OBI-WAN stands behind QUI-GON in the center of the room.
The Senior Jedi is MACE WINDU. To his left is an alien Jedi named
KI-ADI-MUNDI, and to his right, the Jedi Master, YODA.

QUI-GON : ...my only conclusion can be that it was a Sith Lord.
MACE WINDU : A Sith Lord?!?
KI-ADI : Impossible! The Sith have been extinct for a millenium.
YODA : The very Republic is threatened, if involved the Sith are.
MACE WINDU : I do not believe they could have returned without us knowing.
YODA : Hard to see, the dark side is. Discover who this assassin is, we
must.
KI-ADI : I sense he will reveal himself again.
MACE WINDU : This attack was with purpose, that is clear, and I agree the
Queen is the target.
YODA : With this Naboo queen you must stay, Qui-Gon. Protect her.
MACE WINDU : We will use all our resources here to unravel this mystery and
discover the identity of your attacker... May the Force be with you.
YODA : May the Force be with you.

OBI-WAN turns to leave, but QUI-GON continues to face the Council.

YODA : (Cont'd) Master Qui-Gon more to say have you?
QUI-GON : With your permission, my Master. I have encountered a vergence in
the Force.
YODA : A vergence, you say?
MACE WINDU : Located around a person?
QUI-GON : A boy... his cells have the highest concentration of
midi-chlorians I have seen in a life form. It is possible he was conceived
by the midi-chlorians.
MACE WINDU : You're referring to the prophesy of the one who will bring
balance to the Force...you believe it's this boy??
QUI-GON : I don't pressume...
YODA : But you do! Rrevealed your opinion is.
QUI-GON : I request the boy be tested.

The JEDI all look to one another. They nod and turn back to OBI-WAN and
QUI-GON.

YODA : Trained as a Jedi, you request for him?
QUI-GON : Finding him was the will of the Force...I have no doubt of that.
There is too much happening here...
MACE WINDU : Bring him before us, then.
YODA : Tested he will be.

INT. QUEENS QUARTERS - CORUSCANT - DAY Anakin, tentative, walks down one of
the long hallways in Senator Palpatine's quarters. He stops before a dor
that is flanked by TWO GUARDS.

GUARD : May I help you, son?
ANAKIN : I'm...I'm looking for the handmaiden, Padme.

The GUARD speaks into his comlink as ANAKIN looks around a bit nervously.

GUARD : The boy is here to see Padme.
RABE : Send him in.

The doors open, and ANAKIN enters the Queen's quarters.
RABE greets ANAKIN as TWO OTHER HANDMAIDENS come and go into the next room.

ANAKIN : I'd like to speak with Padme, if I could.
RABE : I'm sorry, Annie. Padme is not here right now.

The Queen speaks out in the next room.

AMIDALA : (O.S.) Who is it?
RABE : Anakin Skywalker, to see Padme, Your Highness.

The QUEEN moves into the doorway and studies ANAKIN. ANAKIN bows and looks
down, then takes a peek at her.

AMIDALA : I've sent Padme on an errand.
ANAKIN : I'm going to the Jedi temple to start my training, I hope.

The QUEEN just stares at him.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) I may not see her again...and... I just wanted to say
goodbye.
AMIDALA : We will tell her for you. We're sure her heart goes with you.

ANAKIN bows again.

ANAKIN : Thank you, Your Highness. I'm sorry to have disturbed you.

The QUEEN dissapears behind the doorway, and ANAKIN exits.

EXT. CORUSCANT - GALACTIC SENATE BUILDING - DAY (FX)

A large, distinctive looking domed building stands out amid the cityscape
of Coruscant.

INT. MAIN ROTUNDA - GALACTIC SENATE - DAY

The Senate chambers are huge. Thousands of SENATORS and their AIDES sit in
the circular assembly area. CHANCELLOR VALORUM sits in an elevated area in
the center. Hindreds of AIDES and DROIDS hurry about. SENATOR PALPATINE,
QUEEN AMIDALA, EIRTA, RABE, and CAPTAIN PANAKA sit in the Naboo
congressional box, which is actually a floating platform. PALPATINE leans
over to the QUEEN.

PALPATINE : If the Federation moves to defer the motion...Your Majesty,
Ibeg of you to ask for a resolution to end this congressional session.
AMIDALA : I wish I had your confidence in this, Senator.
PALPATINE : You must force a new election for Supreme Chancellor...I
promise you there are many who will support us...it is our best chance...
Your Majesty, our only, chance.
AMIDALA : You truely believe Chancellor Valorum will not bring our motion
to a vote?
PALAPATINE : He is distracted...he is afraid. He will be of no help.
VALORUM : The Chair recognizes the Senator from the sovereign system of
Naboo.

The Naboo congressional box floats into the center.

PALPATINE : Supreme Chancellor, delegates of the Senate. A tragedy has
occured on our peaceful system of Naboo. We have become caugt in a dispute
you're all well aware of, which began right here with the taxation of trade
routes, and has now engulfed our entire planet in the oppresion of the
Trade Federation.

A second box rushes into the center of the Senate. It is filled with
Federation trade barons led by LOTT DOD, the Senator for the Federation.

LOTT DOD : This is outrageous! I object to the Senator's statements!
VALORUM : The Chair does not recognize the Senator from the Trade
Federation at this time. Please return to your station.

LOTT DOD reluctantly moves back to his place.

PALPATINE : To state our allegations, I present Queen Amidala, the recently
elected ruler of Naboo, to speak on our behalf.

QUEEN AMIDALA stands and addresses the assembly. There is some applause.

AMIDALA : Honorable representatives of the Republic, distinguished
delegates, and Your Honor Supreme Chancellor Valorum, I come to you under
the gravest of circumstances. The Naboo system has been invaded by force.
Invaded...against all the laws of the Republic by the Droid Armies of the
Trade...
LOTT DOD : I object! There is no proof. This is incredible. We recommend a
commision be sent to Naboo to assertain the truth.
VALORUM : Overruled.
LOTT DOD : Your Honor, you cannot allow us to be condemned without
reasonable observation. It's against all the rules of procedure.

A third box representing Malastare moves into the center of the room. AKS
MOE, the Ambassador, addresses the convention.

AKS MOE : The Congress of Malastare concurs with the honorable delegate
from the Trade Federation. A commision must be appointed...that is the law.
VALORUM : The point...

VALORUM confers with several of his AIDES and VICE CHAIRMAN MAS AMEDDA.
PALPATINE whispers something to the QUEEN.

PALPATINE : Enter the bureaucrats, the true rulers of the Republic, and on
the payroll of the Trade Federation, I might add. This is where Chancellor
Valorum's strength will dissapear.
VALORUM : The point is conceded...Section 523A take precedence here. Queen
Amidala of the Naboo, will you defer your motion to allow a commission to
explore the validity of your accusations?

QUEEN AMIDALA is angry but remains composed.

AMIDALA : (angrily) I will not defer...I have come before you to resolve
this attack on our sovereignty now. I was not elected to watch my people
suffer and die while you discuss this invasion in a committee. If this body
is not capable of action, I suggest new leadership is needed. I move for a
"vote of no confidence"...in Chancellor Valorum's leadership.
VALORUM : What?...No!

This causes a great stir in the assembly. A loud mumur cresendos into a
roar of approval and jeers. CHANCELLOR VALORUM is stunned and stands
speechless. His Vice Chair, MAS AMEDDA, takes over.

MAS AMEDDA : Order! We shall have order...

Things settledown a little. The Federation box settles next to AMIDALA.
PRINCE BAIL ORGANA moves his box into the arena.

BAIL ORGANA : Alderaan seconds the motion for a vote of no confidence in
Chancellor Valorum.
MAD AMEDDA : The motion has been seconded by Bail Organa of Alderaan.

MAS AMEDDA turns to the confused VALORUM, and whispers something to him.

BAIL ORGANA : There must be no delays. The motion is on the floor and must
be voted upon in this session.
LOTT DOD : The Trade Federation moves the motion be sent to the procedures
committee for study.

The assembly begins to chant. VALORUM talks to MAS AMEDDA.

ASSEMBLY : Vote now! Vote now! Vote now!

PALPATINE stands next to AMIDALA.

PALPATINE : You see, Your Majaesty, the tide is with us...Valorum will be
voted out, I assure you, and they will elect in a new Chancellor, a strong
Chancellor, one who will not let our tragedy continue...
MAS AMEDDA : Thew Supreme Chancellor requests a recess. Tomorrow we will
begin the vote.

The Federation delegation is furious. VALORUM turns to PALPATINE.

VALORUM : Palpatine, I thought you were my ally...my friend. You have
betrayed me! How could you do this?

EXT. PALACE OF THE JEDI - BALCONY - SUNSET

OBI-WAN and QUI-GON stand outside the palace on a balcony.

OBI-WAN : The boy will not pass the Council's tests, Master, and you know
it. He is far too old.
QUI-GON : Anakin will become A Jedi...I promise you.
OBI-WAN : Don't defy the Council, Master..not again.
QUI-GON : I will do what I must.
OBI-WAN : Master, you could be sitting on the Council by now if you would
just follow the code. They will not go along with you this time.
QUI-GON : You still have much to learn, my young apprentice.

INT. PALACE OF THE JEDI - COUNCIL CHAMBERS - SUNSET

ANAKIN stands before the TWELVE JEDI. MACE WINDU holds a small hand-held
viewing screen. In rapid succession, images flash across the screen.

ANAKIN : A ship...a cup...a speeder.

MACE WINDU turns the viewing screen off and nods toward YODA.

YODA : Good, good, young one. How feel you?
ANAKIN : Cold, sir.
YODA : Afraid are you?
ANAKIN : No, sir.
MACE WINDU : Afraid to give up your life?
ANAKIN : I don't think so.

ANAKIN hesitates for a moment.

YODA : See through you, we can.
MACE WINDU : Be mindful of your feelings...
KI-ADI : YOur thoughts dwell on your mother.
ANAKIN : I miss her.
YODA : Afraid to lose her..I think.
ANAKIN : (a little angry) What's that got to do with anything?
YODA : Eveything. Fear is the path to the dark side... fear leads to
anger... anger leads to hate.. hate leads to suffering.
ANAKIN : (angrily) I am not afraid!
YODA : A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. I
sense much fear in you.
ANAKIN : (quietly) I am not afraid.
YODA : Then continue, we will.

INT. PALPATINES QUARTERS - SUNSET

QUEEN AMIDALA is standing, staring out the window, with JAR JAR. The lights
of the city shimmer before them. EIRTAE and SABE stand near the door. JAR
JAR turns to face the QUEEN and sees her sadness.

JAR JAR : Mesa wonder why da guds invent pain?
AMIDALA : To motivate us, I imagine...
JAR JAR : Yousa tinken yousa people ganna die?
AMIDALA : I don't know.
JAR JAR : Gungans ganna get pasted too, eh?
AMIDALA : I hope not.
JAR JAR : Gungans do die'n without a fight.... wesa warriors. Wesa gotta
grand army. Dat why you no liken us, metinks.

PALPATINE and CAPTAIN PANAKA rush into the rom and bow before the QUEEN.

CAPT. PANAKA : Your Highness, Senator Palpatine has been nominated to
succeed Valorum as Supreme Chancellor.
PALPATINE : A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one. I promise, Your
Majesty, if I am elected, I will bring democracy back to the Republic. I
will put an end to corruption. The Trade Fedreation will lose its influence
over the bureaucrats, and our people will be freed.
AMIDALA : Who else can be nominated?
CAPT. PANAKA : Bail Antilles of Alderaan and Ainlee Teem of Malastare.
PALPATINE : I feel confident...our "situation" will create a strong
sympaphy vote for us... I will be Chancellor, I promise you.
AMIDALA : I fear by the time you have control of the bureaucrats, Senator,
there will be nothing left of our cities, our people, our way of life...
PALPATINE : I understand your concern, Your Majesty; unfortunately, the
Federation has possession of our planet. The law is in their favor.
AMIDALA : With the Senate in transition, there is nothing more I can do
here...Senator, this is your arena. I feel I must return to mine. I have
decided to go back to Naboo. My place is with my people.
PALPATINE : Go back!! But, Your Majesty, be realistic! You would be in
danger. They will force you to sign the treaty.
AMIDALA : I will sign no treaty, Senator. My fate will be no different from
that of our people. Captain!
CAPT. PANAKA : Yes, Your Highness?
AMIDALA : Ready my ship!
CAPT. PANAKA : Please, Your Majesty, stay here...where it's safe.
AMIDALA : No place is safe, if the Senate doesn't condemn this invasion. It
is clear to me now that the Republic no longer functions as a democracy. If
you win the election, Senator, I know you will do everything possible to
stop the Federation. I pray you will bring sanity and compassion back to
the Senate.

AMIDALA and her RETINUE exit the room. PALPATINE has a self-satisfied smile
on his face.

INT. TEMPLE OF THE JEDI - COUNCIL CHAMBERS - TWILIGHT

ANAKIN, OBI-WAN, and QUI-GON stand before the TWELVE MEMBERS OF THE JEDI
COUNCIL.

YODA : ...Correct you were, Qui-Gon.
MACE WINDU : His cells contain a high concentration of midi-chlorians.
KI-ADI : The Force is strong with him.
QUI-GON : He's to be trained, then.

The COUNCIL MEMBERS look to one another.

MACE WINDU : No. He will not be trained.

ANAKIN is crestfallen; tears begin to form in his eyes.

QUI-GON : No??!!

OBI-WAN smiles.

MACE WINDU : He is too old. There is already too much anger in him.
QUI-GON : He is the chosen one...you must see it.
YODA : Clouded, this boy's future is. Masked by his youth.
QUI-GON : I will trin him, then. I take Anakin as my Padawan learner.

OBI-WAN reacts with surprise. ANAKIN watches with interest.

YODA : An apprentice, you have, Qui-Gon. Impossible, to take on a second.
MACE WINDU : We forbid it.
QUI-GON : Obi-Wan is ready...
OBI-WAN : Iam ready to face the trials.
YODA : Ready so early, are you? What know you of ready?

ANAKIN watches as QUI-GON and OBI-WAN exchange angry looks.

QUI-GON : Headstrong....and he has much to learn about the living Force,
but he is capabe. There is little more he will learn from me.
YODA : Our own council we will keep on who is ready. More to learn, he
has...
MACE WINDU : Now is not the time for this...the Senate is voting for a new
Spreme Chancellor. Queen Amidala is returning home, which will put pressure
on the Federation, and could widen the confrontation.
YODA : And draw out the Queen's attacker.
KI-ADI : Events are moving fast...too fast.
MACE WINDU : Go with the Queen to Naboo and discover the identity of the
dark warrior. That is the clue we need to unravel this mystery of the Sith.

YODA : Young Skywalker's fate will be decided later.
QUI-GON : I brought Anakin here; he must stay in my charge. He has nowhere
else to go.
MACE WINDU : He is your ward, Qui-Gon...we will not dispute that.
YODA : Train him not. Take him with you, but train him not!
MACE WINDU : Protect the Queen, but do not intercede if it comes to war
until we have the Senate's approval.
YODA : May the Force be with you.

OBI-WAN, QUI-GON, and ANAKIN leave.

EXT. CORUSCANT - SENATE LANDING PLATFORM - NIGHT

QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, and ANAKIN stand on the landing platform outside the
ship. ARTOO whistles a happy tune as he leans over the edge of the
platform, watching the traffic. Suddenly, he leans over too far and falls
overboard. After a moment, he reappears, using his on-board jets to propel
himself back onto the landing platform. The wind whips at ANAKIN as he
listens to the JEDI.

OBI-WAN : It is not disrespect, Master, it is the truth.
QUI-GON : From your point of view....
OBI-WAN : The boy is dangerous...they all sense it. Why can't you?
QUI-GON : His fate is uncertain, not dangerous. The Council will decide
Anakin's future...that should be enough for you. Now get on board!
OBI-WAN reluctantly boards the Naboo spacecraft followed by ARTOO. QUI-GON
goes over to ANAKIN.
ANAKIN : Master Qui-Gon, sir, I do not wish to be a problem.
QUI-GON : You won't be, Annie....I'm not allowed to train you, so I want
you to watch me and be mindful...always remember, your focus determines
your reality. Stay close to me and you will be safe.
ANAKIN : Master, sir...I've been wondering...what are midi-chlorians?
QUI-GON : Midi-chlorians are a microcopic lifeform that reside within all
living cells and communicates with the Force.
ANAKIN : They live inside of me?
QUI-GON : In your cells. We are symbionts with the midi-chlorians.
ANAKIN : Symbionts?
QUI-GON : Life forms living together for mutual advantage. Without the
midi-chlorians, life could not exist, and we would have no knowledge of the
Force. They continually speak to you, telling you the will of the Force.
ANAKIN : They do??
QUI-GON : When you learn to quiet your mind, you will hear them speaking to
you.
ANAKIN : I don't understand.
QUI-GON : With time and training, Annie...you will.

Two taxis pull up, and CAPTAIN PANAKA, SENATOR PALPATINE, TWENTY OR SO
TROOPS, GUARDS, and OFFICERS walk briskly toward the ship, followed by
QUEEN AMIDALA, PADME, EIRTAE, and finally, JAR JAR. AMIDALA and her
HANDMAIDENS stop before the JEDI.

QUI-GON : (Cont'd) Your Highness, it is our pleasure to continue to serve
and protect you.
AMIDALA : I welcome your help. Senator Palpatine fears the Federation means
to destroy me.
QUI-GON : I promise you, I will not let that happen.

AMIDALA enters the ship, followed by her HANDMAIDENS. JAR JAR hugs QUI-GON
and ANAKIN.

JAR JAR : Wesa goen home!

They ALL move onto the ship. The ship takes off.

INT. NABOO PALACE - THRONE ROOM - THEED - NIGHT

NUTE and RUNE stand before a hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS.

DARTH SIDIOUS : The Queen is on her way to you. I regret she is of no
further use to us. When she gets there, destroy her.
NUTE : Yes, my Lord.
DARTH SIDIOUS : Viceroy, is the planet secure?
NUTE : Yes, my Lord, we have taken over the last pockets of primitive life
forms. We are in complete control of the planet now.
DARTH SIDIOUS : Good. I will see to it that in the Senate, things stay as
they are. I am sending Darth Maul to join you. He will deal with the Jedi.
NUTE : Yes, my Lord.

DARTH SIDIOUS fades off.

RUNE : A Sith lord here with us?!!

INT. SPACE - NABOO SPACECRAFT COCKPIT

ANAKIN stands next to the PILOT, RIC OLIE, pointing to various buttons and
gauges.

ANAKIN : ...and that one?
RIC OLIE : The forward stabalizer.
ANAKIN : And those control the pitch?
RIC OLIE : You catch on pretty quick.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - QUEEN'S CHAMBERS

SABE and EIRTAE stand behind QUEEN AMIDALA as she talks with QUI-GON and
CAPTAIN PANAKA. OBI-WAN and JAR JAR watch.

CAPT. PANAKA : The moment we land the Federation will arrest you, and force
you to sign the treaty.
QUI-GON : I agree...I'm not sure what you hope to accomplish by this.
AMIDALA : I'm going to take back what's ours.
CAPT. PANAKA : There are only twelve of us, Your Highness....we have no
army.
QUI-GON : I cannot fight a war for you, Your Highness, only protect you.
AMIDALA : Jar Jar Binks!

JAR JAR looks around, puzzled.

JAR JAR : Mesa, Your Highness?
AMIDALA : Yes. I need your help.

INT. NABOO CRUISER COCKPIT - DAY

The Naboo Cruiser heads toward the lush green planet. There is only one
Federation battle cruiser orbiting. OBI-WAN and CAPTAIN PANAKA spot it on
the view screen.

PANAKA : The blockade's gone.
OBI-WAN : The war's over...No need for it now.
RIC OLIE : I have one battleship on my scope.
OBI-WAN : A droid control ship.
PANAKA : They've probably spotted us.
OBI-WAN ; We haven't much time.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - MAIN HOLD

The QUEEN, CAPTAIN PANAKA, TROOPS, and HANDMAIDENS get ready to disembark
as the ship alnds. The elevator door slides open, and ANAKIN emerges into
the hold area. He see PADME and run up to her.

ANAKIN : Hi! Where have you been?
PADME : Annie! What are you doing here?
ANAKIN : I'm with Qui-Gon...but...they're not going to let me be a Jedi.
I'm too old.
PADME : This is going to be dangerous, Annie.
ANAKIN : Is it? I can help... Where are we going?
PADME : To war, I'm afraid. The Queen has had to make the most difficuld
decision of her life. She doesn't believe in fighting, Annie. We are a
peaceful people...
ANAKIN : I want to help...I'm glad you're back.

ANAKIN smiles. PADME smiles back.

EXT. NABOO SWAMP - DAY

The Naboo spacecraft has landed in the Gungan swamp. TROOPS unload the
ships in the background as OBI-WAN approaches QUI-GON.

OBI-WAN : Jar Jar is on his way to the Gungan city, Master.

QUI-GON's thoughts are elsewhere.

QUI-GON : Good.

OBI-WAN and QUI-GON stand silently for a moment.

OBI-WAN : Do you think the Queen's idea will work?
QUI-GON : The Gungans will not easily be swayed, and we cannot use our
power to help her.
OBI-WAN : I'm...I'm sorry for my behavior, Master. It is not my place to
disagree with you about the boy. I am grateful you think I am ready for the
trials.

QUI-GON looks at him for a long moment.

QUI-GON : You have been a good apprentice. You are much wiser than Iam,
Obi-Wan. I foresee you will become a great Jedi Knight.

EXT. NABOO SWAMP - UNDERWATER - DAY (FX)

JAR JAR swims down into Bubble City.

INT. OTOH GUNGA - CITY SQUARE

JAR JAR enters the main square of the bubble city. He stands, stunned, in
amazement and fear. He is nervous and shaking.

JAR JAR : Ello! Where das everybody?

The plaza is empty. He notices that many of the buildings are shot up as if
there had been a battle of some kind.

EXT. NABOO SWAMP LAKE - DAY

JAR JAR exits the swamp lake and walks over to QUEEN AMIDALA, CAPTAIN
PANAKA, OBI-WAN, and QUI-GON. PADME, EIRTAE, RABE, ANAKIN, and ARTOO,
FOUR
PILOTS, and EIGHT GUARDS stand in the background near the starship.

JAR JAR : Dare-sa nobody dare. All gone. Some kinda fight, I tink. Sorry,
no Gungas...no Gungas.
CAPT. PANAKA : Do you think they have been taken to camps?
OBI-WAN : More likely they were wiped out.
JAR JAR : No...mesa no tink so. Gungan hiden. When in trouble, go to sacred
place. Mackineeks no find them dare.
QUI-GON : Do you know where they are?

EXT. NABOO SWAMP - DAY

The GROUP follows JAR JAR as he moves through the swamp. JAR JAR stops and
sniffs the air. The GROUP stop behind him.

JAR JAR : Dissen it.

JAR JAR makes a strange chattering noise. Suddenly, out of nowhere, CAPTAIN
TARPALS and SIX OTHER GUNGAN TROOPS riding on KAADUS emerge from the brush.

JAR JAR : (Cont'd) Heyo-dalee, Captain Tarpals.
CAPT. TARPALS : Binks!! Noah gain!
JAR JAR : We comen to see da boss.

CAPTIAN TARPALS rolls his eyes.

CAPT. TARPALS : Ouch time, Binks... Ouch time for all-n youse.

EXT. NABOO SACRED TEMPLE RUINS - DAY

JAR JAR, QUEEN AMIDALA, ANAKIN, ARTOO, QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, PADME, RABE,
EIRTAE, and the rest of her group are led through a clearing full of GUNGAN
refugees. At the far end are the ruins of a grand temple with massive
carved heads. BOSS NASS and several other COUNCIL MEMBERS walk out on the
top of a three-quarter-submerged head.

BOSS NASS : Jar Jar, yousa payen dis time. Who's da uss-en others??

QUEEN AMIDALA steps forward. CAPTAIN PANAKA and the JEDI stand behind her.

AMIDALA : I am Queen Amidala of the Naboo...I come before you in peace.
BOSS NASS : Naboo biggen. Yousa bringen da Mackineeks... Dya busten uss-en
omm. Yousa all bombad. Yousa all die'n, mesa tink.

CAPTAIN PANAKA and HALF A DOZEN GUARDS and PILOTS look around nervously,
and the GUNGAN TROOPS lower their long power poles. The JEDI stay relaxed.
ANAKIN watches everything with great interest.

AMIDALA : We wish to form an alliance...

Suddenly, PADME steps forward.

PADME : Your Honor...

ARTOO whistles a quiet "uh oh."

BOSS NASS : Whosa dis?
PADME : I am Queen Amidala (points to Queen) This is my decoy...my
protection...my loyal bodyguard.

ANAKIN is stunned. OBI-WAN and QUI-GON give each other a knowing look.

PADME : (Cont'd) ...I am sorry for my deception, but under the
circumstances it has become necessary to protect myself. Although we do not
always agree, Your Honor, our two great societies have always lived in
peace...until now. The Trade Federation has destroyed all that we have
worked so hard to build. You are in hiding, my people are in camps. If we
do not act quickly, all will be lost forever...I ask you to help us...no, I
beg you to help us.

PADME drops to her knees and prostrates herself before BOSS NASS. There is
a gasp from CAPTAIN PANAKA, HIS TROOPS, and the HANDMAIDENS.

PADME : (Cont'd) We are your humble servants...our fate is in your hands.

Slowly, CAPTAIN PANAKA and his TROOPS bow down before the GUNGAN COUNCIL.
Then the HANDMAIDENS, ANAKIN, and finally the JEDI. The GUNGANS are puzzled
by this. BOSS NASS begins to laugh.

BOSS NASS : Yousa no tinken yousa greater den da Gungans.. Mesa like dis.
Maybe wesa bein friends.

INT. NABOO PALACE - THRONE ROOM - DAY

NUTE, RUNE, and DARTH MAUL walk with a hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS.

NUTE : ...we've sent out patrols. We've already located their starship in
the swamp....It won't be long, My Lord.
DARTH SIDIOUS : This is an unexpected move for her. It's too aggresive..
Lord Maul, be mindful.
DARTH MAUL : Yes, my Master.
DARTH SIDIOUS : Be patient... Let them make the first move.

EXT. NABOO EDGE OF SWAMP/ GRASS PLAINS - DAY

A GUNGAN SENTRY sits on top of the ancient temple heah, searching the
landscape with a pair of electrobinoculars. He sees something and yells
down to ANAKIN at the foot of the statue.

GUNGAN LOOKOUT : Daza comen!
ANAKIN : All right. They're here!

ANAKIN yells and runs over to PADME and the JEDI, who are discussing a
battle plan with FIVE GUNGAN GENERALS. SABE and EIRTAE stand nearby. BOSS
NASS puts his arm around JAR JAR.

BOSS NASS : Yousa doen grand. Jar Jar bringen da Naboo together.
JAR JAR : Oh, no, no, no...
BOSS NASS : So, wesa maken yousa Bombad General.
JAR JAR : General??! Oh, no..

JAR JAR's eyes roll back, his tongue flops out and he faints.
FOUR SPEEDERS pull up to the GROUP. CAPTAIN PANAKA and a DOZEN OR SO
GUARDS
and PILOT pile out and join the group.

PADME : What is the situation?
CAPT. PANAKA : Almost everyone's in camps. A few hundred police and guards
have formed an underground movement. I brought as many of the keaders as I
could. The Federation Army's also much larger than we thought, and much
stronger. Your Highness, this is a battle I do not think we can win.
PADME : The battle is a diversion. The Gungans must draw theDroid Army away
from the cities. We can enter the city using the secret passages on the
waterfall side. Once we get to the main entrance, Captain Pnaka will create
a diversion, so that we can enter the palace and capture the Viceroy.
Without the Viceroy, they will be lost and confused.

QUI-GON and OBI-WAN look on with interest.

PADME : (Cont'd) What do you think, Master Jedi?
QUI-GON : The Viceroy will be well guarded.
CAPT. PANAKA : The difficulty's getting into the throne room. Once we're
inside, we shouldn't have a problem.
QUI-GON : There is a possibility with this diversion many Gungans will be
killed.
BOSS NASS : Wesa ready to do are-sa part.

JAR JAR smiles a very worried and sheepish grin. ANAKIN watches with
interest, as does ARTOO.

PADME : We have a plan which should immobilize the Droid Army. We will send
what pilots we have to knock out the Droid control ship which is orbiting
the planet. If we can get past their rayshields, we can sever communication
and their droids will be helpless.
QUI-GON : A well-conceived plan. However, there's great risk. The weapons
on your fighters may not penetrate the shields on the control ship.
OBI-WAN : And there's an even bigger danger. If the Vicroy escapes, Your
Highness, he will return with another droid army.
PADME : That is why we must not fail to get to the Viceroy. Everything
depends on it.

INT. THEED - PALACE - THRONE ROOM - DAY

NUTE, RUNE, DARTH MAUL, OOM-9, and a hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS walk through
the throne room.

DARTH SIDIOUS : ...she is more foolish than I thought.
NUTE : We are sending all available troops to meet this army of hers
assembling near the swamp. It appears to be made up of primitives. We do
not expect much resistance.
OOM-9 : I am increasing security at all Naboo detention camps.
DARTH MAUL : I feel there is more to this, My Master. The two Jedi may be
using the Queen for their own purposes.
DARTH SIDIOUS : The Jedi cannot become involved. They can only protect the
Queen. Even Qui-Gon Jinn will not break that conenant.... This will work to
our advantage...
NUTE : I have your approval to proceed then, My Lord.
DARTH SIDIOUS : Proceed. Wipe them put...all of them. INT. NABOO SWAMP LAKE
- DAY (FX)

All is peaceful. SMALL CRITTERS drink out of a large swamp lake. Suddenly
there is a disturbance in the middle of the lake. A rush of bubbles, then a
GUNGAN SOLDIER riding a KAADU emerges from the water, followed by SEVERAL
OTHERS. FROGS and OTHER LITTLE ANIMALS flee in all directions as the GUNGAN
ARMY marches through the swamp. The KAADU shake themselves off as they exit
the lake. When JAR JAR's KAADU shakes off, JAR JAR falls off.
SOLDIERS on huge, lizard-like FAMBAAS with large shield generators mounted
on their backs follow the marching WARRIORS. The GUNGAN ARMY heads out of
the swamp and onto the rolling grassy hills.
HUNDREDS OF GUNGAN WARRIORS march in lon lines toward the horizon.
Federation tanks move up to a ridge and stop. In the distance they see the
GUNGAN ARMY marching toward them. The GUNGAN GENERAL CEEL sees the tanks on
the ridge and orders a halt. The GUNGANS are spread out in a large line.
JAR JAR is nervous. GENERAL CEEL signals to the shield operators.

GENERAL CEEL : Energize the shields.

A red ray shoots out of the generator and blasts into a large dish on the
back of a second FAAMBA and spreads like an umbrella over the assembled
WARRIORS.

EXT. THEED - CENTRAL PLAZA - DAY

PADME, followed by EIRTAE, OBI-WAN, QUI-GON, ANAKIN, and ARTOO, stealthily
makes her way toward the entrance to the main hanger. They are followed by
about TWENTY NABOO GUARDS, PILOTS, and TROOPS. They stop, and PADME uses a
small red laser light to signal across the plaza to CAPTAIN PANAKA, RABE
and TWENTY OTHER ASSORTED NABOO TROOPS. They signal back. QUI-GON leans
over to ANAKIN.

QUI-GON : Once we get inside, Annie, you find a safe placeto hide and stay
there.
ANAKIN : Sure.
QUI-GON : And stay there!

DROID TROOPS mill about the tank-filled plaza. At the far end of the plaza,
SEVERAL DROIDS begin to run and fire. NABOO SOLDIERS begin to fire back at
the BATTLE DROIDS.
As the ruckus erupts at one end of the plaza, PADME and her TROOPS rush
into the main hanger. CAPTAIN PANAKA and HIS SOLDIERS continue to engage
the DROIDS outside.

INT. THEED - CENTRAL HANGER - DAY

ALARMS ARE SOUNDING a PADME, the JEDI, ANAKIN, EIRTAE, and PADME's TROOPS
rush into the hanger. BATTLE DROIDS begin firing at them as they run for
cover. ANAKIN runs under a Naboo fighter. The JEDI deflect bolts aimed at
PADME back onto the BATTLE DROIDS, causing them to EXPLODE.

INT. THEED - PALACE THRONE ROOM - DAY

NUTE, RUNE, and FOUR COUNCIL MEMBERS watch the plaza battle on a large view
screen.

NUTE : I thought the battle was going to take place far from here...this is
too close!
RUNE : What is going on?

DARTH MAUL enters the throne room.

DARTH MAUL : I told you there was more to this...the Jedi are involved.

EXT. NABOO GRASS PLAINS - DAY (FX)

The Federation tanks begin to fire on the GUNGANS, but they are protected
by their energy shield. The tanks stop firing, and the GUNGANS CHEER, until
they see the doors to the massive transports open, and racks of BATTLE
DROIDS are pulled out and lined up by a squad of STAPS.
The BATTLE DROIDS reconfigure into their standing position. The GUNGANS get
ready for an attack. OOM-9 gives the command to move forward, and THOUSANDS
OF DROIDS march toward the GUNGANS.
The GUNGANS power up their weapons. The DROIDS slowly march through the
protective shield and start firing. The GUNGANS throw their power poles and
fling small balls of energy with slingshots. The WARRIORS dump large balls
of energy into mortars that heat up and fire the energy goo onto the BATTLE
DROIDS, causing them to short out.
The battle rages and the GUNGANS defend their shield generators against the
ARMY OF DROIDS. OOM-9 watches from a tank on a hill overlooking the battle.

INT. THEED - CENTRAL HANGER - DAY

ANAKIN hides behind one of the Naboo fighters, ducking as large bolts whiz
past and EXPLODE near him. PADME and the TWO JEDI destroy BATTLE DROIDS
right and left. The QUEEN'S TROOPS and EIRTAE also blast away at the
DROIDS. PADME signals to her pilots.

PADME : Get to your ships!

The PILOTS and ARTOO UNITS run for the Naboo fighter craft stacked in the
hanger bay. ONE OF THE PILOTS jumps into a fighter right above where ANAKIN
is hiding.

FIGHTER PILOT : Better find a new hiding place, kid. I'm taking this ship.

The ship begins to levitate out of the hanger. BATTLE DROIDS fire at it as
it falls in behind five other fighters. ARTOO whistles to ANAKIN from a
second fighter not far away. ANAKIN runs and jumps into the second fighter
to hide.

EXT. THEED - CENTRAL PLAZA - DAY (FX)

Two Naboo starfighters exit the main hanger. A tank fires at them, hitting
one of them, which causes it to pinwheel into the ground and EXPLODE.

INT. THEED - CENTRAL HANGER - DAY

CAPTAIN PANAKA, SABE and NABOO TROOPS rush into the hanger and overwlm the
few remaining BATTLE DROIDS. PADME, OBI-WAN, and QUI-GON join forces with
CAPTAIN PANAKA.

PADME : My guess is the Viceroy is in the throne room.

She looks to QUI-GON.

QUI-GON : I agree.

They start to head for the exit, on the way passing the fighter where
ANAKIN is hiding. ARTOO whistles a greeting as ANAKIN peeps out of the
cockpit.

ANAKIN : Hey! Wait for me.
QUI-GON : No, Annie, you stay there. Stay right where you are.
ANAKNI : But, I...
QUI-GON : Stay in that cockpit.

They head for the exit. As they are about to go through the door, suddenly
everyone scatters, revealing DARTH MAUL standing in the doorway. CAPTAIN
PANAKA, PADME, and HER TROOPS back away. QUI-GON and OBI-WAN step forward.

QUI-GON : (Cont'd) We'' handle this...

The TWO JEDI take off their capes and ignite their laser swords. DARTH MAUL
takes off his cape, and ignites his laser sword. Both ends of the sword
light up.
At the far end of the hanger, SIX WHEEL DROIDS roll in and transform into
their battle position. ARTOO calls ANAKIN's attention to the DROIDS. The
JEDI begin to fight the Sith Lord.

ANAKIN : Oh, no...

The DROIDS begin to advance and start firing on PADME and HER TROOPS.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) We gotta do something, Artoo.

ARTOO whistles a reply. Suddenly, the ship's systems go on, and the ship
begins to levitate.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) All right, thanks Artoo! Great idea! I'll take over.
Let's see...

ANAKIN steers the ship toward the DROIDS. He pushes a button, and the ship
begins to shake.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Where's the trigger? Oops, wrong one.. Maybe this one....

ANAKIN pushes a second button, and the lasers begin to fire, wiping out
several DESTROYER DROIDS. ARTOO whistles a cheer.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Yeah, all right. "Droid blaster." Yeah!

The JEDI are engaged in a fierce sword fight with DARTH MAUL. They have
moved into the center of the hanger. While the WHEEL DROIDS are momentarily
distracted by ANAKIN, CAPTAIN PANAKA, PADME, and HER TROOPS exit into a
palace hallway.
The WHEEL DROIDS start firing at ANAKIN. There are EXPLOSIONS all around
him.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Oops...shield up! Always on the right...shields always on
the right.

ANAKIN flips several switches, and the after-burner ignites.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) I know we're moving. I'll shut the energy drive down.

The fighter rockets out of the hanger. ARTOO and ANAKIN hold on for dear
life.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Oops!! Wrong one.

ARTOO beeps.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) I'm not doing anything!

ARTOO beeps.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) I know...I didn't push anything.

The SITH LORD's moves are incredible. He is fighting the TWO JEDI at once,
flipping into the air, outmaneuvering them at every turn.

INT. NABOO STARFIGHTER - COCKPIT - SPACE

The Naboo fleet leaves the planet and heads toward the space station.

RIC OLIE : Bravo Flight A, take on the fighters. Flight B, make the run on
the transmitter.
BRAVO TWO : Roger, Bravo Leader.

The fleet approaches the space station. Many Federation fighters exit the
hangers and attack.

RIC OLIE : Enemy fighters straight ahead!

EXT. NABOO GRASS PALINS - DAY

JAR JAR's clumsiness works for him in the battle. He gets caught up in the
wiring of a blasted DROID, dragging the torso around with him, the DROID's
gun firing randomly, accidently blasting SEVERAL DROIDS in one process.
OOM-9 decides to send in the WHEEL DROIDS and gives the signal. HUNDREDS OF
WHEEL DROIDS roll out of the transports and head down toward the battle.
They slowly roll through the deflector shields, then transform themselves
once they get on the other side. The GUNGANS blast the WHEEL DROIDS with
energy balls. The DESTROYER DROIDS blast many GUNGANS.

INT. NABOO STARFIGHTER - COCKPIT - SPACE

A giant dogfight ensues. ANAKIN's fighter flies into space above Naboo.
ARTOO beeps a worried concern.

ANAKIN : The Autopilot is searching for what other ships?

ARTOO beeps and whistles.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) There is no manual override, Artoo. You'll have to rewire
it or something.

ARTOO chirps that he's trying.

ANAKIN : (cont'd) Look! There they are! That's where the autopilot is
taking us.

ANAKIN's fighter flies toward the Federation Battleship.

INT. THEED - CENTRAL HANGER - DAY

The SITH LORD drives the JEDI out of the hanger and nto the power generator
area next door.

INT. THEED - POWER GENERATOR PIT - DAY

Three swords are crossed in an intense display of swordmanship. The JEDI
and the SITH LORD fight their way across the narrow bridge of the Theed
power generator. DARTH MAUL jumps onto the bridge above them. The JEDI
follow, one in front of the SITH LORD and one behind. They continue their
sword fight.

INT. THEED - PALACE - HALLWAY - DAY

PADME, CAPTAIN PANAKA, EIRTAE, SABE and THIER TROOPS are trapped in a
hallway by BATTLE DROIDS.

PADME : We don't have time for this, Captain.
CAPT. PANAKA : Let's try the outside stairway.

CAPTAIN PANAKA blasts a hole in the window, and they make their way outside
the building onto a ledge about six stories above a raging waterfall. SABE,
EIRTAE and about TWENTY NABOO SOLDIERS stay in the hallway to hold off the
BATTLE DROIDS.

EXT. THEED - PALACE - OVER WATERFALL - DAY

PADME, CAPTAIN PANAKA, and about TEN OTHER NABOO SOLDIERS are lined up
along the edge. They have pulled small attachments out of their pistols and
fire at a ledge about four stories above them. Thin cables shoot out of the
pistols and are embedded into the ledge. PADME, CAPTAIN PANAKA, and the
OTHERS begin to climb up the wall.

EXT . NABOO GRASS PLAINS DAY

The GUNGAN ARMY is no match for the DESTROYER DROIDS. JAR JAR tries to run
from the BATTLE DROIDS.

GENERAL CEEL : Retreat! Retreat!

The GUNGANS begin to turn and run, on foot, on their kaadu, and in wagons.
JAR JAR attempts to escape on a wagon of energy balls but only manages to
unhitch the back gate, causing all of the energy balls to roll out of the
wagon and down the hill. JAR JAR scrambles to avoid being hit by one of the
balls. FOUR DESTROYER DROIDS aren't so lucky. They get blasted by the
energy balls.
The GUNGANS renew their attack on the DROID ARMY. JAR JAR's bumbling
destroys several more DESTROYER DROIDS.

INT. NABOO STARFIGHTER - COCKPIT -SPACE

ANAKIN finds himself in the middle of the space battle. A ship explodes
behind him (over his left shoulder).

ANAKIN : Whoo, boy! This is tense!

He looks forward to see enemy ships approaching head on.

ANAKN : (Cont'd) : Oops! Artoo, get us off Autopilot!

ARTOO screams a reply.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) I've got control?

ANAKIN fips switches.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Okay, let's go left!

He moves the controls left and the ship responds, turning left.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Yes...I've got control. You did it, Artoo!

ARTOO beeps

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Go back!?! Qui-Gon told me to stay in this cockpit and
that's what I'm gonna do. Now c'mon!

An enemy fighter comes into his sights. ANAKIN pushes the controls and
instead of firing, his fighter accelerates past the enemy ship.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Oops! Whoa!

Now the enemy ship is on his tail. He tries evasive maneauvers.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) I'll try spinning, that's a good trick.

ANAKIN rolls the ship as ARTOO screams desperately.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) I know we're in trouble! Hang on! The way out of this
mess is the way we got into it.

ARTOO beeps a reply.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Which one? This one?

ANAKIN yanks on the reverse thrusters and the ship slows instantly- the
enemy fighter shoots past and explodes against the space station.

INT. NABOO STARFIGHTER - COCKPIT - SPACE

The SQUADRON attacks the space station.

RIC OLIE : Bravo flight...go for the central bridge.
BRAVO TWO : ROger, Bravo Leader.

The attack is fruitless.

RIC OLIE : Their deflector shield is too strong. We'll never get through
it.

Meanwhile, ANAKIN is being chased by another fighter. ARTOO shrieks.

ANAKIN : I know, Artoo! This isn't Podracing!

The enemy ship fires and hits ANAKIN's fighter, sending it into a spin.
ARTOO screams.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) We're hit!

ANAKIN regains control as his ship enters the space station hanger.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Great gobs of bantha poo-doo!

ANAKIN's ship dodges parked transport ships and other obstacles. A huge
bulkhead blocks his way. ARTOO beeps.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) I'm trying to stop! I'm trying to stop! Whoa!

ANAKIN hits the reverse thrusters and the ship skids to a stop on the
hanger deck. ARTOO givesout a worried whistle.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) All right! All right! Get the system started!

ANAKIN ducks down to adjust a control panel.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Everything's overheated. All the lights are red.

ARTOO sees DROIDS appraoching, and beeps frantically.

INT. THEED - POWER GENERATOR PIT - DAY

The laser sword battle continues on the small catwalk around the vast power
pit. DARTH MAUL kicks OBI-WAN off one of the ramps and he falls several
levels. QUI-GON knocks the DARK LORD off another ramp, and he lands hard on
a ramp two levels below. QUI-GON jumps down after him. The DARK LORD backs
away along the catwalk into a small door. QUI-GON follows as OBI-WAN runs
to catch up.

INT. THEED - POWER GENERATOR ELECRIC BEAM - HALLWAY

The SITH LORD, followed by QUI-GON, enters a long hallway filled with a
series of deadly rays that go on and off in a pulsing pattern that shoots
down the corridor every minute or so. DARTH MAUL makes it down several
walls of deadly rays before they close. QUI-GON is one wall away from the
DARK LORD. OBI-WAN is just starting into it and is five walls way from
DARTH MAUL.
The JEDI must wait until the next pulse to advance down the corridor.
OBI-WAN is impatient and paces, waiting for the wall of rays to open.
QUI-GON sits and meditates. The SITH LORD tries to patch up his wounds.

INT. THEED - PALACE - HALLWAY TO THRONE ROOM

A window in the hallway blasts apart. PADME, CAPTAIN PANAKA, and HER
SOLDIERS climb into the hallway. They head for the door to the throne roo.
Suddenly, two DESTROYER DROIDS skitter in front of the door. PADME turns
around and sees TWO MORE appear at the far end of the hallway, trapping
them in the middle.
PADME throws down her pistol and turns to CAPTAIN PANAKA.

PADME : Throw down your weapons. They win this round.
CAPT. PANAKA : But we can't....
PADME : Captain, I said throw down your weapons.

CAPTAIN PANAKA and HIS MEN throw down their weapons.

EXT. NABOO GRASS PLAINS - DAY

A DESTROYER DROID blasts one of the shield generators, causing it to
EXPLODE. The protective shield begins to weaken and fall apart.OOM-9 sees
the shield weaken and orders his tanks forward. The GUNGAN GENERAL signals
a retreat as the tanks enter the battle.
The GUNGANS flee as fast as they can. JAR JAR is blown off his KAADU and
lands on one of the tank guns. A GUNGAN WARRIOR signals JAR JAR to jump
off. JAR JAR is afraid. The gun swings around trying to knock JAR JAR off.
JAR JAR hangs from the tank barrel as it moves along. Finally, he jumps
onto a KAADU behind a GUNGAN WARRIOR. EXPLOSIONS from the tank fire are
everywhere. It is chaos.

INT. THEED - POWER GENERATOR ELECTRIC BEAM - HALLWAY

The electric rays cycle as QUI-GON sits meditating. The wall of the deadly
rays turn away, and OBI-WAN starts running toward QUI-GON and the DARK
LORD. When the wall between QUI-GON and DARTH MAUL opens, QUI-GON is in a
split second fighting the DARK LORD with a ferocity not seen before. They
move into the area at the end of the corridor called the melting pit, a
small area that is mostly made up of a deep hole.
The electron ray gates begin to close. OBI-WAN tries to make it to the
melting pit but is caught one gate short. He slides to a stop just before
he hits the deadly electron field.
QUI-GON and DARTH MAUL battle around the melting pit as a frustrated
OBI-WAN watches.
DARTH MAUL cathces QUI-GON off guard. The SITH makes a quick move, bashes
his lightsaber handle into QUI-GON's chin, and runs him through. QUI-GON
slumps to the floor in a heap.

EXT. NABOO GRASS PLAINS - DAY

The GUNGANS have beeb overrun. Some flee into the hills, chased by BATTLE
DROIDS on STAPS. Many OTHERS are herded into groups by BATTLE DROIDS and
DESTROYER DROIDS.
JAR JAR and GENERAL CEEL are held in a small group with OTHER OFFICERS.

JAR JAR : Dissa bad, berry bombad.
GENERAL CEEL : Mesa hopen dissa working for da Queen.

INT. THED - PALACE THRONE ROOM - DAY

PADME, CAPTAIN PANAKA, and SIX OTHER OFFICERS are brought by TEN BATTLE
DROIDS before NUTE and RUNE and FOUR NEIMOIDIAN COUNCIL MEMBERS.

NUTE : Your little insurrection is at an end, Your Highness. Time for you
to sign the treaty...and end this pointless debate in the Senate.

SADBE dressed like the Queen appears in the doorway with SEVERAL TROOPS.
Several destroyed battle droids can be seen in the distance.

SABE : I will not be signing any treaty, Viceroy, because you've lost!

NUTE and THE OTHERS are stunned to see a SECOND QUEEN. NUTE yells at the
TEN GUARDS in the room.

NUTE : After her! This one is a decoy!

SIX OF THE DROIDS rush out of the throne room after SABE. NUTE turns to
PADME.

NUTE : (Cont'd) Your Queen will not get away with this.

PADME slumps down on her throne and immediately hits a security button that
opens a panel in her desk opposite CAPTAIN PANAKA.
PADME grabs two pistols, tosses one of the to CAPTAIN PANAKA and one to an
OFFICER. She takes a third pistol and BLASTS the last of the BATTLE DROIDS.
The OFFICERS rush to the door control panel as PADME hits the switch to
close the door. The OFFICER at the door jams the controls. CAPTAIN PANAKA
throws more pistols to the OTHER GUARDS. The NEIMODIANS are confused and
afraid.

PADME : Now, Viceroy, this is the end of your occupation here.
NUTE : Don't be absurd. There are too few of you. It won't be long before
hundreds of destroyer droids break in to rescue us.

INT. THEED - POWER GENERATOR - MELTING PIT

OBI-WAN screams as the pulsing electron gate opens, and the SITH LORD
attacks him. The DARK LORD is relentless in his assault on the young JEDI.
OBI-WAN and DARTH MAUL use the Force to fling objects at each other as they
fight. DARTH MAUL seems to have the upper hand as OBI-WAN grows weary.
DARTH MAUL catches OBI-WAN off guard, and the JEDI slips into a melting
pit. He is barely able to hold onto a nozzle on the side of the pit. DARTH
MAUL grin evilly at OBI-WAN as he kicks OBI-WAN's lightsaber down the
endless shaft.
The SITH LORD smiles as he goes in for the kill. At the last moment,
OBI-WAN jumps up out of the pit, calls QUI-GON's lightsaber to hi, throwing
DARTH MAUL off. The young JEDI swings with a vengeance, cutting the SITH
down. DARTH MAUL falls into the melting pit to his death.
OBI-WAN rushes over to QUI-GON, who is dying.

OBI-WAN : Master! Master!
QUI-GON : It is too late...It's...
OBI-WAN : No!
QUI-GON : Obi-Wan promise...promise me you'll train the boy...
OBI-WAN : Yes, Master...
QUI-GON : He is the chosen one...he will...bring balance...train him!

QUI-GON dies. OBI-WAN cradles his Master, quietly weeping.

INT. NABOO STARFIGHTER - COCKPIT - FEDERATION HANGER

ANAKIN peeks over the edge of the cockpit to see BATTLE DROIDS surrounding
the ship. He ducks back down.

ANAKIN : Uh oh. This is not good.

He looks at the dashboard to see red lights.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) The systems are still overheated, Artoo.

The BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN walks up to the ship and sees ARTOO.

BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN : Where's your pilot?

ARTOO beeps a reply.

BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN : (Cont'd) You're the pilot?

ARTOO whistles.

BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN : (Cont'd) Let me see your identification!

ANAKIN sees the dashboard lights go from red to green.

ANAKIN : Yes...we have ignition.

He flips the switch and the engine starts.

BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN : (seeing Anakin) You! Come out of there or we'll
blast you!
ANAKIN : Not if I can help it! Shields up!

ANAKIN flips a switch and the ship levitates, knocking over the BATTLE
DROID CAPTAIN. The OTHER DROIDS shoot, but the lasers are deflected by
ANAKIN's shields. ARTOO beeeps.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) This should stop them.

ANAKIN fires lasers as the ship begins to rotate.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) ...and take this!

He presses a button and launches two torpedos which miss the DROIDS.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Darn...I missed!

The two torpedos fly down a hallway and explode inside the reactor room.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Let's get out of here!

ANAKIN's ship roars through the hanger deck, bouncing over the DROIDS.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Now, this is Podracing! Whoopee!

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

TEY HOW turns to CAPTAIN DOFINE.

TEY HOW : Sir, we're losing power... There is some problem with the main
reactor...
DOFINE : Impossible!! I don't...

The bridge explodes.

INT. NABOO FIGHTER - COCKPIT - SPACE

RIC OLIE watches in amazement as the Federation battleship starts to
explode from the inside out.

BRAVO TWO : What's that?? It's blowing up from the inside.
RIC OLIE : I don't know, we didn't hit it.
BRAVO THREE : Look! One of ours! Outta the main hold!!

EXT. NABOO GRASS PLAINS - DAY

Suddenly, all of the DROIDS begin to shake upside down, run around in
circles, then stop. The GUNGANS carefully move out to inspect the FROZEN
DROIDS. JAR JAR pushes one of the BATTLE DROIDS, and it falls over.

JAR JAR : Wierdind...

EXT. THEED - CENTRAL HANGER - DAY

ANAKIN and ARTOO follow the squad of yellow Naboo starfighters into the
main hanger.

INT. THEED - CENTRAL HANGER - DAY

RIC OLIE and the OTHER PILOTS gather around as thye exit their ships.

BRAVO TWO : He flew into the hold, behind the deflector shield and blasted
the main reactor...
BRAVO THREE : Amazing... They don't teach that in the academy.

ANAKIN's ship skids to a stop behind the other Naboo starfighters. RIC
OLIE, BRAVO TWO, the OTHER PILOTS, and GROUND CREW rush to his ship.

RIC OLIE : We're all accounted for. Who flew that ship?

ANAKIN sheepishly opens the cockpit and stands up. All the PILOTS stare in
amazement.

ANAKIN : I'm not going to get into trouble, am I?

ARTOO beeps. oh. oh.

INT. MAIN HANGER - COURTYARD - DAY

The large, grand cruiser of the Supreme Chancellor lands in the courtyard
of the main hanger. CAPTAIN PANAKA and TWENTY TROOPS guard NUTE GUNRAY and
RUNE HAAKO. OBI-WAN, the QUEEN, and her HANDMAIDENS stand before the
NEIMOIDIANS.

PADME : Now, Viceroy, you are going to have to go back to the Senate and
explain all this.
CAPT. PANAKA : I think you can kiss your Trade franchise goodbye.

The main ramp of the cruiser is lowered as OBI-WAN and CAPTAIN PANAKA lead
the VICEROY and HIS ASSISTANT toward the ship. The GRAND CHANCELLOR
PALPATINE and SEVERAL REPUBLIC GUARDS descend the walkway, followed by YODA
and SEVERAL OTHER JEDI MASTERS.

The CHANCELLOR PALPATINE is greeted by the QUEEN.

AMIDALA : Congratulations on youer election, Chancellor. It is so good to
see you again.
PALPATINE : It's good to be home. Your boldness has saved our people, Your
Majesty. It is you who should be congratulated. Together we shall bring
peace and prosperity to the Republic.

OBI-WAN greets YODA and the OTHER JEDI as CAPTAIN PANAKA takes the
NEIMODIANS onto the cruiser.

INT. TURRET ROOM - NABOO PALACE - LATE DAY

The sun streams into the multi-windowed room at a low angle. It is not
quite sunset. YODA paces before OBI-WAN, who is kneeling in the center of
the room.

YODA : Confer on you, the level of Jedi Knight the Coucil does. But agree
on you taking this boy as your Padawan learner, I do not.
OBI-WAN : Qui-Gon believed in him. I believe in Qui-Gon.
YODA : The Chosen One the boy may be; nevertheless, grave danger I fear in
his training.
OBI-WAN : Master Yoda, Igave Qui-Gon my word. I will train Anakin. Without
the approval of the Council if I must.
YODA : Qui-Gon's defiance I sense in you. Need that, you do not. Agree, the
council does. Your apprentice, young Skywalker will be.

EXT. THEED - CENTRAL PLAZA - FUNERAL TEMPLE STEPS - SUNSET

QUI-GON's body goes up in flames as the JEDI COUNCIL, the QUEEN, SIO
BIBBLE, CAPTAIN PANAKA, the HANDMAIDENS, and ABOUT ONE HUNDRED NABOO
TROOPES, TWENTY OTHER JEDI, PALPATINE, OBI-WAN (standing with ANAKIN), JAR
JAR, BOSS NASS, and TWENTY OTHER GUNGAN WARRIORS watch. There is a drum
roll that stops. Doves are released, and the body is gone. ANAKIN looks to
OBI-WAN.

OBI-WAN : He is one with the Force, Anakin...You must let go.
ANAKIN : What will happen to me now?
OBI-WAN : I am your Master now. You will become a Jedi, I promise.

To one side, MACE WINDU turns to YODA.

MACE WINDU : There is no doubt. The mysterious warrior was a Sith.
YODA : Always two there are....no more...no less. A maste and an
apprentice.
MACE WINDU : But which one was destroyed, the master or the apprentice?

They give each other a concerned look.

               EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

               The wail of a siren grows out of the distance and very faintly 
               through the fog we see the headlights and flashing blue rack 
               lights of a police car coming toward us. It drops into a 
               dip, reappears almost immediately, hurtling down the center 
               of the deserted highway. It gets closer and closer until the 
               lights and siren fill our senses then zooms past us.

               INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT

               A frightened SECURITY GUARD is tensed forward off the back 
               seat, his hands clutched into the fabric between the two 
               regular POLICE OFFICERS in front.

                                     GUARD
                              (an edge of fear in 
                              his voice)
                         It's coming up... Slow down...
                              (he points out between 
                              them)
                         There, right there...

               Through the windshield we can see the headlights pick up a 
               billboard announcing a 'new' housing development.

               EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

               The squad car skids off the asphalt in front of the sign and 
               starts up a rutted dirt road. The sign tells us we are headed 
               for 'Pinewood Estates,' a housing development financed by 
               the Farmers Bank of Wisconsin.

               INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT

               The Security Guard is becoming more agitated. He wipes a 
               cold sweat off his brow. The blue flashers reflect off the 
               fog onto the faces of the men. Suddenly the Security Guard 
               lunges forward and slaps off the rack lights and siren.

                                     OFFICER
                              (startled)
                         Benny, God, take it easy...

                                     BENNY (GUARD)
                         I don't want to scare them away.

               The two Police Officers exchange an indulgent look.

               EXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT

               Using only its parking lights, the police car creeps up the 
               dirt road between skeletons of unfinished houses.

               INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT

               The windows are rolled down. Periodically one of the men 
               leans out for a better look at the terrain around them.

                                     SECOND OFFICER
                         Smells smoke...

                         I told you.

               EXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT

               The police car comes around a curve on the hillside and stops. 
               Above them on the next hill, a necklace of embers from a 
               grass fire and a burning tree flicker through the fog. The 
               men get out of the car.

                                     BENNY
                              (loud whisper)
                         There!! Up on the hill!!

               The officer steps forward for a better look. Benny hangs on 
               his shoulder.

                                     BENNY
                         Right in line with that burning tree.

                                     OFFICER
                         I don't see anything.

                                     BENNY
                         It's there. The fog's thicker now, 
                         but it's there. What do you think 
                         started those fires?

               The officer strains to see through the fog.

                                     OFFICER
                         Benny, there's nothing there.

                                     BENNY
                         There is. They came out of the belly 
                         of the ship and then went to the 
                         first terrace and flew down into the 
                         houses.

                                     OFFICER
                         Flew?! Oh, come on Benny...

               The second officer is peering intently at something down 
               among the houses.

                                     OFFICER
                         You hear that, Mike? Now he's telling 
                         us...

                                     MIKE (SECOND OFFICER)
                         What's that?

               Benny and the officer look to where Mike is pointing. What 
               appears to be the beam of a powerful headlight bobs among 
               the houses below them. Further into the track another beam 
               of light moves slightly from right to left but seems otherwise 
               stationary.

                                     BENNY
                         What did I tell you?

                                     OFFICER
                         Probably kids.

               One of the lights rises over a house and settles on the other 
               side.

                                     MIKE
                              (not convinced)
                         Probably...

               EXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT

               A light shines directly into our eyes. As it swings away 
               from us we realize that it was the searchlight on the police 
               car which is idling along the dirt road with its running 
               lights off. The fire on the hill gives the fog down here a 
               red tint.

               INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT

               The police officers are beginning to feel anxious. Benny's 
               nervous fidgeting in the back seat doesn't help them any.

                                     BENNY
                         Don't you think you should call a 
                         backup?

                                     OFFICER
                         No, we can handle this.

               EXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT

               The police car passes a road perpendicular to the one it is 
               on. A couple of houses down that road a faint glow spills 
               over the sides of an industrial dumpster. As we watch we 
               hear an eerie high pitched whistle, a shaft of light slowly 
               rises out of the metal box and seems to fly off between the 
               houses.

               INT. FINISHED HOUSE - NIGHT

               As a humanoid silhouette passes in front of the picture 
               window, a shaft of light floats by in the fog outside. The 
               silhouette continues around to look at the kitchen. It raises 
               a hand to eye level. There is a sharp "SNAP" and a hard-edged 
               cone of light shoots out of the darkness to capture the inside 
               of the kitchen and pulls back a three-dimensional image of 
               stove, sink, cupboards, electrical fixtures and walls to the 
               silhouette.

               EXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT

               The police car is parked in the middle of the dirt road. 
               Benny and the officers are intent on a light that reaches 
               them only in strobes as it moves through the houses in the 
               direction of the fire on the hill. The police searchlight 
               swings onto the house.

                                     OFFICER
                              (over outside speakers)
                         This is the police. Identify 
                         yourselves.

               It is deathly silent.

               Carrying a shotgun the officer motions Benny and Mike to fan 
               out on either side of him and, guns drawn, they cut across 
               the tract to where they last saw the bobbing light.

               The fog quickly isolates them, heightening their fear. Each 
               man becomes acutely aware of the loudness of his breathing 
               and the crunch of his footsteps on the ground. They drift in 
               and out of visual contact with each other.

               Benny freezes as he hears a burst of the high pitched whistle 
               sweep by on his left. He turns slowly to see, through the 
               ribs of an unfinished house, a shaft of the white light 
               pointing at a cement mixer.

                                     BENNY
                              (to the officers, his 
                              voice cracking)
                         There's one over here...

               The brilliant light swings toward him. Benny, his hands 
               trembling, raises the gun.

                                     BENNY
                         Stop!! Police!!

               The light fixes on Benny and terrified he shakes off a couple 
               shots. The light goes out immediately.

                                     MIKE
                              (in Benny's direction)
                         What happened?

                                     BENNY
                         I think I shot one.

                                     MIKE
                         Jesus, Benny. What are you doing?

               INT. FINISHED HOUSE (BEDROOM) - NIGHT

               We are looking at the back of the humanoid figure. It crosses 
               to a high window and looks out. The reddish tinge of the fog 
               outlines him.

               EXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT

               The men strain to see something through the silent fog.

                                     OFFICER
                         You see anything, Mike?

               Before Mike can answer, a strange percussive clicking sound 
               is heard. He pumps a shell in the chamber of his shotgun and 
               swallowing his fear moves toward the voices. They stop.

                                     OFFICER
                         This is the police. Identify 
                         yourselves.

               Benny, his flashlight throwing a feeble beam in front of 
               him, inches around the house looking for what he shot at. He 
               gets to where it should be but it's not there. His light 
               searches the area. There is nothing but a stack of lumber. 
               Shaking visibly he shuffles to it and peers around its corner. 
               Nothing. Benny relaxes and allows himself to breathe again.

                                     BENNY
                              (shouts to the officers)
                         You wanna give me some help over 
                         here.

                                     MIKE
                         Okay...

               Benny continues around the house. He flashes his light into 
               a doorway. There is nothing but framing. When he moves on, a 
               figure steps out of the darkness to fill the space, then 
               raises its arms. With a sharp snap cylindrical devices swing 
               off its wrist into its hands.

               At the corner of the house Benny hears the snap and stops. 
               The high pitched whistle starts behind him. He stumbles around 
               to face a brilliant white light flying directly at him. Benny 
               screams in terror and fires at it. The light swerves and a 
               laser streak from one of the hand rockets sears Benny's chest 
               and knocks him to the ground in pain. Holding his shoulder 
               he watches the light rise and fall erratically between the 
               houses.

               The officers watch in awe as the beam wobbles through the 
               air, then crashes to the earth.

                                     OFFICER
                         Mike, call for back-up.
                              (shouting)
                         Benny, you all right?

                                     BENNY
                         I don't think so...
                              (clutching his shoulder)

                                     OFFICER
                              (waving the beam of 
                              his flashlight, shouts)
                         Benny, this is me. I'm going to take 
                         a look.

               Benny's beam flashes back.

                                     BENNY
                         Don't leave me. I'm coming.

               The two men begin to trot toward the light. It swings wildly 
               around and, accompanied by the high-pitched whistle, starts 
               to stagger back up the hill. Benny and the officer break 
               into a run. They are on their way up the hill when the light 
               in front of them crashes to the earth. It rolls over and 
               lays still, the beam shooting straight up into the air. Benny 
               and the officer slow their pursuit, terrified of what they 
               might find. Suddenly a high-pitched whistle is bearing down 
               on them from behind. Before they can turn a light rockets 
               over their heads. With a rumble the hill begins to vibrate. 
               As they follow its flight, they see lights beginning to ripple 
               to life across the skin of a saucer-shaped spacecraft resting 
               at the edge of the forest on top of the hill. With a rumble 
               the hill begins to vibrate. Frightened, the officers stop.

               INT. FINISHED HOUSE - NIGHT

               The humanoid figure walks rapidly down the hall into the 
               kitchen. An indistinct image plays on the inside of its 
               faceplate and we hear the faint sounds of a percussive 
               language. Through the window over the sink we can see the 
               lights of the spaceship.

               The rockets flip into the humanoid's gloved hands and it is 
               airborne out the open back door.

               EXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT

               From the road Benny and the officer watch as the humanoid 
               figure that just blasted over them flies between the trees 
               and into the white light emitting from the underbelly of the 
               spacecraft. The noise from the ship's power plant is deafening 
               as it begins to rise above the trees.

               With Mike at the wheel the police car, its rack lights 
               flashing, fishtails up the dirt road and slides sideways to 
               a bone-jarring stop next to Benny and the officer. As they 
               jump out of the way they find themselves facing into the 
               super white beam of the figure that was in the house. They 
               are between it and the ship. At the angle that it is coming 
               up the hill, the light looks like it is heading directly for 
               them. This is too much for the officer and in terror he raises 
               his shotgun and fires wildly at it. The figure veers off and 
               disappears into the fog.

               With an awesome roar the spacecraft reaches escape velocity 
               and hurtles into the night sky. The concussion waves knock 
               Benny and the officers off their feet.

               EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

               The escaped figure's light comes out of the fog at tree 
               height. We hear the high-pitched whistle of its rockets. A 
               burst of percussive language comes from behind the faceplate.

               EXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT

               The fires on the hillside have been renewed. Shaking, Benny 
               and the officer rise to their feet and start toward the light 
               shafting straight up from the figure lying on the hillside. 
               The only sound is police chatter coming out of the radio in 
               the open squad car.

               EXT. LOGGING ROAD - NIGHT

               An 18-wheeler with a load of logs lumbers past us.

               INT. TRUCK - NIGHT

               It feels cozy with the wipers slapping the rain off the 
               windshield. The DRIVER is trying to steal a cigarette out of 
               his snoring PARTNER'S pocket without waking him up. He gets 
               one and reaches for the lighter.

               EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

               The escaped figure banks around a blind corner.

               INT. TRUCK - NIGHT

               The driver gets a glimpse of something in his headlights and 
               slams on the brakes, but it is too late. The figure hits the 
               spoiler above the cab. We hear the smack of impact. One of 
               its boots scars the windshield.

               EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

               The figure bounces off the jack-knifing truck and like a 
               wounded bird tumbles through the air into the trees. With 
               the light spinning crazily, it plunges through the boughs 
               and smashes face first into the mud at the bottom of an 
               embankment. The strip lights on the sides of its helmet go 
               out.

               EXT. TRUCK - NIGHT

               The driver and his partner, standing in the shafts of the 
               high beams, are peering into the woods.

                                     PARTNER
                         What the hell was it anyway?

                                     DRIVER
                         Damned if I know.

               EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

               The figure thrashes over on its back and tries to close a 
               shoulder-to-hip tear in its life-support suit. By the faint 
               identification light that flickers on and off inside its 
               helmet, we see a MAN FROM THE STARS. His skin is translucent 
               coral. He is gasping as our atmosphere mixes with his and 
               threatens to suffocate him.

               Under his translucent skin a maze of veins and arteries extend 
               from a white mass that sits in the upper half of his head. 
               He is hairless. Underneath a graceful fore-head, transparent 
               eyelids droop over black pupilless eyes. The thin lips that 
               delineate his mouth are chalk-white.

               He tries to clutch the edges of the tear together but is too 
               weak. His hands drop limply from the suit, allowing the rent 
               to gape open and reveal the translucent body underneath.

                                     PARTNER (V.O.)
                         Come on. I'm getting wet.

                                     DRIVER (V.O.)
                         It musta been a bird.

                                     PARTNER (V.O.)
                         How about if I drive now?

               Behind the faceplate a piece of white light breaks off from 
               the shining mass in the STAR MAN'S head and moves down his 
               neck. Through the hole in the suit we see it arrive at the 
               top of his single lung. The white light spreads throughout 
               the organ like a phosphorescent tide. The STAR MAN lapses 
               into unconsciousness as we hear the truck pull away.

               INT. HELICOPTER (COCKPIT) - DAWNBREAK

               A light rain is falling.

               We are looking through the windscreen at the gray landscape 
               passing under the helicopter. MARC SHERMIN, a grizzled man 
               in his mid-fifties with an honest stubborn face, shifts his 
               attention from the right side to the left side of the craft. 
               Below him he can see the road leading into the housing tract 
               is blocked by police cars. The helicopter leans into a banking 
               turn and the spacecraft's blackened landing site comes into 
               view. Below it an orange nylon tent has been erected over 
               the dead extraterrestrial. It glows from the inside. An Air 
               Force helicopter is parked on the other side of the burn.

               EXT. HOUSING TRACT - DAWNBREAK

               A man in a white contamination suit is helping Benny and the 
               two officers into the Air Force helicopter. The three men 
               are glassy-eyed and wrapped in blankets. Benny has a bandage 
               across his chest. They look up at Shermin's descending 
               helicopter. They are still looking at it when they disappear 
               inside.

               Shermin's unmarked S65 settles on the clearing. The nose 
               door is open and Shermin, carrying the hood of his 
               contamination suit, comes down the ladder. A tall homespun 
               man, also in a hoodless contamination suit, steps forward to 
               greet him.

                                     MAN
                              (around a cigarette)
                         Major Aaron Bell...

                                     SHERMIN
                         Marc Shermin, National Security 
                         Agency.

               Shermin takes a moment to look over at the tent, the green 
               hillside and the forest beyond. It is pastoral in the soft 
               light of dawn.

                                     SHERMIN
                         This has always been my favorite 
                         time of day.

                                     MAJOR BELL (MAN)
                         Very beautiful country up here...

                                     SHERMIN
                         Any signs of biological contamination, 
                         excessive radiation, anything like 
                         that?

                                     MAJOR BELL
                         Not on the landscape. We're trying 
                         to get a tube under the faceplate 
                         for a reading on possible deadly 
                         lifeforms but it's hard going.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Can you see under the faceplate?

                                     MAJOR BELL
                         No.

               Bell's hands shake as he lights a new cigarette off the one 
               in his mouth.

                                     SHERMIN
                         There's a good chance you could be 
                         wrong about this thing then...

                                     MAJOR BELL
                         Wait'll you see it.

               He throws away the cigarette and begins to put on his 
               contamination hood. Shermin follows as they start for the 
               tent.

                                     MAJOR BELL
                         We had a flight of F16's play tag 
                         with the spaceship over Michigan for 
                         an hour. Then it shot straight up 
                         and disappeared.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Was there visual contact?

                                     MAJOR BELL
                         No, sir. Radar.

                                     SHERMIN
                         It could have been anything.

               EXT. BLACKENED LANDING SITE - DAWNBREAK

               Hooded, Bell and Shermin make their way past three suited 
               scientists examining the landscape with geiger counters and 
               other sensing instruments. With the coming of dawn and Bell's 
               handlight we can clearly see the pod indentations and the 
               huge black glass cup of earth that was fused by the energy 
               blasting out of the spaceship's power plant.

                                     MAJOR BELL
                         After I called in, I had a chance to 
                         sit down with the three locals. They 
                         swear there's another one that didn't 
                         make the ship... It might be alive.

                                     SHERMIN
                         People have made mistakes in these 
                         situations before.

                                     MAJOR BELL
                         I've been investigating sightings 
                         for seventeen years, Mr. Shermin. 
                         This one's real. We have a dead extra-
                         terrestrial in that tent and another 
                         one in the area that might be alive. 
                         We've been visited. It's finally 
                         happened and the sooner Washington 
                         accepts that and starts figuring out 
                         how we're going to deal with these 
                         beings, the better off we're going 
                         to be.

               EXT. FOOT OF EMBANKMENT - DAWNBREAK

               It is still raining.

               The STAR MAN stirs and awakens with a start. He parts the 
               tear in his suit and looks at his lung through his translucent 
               body. It has changed in color from brown to a rich yellow 
               ocher. He takes several deep breaths of our atmosphere and 
               his lung expands and contracts easily. He conducts a quick 
               inventory of his damaged spacesuit, then struggles to his 
               knees and stands up.

               INT. BIOQUARANTINE TENT (HOUSING TRACT) - DAWNBREAK

               The sound of a powerful slow-speed drill greets Bell and 
               Shermin as they enter. The extraterrestrial is still on its 
               back with its helmet lights shining straight up. A hose that 
               extends from a portable gas chromatograph has been suction-
               sealed to a corner of the faceplate. A SCIENTIST is making 
               adjustments at the chromatograph while his COMPANION is 
               monitoring the progress of the drill into the faceplate. 
               Both are wearing contamination suits.

               A foam-lined coffin-shaped metal box is on the ground next 
               to one of the walls. Bell and Shermin approach the body. 
               Shermin's first look is at the faceplate, but all he can see 
               is his own reflection. His eyes travel down the body.

                                     MAJOR BELL
                         Look at the hands.

               The gloved hands of the figure have only three fingers and a 
               thumb.

               Shermin takes Bell's flashlight. He angles it at the 
               faceplate. As he leans in to follow the beam, the pitch of 
               the drill rises. He shifts the light. The drill breaks through 
               and the faceplate explodes out of the helmet. The men throw 
               themselves back in panic. When they turn back to look, 
               distorted impressions of the face inside the helmet reflect 
               on the glass of their contamination hoods. (Pause)

                                     SHERMIN
                         Oh, Jesus.

                                     MAJOR BELL
                              (moving toward the 
                              body)
                         We better get it into the box. Come 
                         on...

               The other men approach the body but before they can bend to 
               it a burst of percussive language, followed by a low buzz, 
               comes from inside the extraterrestrial's helmet. The men 
               freeze. There is another burst of percussive language and a 
               projection beam shoots out of the helmet throwing the image 
               of the escaped STAR MAN onto one of the scientists. He jumps 
               aside and the beam falls out of focus and indistinct on the 
               tent wall behind him.

                              (incredulous)
                         The other one is alive!

               EXT. FOOT OF EMBANKMENT - DAWNBREAK

               The STAR MAN is standing. We hear the sounds of his percussive 
               language coming from behind his mirrored faceplate.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (subtitle)
                         Mapmaker Wind. Do you hear me?

               His answer is nothing but the low buzz. He taps a series of 
               buttons on his chest panel and speaks again.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Mapmaker Wind. Do you hear me?

               Again the buzz.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Mapmaker Wind. Do you hear me?

               The buzz continues. He is very still for a moment. Then he 
               presses the palms of his hands together, prayer fashion, and 
               concentrates. When he pulls them apart, a blue force field 
               pulses between them. He stops at shoulder width. A solarized 
               aerial view of the United States forms on the force field. A 
               green dot appears in the area of western Wisconsin, a red 
               dot in the area of Death Valley, California. He drops his 
               hands to his lap and sits very still. The solarized compass 
               remains floating in the air in front of him. After a long 
               moment he reaches up and squeezes it into a ball that 
               disappears when his palms come together.

               INT. HELICOPTER - DAWNBREAK

               Shermin steps through the open bay door into a communications 
               room. The radar and radio consoles each have a TECHNICIAN. A 
               third technician, LYMAN, sits in front of a square of six 
               medium-sized television screens.

                                     LYMAN
                         Is it for real?

                                     SHERMIN
                         Get Fox.

               Lyman taps a code into the computer keyboard. There's a shower 
               of static on one of the TV screens. When it clears up GEORGE 
               FOX, mid-forties, hair slicked straight back, round wire-
               rimmed glasses, is peering intently into the camera.

                                     SHERMIN
                              (before Fox can speak)
                         It's real, George.

                                     SHERMIN
                         I saw it with my own eyes. We've 
                         killed an extraterrestrial and...

                                     FOX
                         Is there any possibility that it's a 
                         hoax? Could you be mistaken?

                                     SHERMIN
                         None. And there's another one in the 
                         area that's alive. I don't know if 
                         it's the only one. I don't know if 
                         it was left here by accident or it's 
                         part of an inva...

                         to Wright Patterson. They'll take it 
                         from there... We didn't expect this,

                                     SHERMIN
                              (answering the 
                              accusation)
                         Neither did I.

               Major Bell enters the helicopter.

                         We'll tell the press that there was

                         That cover cannot be violated in any

                         That this whole thing was a mistake.

                         We'll need a lot of help, George. 
                         You could hide an army up here.

                         I'm going to the White House right 
                         now. I'll try and get you everything 
                         you need.

                         we find this thing?

               Fox sits silently for a second.

                         Contain it and get back to me.

                                     SHERMIN
                         What do you mean by 'contain?'

               Fox knows Shermin is looking for a definite order.

                                     FOX
                         Just what I said.

               The television screen is reduced to static. Shermin stares 
               at it blankly then Lyman turns it off.

               EXT. HOUSING TRACT - MORNING

               The lift off of Shermin's helicopter reveals contamination -- 
               suited scientists slipping the dead extraterrestrial's coffin 
               into the Air Force helicopter.

               EXT. WOODS - DAY

               The STAR MAN, still in his life-support suit, looks surreal 
               in the twilight world under the canopy of firs. The morning 
               rain has gone. A hum of traffic pulls him across the hill to 
               a stand of alders that border the forest. Through the leaves 
               he can see a highway entering the sprawl of Eau Claire, 
               Wisconsin. The cars and trucks zipping along the asphalt are 
               of particular interest to him.

               When he has absorbed them he walks through the trees to get 
               a better look at the town. On the wind he can hear shouts 
               from students boarding a line of yellow buses in front of a 
               grade school off to his right. Suburban houses have begun to 
               snuggle up to the base of the hill he is on.

               Keeping to the tree line well above them he continues his 
               search for an avenue of escape. His head swivels to watch a 
               Volvo station wagon come down the street. It swings into the 
               driveway of the house directly below him and stops next to a 
               Mustang Hatchback. The back door opens and JENNY HAYDN, a 
               pretty girl in her mid-twenties, gets out carrying a crudely 
               lettered be-ribboned sign 'Welcome Back, Mrs. Haydn.' Female 
               voices drift up to the STAR MAN from inside the car.

                                     VOICES
                         It was great to have you back... The 
                         kids loved it. We loved it. You're 
                         doing the right thing...

               EXT. HOUSE - DAY

                                     JENNY
                         I hope so... We'll see... See you 
                         tomorrow... Bye. Bye.

                                     VOICE
                              (as the Volvo backs 
                              out of the driveway)
                         Remember you're required to have a 
                         lesson planned tomorrow.

               Jenny laughs and waves. With the Volvo moving away up the 
               street Jenny picks her newspaper off her walk and goes into 
               the house.

               EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY

               The STAR MAN presses on through the trees. He hears a light 
               plane overhead. He stops and watches until the branches cut 
               off his view. A path between two logs leads him to the tip 
               of a promontory. From behind the cedars growing there, he 
               sits and looks down on the center of Eau Claire.

               Arm in arm, a YOUNG COUPLE meander through the trees. The 
               boy has a blanket over his shoulder and the girl's hair is 
               disheveled. Without seeing him, they walk past the STAR MAN 
               crouched in a thicket of small pines. After they've gone by, 
               he straightens up and watches them walk down toward the 
               highway.

               EXT. HILLSIDE - LATE AFTERNOON

               The sun is setting over suburban Eau Claire. The colors are 
               reflected in the STAR MAN's faceplate as he watches Jenny 
               push a hand mower over her back yard.

               He takes a dusty gray marble out of a leg pocket and while 
               Jenny finishes the lawn he rolls it between his gloves. It 
               turns a glowing gold as it grows in size. When it reaches 
               the dimensions of a baseball, he brings it close to his 
               faceplate and speaks into it.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (subtitles)
                         Iron channel message. Suit and rockets

                         atmosphere and ours in helmet allowed 
                         chemo-ion response time to adapt my 
                         body to this air. Am going to attempt 
                         extreme transformation in order to

                         practice landings. If transformation 
                         is not fatal, second message ball by 
                         next darkness.

               He opens his hands and the ball rises quickly into the sky. 
               Jenny is dumping the grass clippings into a garbage can at 
               the side of the house when the sudden motion of the message 
               ball catches her eye and she watches it quizzically until it 
               disappears.

               EXT. WISCONSIN SKIES - LATE AFTERNOON

               We are on the belly of Shermin's helicopter looking at the 
               tree tops rushing underneath.

               INT. HELICOPTER - LATE AFTERNOON

               Shermin is standing back of Lyman and Bell who are seated in 
               front of the square of television screens watching various 
               shots of the wooded landscape flowing by under them. Shermin 
               scrubs his hands over his face then bends over to stretch 
               his back.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Aghh... I'm supposed to umpire a 
                         little league game tomorrow.

                                     LYMAN
                         I wouldn't worry about it... There 
                         might not be any little league 
                         tomorrow.

               Pause.

                                     MAJOR BELL
                         I'm telling you they're probably 
                         friendly.

                                     LYMAN
                         Then why did they try and sneak in 
                         the back door? Tell me that. Why 
                         didn't they contact us first and 
                         say...

                                     RADAR TECHNICIAN
                              (loud)
                         UFO coming out of the grass.

                         Got it.

               Lyman and the technicians tap out orders to their tracking 
               units and the views of the forest on three of the television 
               screens change to images from their microwave scanners, 
               neutron back scatters and doppler radar. On a fourth screen 
               the forward-looking infrared module begins creating a picture 
               of the UFO. The men relax as they recognize the configurations 
               of a light sea plane.

                                     LYMAN
                         This is crazy. What were we going to 
                         do if that had been the ship? We 
                         have two thirty calibre machine guns, 
                         three M16's and some handguns.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Give it a rest, Lyman.

                                     MAJOR BELL
                              (after a pause)
                         I've never once heard of anybody 
                         being hurt by an extraterrestrial...

               Shermin goes hand over hand along the overhead straps to the 
               radio operator. He begins to flip through a stack of telex 
               messages.

                                     LYMAN
                         That's because the ones that were 
                         hurt, died. They couldn't talk to 
                         you.

                                     SHERMIN
                              (to technician, after 
                              a look at Lyman)
                         Any reports about monsters, people 
                         in Halloween masks, anything like 
                         that?

                                     TECHNICIAN
                         No, but there sure were a lot of 
                         people who saw lights in the sky 
                         last night. Reports are still coming 
                         in.

                              (under above)
                         I've heard of blood being drawn, 
                         sometimes they were taken for a ride 
                         in the ship, a lot of times they 
                         said they had sex... But nobody was 
                         ever hurt...

                                     LYMAN
                         But you decided those weren't real. 
                         This one is.

               There is a buzz and a red dot appears in the center of one 
               of the screens.

                                     LYMAN
                              (over his shoulder to 
                              Shermin)
                         Fox.

               He taps a three digit code and Fox comes into view.

                                     FOX
                         I've got something for you.

               A photograph of a very thin slab of yellow plastic pops up 
               on a second screen next to Fox. Above lines of glowing colored 
               dots are symbols of a hydrogen atom, pulsars, a nude man and 
               a woman and Earth's position in our solar system.

                                     FOX
                         Recognize this?

                                     MAJOR BELL
                         It's a copy of the plaque NASA sent 
                         into space on the Pioneer probes.

                                     FOX
                         Houston found it in the 
                         extraterrestrial's suit.

                         They must have picked it up in space.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Then it's not an accident that they 
                         found us.

                                     FOX
                         We don't think that's necessarily 
                         bad. At least it's a point of contact.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Not necessarily bad! If they knew we 
                         were here why didn't they let us 
                         know they were coming?

                         find the one you're looking for.

                         That's not going to happen, George, 
                         unless you get us the help you 
                         promised us.

                         We've been back and forth on this 
                         all day and keeping in mind the panic 
                         that would occur if this got to the 
                         general public, it's been decided 
                         not to expand the search at this 
                         time.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Don't let them do it this way, George. 
                         It's too important. We can't find 
                         this thing alone.

                                     FOX
                         You have to. We're trying to contact 
                         the ship. If we do, I'll let you 
                         know immediately. Good luck.

               The television screen is reduced to static. Lyman shuts it 
               off.

                         We always were.

               EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

               We are looking through the living room window at Jenny 
               watching television while she irons the clothes she plans to 
               wear to work tomorrow. The STAR MAN stands just outside the 
               light-fall in the back yard watching her.

               A commercial interrupts the old movie with a jolly fat MAN 
               in a jumpsuit touting his used cars. The two words 'We 
               have...' are repeated constantly during the pitch. 'We have 
               automatics... We have sticks... We have colors... We have 
               financing...' ...

               We move in close on the STAR MAN'S faceplate.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (practicing the human 
                              sound)
                         Wehave...
                              (more precise)
                         Wehave...
                              (well-formed)
                         Wehave...

               Jenny finishes the skirt, unplugs the iron, picks up the 
               clothes, shuts off the television, the light and heads 
               upstairs. Half way up she stops.

                                     JENNY
                              (faint through the 
                              glass)
                         Damn!

               She turns around and looks down indecisively, then hurries 
               upstairs. A light goes on in the bedroom. The STAR MAN backs 
               away to look up at it. He can't see anything. He is on his 
               way to try and get in the side door when Jenny comes clumping 
               down the stairs in an old sweatshirt and pulling on a pair 
               of jeans. She disappears into the kitchen. Without warning 
               the door ahead of him is swung open and Jenny rushes out. 
               The STAR MAN barely has time to step into the shadows. Jenny 
               grabs the handle of one of the garbage cans lined against 
               the house and drags it down to the street. When she comes 
               back for the second one we see that the STAR MAN is no longer 
               in the shadows.

               INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

               Jenny comes in and locks the door. She passes through the 
               kitchen and is on her way to the stairs when the STAR MAN 
               steps out of the darkness in the living room. A scream catches 
               in Jenny's throat.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (precise)
                         Wehave...

               Jenny bolts for the front door. At the end of the hallway 
               her foot catches in a phone cord pulling the phone off an 
               end table. The receiver is jarred out of its cradle. Jenny 
               regains her balance and gets to the door ahead of the STAR 
               MAN. She jerks it open, but the guard chain stops it three 
               inches from the jamb. Frantically, she tries again but the 
               chain holds.

               The STAR MAN slams the door shut and reaches out to grab 
               her. She flails back at him. One of her hands strikes the 
               panel on his chest and the identification light comes on 
               inside his helmet. At the sight of the STAR MAN, Jenny begins 
               to scream. He presses her back against the wall and puts a 
               mittened hand over her mouth.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Wehave...

               Jenny ceases her struggle and begins to cry. The STAR MAN 
               takes his hand away from her mouth.

                                     JENNY
                         Please don't hurt me... please... 
                         please.

               Holding her with his eyes he grasps one of Jenny's hands and 
               lifts it up to look at it.

               He raises a piece of skin off her wrist, rolls it between 
               his thumb and forefinger.

               Jenny lets out a blood-curdling scream and strikes out at 
               him. Flashes of light erupt off his exposed chest where she 
               hits. The ferocity of her attack knocks him aside and she 
               sprints up the stairs.

               The STAR MAN recovers and starts after her.

               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Jenny gets there two steps ahead of the STAR MAN. She slams 
               the door in his face and locks it. With him POUNDING ON THE 
               OUTSIDE, Jenny throws open the closet and begins rummaging 
               madly through the side pockets of her jackets and coats.

               The POUNDING STOPS. It takes her a moment to hear the silence. 
               When she does, she whirls toward the door expecting the worst, 
               but it remains closed. She waits. All she can hear is the 
               sound of the rain. She intensifies her search.

                                     JENNY
                              (hysteria creeping 
                              into her voice)
                         It's got to be here... it's got to 
                         be here...

               She finds it in the pocket of a down jacket. The Army issue 
               .45 looks big in her hand. She releases the safety and, with 
               a wary eye on the door, reaches for the phone on the night 
               table next to the bed.

               Long before the receiver gets to her ear, she can hear the 
               "BLEET" caused by the PHONE BEING OFF THE HOOK for so long 
               in the living room. She hangs up and walks around the bed to 
               sit on the corner facing the door. In the distance, we can 
               HEAR the THUMP OF AN APPROACHING HELICOPTER. After a moment's 
               indecision, Jenny gets up and releases the lock. Again she 
               waits.

               Nothing happens. With the gun ready, she turns the knob and 
               opens the door a crack. The hallway is empty. She kicks off 
               her shoes and lets herself out of the bedroom.

               INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Jenny creeps toward the stairs in her stockinged feet. She 
               looks in the bathroom. The STAR MAN isn't there. She decides 
               to go downstairs.

               INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

               The STAR MAN isn't in the living room. Jenny sidles along 
               the wall for the front door. At the archway to the den a 
               hissing sound stops her. She peers around the molding. The 
               spill from the stairwell light provides the only illumination.

               The STAR MAN is sitting on the edge of a chair with his back 
               to her. He is naked. A dot of light is HISSING around his 
               head. The shadows in the room make it difficult for Jenny to 
               tell exactly what is going on.

               Pointing the .45 at the STAR MAN, she steps into the room 
               for a better look. The floor creaks and the STAR MAN turns 
               to her. Jenny shudders at what she sees. The STAR MAN is 
               holding an 8x10 color photograph of Jenny and a man in his 
               mid-twenties standing on a beach in their bathing suits.

               The dot of light is copying the man's features onto the STAR 
               MAN'S translucent head. The top two-thirds of the face is 
               already done. Everything is perfect, even the eyes. Jenny 
               begins to tremble and lowers the gun.

                                     JENNY
                              (in a small voice)
                         No... please don't...

               She sags against the armchair, racked by sobs that are drowned 
               out by the FLAP OF THE APPROACHING HELICOPTER. The STAR MAN, 
               with the dot of light stopped on his left cheek, gets up and 
               takes the gun from her.

               He drops it on the couch and raises his eyes to the sound of 
               the helicopter NOW DIRECTLY OVER THE HOUSE. THROUGH THE 
               WINDOWS, we can SEE the searchlight scouring the hillside 
               next to the back yard.

               The STAR MAN returns to the picture and resumes his 
               transformation. He completes the chin, then continues downward 
               weaving skin and filling in the human characteristics over 
               the entire body.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. CLEAN ROOM (HOUSTON) - NIGHT

               We come down an electrical cord that ends in a micro-phone, 
               then down further to DR. BERGEN, a tall thin balding man in 
               his late fifties dressed in the medical equivalent of a 
               contamination suit.

                                     DR. BERGEN
                         The creature was hit three times...

               Using a laser light indicator Dr. Bergen shows us where.

                                     DR. BERGEN
                         ...the arm, the abdomen and the upper 
                         chest, the one in the chest being 
                         the cause of death. It shattered, 
                         for want of a better term, the 
                         creature's backbone. It's not really, 
                         because it's not jointed. It's simply 
                         a hollow shaft of very pliable 
                         silicate material, as is its entire 
                         endoskeleton. The creature seems to 
                         have tremendous regenerative powers. 
                         Although it must have died within 
                         minutes of receiving the fatal wound, 
                         the arm and abdomen wounds are almost 
                         totally healed and the bullet here...
                              (indicates with the 
                              light)
                         has begun to dissolve...

               INT. SMALL RECTANGULAR ROOM - NIGHT

               Fox, another CIVILIAN and two MEN in uniform are watching 
               the autopsy on a bank of screens which show Dr. Bergen, the 
               room and various close-ups of the dead extraterrestrial lying 
               on a white glass table lit from underneath.

                                     DR. BERGEN
                         It has veins but no blood. We think, 
                         and this is just speculation, that 
                         some form of energy flows from the 
                         brain, which is much more 
                         sophisticated than ours, throughout 
                         the rest of the body... We don't 
                         think there is any danger of bacterial 
                         contamination. Our biochemistries 
                         are too different...

               INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT

               Shermin and his crew are glued to the monitors, watching the 
               autopsy from Houston.

                                     DR. BERGEN (V.O.)
                         The flesh is gelatinous, the skin is 
                         very porous and very moist. This is 
                         another guess, but it probably comes 
                         from a planet that receives only 
                         reflected light, perhaps from a ring 
                         of moons. Its atmospheric pressure 
                         is slightly less than ours and it 
                         contains a great deal more water...

                                     FOX (V.O.)
                         Dr. Bergen, George Fox here in 
                         Washington. Can you give us an idea 
                         of why they're here?

                                     DR. BERGEN (V.O.)
                         They're so advanced... I... eh... 
                         can't imagine what they would want 
                         from us. I know they could be 
                         dangerous. But they could also be 
                         the greatest thing that ever happened 
                         to mankind...

               Shermin and his crew share mixed reactions.

               INT. JENNY'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAWNBREAK

               Jenny, sitting on the floor with her arms wrapped around her 
               knees, is reflected in a mirror fastened to the back of the 
               closet door. The STAR MAN edges around the door to look at 
               himself in the glass. In baggy tan cords, a windbreaker and 
               a plaid shirt, buttoned all the way to the neck and a button 
               in the wrong hole halfway down the front, he looks like an 
               innocent abroad. He notices the shirt is askew across his 
               chest and, with his new hands, awkwardly resets the buttons. 
               He looks himself over. His movements resemble a human's but 
               are noticeably more precise.

               The clothes seem right so he leans into the mirror to inspect 
               his face. He squeezes the skin on his cheeks, examines his 
               eyes, turns his head as far as he can to inspect the sides 
               of his face, folds his ears forward to check the skin behind 
               them and he even gives a good two-fisted tug to his hair to 
               see if it is on securely.

               He turns from the mirror and goes over to where the .45 and 
               a leg pouch from his life-support suit are lying on the bed 
               next to a snapshot of the man whose identity he has taken. 
               In the picture the man is dressed exactly as the STAR MAN is 
               now. The STAR MAN picks up the gun and the pouch and, speaking 
               to Jenny in his own language, steps to the door and motions 
               for her to follow. Jenny consciously ignores him. The STAR 
               MAN comes over, reaches down and grabs her arm to pull her 
               to her feet. Jenny squirms back, but he holds her tight. She 
               looks at the hand, almost touches it, then up at the familiar 
               yet disturbingly unfamiliar face above her.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Please...

                                     JENNY
                         Don't... don't do this... please...

               The STAR MAN gets her to her feet and hustles her out of the 
               room. On the dresser is Jenny's wedding picture. The man the 
               STAR MAN has become is her husband.

               INT. HOUSE - DAWNBREAK

               The STAR MAN pulls Jenny down the stairs.

                                     JENNY
                              (struggles to free 
                              herself)
                         You're hurting me. Stop.

               The STAR MAN guides her into the entryway and reaches for 
               the front door. Realizing his intentions, Jenny increases 
               her struggle and manages to pull away.

                                     JENNY
                         Oh, God, no! I'm not leaving this 
                         house with you. You're going to hurt 
                         me, I know...

               The STAR MAN looks intently at her, then opens the front 
               door. He taps his chest, points to Jenny and motions to the 
               dawn outside.

                                     JENNY
                              (through tears)
                         I can't. I'd like to help. You look 
                         like Scott, but I know you're not. I 
                         don't know what you are. You gotta 
                         understand, I'm afraid of you...

               As Jenny backs into the living room, the STAR MAN closes the 
               door. He raises the gun, examines it quickly, then with his 
               finger around the trigger, points it at Jenny.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Please.

                                     JENNY
                         Why are you doing this to me? I'll 
                         give you whatever...

               The STAR MAN swings the muzzle sights across Jenny's body 
               and FIRES. A FLOOR VASE EXPLODES. Jenny turns to look at the 
               remains, then back to the STAR MAN.

               EXT. JENNY'S HOUSE - DAWNBREAK

               The Mustang is backing out of the driveway with Jenny behind 
               the wheel and the STAR MAN perched nervously on the passenger 
               seat.

               INT. MUSTANG - DAWNBREAK

               Wary of what will happen next, the STAR MAN watches Jenny 
               move the gear selector to the drive position.

               The car jerks forward and he grabs the dashboard to keep 
               from toppling back in the seat.

               During the ride up the block, his head swivels from side to 
               side trying to take in as much of the darkened urban landscape 
               as he can. When the car stops at a 'stop' sign, he looks at 
               Jenny questioningly.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Please...

                                     JENNY
                         Which way do you want to go?

               She motions ahead and he turns to look at an inter-section 
               with streets running in three directions off of it. His eyes 
               question Jenny again.

                                     JENNY
                         You can go that way...
                              (points left)
                         That way...
                              (straight ahead)
                         That way...

               She points right. After another look at Jenny, the STAR MAN 
               presses the palms of his hands together, concentrates briefly, 
               then slowly draws them apart. The force field appears between 
               them. On it the solarized view of the United States rotates 
               until the red destination dot is on his right. He drops his 
               hands and points to the right.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (measured)
                         That way.

               The satel compass continues to hover over the dashboard.

                                     JENNY
                              (staring incredulously 
                              at the compass)
                         God, what are you?

               She starts her right turn without looking left and fails to 
               see a little MG approaching from that direction. The WAIL OF 
               THE AIR HORN startles Jenny and reflexively she slams on the 
               brakes.

               The Mustang stalls and the MG squeals around them. Jenny 
               checks the STAR MAN. He has pressed himself against the 
               passenger door. The gun lies on the seat next to him. They 
               both look at it. The STAR MAN recovers and picks it up.

                                     JENNY
                              (starting the engine)
                         I'm sorry...

               This time when Jenny puts the car into drive, the STAR MAN 
               is ready for the acceleration. The car completes the turn 
               and the compass rotates to its new heading. Looking at it 
               from this angle, Jenny suddenly recognizes it for what it 
               is: an aerial view of the United States.

                                     JENNY
                         That green dot, that's us, isn't 
                         it... and the red's where you want 
                         to go?... You don't understand me, 
                         do you?

               The STAR MAN looks at her uncomprehendingly.

                                     JENNY
                              (to herself)
                         I gotta get out of here.

               EXT. STREET - DAWNBREAK

               The Mustang cruises through the industrial section of Eau 
               Claire.

               INT. MUSTANG - DAWNBREAK

               The STAR MAN is watching Jenny drive. A set of headlights 
               rushes TOWARD US in the other lane. Jenny twists around to 
               follow the car as it goes by and we SEE the desperation on 
               her face.

               When she returns her attention to the road, she sneaks a 
               glance at the STAR MAN to see if her action has given away 
               her state of mind. His expression hasn't changed. Jenny takes 
               a deep breath and lets it out slowly. Uttering a phrase in 
               his own language, the STAR MAN touches the steering wheel.

                                     JENNY
                              (startled)
                         What?

                                     STAR MAN
                              (thinking the steering 
                              wheel is called 
                              'what," he repeats)
                         What.

               With the same phrase in his language, he points to the 'gear 
               shift.'

                                     JENNY
                              (realizing her mistake)
                         Ah... no...

                                     STAR MAN
                              (repeats)
                         Ah no.

               He points to the dashboard. Jenny senses there is going to 
               be a great deal of misunderstanding if she uses more words. 
               She shakes her head 'no' and touches the steering wheel.

                                     JENNY
                              (enunciates)
                         Steering wheel...

                                     STAR MAN
                              (correcting her)
                         What.

               Jenny shakes her head 'no.'

                                     JENNY
                         Steering wheel.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (repeats)
                         Steering wheel.

                                     JENNY
                              (points to the gear 
                              shift)
                         Gear shift.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Gear shift.

                                     JENNY
                              (slaps the dashboard)
                         Dashboard.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Dashboard.

               Jenny sees a police car creeping across the intersection 
               ahead of her and interrupts the lesson to stare at it. The 
               STAR MAN looks to where she is looking.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (alarmed)
                         What?!

                                     JENNY
                         Eh... police.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (remembering)
                         Police...

               He raises the gun off his lap. Jenny tries to distract him.

                                     JENNY
                              (raps on the steering 
                              wheel)
                         What?...

               With his eyes on the police car the STAR MAN ignores her.

                                     JENNY
                         Steering wheel...
                              (she points to the 
                              gear shift)
                         What?

               The STAR MAN is intent on the police car. Jenny gives up 
               trying to distract him. The patrol car passes out of their 
               view. The STAR MAN lowers the gun and looks at Jenny.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (unprompted, points 
                              correctly at each 
                              item)
                         Steering wheel... gear shift... 
                         dashboard...

                                     JENNY
                              (this frightens Jenny 
                              even more)
                         Good.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Good.

               EXT. INTERSECTION - DAWN

               We COME DOWN FROM a red light TO FIND the Mustang stopped 
               behind the limit line.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         Which way?

                                     STAR MAN (V.O.)
                         That way.

               The light changes and the car proceeds straight across the 
               intersection.

                                     STAR MAN (V.O.)
                         Good.

               INT. MUSTANG - DAWN

               While the STAR MAN picks through the contents of the glove 
               compartment, Jenny looks for a way to escape. An all-night 
               laundromat is a possibility, but it's deserted. The STAR MAN 
               finds the switch on a flash-light and flicks it on and off.

                                     STAR MAN
                         What?

                                     JENNY
                              (distant)
                         Flashlight.

               He puts the flashlight in his lap along with the owner's 
               manual and gas slips and takes a stack of Discount Coupons 
               out of the glove compartment.

                                     STAR MAN
                         What?

                                     JENNY
                         Coupons.

               Jenny sees a set of headlights turn into the oncoming lane. 
               She slides her eyes toward the STAR MAN. He is busy looking 
               through the Coupons. Jenny measures the distance between the 
               Mustang and the oncoming lights. The STAR MAN holds up one 
               of the Coupons and points to a picture of the product.

                                     STAR MAN
                         What?

                                     JENNY
                              (curt)
                         Pancakes.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Pancakes.

               He points to the cluster of letters that spells SAVE 35¢.

                                     STAR MAN
                         What?

               Jenny doesn't answer. The distance between the two vehicles 
               is narrowing rapidly.

                                     STAR MAN
                         What?

               Jenny sets her jaw and wrenches the steering wheel violently 
               to the left.

               EXT. STREET - DAWN

               The Mustang skids sideways across the center line. The 
               oncoming van jams on its brakes and swerves to its left. 
               Locked in a skid, it drifts toward the Mustang.

               INT. MUSTANG - DAWN

               The STAR MAN sucks himself back in terror as the van descends 
               on him. It swings past his window and clips the rear fender 
               of the Mustang. Both vehicles shudder to a stop. Jenny claws 
               at her door. It swings open. She is halfway out before the 
               STAR MAN manages to grab the tail of her sweatshirt. Jenny 
               begins to scream at the top of her lungs and keeps it up 
               while he tries to wrestle her down on the seat.

               EXT. STREET - DAWN

               A tall, raw-boned MAN in his late twenties storms around the 
               front of his van.

                                     MAN
                         You stupid son of a bitch!!

               He kicks the Mustang.

                                     JENNY
                              (screaming)
                         Help me!!

                                     MAN
                         You could have killed us both!!

                                     JENNY
                              (battling to maintain 
                              her grip on the door 
                              frame)
                         He's kidnapping me!!!

               The Man bends down to look at the struggle.

                                     MAN
                         Jesus Christ!! You crazy people...

                                     JENNY
                         Call the police!!

                                     MAN
                              (not sure he wants to 
                              get involved)
                         Hey buddy... let her go...

               The STAR MAN increases his efforts and Jenny loses her grip 
               on one of the door frames.

                                     JENNY
                         Help me!!!

                                     MAN
                              (grabbing her other 
                              arm)
                         Hey, she doesn't want to go with 
                         you. Come on.

               The STAR MAN frees his right hand and blindly searches the 
               floor for the gun. He comes up with it and, shoving the barrel 
               in the Man's face, barks a harsh command in his language. 
               The Man freezes and Jenny stops struggling. It's suddenly 
               very quiet on the street.

                                     MAN
                         Oh God, man... don't shoot me... My 
                         mistake... I'm sorry...

                                     JENNY
                         He doesn't understand... just walk 
                         away...

               The STAR MAN claps a hand over her mouth.

                                     MAN
                         I promise I'm not going to tell 
                         anybody about this... None of my 
                         business... I'm going to move now, 
                         okay...
                              (takes a step to one 
                              side)
                         You guys want to fight, that's up to 
                         you...
                              (takes another step)
                         I'm leaving now... I won't say a 
                         word...

               He keeps his eyes on the STAR MAN until he reaches the back 
               of the Mustang, steals a quick look at the license plate, 
               then blots for his van. The STAR MAN takes his hand off 
               Jenny's mouth and slams her back into her seat. Uttering an 
               expletive in his language he points the gun in her face and 
               keeping it there indicates the red dot on the satel compass 
               floating undisturbed above the dashboard.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Go.

               EXT. STREET - DAWN

               The Mustang moves back into the correct lane and continues 
               on.

               INT. MUSTANG - DAWN

                                     JENNY
                         Could you put the gun down?

               The STAR MAN just stares at her. She points to the gun.

                                     JENNY
                         Gun... Down... Down.

               Slowly, he lowers it to his lap.

                                     JENNY
                         Thank you.

               EXT. ABANDONED LOGGING CAMP - EARLY MORNING

               Shermin's helicopter is taking on fuel from an Army tanker 
               truck. The pilot and co-pilot are catching forty winks on 
               the grass next to the old bunkhouse.

               INT. HELICOPTER - EARLY MORNING

               Major Bell, bleary-eyed and unshaven, is huddled in front of 
               the television screens eating a breakfast off a styrofoam 
               plate. On the top left screen is a satellite picture of 
               Northern Michigan and half of Wisconsin taken with a Doppler 
               radar.

               On the lower left screen is an infrared view of the same 
               area. Over both these views is a schematic of the state 
               boundaries and major cities. On the screens to the right of 
               these views are blow-ups of smaller sections of the overview.

               Lyman and the radar technician are asleep on the floor. Seated 
               in front of the radio console Shermin is going through the 
               telex messages. Next to him the radio technician is bent 
               over the desk with his head in his forearms.

                                     SHERMIN
                         There's nothing... No reports of 
                         sightings or landings or anything... 
                         in the other parts of the country or 
                         overseas... Seems like a totally 
                         isolated incident.

                                     MAJOR BELL
                         It was only an accident that we 
                         discovered them.

                                     SHERMIN
                         I know, but...

               Shermin continues on through the messages. Bell asks the 
               computer to change the pictures on the screens. Rhythmically, 
               a sequence of images appears and disappears.

                                     SHERMIN
                         You married, Major?

                                     MAJOR BELL
                         Twenty-eight years.

                                     SHERMIN
                         To the same woman?

                                     MAJOR BELL
                              (smiling)
                         Yes.

                                     SHERMIN
                         I tried it once... Fourteen years 
                         ago... 'I was a lousy husband and a 
                         worse father. The only thing I'm 
                         good at is this... At least until 
                         yesterday.

               Bell stuffs his breakfast plate into a garbage bag and goes 
               to get a breath of fresh air in the open doorway. Shermin 
               stops at a point on the telex sheet. He reads the message to 
               himself again.

                                     SHERMIN
                         How would you describe the sounds we 
                         heard coming out of that thing's 
                         helmet?

                                     MAJOR BELL
                              (after trying to 
                              imitate them)
                         It was kind of like clicking, maybe 
                         a language wasn't it?

                                     SHERMIN
                         Listen to this.
                              (paraphrasing the 
                              telex)
                         A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire 
                         this morning. When a citizen went to 
                         her rescue the kidnapper threatened 
                         him with a gun and shouted at him in 
                         a strange 'clicking gibberish'...

                                     MAJOR BELL
                         It was a man though... right?

                                     SHERMIN
                         The police think he was high on 
                         drugs...

               Bell shrugs.

                                     SHERMIN
                         What do you think?

               EXT. WISCONSIN FOREST - EARLY MORNING

               With a rush the helicopter rises out of the trees and thunders 
               away.

               EXT. JENNY'S HOUSE - MORNING

               There are Eau Claire police cars on the street. Shermin is 
               out back watching Bell pick his way down the hill. Through 
               the windows we see uniformed policemen in the living room.

                                     MAJOR BELL
                              (slides the last few 
                              feet down the hill)
                         Nothing up there... The grass is 
                         matted down in a few places, but 
                         that could have been anything.

                                     SHERMIN
                         It was the husband. The police finally 
                         got a hold of the witness at work 
                         and showed him a picture of the woman.

               The man standing next to her in the picture was her husband 
               and the witness said that was the guy who kidnapped her.

                                     MAJOR BELL
                         It's the right area, that's for sure.

               Throughout the above, Shermin has noticed a WOMAN in the 
               house next door peeping through her blinds at the activity 
               around Jenny's. She closes the drapes suddenly when she 
               realizes Shermin has spotted her.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Why the clicking language though?

               EXT. NEXT-DOOR HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

               Shermin knocks and waits on the steps with Bell for someone 
               to answer. We hear a chain being pulled off and the door is 
               opened by a freckled-face MAN in his late thirties, dressed 
               in a business suit and wiping the traces of a breakfast from 
               around his mouth.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Sorry to disturb you, sir, but there's 
                         been some trouble next door. I'd 
                         like to ask you a few questions.

                                     MAN
                         What happened?

                                     SHERMIN
                         There's a possibility that Mrs. 
                         Haydn's been kidnapped. We're hoping 
                         you might have seen something.

               A WOMAN in a robe opens the door a little wider to include 
               herself in the conversation. She is as freckled as the man 
               and about the same age.

                                     WOMAN
                              (to the Man)
                         I told you...

                                     MAN
                         Judy, that's stupid.

                                     WOMAN
                         Well, maybe these men won't think 
                         so. We were asleep when a helicopter 
                         woke me up. It made me so nervous I 
                         went into the kitchen for something 
                         to eat. I happened to look out the 
                         window and there was Scott Haydn 
                         with this green thing draped over 
                         his arm pulling Jenny down the walk 
                         to the car.

                                     MAN
                         You know that's impossible!

                                     WOMAN
                         I know what I saw. I've seen him 
                         enough times.

                                     MAN
                              (giving up on his 
                              wife and addressing 
                              Shermin and Lyman)
                         Scott Haydn is dead. He died about 
                         three months ago. We went to the 
                         funeral.

               Shermin and Bell exchange a glance.

               EXT. INTERSTATE - DAY

               Jenny's Mustang is sailing through the beautiful Wisconsin 
               farmland.

                                     STAR MAN (V.O.)
                         R-r-S-s...

               INT. MUSTANG - DAY

               The STAR MAN is copying the letters, upper and lower case, 
               from the Owner's Manual he found in the glove compartment, 
               onto the back of an envelope.

                                     STAR MAN
                         T-t-U...

               He draws the upper case but has to check the manual for the 
               lower case.

                                     STAR MAN
                         u-V-v...

               The STAR MAN looks up as they go by a farm.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (pointing correctly 
                              to the various animals)
                         Cow... Dog... Pig...

               He looks to Jenny for confirmation. She nods absently. He 
               returns to the alphabet.

                                     STAR MAN
                         W-w...

               He forms both the upper and lower case 'X-x' and shows them 
               to Jenny.

                                     STAR MAN
                         What?

                                     JENNY
                              (knows what's coming)
                         X...

               Without smiling the STAR MAN opens his mouth and emits a 
               short chirping laugh.

                                     JENNY
                         What's so funny about X?

               The STAR MAN laughs harder. Jenny watches him warily. He 
               starts to hiccup. He is unable to control it through the 
               laughter.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. SMALL RECTANGULAR ROOM - DAY

               Shermin's image waits on the television screen. He is gaunt, 
               tired and visibly shaken. The picture sizzles and breaks up 
               intermittently. Fox and the three men who watched the autopsy 
               stride quickly into the room.

                                     SHERMIN (V.O.)
                              (his voice quavering)
                         George, we've just confirmed the 
                         existence of the live 
                         extraterrestrial.

                                     FOX
                              (after a beat)
                         When can we expect containment?

                                     SHERMIN (V.O.)
                         Well, we're in pursuit of a green 
                         Mustang...

                                     FOX
                              (very controlled)
                         It's in a green Mustang?

                                     SHERMIN (V.O.)
                         Yes. It's kidnapped a woman at 
                         gunpoint and from what we can make 
                         out is forcing her to drive it 
                         somewhere.

                                     MILITARY MAN
                              (to the room)
                         This one has a weapon.

                                     SHERMIN (V.O.)
                         No, no... A .45, it probably got it 
                         in the woman's house. They were last 
                         seen in downtown Eau Claire...

                         It's made itself look like the woman's

               EXT. INTERSTATE - AFTERNOON

               Jenny's Mustang moves along through the traffic.

               INT. MUSTANG - AFTERNOON

               We are CLOSE ON the back of a ten-dollar bill.

                                     STAR MAN (O.S.)
                              (reading slowly)
                         The United States of America. In God 
                         We Trust. Ten dollars.

               We pull back as he holds the ten up to Jenny.

                                     JENNY
                         Money.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Money.

               He holds up a quarter.

                                     JENNY
                         Money.

               Confused, the STAR MAN puts the money back into Jenny's wallet 
               and reads the first card through its plastic window.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Mi-chi-gan driver li-see-ens... 
                         Jennyhaydn... Money?

                                     JENNY
                              (shaking her head 
                              'no,' exhausted)
                         We're going to have to stop for gas 
                         soon.

               Under the license is a picture of Jenny smiling broadly. The 
               STAR MAN looks at Jenny, back at the picture, then imitates 
               the smile for Jenny.

                                     STAR MAN
                         What?

                                     JENNY
                         Smile.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Smile... good?

                                     JENNY
                         Yes.

               He practices curling the corners of his mouth up into a smile. 
               One of them freezes as the Interstate curves and a glistening 
               skyline backlit by the afternoon sun comes into view across 
               a river.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (impressed)
                         What?!

                                     JENNY
                         Minneapolis.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (reaching into the 
                              leg pouch he took 
                              from his life-support 
                              suit)
                         Minneapolis... Minneapolis...

                                     JENNY
                         What are you doing?

               He takes out his camera.

                                     JENNY
                         ...What's that?

               He points the white disc at Minneapolis. With a 'POP,' a 
               cone of light flashes out. It sucks back, almost instantly, 
               bringing with it a three-dimensional image of the skyline.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Minneapolis... good.

                                     JENNY
                         You're full of tricks, aren't you?

               The car starts across the twin cities' bridge.

                                     JENNY
                              (taps the fuel gauge)
                         We need gas.

               The STAR MAN looks at the gauge. Jenny scrunches against the 
               door to avoid contact with him.

                                     JENNY
                         No gas.

                                     STAR MAN
                         No gas.

                                     JENNY
                         This car runs on gas.

               She presses the accelerator to the floor. The car jumps 
               forward.

                                     JENNY
                         Gas...

               She takes her foot off the accelerator and the car quickly 
               slows down.

                                     JENNY
                         No gas.

               EXT. BRIDGE - AFTERNOON

                                     JENNY
                              (V.O.)
                         Gas.

               The Mustang spurts forward a few yards.

                                     JENNY
                              (V.O.)
                         No gas.

               It staggers down to a crawl.

                                     JENNY
                              (V.O.)
                         Gas.

               The car leaps forward again.

                                     JENNY
                              (V.O.)
                         No gas.

               It drops back to a crawl.

               INT. MUSTANG - AFTERNOON

                                     JENNY
                         No gas... car dead.
                              (her head lolls forward 
                              on her chest)
                         We need gas. I don't want to get 
                         shot for running out of gas.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Gas good?

                                     JENNY
                         Yes. Very good.

               INT. MUSTANG - AFTERNOON

               We are LOOKING DOWN Jenny's arm AT a gas station just off 
               Interstate 169 in the Minneapolis suburbs.

                                     JENNY
                         Gas...

               The STAR MAN contemplates the station as they pass it, then 
               turns to Jenny, puzzled:

                                     STAR MAN
                         Go.

                                     JENNY
                         It's closed... closed. We need one 
                         that's open.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Closed?

                                     JENNY
                         You'll see.

               There are no more gas stations in sight. The STAR MAN becomes 
               bored with the silence. He picks up Jenny's wallet. The 
               driver's license is familiar so he flips to the next window. 
               In it is a picture of an older man and woman standing in 
               front of a church.

                                     STAR MAN
                         What?

                                     JENNY
                              (snaps)
                         Not what. Who. What is for things.
                              (touching the steering 
                              wheel, dashboard, 
                              seat, gear shift)
                         What? What? What? What? For people 
                         you use who. Who is he?
                              (points to the man in 
                              the picture)
                         Who is she?
                              (points to the woman)
                         Who are you?
                              (points to the STAR 
                              MAN)
                         Who am I?

               She touches her chest.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (mirrors her gestures)
                         Who is he? Who is she? Who are you? 
                         Who am I?
                              (pause; it clicks for 
                              him and he points at 
                              Jenny)
                         Who are you?

                                     JENNY
                         I am Jenny Haydn.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (flips back to her 
                              license and reads)
                         Jennyhaydn.

               Jenny nods.

                                     JENNY
                         Who are you?

                                     STAR MAN
                         I am...

               We HEAR MODULATED CLICKS of his percussive LANGUAGE.

                                     JENNY
                         That's a big help. Where are you 
                         from?

                                     STAR MAN
                         From?

                                     JENNY
                              (leans forward and 
                              points through the 
                              windshield at the 
                              sky)
                         Are you from up there? Space?

                                     STAR MAN
                              (leans forward to 
                              look with her)
                         Space?

                                     JENNY
                         Up there... I... eh... can't 
                         explain...
                              (leans back)
                         But that's the only place you could 
                         be from.

               The STAR MAN spots a station on the other side of the 
               Interstate.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Gas.

                                     JENNY
                              (shakes her head 'no')
                         Closed.

               He taps the fuel gauge which has dipped below empty.

                                     STAR MAN
                         No gas.

                                     JENNY
                         I know.

               They both scan the horizon for a gas station. When one doesn't 
               come up immediately, the STAR MAN flips to the next picture 
               in the wallet. It is of the man he has become. He is leaning 
               against a fire truck, in uniform.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Who?

                                     JENNY
                         My... husband.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I am husband?

                                     JENNY
                         No. I don't know what you are, but 
                         you're not Scott.

               Silence. The STAR MAN catches her mood. A tear rolls down 
               Jenny's cheek.

                                     JENNY
                              (brushes it away 
                              angrily)
                         Shit.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Shit?

                                     JENNY
                         No, no... don't say that. Bad word.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (likes the sound of 
                              it)
                         Shit... shit... what shit?

                                     JENNY
                              (screams)
                         Stop!! Enough!! Jesus! You're worse 
                         than a parrot!!

               Like closing a zipper, she slides her fingers across her 
               mouth.

                                     JENNY
                         Mouth closed... closed.

               The STAR MAN does as he is told. He doesn't like it, but he 
               does it. With his lips puckered, he looks straight down the 
               road. The car rises out of a gulley. Topping a knoll straight 
               ahead is a gas station with an enormous Exxon sign revolving 
               above it. With his lips firmly pressed together, he tugs 
               Jenny's sleeve and points.

                                     JENNY
                         I see it.

               The STAR MAN reaches forward and squeezes the satel compass 
               back into his palms.

               EXT. GAS STATION - AFTERNOON

               The Mustang comes up the off-ramp toward the pumps.

               INT. MUSTANG - AFTERNOON

               The STAR MAN'S hand closes around the butt of the .45 when 
               he sees the ATTENDANT step out of the office.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Who?

                                     JENNY
                         Attendant. He'll give us gas. Put 
                         the gun down. Under the seat. Under 
                         the seat...

                                     STAR MAN
                         No.

                                     JENNY
                         Oh God! You're going to get us both 
                         killed. Okay... in your pocket...

               She shoves her hand into the pocket of her slacks showing 
               him what to do.

                                     JENNY
                         In your pocket... pocket...

               Jenny eases in next to the pumps and stops. The Attendant is 
               already coming around the front of the car.

                                     JENNY
                         In your pocket, please...

                                     STAR MAN
                              (draws his fingers 
                              over his lips)
                         You. Mouth closed.

                                     JENNY
                         Okay.

               The STAR MAN stuffs the gun into the left pocket of his baggy 
               cords just as the Attendant arrives at the driver's door.

                                     ATTENDANT
                         Morning, folks. Fill her up?

               The STAR MAN looks at Jenny for help. She sweeps her fingers 
               across her mouth to indicate her lips are sealed. The STAR 
               MAN peeks around her at the Attendant.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (overly loud)
                         ...Gas...

                                     ATTENDANT
                         You got it.

               He leaves the window. The STAR MAN watches him until the 
               nozzle is in the Mustang, then pleased with himself, turns 
               to Jenny and lifts his face into a 'smile.'

                                     JENNY
                         I'm going to the ladies' room. You 
                         stay here.

               EXT. GAS STATION - AFTERNOON

               Jenny gets out of the car. When she straightens up, she finds 
               the STAR MAN staring at her over the roof. She slams the 
               door and strides rapidly in the direction of the ladies' 
               room. Stuffing the green pouch in his pocket, the STAR MAN 
               trots after her.

                                     JENNY
                              (wheels on him as he 
                              catches up)
                         Go back to the car.

               The STAR MAN looks at her but doesn't move. Jenny snarls in 
               frustration, then with the STAR MAN on her heels, stalks to 
               the ladies' room and throws open the door.

               INT. LADIES' ROOM - AFTERNOON

               The STAR MAN follows Jenny inside.

                                     JENNY
                         See. It's a bathroom. I'm not trying 
                         to escape. I just have to go to the 
                         bathroom.

               He checks out the stall.

                                     JENNY
                         Satisfied? Now get out. Out.

                                     STAR MAN
                         No.

               Furious, Jenny steps around him and opens the door. She points 
               to the sign on it.

                                     JENNY
                         Women... me.

               She continues out. The STAR MAN goes after her.

               EXT. RESTROOMS - AFTERNOON

               Jenny points to the sign on the next door.

                                     JENNY
                         Men. You go in here.

               She cracks the door for him.

                                     JENNY
                         Come on.

               He takes the door from her and pushes it open for a look 
               inside. Jenny ducks into the ladies' room. He is confused 
               for a moment then takes a long look at the men's room. It 
               means nothing to him. He backs out and tries the ladies' 
               room. It is locked. Not knowing what to do, the STAR MAN 
               stands uncomfortably in front of the door, then like a child 
               waiting for his mother, he sits on the curb. He watches the 
               Attendant lift the Mustang's hood and reach in for the 
               dipstick. The numbers on the pumps turn over, adding up the 
               gallons and the cost of the gas.

               Everything is peaceful and quiet within the circle of light 
               cast by the gas station. The STAR MAN pulls the camera disc 
               out of his pocket and points it at the pumps. The cone of 
               light flashes out and pulls back its three-dimensional image. 
               The Attendant turns around and waves genially at the STAR 
               MAN, who waves back a perfect imitation of the gesture.

               The SHARP RUMBLE of a SOUPED-UP HONDA MOTORCYCLE coming up 
               the off-ramp shatters the mood and the STAR MAN gets to his 
               feet.

               He is startled by the image of the RIDER. In a one piece 
               driving skin and helmet he looks amazingly like a space 
               traveller. The STAR MAN steps cautiously forward for a better 
               look and mutters something to himself in his language. The 
               rider stops his bike at the second row of pumps and swings 
               himself stiffly out of the seat.

                                     RIDER
                         Do I need a key for the head?

                                     ATTENDANT
                         It's open.

               Without taking off his helmet, the Rider sets out for the 
               men's room.

                                     RIDER
                              (over his shoulder)
                         Fill it up.

                                     ATTENDANT
                         You got it.

               The rider's approach frightens the STAR MAN. He backs up to 
               the ladies' room door and knocks. There is no answer. He 
               tries the knob. With the other hand he inches the gun slightly 
               out of his pocket.

               INT. LADIES' ROOM - AFTERNOON

               Jenny is bent over the sink dabbing nail polish around the 
               corners of a paper towel. Her head snaps around to look at 
               the doorknob. It holds.

                                     JENNY
                         Just a minute.

               EXT. RESTROOMS - AFTERNOON

               The STAR MAN tenses and forces a smile as the Rider passes 
               in front of him. A VOICE comes from behind the faceplate.

                                     RIDER
                         Howdy... can't get her out.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (thru the smile)
                         Gas.

                                     RIDER
                         I know how she feels.

               The rider enters the men's room. As the door closes behind 
               him, the STAR MAN's face falls and he knocks frantically on 
               the ladies' room door. Jenny opens it under his knuckles. He 
               blocks the doorway and she backs up as he steps inside.

               INT. LADIES' ROOM - AFTERNOON

               The STAR MAN looks around. Jenny's eyes widen at what is 
               happening behind him. The pneumatic arm above the door is 
               pulling it shut to reveal her paper towel pasted to the back. 
               The message on it, written in red lipstick, reads: KIDNAPPED 
               GOING W ON 169 JADE MUS. LIC#PXV237.

                                     JENNY
                              (stepping around him)
                         It's still a toilet. Hasn't become a 
                         ballroom.

               She tries to swing the door open and hide her message against 
               the wall, but she is too slow. The STAR MAN sees it and steps 
               forward to read.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Kid-nap-ped... go-ing W o-n...

               Jenny realizes he doesn't know what it means.

                                     JENNY
                              (on her way out)
                         That's very good.

               Other graffiti on the door helps convince the STAR MAN Jenny's 
               message has nothing to do with him and after a last look at 
               it, he follows her.

               EXT. GAS STATION - AFTERNOON

               A CAN of Coke CLATTERS DOWN the chute of a drink dispenser. 
               Jenny picks it up and, with the STAR MAN hovering at her 
               shoulder, moves on to the candy machine. He watches a quarter 
               disappear into the slot and when Jenny picks another one out 
               of her purse, he points to it.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Money.

                                     JENNY
                         Yes.

               She inserts the quarter and makes her selection. A Reese's 
               Peanut Butter Cup drops from its position into the pickup 
               bin.

                                     STAR MAN
                         What?

                                     JENNY
                         Candy.

               Using the change from this and another quarter, she selects 
               an Almond Joy.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (as it tumbles into 
                              the bin)
                         Money... candy.

                                     ATTENDANT
                              (to the STAR MAN)
                         That'll be fifteen fifty, sir.

                                     JENNY
                         Here.

               She hands him a twenty.

                                     ATTENDANT
                         Thank you.

               He goes to make change.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (to himself)
                         Thank you.

               Jenny pops the top on the Coke can and on the way to the car 
               takes a sip.

                                     STAR MAN
                         What is...
                              (reads off the can)
                         ...Coke?

                                     JENNY
                         A drink.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (holds his hand out 
                              for it)
                         I...

                                     JENNY
                         You want to try it?

                                     STAR MAN
                         I want to try it.

                                     JENNY
                         This stuff could kill...
                              (changes her mind and 
                              smiles)
                         Be my guest.

               The STAR MAN fills his mouth, swirls it around and swallows.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (after a loud burp)
                         Good.

               He hands the can back to Jenny. She looks at it and knows 
               there are alien bacteria there her body would not like to 
               meet.

                                     JENNY
                         Eh... you keep it. I've had enough.

               The STAR MAN takes another drink. He stops dead when he lowers 
               the can. Jenny continues for a few steps before she realizes 
               he isn't with her. She looks back over her shoulder. Her 
               eyes go immediately to where he is looking. The license plate 
               PXV 237 hangs like an accusation on the front bumper of the 
               Mustang. Jenny decides to brazen it out.

                                     JENNY
                         What's the matter?

                                     STAR MAN
                              (throws the can to 
                              the ground)
                         Shit!

               INT. MUSTANG - AFTERNOON

               Jenny and the STAR MAN ride along in tight-lipped silence.

                                     STAR MAN
                         What is kidnapped?

               Jenny ignores him.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (yells)
                         Kidnapped!!!

               She flinches but remains silent. The STAR MAN snatches the 
               paper towel off his lap and flaps it in her face, jabbing at 
               the word violently with a forefinger.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Kidnapped!!! What is kidnapped?!!

               Jenny can't take it anymore and screams back at him through 
               tears.

                                     JENNY
                         Kidnapped is what you're doing to me 
                         now!!! Kidnapped is pointing a gun 
                         at me and taking me from my house! 
                         Kidnapped is changing yourself into 
                         my husband. I don't know what you 
                         are and I don't care. I just want to 
                         get away from you!

               Jenny's outburst rocks the STAR MAN back into silence. He 
               waits for her to calm down, then slowly takes the gun out of 
               his pocket.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Jennyhaydn.

               She doesn't dare look at him.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I am good.
                              (and he slides the 
                              .45 under his seat)

               EXT. INTERSTATE - NIGHT

               Jenny speeds up to pass a truckload of horses.

                                     STAR MAN
                         What is that?

               She doesn't answer. The car passes the truck. The highway 
               before them is empty.

                                     JENNY
                              (finally)
                         Horses.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (without looking at 
                              her)
                         Horses.

               Jenny TURNS ON the RADIO and finds a COUNTRY AND WESTERN 
               STATION.

                                     STAR MAN
                         What?

                                     JENNY
                         Music.

               It is pleasing to him and he listens for a while, then reaches 
               in his pouch and takes out one of the dusty gray marbles. He 
               rolls it between his palms. It changes to a glowing gold as 
               it grows to the size of a baseball.

                                     JENNY
                              (alarmed)
                         What are you doing?!

               The STAR MAN brings the globe close to his mouth and speaks 
               into it.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (subtitles)
                         Iron channel message. Transmute was 
                         successful. Have captured one of 
                         them. It is taking me to the pick-up 
                         point in a land vehicle.
                              (eyeing Jenny)
                         I think I can control it by mastering 
                         its language, which is primitive and 
                         easy to learn. Will arrive on time. 
                         Wait for me.

               The STAR MAN opens his hands and, to Jenny's astonishment, 
               the ball rises quickly and seeps through her roof without 
               leaving a trace.

               EXT. INTERSTATE - NIGHT

               The Mustang swerves violently, then straightens itself as 
               the ball comes through the roof and surges into the sky.

               EXT. SKY - NIGHT

               Unexpectedly, Shermin's helicopter storms into view. It is 
               so close we can count the rivets. As it clears, we go to:

               INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT

               The flow of traffic on the Interstate below is being fed 
               into the six television screens from infrared cameras on the 
               belly of the craft. The image on the screen under the master 
               begins to move and ends in a close-up of a green Mustang. 
               It's not Jenny's. With a buzz the red dot appears and Fox's 
               face interrupts the view of the Mustang.

                                     FOX (V.O.)
                         I just came from a meeting with the 
                         Security Council and
                              (the picture breaks 
                              up, but the voice 
                              continues)
                         in view of the extraterrestrial's 
                         radical change and the fact that all 
                         our efforts
                              (the picture re-
                              assembles)
                         to contact its ship remain unanswered, 
                         it was decided to issue a ten state 
                         'all points bulletin' for Scott Haydn, 
                         Jenny Haydn and the green Mustang. 
                         The officers have been instructed 
                         not to approach the people or the 
                         vehicle but to contact you. You will 
                         then move in and contain the subjects.

               Shermin rubs his hands over his face while he digests this.

                                     SHERMIN
                              (sorting it out)
                         You sure you want this, because... 
                         that's putting an awful lot of faith 
                         in people we have no control over...

                                     FOX (V.O.)
                         I'm afraid the situation demands 
                         that kind of risk.

                                     SHERMIN
                         I don't like it, George...

                         It's messy... the thing's got a gun...

                         We don't know what else to do. We 
                         need results.

                         other, that's for sure... Okay.

               His image is replaced by one of the highway.

                                     MAJOR BELL
                         Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool.

                                     LYMAN
                         Bullshit!

                                     MAJOR BELL
                         You have no conception of this, do 
                         you?

                                     LYMAN
                         You jerk! You look at all the 
                         sweetness and light and goodness you 
                         think'll come out of this. You know 
                         what's gonna come out of this... The 
                         end of religion, the end of 
                         civilization, the end of the earth. 
                         We could become slaves, we could 
                         become a colony of these things. 
                         Don't you see that? Are you too stupid 
                         to see that?

                                     SHERMIN
                         Are you ladies through?...

               Bell and Lyman look at their feet.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Good... It looks like we might be 
                         the welcoming committee, so I think 
                         we should try and figure out what 
                         we're gonna do if we have to come 
                         face to face with this creature.

                         Bell wants us to get down on our 
                         knees and bow.

                                     SHERMIN
                              (to Bell)
                         Did your people have any contingencies 
                         rehearsed?

                                     MAJOR BELL
                         No... I guess we never thought it 
                         would happen.

               It's Shermin's turn to look at his feet.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Terrific.

               On one of the screens behind him the camera has picked up a 
               lighted billboard advertising 'Kellogg's Corn Flakes' with 
               its slogan 'HAVE A GREAT DAY.'

               EXT. HIGHWAY - EARLY MORNING

               Jenny's Mustang is barreling along well over the speed limit. 
               As it PASSES US, we PAN WITH it TO a sign: SLOW FOR 
               INTERSECTION.

               EXT. INTERSECTION - EARLY MORNING

               A truckload of corn is hurtling down ON US from the north. 
               An empty semi is rumbling up from the south. The light is in 
               their favor.

               INT. MUSTANG - EARLY MORNING

               The STAR MAN is driving. It is obvious that he doesn't see 
               the red light facing him. But Jenny does. And she also sees 
               the trucks closing in from either side.

                                     JENNY
                              (loud)
                         Red light!

               The STAR MAN doesn't see it, doesn't believe her, doesn't 
               slow down.

                                     JENNY
                              (screams)
                         Stop!!!

               EXT. INTERSECTION - EARLY MORNING

               It is as if all three vehicles have heard Jenny. They slam 
               on their brakes at the same time and begin to skid toward 
               each other. It's going to be close.

               INT. MUSTANG - EARLY MORNING

               The prows of the trucks loom over Jenny and the STAR MAN 
               and, for a fleeting instant, it looks like they will join 
               the bugs imbedded in the radiators.

               EXT. INTERSECTION - EARLY MORNING

               The Mustang barely squeaks through and the trucks slam into 
               each other behind it, spilling corn all over the highway.

               INT. MUSTANG - EARLY MORNING

               It finally comes to a stop on the center line.

                                     JENNY
                         That was a red light!! I told you 
                         you have to stop at a red light!!

                                     STAR MAN
                              (sheepish)
                         It was yellow.

                                     JENNY
                         You didn't even see it.

               The STAR MAN looks back for the traffic light. It is hanging 
               from a pole in the middle of the road. Under it the truck 
               DRIVERS are climbing out of the cabs.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I will see it next time.

                                     JENNY
                         You better.

               The STAR MAN angles back into his lane and begins to pick up 
               speed.

               EXT. SIOUX FALLS - SOUTH DAKOTA - DAY

               Deftly, the STAR MAN moves in and out of the afternoon 
               traffic. A bus coming in the other direction hits a pothole 
               filled with water and the SPLASH covers the Mustang.

               INT. MUSTANG - DAY

               Jenny watches the STAR MAN calmly turn on the wipers and the 
               washer and clean the windshield. The light above the 
               intersection ahead turns red and, even though he is still 
               fiddling with the wipers, the STAR MAN manages a smooth stop 
               back of the crosswalk.

                                     JENNY
                              (indicating the red 
                              dot on the satel 
                              compass)
                         Why are you going here? What is here?

                                     STAR MAN
                         My...
                              (searches for word)
                         ...car will take me...
                              (pokes finger toward 
                              sky)
                         ...up there... home.

               The light changes and the STAR MAN continues down the street.

                                     JENNY
                              (at the red dot again)
                         When do you have to be here?

                                     STAR MAN
                         I do not understand.

                                     JENNY
                              (rubs her temples and 
                              laments to herself)
                         How will I do this one?...

               The answer is hovering above the city in front of them.

                                     JENNY
                              (pointing to the sun)
                         Sun...

                                     STAR MAN
                         Yes.

                                     JENNY
                         Sun... day. No sun... night. You 
                         understand?

                                     STAR MAN
                         Yes. Day... night.

                                     JENNY
                         How many days and nights do you have 
                         to go...
                              (prods the red dot)
                         ...here?

                                     STAR MAN
                         Three nights... two days.

                                     JENNY
                         That's not much time. I'll just slow 
                         you down. I have to sleep. I'm very 
                         tired. And I have to wash and eat. 
                         You don't...

                                     STAR MAN
                         I need you.

                                     JENNY
                         I won't tell anybody if that's what 
                         you're worried about. I promise. 
                         You'll keep...

                                     STAR MAN
                         No.

                                     JENNY
                         You'll keep the car. I'll take a 
                         bus...
                              (an awful possibility 
                              occurs to her)
                         Am I going up there with you... in 
                         your ship... up there?

                                     STAR MAN
                         No.

                                     JENNY
                         Then let me go. You don't need me.

                                     STAR MAN
                         No.

                                     JENNY
                         I feel like I'm going crazy here. 
                         You're Scott. But he's dead. I don't 
                         know what's real anymore. I can't be 
                         here with you.

               The STAR MAN is unyielding.

                                     JENNY
                         Do you understand what I'm saying to 
                         you? You can keep the car.
                              (she hands him some 
                              money)
                         That should be enough for gas from 
                         here to there. Please let me go.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (taps the red dot on 
                              the satel compass)
                         When we get here.

               Jenny slams herself angrily back in the seat.

                                     JENNY
                         You bastard.

               Her upper lip trembles and, in spite of herself, she might 
               cry. The STAR MAN sees the center lane is open. He checks 
               his side mirror and drifts over, only to be caught by a light. 
               The car is still rolling when Jenny makes her move. She throws 
               open the door and, by the time the STAR MAN turns around, 
               she is out and running.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Jennyhaydn!

               He takes his foot off the brake to go after her and the car 
               lurches into the cross traffic. He clambers back behind the 
               wheel, regains control and cuts a hard right in front of the 
               other car waiting at the light.

               EXT. STREET - SIOUX FALLS - DAY

               Over her shoulder, Jenny can see the Mustang coming. She 
               dodges up a brick walkway toward a J.C. Penney shopping mall. 
               The Mustang skids to a stop at the curb. The STAR MAN jumps 
               out in time to see Jenny push her way past a stream of 
               pedestrian traffic and enter the mall. He leaves the car and 
               zigzags through the people in that direction.

               INT. SHOPPING MALL - DAY

               As he barges in, the STAR MAN accidentally knocks a cup of 
               Coke out of a YOUNG MAN's hand.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Hey!!

               In a panic to find Jenny, he continues jostling past people 
               to look in the shops that border the atrium.

               MEZZANINE

               Jenny warily approaches the railing and peers over. Below 
               her the STAR MAN comes out of a record store. She turns away 
               and gets on the escalator to the second floor.

               ON THE GROUND FLOOR

               The STAR MAN thinks he sees Jenny in an electronics store, 
               but when the girl turns around, it is obviously not her. 
               Backing out of there, he knocks over a sandwich board 
               advertising a restaurant. The LOUD THWACK it makes when it 
               hits the cement turns faces in his direction.

               Jenny's is not among them. His eyes raise to the mezzanine. 
               Maybe she's there. He looks wildly around for a way up. He 
               spots the escalator and, trying to keep the upper floor in 
               view while he runs for it, he slams into an unattended pram.

               It begins to tip over. The BABY INSIDE SCREAMS. The STAR MAN 
               manages to snatch it out of the carriage before it hits the 
               floor. He is looking for a place to put it when the MOTHER 
               comes charging out of a plant store.

                                     MOTHER
                         My baby!!! He's stealing my baby! 
                         Burt!!

               The STAR MAN holds the baby out to her.

               She grabs it out of his hands and he turns to leave.

                                     MOTHER
                         Burt!! Somebody stop him!! He was 
                         stealing my baby!!

               Two tough-looking MEN in T-shirts step in to block the STAR 
               MAN's way to the escalator.

                                     MAN
                         Where you think you're going?

               Not understanding, the STAR MAN tries to get by them. They 
               push him back.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Please.

               A tall, skinny blond man with spectacles elbows his way to 
               the Mother.

                                     MOTHER
                         He was trying to steal Gloria.

               Two steps and Burt is on the STAR MAN. He spins him around.

                                     BURT
                         Is that right? Huh?

               He throws him back against the crowd that has gathered.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (stutters)
                         Please.

               Burt pulls the STAR MAN up by his shirt front and shakes 
               him.

                                     BURT
                         Is that right? Come on. Answer me.

               Fear erases the STAR MAN's tenuous grasp of English and he 
               begins to jabber in his own language. This makes Burt even 
               madder.

                                     BURT
                         Were you trying to steal my baby? 
                         Huh? Answer me!

                                     STAR MAN
                         Jennyhaydn!

               SECOND FLOOR

               Jenny has just gotten on the escalator to the third floor 
               when she hears her name. She knows she shouldn't but she 
               gets off and joins the crowd at the railing. From there, she 
               can see the STAR MAN trapped in a circle of people. He clubs 
               Burt away from him and tries to thrash his way out of the 
               mob.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Jennyhaydn!

               One of the T-shirts throws him back and Burt begins to punch 
               him. We MOVE IN UNTIL we are CLOSE ON Jenny's face.

               GROUND FLOOR

               Some of the onlookers have joined Burt in his attempt to 
               bring the STAR MAN down. Growling in his own language, the 
               STAR MAN fights back as best he can. The sleeve of his 
               windbreaker is torn. One of the T-shirts lands a blow on his 
               right shoulder that turns the STAR MAN around. He takes a 
               blow on the chest. Another in the kidneys. Burt gets a grip 
               on the STAR MAN's left wrist and holds on. The attackers 
               close in. Jenny's voice cuts through the din.

                                     JENNY (O.S.)
                         Stop it!!! Stop it!!!

               She barges into the fray and starts peeling the men away 
               from the STAR MAN.

                                     JENNY
                         Get away from him!! Leave him alone!! 
                         You stupid jerks!! He's retarded!! 
                         Can't you see that?!! Get away from 
                         him!!

               The men do. Jenny pushes the sleeve of the torn wind-breaker 
               back up on the STAR MAN's shoulder.

                                     MOTHER
                         He was stealing my baby...

                                     JENNY
                         You're wrong!! He would never do 
                         anything like that!!
                              (takes STAR MAN's 
                              hand)
                         Let's go...

                                     MOTHER
                         He had Gloria in his hands!

                                     JENNY
                         He's retarded! I shouldn't have left 
                         him alone!

               She starts to push out of the circle. Burt steps in to block 
               her.

                                     JENNY
                              (hisses)
                         Get out of my way.

               She stares at him until he does, then leads the STAR MAN 
               down the path that opens for them in the crowd. They pass a 
               MALL GUARD who has just arrived.

               EXT. STREET - SIOUX FALLS - DAY

                                     JENNY
                         Are you okay?

               Still shaken, the STAR MAN nods. Jenny realizes that it is 
               comforting to him to have his hand in hers and she leads him 
               like a child down the sidewalk to the Mustang.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (as Jenny puts him in 
                              the passenger seat)
                         Thank you.

               The Mall Guard follows them down the walk-way and watches 
               them drive off. He scribbles the license number in his 
               notebook.

               INT. GREYHOUND BUS STATION - SIOUX FALLS - DAY

               At the counter Jenny puts her Visa card back into her wallet 
               while the CLERK staples the pages of a ticket into a travel 
               folder.

                                     CLERK
                              (handing it to her)
                         Gate three. It's boarding now.

                                     JENNY
                         Thank you.

                                     CLERK
                         Have a nice trip.

               We FOLLOW Jenny THROUGH the people milling around the benches 
               in the waiting area TO the STAR MAN seated in an open-faced 
               coffee shop. He is watching a MOTHER feed her baby in the 
               booth across from him. A map of the United States is spread 
               out on the formica. Jenny plunks herself down catty-cornered 
               from him. The tear in his sleeve has been closed with safety 
               pins.

                                     JENNY
                         The closest I was able to get you 
                         was Lathrop Wells...

                                     STAR MAN
                              (pointing to baby)
                         Is that a baby?

                                     JENNY
                         Yes.

                                     STAR MAN
                         A baby is a new person?

                                     JENNY
                         Eh... yes...

                                     STAR MAN
                         Do you have a baby?

                                     JENNY
                         No... The closest...

                                     STAR MAN
                         Why?

                                     JENNY
                         I'd love to have a baby. But I 
                         can't...

                                     STAR MAN
                         Why?

                                     JENNY
                         I can't... Forget the baby. Okay? 
                         The closest I was able to get you 
                         was Lathrop Wells. You'll have to 
                         hitchhike the rest of the way.

               The STAR MAN looks at the map. Lathrop Wells is a small town 
               north of Las Vegas on Highway 95. From there he runs his 
               finger to a spot in the Funeral Range of Death Valley.

                                     STAR MAN
                         But I must go here.

                                     JENNY
                         I know that. But the buses don't go 
                         there.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (suspicious)
                         What is hitchhike?

                                     JENNY
                         That's easy. I'll explain that in a 
                         minute. This is your ticket. When 
                         you get on the bus here, the driver 
                         will take this part. You will ride 
                         to Omaha. When you get to Omaha, ask 
                         the driver. 'Salt Lake City, please. 
                         I do not speak English.'

               The STAR MAN nods that he understands.

                                     JENNY
                         Say it.

                                     STAR MAN
                         'Salt Lake City, please. I do not 
                         speak English.'

                                     JENNY
                         The driver will...

                                     STAR MAN
                         But I speak English.

                                     JENNY
                         Will you please do it my way? You'll 
                         get into trouble if you don't. If 
                         anybody talks to you, tell them... I 
                         do not speak English.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (indignant)
                         I do not speak English.

                                     JENNY
                         Right. In Omaha the driver will put 
                         you on the bus for Salt Lake City 
                         and the new driver will take...
                              (bends back second 
                              portion of ticket)
                         ...this part. When you get to Salt 
                         Lake City, ask the driver, 'Las Vegas, 
                         please'...

                                     STAR MAN
                              (impatient)
                         'Las Vegas, please. I do not speak 
                         English.' What is hitchhike?

                                     JENNY
                         You want this ticket?

                                     STAR MAN
                         Yes.

                                     JENNY
                         Then don't be smart.

                                     P.A. SYSTEM (V.O.)
                         Last call for bus 33 to Vermillion, 
                         Sioux City and Omaha... loading at 
                         Gate 3.

                                     JENNY
                         That's your bus.
                              (picks up the map and 
                              folds it)
                         When you get to Las Vegas, ask the 
                         driver. 'Lathrop Wells, please. I do 
                         not speak English.'

                                     STAR MAN
                              (falling into step 
                              next to her)
                         'Lathrop Wells, please. I do not 
                         speak English.'

                                     JENNY
                              (hands him the map)
                         You keep this. Now this is hitch-
                         hike...
                              (stops in the middle 
                              of the waiting area 
                              to illustrate)
                         You stand on the side of the road, 
                         the highway... you understand? And 
                         you face the cars going in the 
                         direction you want to go. When you 
                         see a car or a truck coming, you 
                         stick out your thumb like this...

               Jenny takes a few sweeps at an imaginary highway with her 
               thumb. The stares this pantomime draws make the STAR MAN 
               more nervous about the bus trip than he already is.

                                     JENNY
                         Your thumb tells the driver that you 
                         want a ride.

                                     STAR MAN
                         The car will stop?

                                     JENNY
                              (continuing toward 
                              the loading platform)
                         Not every car, but... a car will 
                         stop... Maybe not the first car... 
                         maybe number eight, number fifteen...

               The STAR MAN stops.

                                     STAR MAN
                         When do I get to Lathrop Wells?

                                     JENNY
                         Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking 
                         right away and...

               Jenny pushes open a glass door to:

               EXT. LOADING PLATFORM - DAY

                                     JENNY
                         ...you'll have plenty of time to get 
                         to where you want to go.

               The STAR MAN hangs back when he sees the security guards.

                                     JENNY
                         Don't worry. They're not going to 
                         hurt you. Come on.
                              (gives him ticket)
                         Only show this to the driver. Nobody 
                         else. And don't lose it.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Can I have the gun?

                                     JENNY
                         No.

               She maneuvers him into the end of the line.

                                     JENNY
                         You might need this.

               She takes some of the paper money out of her wallet and stuffs 
               it in his pocket.

                                     JENNY
                         Don't be afraid. Do what I told you 
                         and you'll be okay.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (nervous)
                         Yes.

               The line moves forward a step.

                                     JENNY
                         Well... I'm going to go now.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Go?

                                     JENNY
                         Yes. I have a long ride ahead of 
                         me...
                              (takes his hand)
                         Goodbye.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Goodbye.

               He watches her walk away.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Jennyhaydn.

                                     JENNY
                         Yes?

                                     STAR MAN
                         Please stay.

               Jenny comes back and takes his hand.

                                     JENNY
                         I'll stay till you get on the bus.

               A family of four climbs aboard and the line moves up. The 
               STAR MAN is alert to everything happening on the platform. 
               Jenny sneaks him an affectionate look. No one in front of 
               him has baggage to check and they move quickly past the DRIVER 
               until the STAR MAN is next in line.

                                     DRIVER
                         Ticket?

               The STAR MAN hands the Driver his ticket. The Driver rips 
               out the first coupon and hands it back.

                                     JENNY
                         See? You're going to be okay.

               When they stop at the door, she impulsively kisses him on 
               the cheek.

                                     JENNY
                         Goodbye.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (touches his cheek)
                         What?

                                     JENNY
                         It's a kiss...
                              (she motions for him 
                              to get on the bus)
                         Goodbye...

                                     DRIVER
                         Let's go.

               The STAR MAN climbs the steps just ahead of him. The door 
               closes. Its ENGINE REVVING, the bus backs out of its stall. 
               Jenny catches a glimpse of the STAR MAN bent over in the 
               aisle looking out at her. She waves until the bus rounds the 
               building.

               EXT. GREYHOUND PARKING LOT - DAY

               Jenny's green Mustang loops around the end of a row of cars 
               and heads for the street.

               INT. MUSTANG - DAY

               LOOKING OVER Jenny's SHOULDER, we SEE the Star Man waiting 
               for her at the curb.

                                     JENNY
                              (softly)
                         Oh no...

               She stops next to him and rolls down her window.

                                     JENNY
                         What happened?

                                     STAR MAN
                         I was afraid.

               Jenny moans and lays her head on the vinyl of the window 
               sill. When she raises up, he smiles at her.

                                     JENNY
                         Okay, you win. Get in.

               INT. SHOPPING MALL - DAY

               Shermin is standing next to the security guard in the middle 
               of a knot of shouting people.

                                     SHOPKEEPER
                         This kind of thing's real bad for 
                         business...

                                     TOUGH
                         He couldn't even speak English.

                                     MOTHER
                         Those kind of people should be shot.

                                     ONLOOKER
                         What happened?

                                     WAITRESS
                         I think he was just lost...

                                     BURT
                         Who's side are you on?

                                     TOUGH
                         No way he was going to get away from 
                         me.

               We move in on a lapel mike pinned to the front of Shermin's 
               shirt.

               INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

               The hubbub in the shopping center is being recorded on a 
               tape deck. Lyman, a phone to his ear, is seated in front of 
               the television screens.

                                     LYMAN
                         Where's that?... And it was one 
                         person, one way...

               He hangs up and heads for the rear door. Jenny Haydn's current 
               Visa statement occupies the upper left screen. The last two 
               items are circled: The charge for the Greyhound ticket and 
               the credit for the return of that ticket.

               EXT. SHOPPING MALL - DAY

               The security guard tags Shermin into the parking lot.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Eyewitnesses are the worst. You get 
                         two of them together. You got three 
                         stories. You know what I mean?

               Shermin sees Lyman come out of the crowd surrounding the 
               police cars in front of the helicopter.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Is there a reward in this?

                                     SHERMIN
                         Huh?... Eh... no, there isn't

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Because I'm the one who called the 
                         police, you know.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Yeah, thanks. We appreciate that.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Hey, it's none of my business why 
                         you're chasing a retard... You want 
                         my opinion, it's the girl. She had 
                         to hold the guy's hand all the way 
                         to the car like he was a kid.

                                     SHERMIN
                         You saw that?

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Hey... he didn't look like no big 
                         time criminal to me.

               Lyman meets them. It is obvious he has something to tell 
               Shermin.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Eh... the store tells you to call 
                         when there's trouble, so they won't 
                         get sued... But that shouldn't matter 
                         if there's a reward, right?

                                     SHERMIN
                         I wouldn't think so.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                              (peeling off)
                         That's what I thought. So remember 
                         it was me because sometimes rewards 
                         come late, you know.

                                     SHERMIN
                         We will.
                              (he turns to Lyman)
                         Something's wrong here. She's helping 
                         him now.

                                     LYMAN
                              (alarmed)
                         I know. She bought him a ticket for 
                         Lathrop Wells and put him on the 
                         bus. He didn't stay on though and 
                         they drove off together.

                                     SHERMIN
                              (shaking his head)
                         Doesn't make sense.

                                     LYMAN
                         Maybe he's turned her into one of 
                         them. They enter the crowd around 
                         the helicopter.

               EXT. INTERSTATE 29 - DAY

               The Mustang cruises along between fields of corn.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         Why did your ship land on this 
                         planet... on Earth?

                                     STAR MAN (V.O.)
                         It was a mistake.

               INT./EXT. MUSTANG - DAY

               The following conversation will be played over various views 
               of Americana: a station wagon load of kids, waving and 
               laughing, lovers kissing at a bus stop, billboards, car lots, 
               a dog taking a leak against a tree, cheerleaders practicing 
               on a football field, a funeral cortege, a telephone repairman 
               up on a pole.

                                     JENNY
                         You thought we were a different 
                         planet?!

                                     STAR MAN
                         No. My ship was doing a map of all 
                         the suns and...

                                     JENNY
                         Stars... When a sun is far away, we 
                         call it a 'star.'

                                     STAR MAN
                         We were doing a map of the stars and 
                         all the other things up there when 
                         we saw a small ship. My... eh... we 
                         kidnapped it. On it there was a map 
                         that said how to come to Earth. This 
                         was very important. Before then, we 
                         thought we were the only people in 
                         all the stars.

                                     JENNY
                         You did? That's funny. So did we.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Yes?

                                     JENNY
                         Yes.

                                     STAR MAN
                         We told our home, and the people who 
                         tell us what to do on my planet said 
                         to come and look but not to talk, 
                         not to land, not to shoot. Just to 
                         look from up there. We came and... 
                         the driver of my ship...

                                     JENNY
                         The captain...

                                     STAR MAN
                         The captain wanted to land to see 
                         close and to get some things from 
                         Earth to take home. The police came 
                         and shot at us. One of the people 
                         from my ship was killed.

                                     JENNY
                         Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. Was 
                         he a good friend?

                                     STAR MAN
                         I don't understand 'friend.'

                                     JENNY
                         A friend is a person that is good to 
                         you... someone you like to be with... 
                         someone you like to laugh with...

                                     STAR MAN
                         He was a good friend... The captain 
                         took the ship away fast and I was 
                         not in the ship.

                                     JENNY
                         The police shouldn't have started 
                         shooting. But you can hardly blame 
                         them. You surprised them. They didn't 
                         know you were up there. When they 
                         saw you, they thought you were here 
                         to hurt us.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I understand.

                                     JENNY
                         Sounds like your captain's going to 
                         get hell when he gets back home.

                                     STAR MAN
                         What is hell?

                                     JENNY
                         It's bad.

                                     STAR MAN
                         He will.

               Pause. Jenny feels the STAR MAN staring at her. She turns to 
               look at him. His gaze doesn't waver. She looks back at the 
               road, then back at the STAR MAN.

                                     JENNY
                         What are you doing?

                                     STAR MAN
                         Are you my friend?

                                     JENNY
                         Yes.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (smiles)
                         I am your friend.

               EXT. INTERSTATE 80 - NIGHT

               Jenny's Mustang is whipping west out of Lincoln, Nebraska. 
               We HEAR A JUMBLE OF RADIO STATIONS as the SELECTOR is RUN 
               THROUGH THE FREQUENCIES.

               INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT

               Jenny is driving. The STAR MAN finds a RELIGIOUS STATION ON 
               the RADIO.

                                     PREACHER (V.O.)
                              (on radio)
                         God is your creator. God is your 
                         master. God is you savior. God is 
                         the only reason that you exist. If 
                         God...

                                     STAR MAN
                              (during the above)
                         Who is God?

               Jenny is tired. She doesn't want to get into that.

                                     JENNY
                         Nobody knows.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Why?

                                     JENNY
                         I don't know.

               The STAR MAN lets it drop and finds a COUNTRY AND WESTERN 
               STATION.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I like this music.

                                     JENNY
                         I've noticed... Do you understand 
                         what they're saying?

                                     STAR MAN
                         Not all... but it feels like a kiss.

               Jenny smiles at him, then:

                                     JENNY
                         Do you have music up there?

                                     STAR MAN
                         Yes.

                                     JENNY
                         I'd like to hear it. Can you sing 
                         something?

                                     STAR MAN
                         I do not want to.

                                     JENNY
                         Don't be afraid... I'd really like 
                         to hear it.

               She TURNS OFF the RADIO.

                                     JENNY
                         Please.

               He turns away from her, clears his throat and begins. His 
               singing is like nothing we have ever heard. Vibrations of 
               tones and glottal stops blend into a haunting, seductive 
               fugue. The STAR MAN stops.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I am not a good singer.

                                     JENNY
                         That was beautiful.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (incredulous)
                         You liked my singing?

                                     JENNY
                         Yes. Sing some more.

               EXT. INTERSTATE 80 - NIGHT

               With the STAR MAN's SERENADE WAFTING over the Nebraska plains, 
               we FALL BACK TO FIND a Highway Patrol car tagging along at a 
               safe distance behind the Mustang.

               EXT. BEST WESTERN MOTEL - NIGHT

               The STAR MAN stops the Mustang in front of the office. He 
               and Jenny get out and go inside. As the door closes on them, 
               three Nebraska Highway Patrol cars speed up the off-ramp. 
               The lead car turns right on a surface street and enters the 
               motel parking lot at the far end.

               The middle car goes straight across the intersection and 
               positions itself at the curb next to the driveway, giving 
               access to a frontage road which leads to an on-ramp. The 
               last car also turns right on the surface street, but parks 
               in a restaurant parking lot directly across from the office.

               INT. OFFICE - BEST WESTERN MOTEL - NIGHT

               In answer to Jenny's bell, the night CLERK comes out of the 
               living quarters in the back, finger combing his sleep-rumpled 
               hair.

                                     CLERK
                         What can I do for you folks?

                                     JENNY
                         How much are your rooms?

                                     CLERK
                         Thirty-seven fifty for one person, 
                         forty-nine fifty for two.

               Drawn by the bright colors on their covers, the STAR MAN 
               wanders over to the magazine rack. By chance, he selects a 
               copy of 'Playgirl' and begins to look through it.

                                     JENNY
                         You have one with two beds?

                                     CLERK
                         Sure.

                                     JENNY
                         I'll take that.

                                     CLERK
                              (slides her a 
                              registration card)
                         Fill this out.
                              (as Jenny writes)
                         Will this be cash or credit card?

                                     JENNY
                         Credit card.

                                     CLERK
                         I'll have to run your card off now.

                                     JENNY
                              (digging through her 
                              purse)
                         We're only going to be here a few 
                         hours...

                                     CLERK
                         It's still the full price.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Jenny, look...

               From behind the STAR MAN, we WATCH Jenny react to the open 
               Playgirl centerfold that he is holding up.

                                     JENNY
                         Put that back.

                                     STAR MAN
                         But I have never seen this before. I 
                         am not complete.

               Although we cannot see it, we know what he is pointing at.

                                     JENNY
                         Put it back.

               The STAR MAN swivels the picture around so that he can see 
               it. Jenny hands the smirking Clerk her credit card. He steps 
               to the side and inserts it into the imprinter. Out of the 
               corner of his eye, he sees a dot of light leave the STAR 
               MAN's forehead to drop behind the magazine and into his 
               trousers.

               The Clerk glances over at Jenny to see if she hears the 
               HISSING that is going on behind the STAR MAN's fly. She does 
               and she hopes it'll stop soon. His eyes on the STAR MAN, the 
               Clerk fumbles the key to 117 off the rack.

                                     CLERK
                         You can park your car in front of 
                         the room.

               He drops the key on the counter.

               INT. MIDDLE PATROL CAR - NIGHT

               Through his side window, the DRIVER can see the motel office.

                                     DRIVER
                              (into microphone of 
                              his radio)
                         What did these two do?

               INT. LAST PATROL CAR - NIGHT

                                     SECOND DRIVER
                         All anybody knows is that they're 
                         armed and dangerous.

               In the office, he can see Jenny and the STAR MAN leave the 
               counter and head for the door. He raises a pair of binoculars 
               to his eyes for a good head-on look at them.

               THROUGH THE BINOCULARS

               We SEE Jenny and the STAR MAN come out of the motel office.

               BACK TO SCENE

               The Second Officer lowers the glasses and looks down at the 
               telex pictures of Jenny and the STAR MAN taped to the 
               dashboard.

                                     SECOND OFFICER
                         Be a piece of cake for us to take 
                         'em.

               INT. LEAD PATROL CAR - NIGHT

               THROUGH the WINDSHIELD, we can SEE Jenny and the STAR MAN 
               approaching the Mustang.

                                     THIRD DRIVER
                         National Security folks should be 
                         here any minute. Let them take care 
                         of it. That's what they get the big 
                         bucks for.

               EXT. BEST WESTERN MOTEL - NIGHT

                                     STAR MAN
                         I want a drink. May I have two 
                         quarters?

               At the passenger door, Jenny sets her purse on the car roof 
               to take out her wallet.

                                     JENNY
                              (handing it to him)
                         You shouldn't drink so much of that 
                         stuff. It's bad for you.

                                     STAR MAN
                         On the radio they say it's good.

                                     JENNY
                         Hurry up.

               Over her purse she notices the patrol car facing her from 
               the restaurant parking lot. There is certainly nothing unusual 
               about a patrol car in a restaurant parking lot. She shrugs 
               it off and gets in the Mustang.

               INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT

               Jenny's behind hasn't even hit the seat before she sees the 
               patrol car parked on the frontage road off to her left. She 
               looks at the STAR MAN. He's busy pounding on the drink 
               machine. She turns around to check the lot behind her and 
               spots the patrol car there.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (coming to the car 
                              with a drink can in 
                              each hand)
                         The machine gave me two. Should I 
                         put one back?

                                     JENNY
                         No. Get in.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (rounding the hood)
                         You can have one.

                                     JENNY
                              (as he gets in)
                         I'm not sleepy anymore. Let's drive 
                         for a little while longer.

               The STAR MAN stiffens when he sees the patrol car on the 
               frontage road.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Are you angry at me?

                                     JENNY
                         No. I'm just not tired. Let's go.

               EXT. BEST WESTERN MOTEL - NIGHT

               The Mustang moves toward the frontage road.

               INT. LAST PATROL CAR - NIGHT

                              (as the Mustang rolls 
                              onto the frontage 
                              road)
                         They made us. Let's get 'em.

               EXT. BEST WESTERN MOTEL - NIGHT

               All three patrol cars jam on their rack lights and, with 
               their SIRENS HOWLING, peel out after Jenny and the STAR MAN.

               INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT

               At the SOUND, the STAR MAN snaps his attention to the rear 
               view mirror. It's ablaze with police lights. He tromps on 
               the gas.

                                     JENNY
                         No.

               INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT

               Shermin is patched into the Nebraska Highway Patrol and is 
               listening to the pursuit.

               EXT. INTERSTATE 80 - NIGHT

               The Mustang careens down the on-ramp and squeezes into the 
               traffic a hair's breath ahead of an 18-wheeler. This cuts 
               off the patrol cars momentarily, but the Mustang doesn't 
               have the speed to stay ahead of them. Using the other cars 
               on the road as shields, the STAR MAN dodges from lane to 
               lane trying to keep the police from coming alongside.

               INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT

               The lead patrol car feints forward on the STAR MAN's side. 
               The STAR MAN sways over to cut it off and the middle patrol 
               car slips in next to Jenny. The STAR MAN grabs the gun from 
               under the seat.

                                     JENNY
                         No!!! No!!!

               INT. MIDDLE PATROL CAR - NIGHT

                                     DRIVER
                         He's got a gun!!

               INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT

               Jenny screams.

               A shotgun blast from the middle patrol car rips through the 
               door and into Jenny. Part of the FRONT WINDOW is BLOWN OUT. 
               Bleeding badly, she slumps against the STAR MAN.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Jennyhaydn! Jennyhaydn!!

               Her eyelids flutter open and she tries to speak, but can't. 
               The middle patrol car is lining up for another shot. The 
               STAR MAN slams the Mustang into it, sending it spinning onto 
               the shoulder and into a ditch.

               The last patrol car speeds up to replace it. The lead patrol 
               car slips in next to the STAR MAN. They've got him in a 
               sandwich. The STAR MAN stands on his brakes.

               EXT. INTERSTATE 80 - NIGHT

               Caught by surprise, the patrol cars rocket ahead of him. The 
               Mustang cuts across the swatch of land that acts as a center 
               divider in the highway and races west in the eastbound lanes.

               INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT

               The STAR MAN squints against the headlights of the on-coming 
               traffic as he calmly wedges his way straight through it.

               EXT. INTERSTATE 80 - NIGHT

               The lead patrol car tries to follow him but is clipped by a 
               Cadillac swerving to avoid the STAR MAN and bounced back 
               into the center divider. The last patrol car parallels the 
               Mustang in the westbound lanes.

               INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT

               The STAR MAN realizes he's still boxed in. A car carrier 
               swerves by on his left. The lane behind is open. The STAR 
               MAN takes advantage of the opportunity.

               EXT. INTERSTATE 80 - NIGHT

               The Mustang vaults off the shoulder of the highway into an 
               open field and bullets away through the weeds.

               The rush of oncoming traffic traps the three patrol cars in 
               the center divider.

               INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT

               Jenny moans as the car jostles over the rough ground. The 
               STAR MAN puts out a hand to cushion her ride. His headlights 
               pick up a gravel road splitting the field and he turns onto 
               it. In a quick look back, he sees the patrol car shooting 
               across the highway after him.

               EXT. GRAVEL ROAD - NIGHT

               We FOLLOW the Mustang as it winds upward through the grazing 
               lands sparsely dotted with clumps of trees. The plume of 
               dust kicked up by the fleeing car is turned silver by a full 
               moon. The WAIL OF the PATROL CARS is DISTANT BUT CLOSING.

               EXT. PASTURE - NIGHT

               The Mustang barrels around a curve and slides to a surprise 
               stop before a gate in a barbed wire fence that ends the road. 
               With the .45 in his hand, the STAR MAN jumps out of the car 
               and tries the gate. It is locked.

               When he turns back to the car, he sees something that 
               frightens him more than the approaching patrol cars. A 
               helicopter has joined the chase. He looks for a place to 
               hide. A stand of cottonwood and elm fifty yards on the other 
               side of the gate offers the only protection.

               The STAR MAN opens the passenger door. Jenny is soaked in 
               her own blood. He hooks the strap of her purse over his 
               shoulder, lifts her tenderly and, cradling her in his arms, 
               wiggles between a fence post and the gate and jogs into the 
               trees.

               EXT. PASTURE - NIGHT

               The helicopter sets down behind the Mustang. Shermin leads 
               Bell, Lyman and the technicians to the car.

                                     LYMAN
                              (seeing the blood on 
                              the passenger seat)
                         One of them must be pretty badly 
                         hurt.

               Shermin pushes the seat forward. The STAR MAN's life-support 
               suit is stuffed in the space behind it. The patrol cars skid 
               around the curve.

                                     SHERMIN
                              (to Bell, indicating 
                              the suit)
                         Get this back to the copter.

               Shermin takes a bullhorn from Lyman and goes around to the 
               front of the Mustang. The highway patrolmen get out of their 
               cars behind him.

                                     SHERMIN
                              (bullhorn to woods)
                         Mrs. Haydn, please come out. We don't 
                         want to hurt you or your friend. 
                         Please put down your weapon and come 
                         out.

               EXT. TREES - NIGHT

               Jenny's limp weight is beginning to slow the STAR MAN. He 
               hears the bullhorn but doesn't stop.

               EXT. PASTURE - NIGHT

               Shermin lowers the bullhorn and speaks to the patrolmen.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Okay, fan out. These people have a 
                         gun but we want them alive. 
                         Understand?

               EXT. TREES - NIGHT

               A deep shadow on the other side of an elm offers a likely 
               hiding place. He moves through the underbrush toward it. 
               Without warning, his feet begin to slip out from under him. 
               He struggles to regain his balance.

               When he does he looks down to find himself staring at a RAGING 
               RIVER 150 feet below. The bank on the other side is just a 
               few feet above the water and in the moonlight he can see a 
               flat plain cut by a highway that stretches into the distance. 
               Slowly, he backs away from the edge of the cliff.

               From under the elm he watches the helicopter sweep out over 
               the ravine. Its searchlight darts toward him bleaching the 
               treeline. The overhanging branches cloak him and Jenny and 
               the light passes without picking them up. The STAR MAN adjusts 
               his grip on Jenny and starts off in the opposite direction 
               from the helicopter to look for a way down the cliff.

               EXT. TREES - NIGHT

               Shermin, his people and the patrolmen are combing the woods 
               with flashlights in a picketline search. The Third Driver 
               stops at the mouth of a clearing that runs between the 
               cottonwood and elm to the cliff. He takes a bite off a block 
               of chewing tobacco.

               As he replaces it in his pocket, he sees a shadow flit across 
               the far end of the clearing. He swings his flashlight in 
               that direction. The beam catches a piece of Jenny and the 
               STAR MAN.

                                     THIRD DRIVER
                         Over here! They're over here!

               EXT. TREES - NIGHT

               Standing on the rim of the gorge, the STAR MAN sees the rays 
               of his pursuers' flashlights choking off any possible escape. 
               He eases Jenny to the ground behind a boulder. She whimpers 
               with the pain.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (strokes her cheek)
                         You will be all right.

               He stretches over the top of the boulder and scatters FOUR 
               SHOTS at the lights.

               EXT. TREES - NIGHT

               The patrolmen, the technicians and Shermin all hit the ground 
               and kill their lights.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Mrs. Haydn, we don't want to hurt 
                         you. Put down your gun and come out. 
                         We just want to talk to your friend.

               THE STAR MAN AND JENNY

               The STAR MAN peers around the boulder. At that instant the 
               searchlight from the helicopter happens to splash across the 
               men in the field. He sees that their guns are drawn and 
               pointed in his direction. The STAR MAN pulls back and takes 
               a marble from his pouch. It grows and glows gold as the STAR 
               MAN rolls it between his palms. When it reaches the size of 
               a baseball, he clutches it firmly in his right hand and 
               EMPTIES the .45 toward Shermin and the police. This time, 
               there is a BARRAGE OF ANSWERING FIRE.

               With the BULLETS RICOCHETING around him, the STAR MAN lifts 
               Jenny to his shoulder. He massages the golden orb until it 
               becomes the size of a soccer ball, then takes two quick steps 
               to the edge of the cliff and leaps into the abyss.

               EXT. ABYSS - NIGHT

               The upward thrust of the ball supports their fall and under 
               its glow they begin a slow descent to the other side of the 
               river. Above them, the helicopter dips back and locks its 
               searchlight on the shelf of boulders they just left.

               EXT. PLAIN - NIGHT

               The STAR MAN sets down with the smoothness of a man stepping 
               off an escalator. He looks over his shoulder. The helicopter 
               is still concentrating its spotlight on the ridge. He speaks 
               to the ball in his language.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (subtitles)
                         Iron channel message. Almost caught 
                         by pursuers. This may hinder escape. 
                         Wait for me.

               He lets the ball go and, with even more velocity than the 
               others, it zips into the sky.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. TRUCK STOP - NIGHT

               A WOMAN in a Frederick's of Hollywood negligee lets a TRUCK 
               DRIVER out of one of the Winnebagos parked to the side of 
               the main building.

                                     WOMAN
                         Don't forget to tell the boys where 
                         you had a good time.

                                     DRIVER
                              (calling back to her)
                         You weren't that good.

               Her rusty laugh follows him into the parking lot. He walks 
               between the trucks to a semi which has half of a pre-fab 
               mobile home tied onto its flat-bed. The polyethylene that 
               covers the open side of the house flaps in the WIND at the 
               lower corner next to the cab. The Driver opens his door. He 
               takes out a staple gun and refastens the dark green plastic 
               to the house frame.

               INT. HALF HOUSE - NIGHT

               In the middle of the empty bedroom, the STAR MAN tries to 
               cushion Jenny against the sudden JOLTS made by the semi as 
               it lumbers out of the parking lot.

               EXT. HIGHWAY 76 - NIGHT

               With the Driver taking it smoothly through the gears, the 
               semi picks up speed.

               INT. HALF HOUSE - NIGHT

               The STAR MAN moves Jenny into a rectangle of moonlight shaped 
               on the floor by a high, wide window and strips off her blouse.

               The cold light marbles Jenny's skin and makes the blood from 
               her wounds appear black. With her blouse, the STAR MAN wipes 
               away the blood on the right side of her head and neck. He 
               finds a deep glass cut on her cheek and two entry points in 
               her neck. He concentrates on her cheek and we can SEE the 
               glow of his brain through his human skin.

               A bit of the white light comes out of his forehead. It tumbles 
               across to Jenny's cheek and settles into the wound. The STAR 
               MAN watches intently as one end of the wound flares brightly 
               for an instant, then dies. The flesh left behind has been 
               closed without a scar.

               A larger piece of light drops out of his forehead into what's 
               left of the gash. With that area suffused in a healing glow, 
               he shifts his focus to the pellet holes on her neck. He sends 
               two pieces of light plunging into the wounds. Immediately, 
               they spread into halos which we can SEE radiating from under 
               the skin.

               Out of the night comes a LONG BLAST ON the AIR HORN and the 
               STAR MAN has to steady Jenny as the truck swerves around 
               something in the highway.

               When it settles back into its ride, the STAR MAN wipes the 
               blood off Jenny's shoulder. The beams of the passing cars 
               through the plastic catch the fatigue on the STAR MAN's face 
               as he works over Jenny.

               EXT. HIGHWAY 76 - NIGHT

               With its pre-fab house, the semi rumbles through Julesburg, 
               Sterling and Ft. Morgan. By the time it gets to Denver, dawn 
               is beginning to color the tips of the Rocky Mountains.

               INT. HALF HOUSE - DAWNBREAK

               It's still dark in here. With a chunk of light in his left 
               hand, the STAR MAN dabs at the last of Jenny's wounds, leaving 
               behind a phosphorescent bandage. More of these patches glimmer 
               up and down her right side. He checks her over to see if 
               he's missed a wound. He hasn't.

               He covers her with his windbreaker and, exhausted by his 
               efforts, sits back against the wall. He waits to see that 
               Jenny is sleeping comfortably, then presses the palms of his 
               hands together. The satel compass appears between them. The 
               green dot tells him he is still on course.

               EXT. INTERSTATE - SUNRISE

               Colorado Highway PATROLMEN are dropping orange fluorescent 
               cones across two of the three westbound lanes to form a 
               roadblock. The sound of a harmonica draws us to Shermin's 
               helicopter parked in a meadow beside the road.

               EXT. HELICOPTER - SUNRISE

               As the radio technician plays the harmonica, Lyman clangs 
               down the steps and bends to wake Shermin who is sacked out 
               under the fuselage.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Tell him I'm not here.

                                     LYMAN
                         I did.

               Shermin sighs and rolls over on his back. He looks terrible.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Get me a radio. At least I won't 
                         have to look at his face.

               EXT. MEADOW - SUNRISE

               Shermin is holding a field radio to his ear.

                                     FOX (V.O.)
                         We're growing very concerned back 
                         here. There's no use pretending 
                         otherwise. We're rapidly approaching 
                         a 'condition red.' People are 
                         beginning to ask difficult questions.

                                     SHERMIN
                         I'll make this as simple as I can, 
                         George. They disappeared.

                                     FOX (V.O.)
                         I don't care where you're from you 
                         just can't disappear into thin air.

                                     SHERMIN
                              (through a punchy 
                              hysterical laugh)
                         George, listen to what you're saying. 
                         This thing's changed itself into a 
                         man. Disappearing may not be that 
                         big a deal.

                                     FOX (V.O.)
                         So far you've let it cross the heart 
                         of America. For two days it has been 
                         absorbing information that is 
                         detrimental to our security. I don't 
                         see the humor in that.

               Stung, Shermin takes a deep breath, controls himself and 
               returns the radio to his ear.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Maybe... look, this is just something 
                         to think about... from what I got at 
                         the shopping center, it was more 
                         scared than anything else... I don't 
                         feel it's as big a threat as you 
                         think it is...

                                     FOX (V.O.)
                         Is that what's affecting your 
                         performance?

                                     SHERMIN
                         I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm 
                         doing my damndest to catch them. 
                         Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on 
                         70 past Grand Junction. They're 
                         heading west. If they're not flying 
                         we have a damn good chance of getting 
                         them. All I'm asking is that you 
                         people think about it.

                                     FOX (V.O.)
                         You just do your job, Shermin. We'll 
                         make the policy.

               EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - DAY

               The semi is in the slow lane. Its right rear turn signal 
               blinks steadily telling US that it is leaving the highway 
               and going north at the intersection ahead.

               INT. HALF HOUSE - DAY

               Jenny stirs awake under the windbreaker in the bedroom as a 
               sloppy DOWNSHIFT JOLTS the house. Her eyes flutter open and 
               she looks around the room trying to figure out where she is. 
               The truck leans into the turn. Jenny braces herself on one 
               arm and sits up.

               Catching the windbreaker as it slips off her front, she 
               remembers that she was shot and examines her right side. She 
               runs her fingers over her cheek and neck, across her shoulder 
               and down her side, feeling for traces of the wounds she knows 
               she sustained. She has been completely healed and there are 
               no scars. She leans forward and looks down the hallway.

                                     JENNY
                         Hello... hello.

               The WIND snapping the polyethylene is the only answer she 
               gets. She picks her blouse off the floor next to her purse, 
               but throws it aside and shrugs into the windbreaker when she 
               sees the blood and bullet holes.

               Her sudden rise to a standing position makes her light-headed 
               and she has to lean against the doorway until the spinning 
               stops. With her hands outstretched, as guards against the 
               sway of the truck, Jenny shuffles down the hallway.

                                     JENNY
                         Hello. Where are you?

               There is no one in the kitchen and she continues into the 
               living room. It is empty. Jenny opens the door to an enclosed 
               back porch. It is also empty. The STAR MAN is gone. She 
               returns to the living room and stands there not really knowing 
               what to do next. The countryside rushes by outside a floor-
               to-ceiling picture window.

               A WAIL FROM the semi's AIR HORN jars Jenny out of her reverie 
               and she goes to press her cheek against the window. She is 
               looking past her left hand at the road when she notices a 
               wide green ring on her finger above her wedding band. She 
               steps back from the window to examine it, then with some 
               trepidation, twists it off. As it clears the end of her 
               finger, the STAR MAN's VOICE SPEAKS OUT OF IT.

                                     STAR MAN (V.O.)
                         Jennyhay...

               Jenny drops the ring as if she'd been stung. The STAR MAN's 
               voice stops as soon as she does and the ring bounces across 
               the floor until it hits the baseboard. It looks innocent 
               enough lying there, but Jenny has a great deal of trouble 
               making herself approach it.

               When she finally picks it up, it does nothing. She turns it 
               in her hand and when the side of the ring hole that was facing 
               her when she took the ring off faces her again, the STAR 
               MAN's VOICE CONTINUES.

                                     STAR MAN (V.O.)
                         ...nd. You are all fixed. I'm sorry 
                         you were shot. I was a big problem 
                         for you. Thank you for your help. I 
                         can go to my ship alone now.

               EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

               The semi is picking up speed as it heads north.

               EXT. SEMI'S CAB - DAY

               The Driver checks his side view mirror to see if the lane 
               next to him is clear and is astonished to see a woman's arm 
               sticking out of the polyethylene waving a blouse at him.

               EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

               Smoke billows from under the tires as the semi skids to a 
               stop.

               EXT. SEMI - DAY

               Jenny, her purse over her shoulder, is running toward the 
               cab as the Driver steps out with a wrench in his hand.

                                     JENNY
                         Where did you stop last?

                                     DRIVER
                         What the hell do you think you're 
                         doing?

                                     JENNY
                         Where did you stop last?

                                     DRIVER
                         Stay right there...

                                     JENNY
                         What was your last stop?

                                     DRIVER
                         Elmo's...

                                     JENNY
                         Where's that?

                                     DRIVER
                         About five miles back.

               Jenny's thumb is already out for a ride as she sprints across 
               the highway.

                                     DRIVER
                              (shouting after her)
                         Are there any more in there?

               EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - DAY

               A passing car TAKES US TO the STAR MAN as he runs along the 
               shoulder to a maroon and white '57 Chevy that has pulled off 
               to pick him up.

               EXT. '57 CHEVY - DAY

               A swarthy, bald MAN with hairy arms leans across the seat.

                                     MAN
                         Where are you going?

                                     STAR MAN
                         Las Vegas, please. I do not speak 
                         English.

                                     MAN
                         Hop in.

               INT. '57 CHEVY - DAY

                                     MAN
                              (re-entering the flow 
                              of traffic)
                         I can only take you to Grand Junction, 
                         but you'll have a better chance to 
                         get a ride from there.

               The STAR MAN smiles.

                                     MAN
                         Where you from?

               The STAR MAN starts to point to the sky, then catches himself.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I don't understand.

                                     MAN
                         Parlez vous Francais?... Habla 
                         Ingles?... Sprechen zie deutsch?

               These are foreign words to the STAR MAN and he pastes on his 
               smile.

                                     MAN
                         Good job, neither do I. What do you 
                         do for a living?

                                     STAR MAN
                              (pretending)
                         I don't understand.

                                     MAN
                         I'm a cook. Do you understand 'cook?'

                                     STAR MAN
                         No.

                                     COOK (MAN)
                         Food. Eat. I prepare food. I work as 
                         a cook. That's how I make money.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I understand.

                                     COOK
                         What do you do?

                                     STAR MAN
                              (searches for an 
                              answer, then)
                         I make maps.

                                     COOK
                         Hey, that sounds interesting. You 
                         like it?

                                     STAR MAN
                         Eh... yes.

                                     COOK
                         Make any money?

                                     STAR MAN
                         No.

                                     COOK
                              (takes a pack of Camels 
                              out of his pocket)
                         You don't get rich as a cook, either, 
                         believe me. I got a girl going to 
                         college this fall. The wife had to 
                         go back to nursing to help pay for 
                         it.

               He sticks a cigarette in his mouth and flips one up for the 
               STAR MAN.

                                     COOK
                         Smoke?

               The STAR MAN takes it, quickly examines it, then positions 
               it in his mouth at the exact angle the Cook did. His eyebrows 
               raise when the Cook flicks his Bic and puffs an ash on the 
               end of his cigarette.

               The butane flame is swung in his direction and he flinches 
               back before allowing the Cook to singe his Camel. He copies 
               the Cook's puffing and the end of his cigarette begins to 
               glow.

                                     COOK
                         She wants to become a doctor. She's 
                         a bright kid. Hard worker. I think 
                         she'll make it. But the damned 
                         inflation's driven the tuition up so 
                         high it makes it real tough on a 
                         family like ours.

               The Cook inhales deeply from his cigarette and blows smoke 
               at the windshield. The STAR MAN mimics the inhalation, then 
               chokes. His eyes bulge and his cheeks puff out as he tries 
               to be cool and not cough. The Cook takes no notice of his 
               struggles.

                                     COOK
                         I got two other kids. I don't know 
                         what we'll do when they get old enough 
                         for college.

               Smoke starts to dribble out of the Star Man's nose and mouth. 
               Puzzled, he re-examines his cigarette.

                                     COOK
                         Everybody blames it on the oil crisis. 
                         That might be where it starts. But I 
                         think a lot of people are just using 
                         that as an excuse to rip the rest of 
                         us off. I see it every day in the 
                         kitchen. Peaches. We use the gallon 
                         cans. The price has gone up three 
                         times in the last year. And now the 
                         cans are only half full.

               The Cook takes another drag. As if etiquette required it, 
               the STAR MAN hurries to copy him. This time there are no ill 
               effects.

                                     COOK
                         Do you have children?

                                     STAR MAN
                         No.

                                     COOK
                         They're damned expensive and a pain 
                         in the ass sometimes, but I wouldn't 
                         trade having them for anything.

               The Cook flicks his ash out of the window. A moment later, 
               the STAR MAN mirrors his action.

                                     COOK
                         What do you think of America?

                                     STAR MAN
                         It is beautiful.

               EXT. ELMO'S - DAY

               A truck stop set back as little as the law allows from the 
               BUZZ OF INTERSTATE 70.

                                     JENNY (O.S.)
                         I'm looking for a guy about this 
                         tall, with brown hair and really 
                         gray eyes...

               We FIND Jenny at the set of fuel pumps nearest the highway 
               dogging an ATTENDANT while he services an 18-wheeler

                                     JENNY
                         He had on tan cords, a plaid shirt 
                         and a baseball cap... probably 
                         hitchhiking.

                                     ATTENDANT
                         I don't pay much attention to those 
                         guys.

                                     JENNY
                              (taking out her wallet)
                         In the last hour or so...

                                     ATTENDANT
                         Nope.

               Jenny folds back the plastic windows to the picture of her 
               husband.

                                     JENNY
                         This is him.

                                     ATTENDANT
                              (shakes his head)
                         Sorry.

               We FOLLOW Jenny as she wends her way through the trucks 
               questioning other attendants. The RUMBLE OF TRAFFIC DROWNS 
               OUT their CONVERSATION, but the answer is always the same. 
               Finally, we FOLLOW the picture as Jenny hands it up to an 
               ATTENDANT cleaning the windshield on a Peterbilt cab.

                                     SECOND ATTENDANT
                              (looking at picture)
                         I don't know... I'm not sure. I might 
                         have seen him up the road a piece on 
                         my way in. He's long gone by now.

               He hands the snapshot back to Jenny. She nods a 'thank you' 
               and looks wistfully around the yard. There is nothing she 
               can do. Fitting the picture back into her wallet, she walks 
               away. After a few steps she turns back.

                                     JENNY
                         You know if anybody here's going to 
                         Wisconsin?

                                     SECOND ATTENDANT
                         Ask inside.

               INT. ELMO'S DINER - DAY

               It's bustling, loud and smoky. Jenny is standing just inside 
               the entrance. She licks her lips and tries to clear the frog 
               out of her throat.

                                     JENNY
                              (small voice)
                         Anybody going to...

               Nobody pays any attention to her. Her voice trails off. She 
               swallows hard and tries again, this time booming out.

                                     JENNY
                         Anybody going to Wisconsin?

               The activity in the diner comes to a screeching halt and in 
               the silence Jenny adds in a normal voice:

                                     JENNY
                         I need a ride.

               An OLDER MAN, with a face seamed by cigarettes and weather, 
               waves at her from the counter.

                                     OLDER MAN
                         I'm going to Des Moines. If you can 
                         wait till I finish here, you're 
                         welcome to ride along.

               This gets some good-humored cheers and catcalls.

                                     JENNY
                         I can wait.

               Smiling self-consciously, she takes a seat at the end of the 
               counter and orders coffee from the waitress. While she is 
               waiting for it to come, she happens to glance outside and 
               sees a Colorado Highway patrol car stopped in the yard.

               The officer on the passenger side is talking to one of the 
               attendants. Jenny turns away from the window and finds that 
               she is able to watch the conversation in a strip of mirrors 
               that runs around the top of the pie case. The squad car leaves 
               and her coffee arrives.

                                     JENNY
                              (to the waitress)
                         Where's the phone?

               INT. SIT-DOWN PHONE BOOTH - DINER HALLWAY - DAY

               Jenny drops a dime in the slot and dials 'O.'

                                     OPERATOR (V.O.)
                         Operator... may I help you?

                                     JENNY
                         Could you give me the highway patrol, 
                         please?

               After TWO RINGS, the phone is picked up on the other end of 
               the line.

                                     MALE (V.O.)
                         Sergeant Packert, Highway Patrol.

                                     JENNY
                         My name's Jenny Haydn. I think you're 
                         looking for me. I was kidnapped in 
                         Eau Claire, Wisconsin a couple of 
                         days ago. But I'm free now.

                                     SERGEANT (V.O.)
                         What was your name again?

                                     JENNY
                         Jenny Haydn. I'm on my way home and 
                         I don't want anybody I'm with shot 
                         at when you...

                                     SERGEANT (V.O.)
                         Hold on.

               EXT. ROADBLOCK (INTERSTATE 70) - DAY

               Standing back of the officers, Shermin watches them check to 
               cars passing through the squeeze point. Every car trunk is 
               opened. Vans and campers are looked into.

               Lyman runs up and whispers in Shermin's ear. Shermin is 
               startled by what he hears. He leaves Lyman in charge and 
               hurries to the helicopter parked in the field beside the 
               roadblock.

               INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

               A TECHNICIAN gives Shermin a headset phone as he enters.

                                     SHERMIN
                              (hand over the mouth-
                              piece)
                         You trace it yet?

                                     TECHNICIAN
                         All we know right now is that it's 
                         east of here.

               Shermin puts on the headset and the technician starts a tape 
               recorder.

                                     SHERMIN
                         This is Marc Shermin. Where are you, 
                         Mrs. Haydn?

               INT. SIT-DOWN PHONE BOOTH

                                     JENNY
                         I don't know. Someplace called Elmo's. 
                         Look, I just wanted to tell you that 
                         I'm all right and I'm on my way home.

                                     SHERMIN (V.O.)
                         You've been through quite an ordeal, 
                         Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where 
                         you are and let us pick you up? We'll 
                         fly you home.

                                     JENNY
                         No. You'll want to ask a lot of 
                         questions I don't want to answer 
                         right now. I already have a ride.

               INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

               The Technician hands Shermin a note which reads: ELMO"S TRUCK 
               STOP/ABOUT 30 MILES EAST.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         I only called to tell you I was free 
                         and not to shoot anybody I was with 
                         if you see me.

               Shermin jabs his thumb upward, indicating that the helicopter 
               should lift off.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Is the man who kidnapped you there 
                         now?

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         I told you. He let me go. I'm on my 
                         way home.

                                     SHERMIN
                              (his hand over the 
                              mouthpiece)
                         Get a highway patrol unit over there.

               EXT. ROADBLOCK - DAY

               Shermin's helicopter lifts off.

                                     SHERMIN (V.O.)
                         Mrs. Haydn, I'm going to have to ask 
                         you to stay where you are.

               INT. SIT-DOWN PHONE BOOTH

               A sharp rap on the glass startles Jenny and she turns around 
               to see her ride.

                                     OLDER MAN
                         Ready?

               Jenny holds up a finger that asks for a moment longer on the 
               phone.

                                     JENNY
                              (into phone)
                         Mr... I'm sorry, what was your name 
                         again?

                                     SHERMIN (V.O.)
                         Marc Shermin.

                                     JENNY
                         Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up now. If 
                         you want to ask me any questions, 
                         call me at home in a couple of days. 
                         I'm in the book.

                                     SHERMIN (V.O.)
                         Do you know what you were kidnapped 
                         by?

               Pause.

                                     SHERMIN (V.O.)
                         Mrs. Haydn...

                                     JENNY
                         He doesn't want to hurt anybody. 
                         Please leave him alone.

                                     SHERMIN (V.O.)
                         Is he on his way to Lathrop Wells?

               This hits Jenny like a kick in the stomach. She leans her 
               head back against the wall. Her ride is pacing outside the 
               booth.

                                     SHERMIN (V.O.)
                         What's he planning to do in Lathrop 
                         Wells? Is he meeting someone there?

               Jenny smashes the receiver back in its cradle and throws 
               open the door.

                                     JENNY
                              (on her way past the 
                              weathered driver)
                         I changed my mind. Thanks.

               She rushes down the hallway to the dining area where again 
               she stands just inside the entrance.

                                     JENNY
                              (at the top of her 
                              lungs)
                         It's me again...

               The place goes quiet except for a smattering of laughter.

                                     JENNY
                         I need a fast ride west.

               INT. PORSCHE - DAY

               The speedometer reads 90. The driver, a bespectacled, pimply-
               faced SIXTEEN YEAR OLD, shifts into fifth gear. Jenny is 
               harnessed in the passenger seat. Chatter from a CB under the 
               dash COMPETES WITH ROCK N' ROLL ON THE TAPE DECK.

                                     JENNY
                         You sure this is your car?

                              (as they come up on a 
                              station wagon)
                         Slow down, slow down.

                                     TEENAGER
                         Geez, Mrs. Haydn, we just got going.

               But he downshifts. The Porsche is going a mere 80 when they 
               pass the station wagon.

                                     JENNY
                              (peering at its 
                              occupants)
                         I told you I'm looking for someone.

                                     TEENAGER
                         In the cars, too?!

                         I don't know where he is.

                         This is going to be a real drag. I 
                         thought you wanted to go fast.

               Howling at full throttle, three highway patrol cars rush 
               past them in the opposite direction. Jenny swivels around to 
               follow their progress until they are out of sight.

                                     TEENAGER
                         They after you?

                                     JENNY
                         What? No, of course not.

                              than before)
                         Would be kinda neat if they were. I 
                         think I could outrun them. Maybe get 
                         my picture in the papers.

               Jenny takes a second look at this guy. He flashes her a gap-
               toothed grin.

               EXT. OVERPASS - DAY

               The Cook's '57 Chevy makes a left on the street intersecting 
               the off-ramp and stops at the curb. Behind it a large plastic 
               yellow chicken twirls on a pole above the restaurant it 
               advertises.

                                     COOK
                         Well, here we are... You go down 
                         that ramp there, you're sure to get 
                         a ride.

                         And don't be shy about your English. 
                         You speak better than a lot of people 
                         I know.
                              (leaving)
                         Take care of yourself.

               As an afterthought, the STAR MAN duplicates the Cook's wave, 
               then heads down the ramp. As he clears the frame, our VIEW 
               ZOOMS AND ZOOMS AND ZOOMS UNTIL we can SEE a piece of the 
               roadblock in the valley below him. During the MOVE-IN, we 
               BEGIN TO PICK UP CB CHATTER.

               Jenny TURNS DOWN the ROCK 'N ROLL to listen to the CB.

                         I bet you we find your friend at the 
                         roadblock.

               Jenny doesn't answer immediately. She takes her time checking 
               out the people in a VW they are passing.

                                     JENNY
                              (to the road ahead)
                         We better find him before that.

               EXT. INTERSTATE 70 - DAY

               In the style prescribed by Jenny, the STAR MAN raises his 
               thumb to a dilapidated Vega shimmying down the on-ramp. The 
               two blue-haired ladies inside are afraid to look at him as 
               they go by. He has the same luck with an attractive blonde 
               secretary that passes on the highway.

               EXT. ELMO'S - DAY

               A highway PATROLMAN is standing behind the open door of his 
               car speaking into the mike of his radio.

                                     PATROLMAN
                         The girl's not here, Mr. Shermin. 
                         Seems right after she talked to you, 
                         she got a ride west with a kid.

               INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

               All six TV screens display the road rushing under it.

                                     SHERMIN
                              (into mouthpiece of 
                              his headset)
                         You get that, Lyman?

                                     LYMAN (V.O.)
                         We're ready.

               EXT. SKY ABOVE INTERSTATE 70 - DAY

               Shermin's S65 banks through a U-turn and chases west.

               EXT. INTERSTATE 70 - DAY

               A dun-colored Roadrunner gurgles down the ramp and stops in 
               front of the STAR MAN. Two grubby LONG HAIRS in worn western 
               clothes are inside with boxes of house-hold utensils and 
               duffle bags.

                                     LONG HAIR
                         Where you going?

                                     STAR MAN
                         Las Vegas, please.

                                     LONG HAIR
                         We're going to L.A.

               He looks at his buddy stretched on the jumble in the back. 
               The buddy nods.

                                     LONG HAIR
                         Sure. Get in. We can drop you in 
                         Vegas or get you darn close.

               The STAR MAN opens the door and gets in.

               INT. PORSCHE - DAY

               The CB CONTINUES TO CRACKLE with news of the roadblock. 
               Jenny's eyes restlessly search the overpass under the whirling 
               yellow chicken for any sign of the STAR MAN. She sees the 
               dun-colored Roadrunner waiting at the foot of the on-ramp 
               for a break in the traffic, but she is too far away to see 
               who's inside. As the Porsche gets closer, it overtakes an 18-
               wheeler and Jenny's view of the Roadrunner is cut off 
               entirely. She passes without seeing the STAR MAN.

               EXT. INTERSTATE 70 - DAY

               The Porsche weaves through the traffic giving Jenny a chance 
               to look into the cars and trucks it shoots by.

               INT. PORSCHE - DAY

               Jenny is turned around looking back at a camper.

                                     TEENAGER
                         I'm telling you, you're going to 
                         find him at the roadblock, or right 
                         after, or not at all.

                                     JENNY
                         If he didn't want to go through the 
                         roadblock, is there any other way to 
                         get to Vegas?

                                     TEENAGER
                         Fly.

               Jenny gives him a withering look.

                                     TEENAGER
                         The five-fifty. We already passed 
                         it. But it'll take him way out of 
                         his way.

                                     JENNY
                         Pull over. I've got to get back there.

                                     TEENAGER
                         Why wouldn't he want to go through 
                         the roadblock?... What did you guys 
                         do?... I won't tell anybody.

                                     JENNY
                         It's easier not to tell if you don't 
                         know.

               EXT. INTERSTATE - DAY

               The Porsche slows to a stop on the shoulder.

                                     TEENAGER
                              (as Jenny opens the 
                              door)
                         Wait. Could I have your autograph?

                                     JENNY
                         Sure.

               She leans back and gives the startled Teenager a kiss on the 
               mouth, then gets out.

                                     TEENAGER
                         I have nothing to do. I'd like to 
                         help you.

                                     JENNY
                         Don't worry. I'll be all right.

               She closes the door. The Teenager takes a last look at her 
               before pulling back on the highway. Jenny waits for a car in 
               the slow lane to go by, then runs across to the line and 
               waits for cars in the fast lane to go by.

               INT. ROADRUNNER - DAY

               The STAR MAN spots Jenny standing on the line peering into 
               the on-coming cars for signs of him. He becomes agitated and 
               his mouth begins to move soundlessly. There is a break in 
               the traffic and Jenny dashes to the center divider. The STAR 
               MAN leans across his driver and yells as the Roadrunner 
               plunges by her.

                                     STAR MAN
                         JENNYHAYDN!!!

               EXT. INTERSTATE - DAY

               Jenny spins around to see the Roadrunner skid to a stop on 
               the shoulder and the STAR MAN get out. A motorcycle bombs 
               by. He starts across the lanes of traffic toward Jenny. A 
               truck blasts past him in the slow lane. He is buffeted into 
               the fast lane. Jenny runs down the center divider to meet 
               him. A VW honks, its tires squeal on the pavement as it 
               swerves around him. He reaches the safety of the center 
               divider. Jenny throws her arms around him and lays her head 
               against his chest. He stands there uncomfortably not knowing 
               how to respond to this human emotion.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I told you goodbye. Why are you here?

                                     JENNY
                         The police are waiting for you up 
                         ahead. There's a roadblock. You have 
                         to go back.

                                     STAR MAN
                         This car will take me to Las Vegas. 
                         I cannot go back.

                                     JENNY
                         The police know about Lathrop Wells. 
                         We have to go another way. Come on.

               She grabs his wrist but he hangs back.

                                     STAR MAN
                         If I don't meet the ship, my people 
                         will go home without me.

                                     JENNY
                         Please understand. If you go this 
                         way, you'll never get to your ship. 
                         The police know about Lathrop Wells. 
                         We have to go another way. I'll get 
                         you to your ship. I promise.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I will go. But not you.

                                     JENNY
                         You shit! I'll decide if I go or 
                         not. Not you. I don't know what you 
                         do on your planet, but I didn't think 
                         that was very nice walking out on me 
                         like you did.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I don't want you to be hurt.

                                     JENNY
                         Come on.

               Holding the STAR MAN's hand, Jenny pulls him toward the road.

                                     JENNY
                         I didn't ask to come along on this 
                         trip, but I sure as hell am going to 
                         be the one to say when I get off.

               They bolt across the lanes of traffic to the other side of 
               the road where she flags down an old black pickup truck. She 
               says something to the driver and she and the STAR MAN climb 
               into the back. As the truck returns to the highway, the CLACK 
               OF AN APPROACHING HELICOPTER OVERPOWERS the TRAFFIC SOUNDS.

               EXT. SKY - DAY

               Shermin's helicopter slices around a pine-dotted peak 
               following the twists of Interstate 70 below. In the near 
               distance, we can SEE the roadblock.

               INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

               Unnoticed by Shermin or the Technicians, the black pickup 
               passes off the television screens carrying their quarry east.

                                     SHERMIN
                              (into headset)
                         Any sign of either of them yet?

               The roadblock appears on the television screens.

               EXT. ROADBLOCK - DAY

               Lyman, wearing a headset plugged into a belt pack, is walking 
               down the line of cars.

                         I don't think they're going to show.

               INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

               A swift kick from Shermin sends a stool clanging into a 
               bulkhead. The Technicians won't meet his eyes when he turns 
               back to them.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Okay. Tell the highway patrol to 
                         block all major arteries off 70 from 
                         here to Elmo's.

               EXT. INTERSTATE 70 - DAY

               Two highway patrol cars scatter the traffic in front of them 
               with their rack lights and SIRENS.

               EXT. PICKUP - DAY

               Jenny and the STAR MAN are sitting against the cab, a horse 
               blanket drawn up around their shoulders. They can see the 
               flashing lights coming from way down the road and watch 
               helplessly as the patrol cars eat up the distance between 
               them.

               EXT. INTERSTATE 70 - DAY

               The pickup makes the turn onto Highway 550.

               EXT. PICKUP - DAY

               For a moment, Jenny and the STAR MAN think they're safe. 
               That hope turns to despair when the two patrol cars loop 
               after them. They keep getting closer. The STAR MAN inches 
               the blanket up over his nose. Unexpectedly, the patrol cars 
               are thrown into a skid. When they stop, they are facing each 
               other ready to inspect the traffic coming off 70. They lower 
               the blanket from their faces. Jenny lays her head back against 
               the cab, exhausted.

               EXT. HIGHWAY 550 - LATE AFTERNOON

               A RUMBLE OF DISTANT THUNDER follows the lightning that flashes 
               from the dark clouds hanging on the horizon. Looking 
               incomplete without its trailer, the tractor/cab of a Mack 
               truck makes a turn on a farm road, revealing Jenny and the 
               STAR MAN standing on the gravel. The STAR MAN looks back to 
               where they came from. There is nothing coming so he sets out 
               in the other direction.

                                     JENNY
                         Where are you going?

                                     STAR MAN
                         I must meet my ship.

                                     JENNY
                         Why can't we wait here for a ride?

                                     STAR MAN
                         I feel better if I move.

                                     JENNY
                         We're hundreds of miles from where 
                         you have to be.

               The STAR MAN ignores her and continues to walk.

                                     JENNY
                              (shouts at him)
                         Even if we walk five miles, it's not 
                         going to make any difference.

               Jenny turns toward an oncoming car and sticks out her thumb. 
               The STAR MAN falls into the same pose just back of her. The 
               car honks at them as it breezes by.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (screams after it)

                              (shocked)

               EXT. ROADSIDE - LATE AFTERNOON

               A torrential rainstorm lashes the countryside. The STAR MAN 
               and Jenny splash along the edge of the asphalt. Their heads 
               are lowered against the weather. They are both drenched to 
               the skin.

                                     JENNY
                              (after a few steps)
                         We're not going to get a ride tonight.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I can't stay on this planet.

                                     JENNY
                         No one's traveling in this weather.

                                     STAR MAN
                         You promised you would get me to my 
                         ship.

                                     JENNY
                              (shouts after him)
                         I will. I will. We still have another 
                         day.

                                     STAR MAN
                         You promised.

                                     JENNY
                         What do you want from me? There are 
                         no cars on this road. I didn't ask 
                         for this stupid storm.

               The STAR MAN mutters in his language.

                                     JENNY
                         What are you saying?

                                     STAR MAN
                         You can stop. I will go on alone.

                                     JENNY
                         We're too far away to walk. Don't 
                         you understand?

               The STAR MAN looks at her. With the rain streaming off his 
               face, he looks at her. For the first time, the reality of 
               the situation hits him. He turns and, swearing in his own 
               language, flails at the rain. A distance from Jenny, he stops 
               and cries out in English.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I can't stay here. I want to go home. 
                         I don't want this skin. I don't want 
                         to look like this.

               Jenny can see him standing with his head bowed. She walks 
               over to him.

                                     JENNY
                              (trying to ease his 
                              pain)
                         Why don't you send one of your radio 
                         balloons and tell your captain that 
                         you might be late?

                                     STAR MAN
                         I used the last one to jump off the 
                         cliff...

                                     JENNY
                         Let's find a place out of the rain. 
                         I'm sure we'll get a ride in the 
                         morning.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I can't be late. I don't know if the 
                         radio balloons work above your planet. 
                         I don't know if my words went to the 
                         ship. If I'm not there, the captain 
                         will think I'm dead and go.

                                     JENNY
                         We'll get a ride in the morning.

               A flash of lightning shows us:

               EXT. DESERTED RAILROAD SIDING - DUSK

               Jenny and the STAR MAN are following the tracks to an 
               abandoned boxcar.

               INT. BOXCAR - DUSK

               The STAR MAN climbs in and pulls Jenny after him. Jenny is 
               shivering badly.

                                     JENNY
                         Can you close the door?

               The STAR MAN scrapes it forward. He activates the satel 
               compass which lights the interior of the boxcar. While he is 
               doing this Jenny turns her back to him and takes off her 
               jacket. Her teeth chattering, she tries to wring the water 
               out of it.

                                     STAR MAN
                         You are cold.

                                     JENNY
                         You're damn right I am.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I do not get cold.

               Clutching the windbreaker to her breasts, Jenny looks at the 
               STAR MAN over her shoulder. It doesn't take her long to make 
               up her mind.

                                     JENNY
                              (crossing to him)
                         Open your shirt.

               She waits while he struggles with the buttons. After two she 
               brushes away his hands and undoes the rest. She lets the 
               windbreaker drop and, slipping her arms around his waist, 
               presses her bare chest against his.

                                     JENNY
                              (savoring it)
                         Oh, you're warm... put your arms 
                         around me.

               The STAR MAN does and Jenny jumps as the wet sleeves touch 
               her back.

                                     JENNY
                         Take your shirt off.

               It is difficult with Jenny around his waist, but he manages. 
               He drapes his arms over her. She snuggles into him. The RAIN 
               POUNDS ON THE ROOF. Gradually, Jenny responds to the STAR 
               MAN's warmth and relaxes. She lifts her head off his chest 
               and looks at him.

                                     STAR MAN
                         What?

                                     JENNY
                         Nothing.

               She brushes her lips against his. The STAR MAN's not sure 
               what's happening. But he's not offended. Her next kiss is 
               full and long. He accepts it with his eyes open and when she 
               eases back he leans in for more. Jenny responds. As if on 
               command, the satel compass comes from around behind the STAR 
               MAN to hover in back of Jenny. He takes it between his palms 
               and extinguishes it.

               INT. BOXCAR - MORNING

               Jenny awakens and looks around. The STAR MAN is not with 
               her. As she stands up she hears his VOICE OUTSIDE. He is 
               speaking to something in his language.

               She goes to the door to find out what and sees him standing 
               beside a fenced-in pasture talking to the horses inside.

               EXT. PASTURE - MORNING

               Jenny joins the STAR MAN at the fence.

                                     JENNY
                         Good morning.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Horses.

                                     JENNY
                         You don't forget anything, do you?

                                     STAR MAN
                         No.

               Jenny pets one of the horses on the nose.

                                     JENNY
                              (to the horse)
                         Hello... hello. How are you this 
                         morning?

                                     STAR MAN
                         Do they talk?!

                                     JENNY
                              (laughs)
                         No, they don't talk... We talk to 
                         them.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I understand.

               An appaloosa nudges her way through the others to the fence.

                                     JENNY
                         Oh, you're pretty...

                                     STAR MAN
                         I gave you a baby last night.

               Shocked, Jenny looks at him from around the appaloosa's nose. 
               The STAR MAN is combing a horse's mane with his fingers and 
               he doesn't see her expression.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (meaning the horses)
                         They are beautiful.

                                     JENNY
                         Yes, they are.

                                     STAR MAN
                         You have been very good to me, 
                         Jennyhaydn.
                              (turns to face her)
                         You said you wanted a baby, so I 
                         gave you one.

                                     JENNY
                              (shakes her head 'no')
                         But...

                                     STAR MAN
                         It will be human and it will look 
                         like this.
                              (touches his face)
                         But when it comes it will know 
                         everything I know and everything you 
                         know. That is something from my planet 
                         that I want your baby to have.

                                     JENNY
                         I told you it's impossible for me to 
                         have a baby.

                                     STAR MAN
                         You will have this baby. If you want 
                         it. If you don't, I can stop it now.

               Jenny comes over and puts her arms around the STAR MAN.

                                     JENNY
                         I want it.

               EXT. SKY - DAY

               A formation of six black Bell Cobra helicopters rush at us 
               out of the blue. From above them we can see that they are 
               heading for a small desert town. 'Welcome to Lathrop Wells' 
               is spelled out on a hillside in white-washed stones.

               EXT. AIRSTRIP - DAY

               Grubby, unshaven and unwashed, Shermin, Bell, Lyman and the 
               rest of the crew watch the seven Cobras land in sequence. 
               Fox, immaculate in a freshly pressed black flight suit, climbs 
               out of the first one down and he and Shermin meet in the 
               middle of the runway.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Hello George.

                                     FOX
                         Shermin...

                                     SHERMIN
                         What's all this for?

                                     FOX
                         We have a new directive. I'm taking 
                         over.

                                     SHERMIN
                              (scans the Cobras)
                         We don't have to do it that way. We 
                         can catch him this time.

                                     FOX
                         Washington thinks it's too late for 
                         that.

                                     SHERMIN
                         I've never been taken off an 
                         assignment in my life. Give me twenty-
                         four hours and I'll have him for 
                         you.

                                     FOX
                         You're not hearing me.

                                     SHERMIN
                         You can change a directive, George. 
                         You've done it before. Listen to me. 
                         He's going somewhere in Death Valley. 
                         Lathrop Wells was never anything but 
                         a bus stop. East is the nuclear site. 
                         There are no roads in there. She was 
                         teaching him to hitchhike. I'm telling 
                         you. We block the four roads into 
                         Death Valley and we got him.

                                     FOX
                         We'll do that. But how are we going 
                         to hold him? He can change himself 
                         into a man. He can disappear.

                                     SHERMIN
                         That's the chance we have to take.

                                     FOX
                         No, we don't.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Then you're going to have to do it 
                         without me.

                                     FOX
                         You're a career intelligence officer, 
                         Shermin. You'll be in the air with 
                         us.

                                     SHERMIN
                         You're talking about taking a life. 
                         The most unique life form on this 
                         planet. I think we're better than 
                         that.

               EXT. LAS VEGAS - LATE AFTERNOON

               A fire-engine-red Pontiac convertible with two COWBOYS (late 
               fifties) in the front and Jenny and the STAR MAN in the back 
               moves with the traffic along the main drag in the downtown 
               area. The STAR MAN's head swivels from side to side trying 
               to take in the neon that juts up around him. The convertible 
               stops at a light. The cowboy on the passenger side opens the 
               door and tips his hat to Jenny as she and the Star Man get 
               out of the back seat.

               EXT. SIDEWALK (LAS VEGAS) - LATE AFTERNOON

               The STAR MAN is afraid of the crush of people and wants to 
               stay close to Jenny, but is fascinated by the whir and click 
               and jingle of the one-armed bandits that seem to be 
               everywhere.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Is this gambling?

               Jenny nods. A LADY in curlers and pedal pushers hits a twenty 
               dollar jackpot. Hanging onto Jenny's hand the STAR MAN turns 
               around and walks sideways to watch the quarters tumble out 
               into the lady's shopping bag.

                                     STAR MAN
                         The cowboys were right. You can make 
                         money fast gambling.

                                     JENNY
                         You don't make money gambling. You 
                         lose it.

               INT. DRUG STORE - LATE AFTERNOON

               The STAR MAN hangs back to examine a one-armed bandit inside 
               the front door while Jenny goes to the counter. An almost 
               imperceptible blue haze seems to seep from under the STAR 
               MAN's palms as he runs his hands up and down the sides of 
               the machine.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                              (to the clerk)
                         Do you have a good map of Death 
                         Valley?

                                     CLERK (V.O.)
                         We should have. Let me see.

               While the clerk searches for the map the STAR MAN comes up 
               to Jenny.

                                     STAR MAN
                         May I have twenty-five cents, please?

                                     JENNY
                         What for?

                                     STAR MAN
                         I want to gamble.

               Jenny sighs and rolls her eyes and fishes two quarters out 
               of her purse and hands them to him.

                                     JENNY
                         Here are two quarters. When you lose 
                         these, you're not going to get 
                         anymore.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I understand.
                              (heading back to the 
                              machine)
                         Thank you.

               He drops a quarter into the slot and pulls the handle. While 
               the pictures of fruit spin behind the view window, his hands 
               stroke the sides of the machine. An orange, a pear and a 
               cherry stop in the view window. At the counter Jenny explains 
               to the clerk that she is hitchhiking and wants the busiest 
               route into Death Valley without going through Lathrop Wells. 
               The STAR MAN looks long and hard at the machine before putting 
               in his last quarter. He pulls the handle. The blue haze flows 
               from his palms, three cherries lock into a line and the one-
               armed bandit begins to spit quarters.

               INT. CASINO - LATE AFTERNOON

               Jenny is nervous about being here. She feels every face that 
               looks at them could be a cop. The STAR MAN is pulling her 
               through a Maginot Line of slot machines toward a 'Super 
               Jackpot' machine that advertises a $275,000 payoff.

                                     JENNY
                         This is crazy. We don't have time 
                         for this.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I know how to gamble now.

                                     JENNY
                         You won ten dollars. Big deal. If we 
                         don't get a good ride before dark we 
                         could miss your ship.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I want to get money for you and the 
                         baby.

                                     JENNY
                         I don't need any money for the baby. 
                         I'll be fine.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Inflation, tuition, college. Children 
                         are damned expensive. I know.

                                     JENNY
                         The cook again?

                                     STAR MAN
                              (stepping up to the 
                              'Super Jackpot')
                         Yes.

                                     JENNY
                         If I ever run into that guy, I'm 
                         going to kick his ass.

               The STAR MAN pops a gleaming silver dollar into the machine, 
               pulls the handle and places his hands against the metal. 
               Jenny, knowing it can't work, but hoping that it will, stands 
               back and gnaws on her thumb. Then she sees the blue haze 
               vibrating out of the STAR MAN's palms. Jenny stifles a scream. 
               She looks around to see if anybody else has noticed. They 
               haven't. The STAR MAN smiles at her. The force field does 
               it's work. A picket line of 7's fills the view window. Amid 
               the jangle of bells and flashing lights that accompany a 
               winner Jenny doesn't know whether she should jump for joy or 
               hide her face.

               EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DUSK

               A dot in the distance becomes a brand new Camaro. As it blasts 
               away from under us we see a paper license in its back window. 
               The cabin light is on inside the car.

               INT. CAMARO - DUSK

               In the passenger seat the STAR MAN is riffling through a 
               Columbia "History of the World." A Webster's Dictionary is 
               on the dash in front of him. Wedged between his legs and the 
               transmission well is a shopping bag full of money.

                                     JENNY
                         It'll tell you pretty much everything 
                         about us...

                                     STAR MAN
                         This is very interesting. We are 
                         born knowing our history. We have 
                         other books. But not a book like 
                         this.

                                     JENNY
                         Any words you don't know you can 
                         find in the dictionary.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I understand.

                                     JENNY
                         It'll give you the different 
                         countries, how they came to be, what 
                         they are now, how America came to 
                         be, the governments, the languages... 
                         everything.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (chuckles)
                         Many of my people will not believe 
                         those things are possible. On my 
                         planet there is only one government, 
                         one people, one language. I will be 
                         asked a lot of questions.

                                     JENNY
                         What will you say about us?

                                     STAR MAN
                         I will say that we can be friends.

                                     JENNY
                         We can.

               She notices the green ring on her left hand and takes it 
               off.

                                     JENNY
                         This is yours...

                                     STAR MAN
                         If you want to keep it, you can.

                                     JENNY
                         I'd like to...

               She slips it back on her finger above her wedding band. They 
               drive in silence. The STAR MAN sets the history book on the 
               dash.

                                     JENNY
                              (takes the ring off 
                              again)
                         Would you put some of your singing 
                         in this for the baby?

                                     STAR MAN
                         You want the baby to laugh at me.

                                     JENNY
                         Yes.

               EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DUSK

               With the STAR MAN SINGING IN HIS LANGUAGE, the Camaro moves 
               further into Death Valley. The SONG FADES and we:

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - NIGHT

               The Camaro blows by a gas station, closed for the night.

               INT. CAMARO - NIGHT

               The STAR MAN shifts restlessly in his seat as he searches 
               the ghostly landscape for something familiar. He activates 
               the satel compass. The red and green dots are touching.

                                     JENNY
                         How long will it take you to get 
                         home?

                                     STAR MAN
                              (absently)
                         Many, many days and nights...

               He presses the satel compass into his palms.

                                     JENNY
                         Would you like to listen to some 
                         music?

               The STAR MAN shakes his head "no."

                                     JENNY
                         I'm sure we could find a country and 
                         western station.

                                     STAR MAN
                         No, thank you.

               Jenny takes his hand in hers.

                                     JENNY
                         Don't worry. Everything's going to 
                         be fine.

               The STAR MAN smiles wanly at her.

                                     JENNY
                              (leans forward to 
                              look up at night sky)
                         Which star is yours?

               It only takes the STAR MAN an instant to find his home.

                                     STAR MAN
                         There.

                                     JENNY
                         Where?

               He directs Jenny's attention to the constellation Auriga.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (meaning the star 
                              Capella)
                         The yellow one.

                                     JENNY
                         Oh, wow... I'll tell you what. When 
                         the baby is born, we'll go out in my 
                         back yard and wave to you.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (smiles)
                         I will wave to you.

               All we can HEAR are the TIRES HUMMING over the road. The 
               Camaro rounds the side of a low hill.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Oh, shit!

               Jenny slams on the brakes. One of the Cobra helicopters, lit 
               from the inside, is parked next to a line of flares across 
               the road ahead.

               EXT. CLOSED GAS STATION - NIGHT

               The STAR MAN is looking through a window at the repair bay, 
               lit by a work light. Jenny is standing in a phone shell on 
               the front of the garage, the receiver to her ear.

               The STAR MAN moves to the office door. He tries the knob. It 
               is locked.

                                     JENNY
                              (to the STAR MAN)
                         They're trying to get him.

               Suddenly the STAR MAN slams his shoulder against the door. 
               It swings open.

                         What are you doing?!!

               Fox's voice comes out of the receiver in her hand.

                         This is George Fox...

                         You can speak to me, Mrs. Haydn. I'm 
                         in charge of this operation now.

               EXT. CLOSED STATION - NIGHT

                                     JENNY
                         If I don't speak to Mr. Shermin, I'm 
                         hanging up.

                              (a beat)
                         Okay...

               Tethered by the phone cord, Jenny tries to see what the STAR 
               MAN is doing inside the repair bay.

               INT. REPAIR BAY - NIGHT

               Using an air filter top as a basket, the STAR MAN scavenges 
               from the work bench and the car up on the lift, fuses, lengths 
               of wire, circuit boards from a radio, tubing, metal pipe and 
               a Black and Decker drill. While he is doing this we get 
               glimpses of Jenny pleading his case on the phone. Finally, 
               leaving the receiver dangling at the end of its cord, she 
               comes around to stand in the doorway.

                                     JENNY
                         Mr. Shermin wants to speak to you.

                         Here he is.

               Shermin looks warily at the headset. When the STAR MAN doesn't 
               speak immediately, he takes the initiative.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Hello...

                                     STAR MAN (V.O.)
                         I must get to my ship, Mr. Shermin.

                                     SHERMIN
                         We can't let you do that.

                                     STAR MAN (V.O.)
                         I don't want to hurt anybody. I just 
                         want to go home.

               INT. COBRA - NIGHT

               Fox is listening to the conversation.

                                     SHERMIN (V.O.)
                         All the roads into Death Valley are 
                         blocked. We'd like to talk to you.

                                     STAR MAN (V.O.)
                         If I talk to you, I will miss my 
                         ship.

                                     SHERMIN (V.O.)
                         Hold on a minute... Let's take the 
                         chance, George.

                                     FOX
                         No deal.

                                     SHERMIN (V.O.)
                         I'm afraid we can't let you go.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I understand.

               He hangs up.

               INT. REPAIR BAY - NIGHT

               The STAR MAN shaves the rubber off the electrical lines 
               leading into the fuse box and clips two wires of his own 
               onto the exposed copper. With Jenny watching we have a montage 
               of the STAR MAN working through the night: modifying the 
               insides of the Black and Decker drill, cutting out the mid-
               section above the trigger, fitting electrical components 
               into that area, screwing a pipe into the bit-clamp, welding 
               it together with the spark that arcs between the electrical 
               wires.

               INT. OFFICE (GAS STATION) - NIGHT

               Jenny folds a sheaf of money into a sheet of yellow paper 
               and props it on the cash register. 'For Damages. Thank You' 
               is scribbled on the front. She runs out to catch the STAR 
               MAN who is on his way to the Camaro.

               EXT. CAMARO - NIGHT

               Carrying the modified Black and Decker drill the STAR MAN 
               opens the driver's door.

                                     JENNY
                         Where do you think you're going?

                                     STAR MAN
                         Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. 
                         I must go alone now.

                                     JENNY
                         I said I would get you to your ship 
                         and that's where we're going to say 
                         goodbye.

               INT. CAMARO - NIGHT

               Both hands on the wheel, Jenny is burning down the center 
               line. The STAR MAN bends two thin wires trailing out from 
               the grip of the drill. Jenny winces as he buries them into 
               the flesh on either side of his left wrist. The car skates 
               around the corner of a low hill. They can see that the Cobra 
               is still sitting next to the road.

                                     JENNY
                              (glancing at the 
                              modified drill)
                         I hope that works.

               The STAR MAN is lost in concentration.

               Jenny kills her lights and glues the accelerator to the floor. 
               Three MEN scramble from the helicopter with M16s. A BURST OF 
               SLUGS RIPS THROUGH the Camaro's WINDSHIELD. The STAR MAN 
               leans out the passenger window and with an other-worldly 
               scream, fires. The helicopter is BLOWN TO SMITHEREENS. The 
               concussion throws the men to the ground.

               EXT. BURNING HELICOPTER - NIGHT

               The Camaro whizzes through the falling DEBRIS.

               INT. CAMARO - NIGHT

                                     JENNY
                         It works.

               The STAR MAN slumps in exhaustion and pain.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I do not know how many times I can 
                         do this.

               INT. SHERMIN'S HELICOPTER - NIGHT

               It is filled with the radio voices of the Cobra crews setting 
               up to attack the Camaro.

               EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - NIGHT

               The Camaro becomes airborne at the crest of a dip. Only its 
               new shocks save the landing.

               INT. CAMARO - NIGHT

               The STAR MAN draws the satel compass out between his palms. 
               The green dot now covers the right half of the red dot. He 
               presses his palms together and looks past Jenny at the rugged 
               foothills.

               The first light of day is starting to color the sky behind 
               them. Jenny and the STAR MAN are startled by the DRUMMING 
               WHOMP OF A HELICOPTER. The STAR MAN looks out the window for 
               its source. He can't see anything. The SOUND FADES. In a 
               moment, it is REPEATED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CAR and AGAIN 
               IT FADES.

                                     STAR MAN
                         If my ship is not here, we are in 
                         trouble.

               This is a truism that Jenny doesn't want to hear and she 
               flexes her fingers on the wheel.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (points at a 
                              distinctive cone 
                              peak)
                         That's where we landed last time. 
                         Right under that mountain.

               Jenny and the STAR MAN steady themselves for the last leg of 
               their journey. Suddenly, their silence is exploded by a COBRA 
               dropping out of the sky in front of them. Its searchlight 
               bangs into their faces and, with its thirty-calibre MACHINE 
               GUNS BLAZING, it comes straight at them.

               Jenny yanks the Camaro onto the shoulder. The SLUGS CHEW UP 
               the asphalt beside it. She fishtails back onto the road. A 
               SECOND COBRA surprises them from the STAR MAN's side. Its 
               MACHINE GUN KNOCKS OUT the BACK WINDOW before he can FIRE.

               The STAR MAN crawls over his seat and arranges himself in 
               the hole that was the back window to meet the Cobras' next 
               FIRING RUN. It doesn't take them long. The first two have 
               been joined by a THIRD. They swoop down on the Camaro.

               INT. LEAD HELICOPTER - NIGHT

               The gunsights lock on the car below. The CO-PILOT squeezes 
               the trigger.

               EXT. CAMARO - NIGHT

               SHOTS THUMP INTO the trunk in front of the STAR MAN and he 
               FIRES. The lead HELICOPTER ERUPTS, raining pieces of hot 
               metal over the desert floor. The other helicopters are jarred 
               out of their run and their BULLETS harmlessly KICK UP SAND 
               on the shoulder. Before they can regroup, the STAR MAN BLOWS 
               THEM OUT OF THE SKY.

                                     JENNY
                         In front!!! In front!!!

               The STAR MAN has to hang on as Jenny dodges the car out of 
               the path of a Cobra skimming over the highway toward them. 
               As it goes over, he is able to get off a SHOT directly INTO 
               its UNDERBELLY. The BALL OF FLAME almost engulfs the Camaro.

               INT. CAMARO - NIGHT

               The STAR MAN slumps down into the back seat breathing hard. 
               Jenny looks over her shoulder at him and is shocked at the 
               strain that shows on his face.

                                     JENNY
                         Hang on.

               She throws the car into a skid and leaves the blacktop for a 
               dirt road winding between two low hills.

               EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

               At the base of a sandstone cliff, the Camaro slides to a 
               stop. Jenny helps the STAR MAN out. She supports him as they 
               struggle toward the protection of the boulders. Fox's Cobra 
               roars over the hill.

               INT. COBRA - NIGHT

                                     FOX
                              (spots the car)
                         Over there.

               EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

               The STAR MAN turns toward the Cobra. Weakly, he raises his 
               weapon and pulls the trigger. Nothing happens. The searchlight 
               from the Cobra finds them. Its machine guns begin to raise 
               puffs of gravel around them. Jenny grabs the STAR MAN's arm 
               and pulls him into the relative safety of the rocks. The 
               STAR MAN collapses against the cool stone.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (gasps)
                         I can't shoot anymore.

               Jenny looks out between the crags. Shermin's helicopter 
               arrives to join the Cobra. With their searchlights flicking 
               over the sagebrush, they move cautiously toward the cliff. 
               Jenny turns back to the STAR MAN. He is too weak to run 
               anymore.

                                     JENNY
                              (touches his shoulder 
                              lightly)
                         I won't let anyone hurt you.

               INT. SHERMIN'S HELICOPTER - NIGHT

               Six images (close-up to full shot) of Jenny and the STAR MAN 
               stepping out of their hiding place fill the television screens 
               in front of Shermin.

                         End it, Shermin.

               Lyman taps his keyboard. The screens all change to a long-
               shot of Jenny and the STAR MAN with cross-hairs superimposed 
               on them.

               EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

               Shermin's helicopter moves toward Jenny and the STAR MAN 
               standing helpless in the circle thrown by the searchlight.

               INT. SHERMIN'S HELICOPTER - NIGHT

               The cross-hairs have locked on Jenny and the STAR MAN. Shermin 
               knows he can't do it. He picks up a headset.

                                     SHERMIN
                         George... Do you hear me, George?

               Shermin flips a switch on the console that cuts Fox off.

                                     SHERMIN

               EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

               Shermin's helicopter passes over the heads of Jenny and the 
               STAR MAN and rises into the dawn sky.

                              (to the pilot)
                         Lock in.

               The gunsights lock in on Jenny and the STAR MAN. Fox's grip 
               tightens on the trigger. Suddenly the helicopter begins to 
               vibrate and drift off its target. Fox looks toward the sound 
               coming from his right and his eyes widen in fear as he sees 
               the STAR MAN's ship looming over him.

               EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

               The spacecraft passes over the top of the helicopter. The 
               whirling downdraft emanating from the spaceship's underbelly 
               yanks the Cobra away from Jenny and the STAR MAN and whips 
               it into a spin which gets faster and faster until it 
               disintegrates and falls to the desert floor.

               EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

               Jenny and the STAR MAN shield their faces against the DUST 
               STORM that billows under the WHINING DESCENT of the 
               spacecraft. It settles into a landing across the dirt road 
               resting on its three pods. With a crack, a cone of bright 
               white light blasts from the underside.

                                     JENNY
                         Well...

                                     STAR MAN
                         I must go.

               Jenny nods.

                                     STAR MAN
                         What do I do now?

                                     JENNY
                         You say you love me and kiss me 
                         'goodbye.'

               The STAR MAN puts his arms around her and holds her tight.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I love you.

                                     JENNY
                              (her head on his 
                              shoulder)
                         I'm never going to see you again, am 
                         I?

                                     STAR MAN
                         No.

               He kisses the tears out of her eyes, then full on the mouth.

                                     JENNY
                         I love you.

               The STAR MAN steps back and places a hand on Jenny's stomach.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Tell the baby about me.

                                     JENNY
                         I will.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Goodbye.

               He turns from her and walks to his ship. Jenny watches him 
               go, then remembers something.

                                     JENNY
                         Wait!!

               She gets the Webster's Dictionary and the Columbia History 
               of the World from the Camaro and runs to the STAR MAN. He 
               takes them and kisses her again.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Thank you, Jennyhaydn.

               Jenny backs away as the STAR MAN walks under the ship into 
               the white light. He waves one last time to Jenny and is 
               swallowed into the ship by the light.

               EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

               Jenny turns away from the stinging sand as the space-craft 
               lifts off. When she looks again, it is high and moving over 
               the foothills. A banking turn brings it back. The ship dips 
               low over her, rocks itself in a gesture of farewell, then 
               shoots off into the stars. When she can no longer see it, 
               Jenny drops her wave with a sigh and starts back toward the 
               Camaro.

               Over her walk, we SUPER:

          1    EXT.   ROADSIDE DINER - EARLY MORNING
          
               A strip of two-lane highway runs through a tall pine forest. There
               is a truck-stop coffee shop beside the roadway. A few 14-WHEELERS
               are scattered across the big dusty parking lot. Morning sunlight
               glints off their chrome stacks. It bakes the asphalt and warms the
               mangy hides of stray DOGS asleep in the dirt. A HELICOPTER hovers
               about the treetops like a lazy hummingbird. It's the beginning of a
               perfect day.
          
               A highway PATROL CAR slowly trolls among the trucks and dogs and
               parks beside the slat and shingled building.
          
               TWO TELEPHONE LINEMEN are scaling a power pole at the forest's edge.
          
          2    POWER POLE - ANGLE ON TELEPHONE LINEMEN
          
               High on the pole, the linemen lean back against their safety straps
               to work, their bodies forming a "Y." One of them suddenly turns,
               pointing at a nearby treetop.
          
                                              FIRST LINEMAN
                                   Lookee there!
          
               He grabs a PORCELAIN INSULATOR from his belt, cocks his arm and
               hurls it across the open stretch. It lands smack in the middle of
               the tree. SQUAWK! A rattle of leaves, a rustle of feathers and a
               HUGE BUZZARD comes flapping out. The lineman cackles over his
               marksmanship.
          
          3    CLOSE ANGLE ON BUZZARD - MOVING SHOT
          
               The big, frightened beady-eyed bird is lumbering through the sky,
               flapping for its life and suddenly...SPLAT! It crashes head-on into
          3A   the bubble of the passing HELICOPTER.

               The ship rocks as the PILOT wrestles the controls. There are THREE
               OTHERS in the cabin. The man beside the pilot, ELI CROSS, is
               sketching in a manuscript and eating an apple. He glances up in
               irritation.
          
                                              ELI
                                   Hey, will you stop wiggling?!

                                  goddamn crazy bird! It tried to
                                  kill us!
          
                                             ELI
                                     (back to his manuscript)
                                  Oh yeah, that's your story. What's
                                  the bird got to say about it?
          
              Eli bites into his apple, grimacing at the mushy mouthful    He tosses
              it out the hatch.
          
          5   EXT.   FOREST - TREETOPS
          
              The apple drops into the trees, bounces down from branch to branch
              and falls on the slanted roof of the ROADSIDE DINER beneath. It
              rolls down the eaves, off the edge and lands on top of the parked
              Highway Patrol car.

              They climb out as we see a SECOND PATROL CAR sliding up behind them.
              MORE POLICEMEN emerge from the second car.
          
          7   EXT.   DINER - ON POLICEMEN
          
              They huddle, then move toward the diner entrance.     As they pass an
              open WINDOW the CAMERA HOLDS.
          
              INT.   DINER

              A FRY COOK serves behind the long counter where MEN on stools eat
              watching the overhead TV. There is a PINBALL MACHINE in action.
              The policemen are seen ENTERING b.g. A TRUCK DRIVER ambles up and
              straddles a stool.
          
                                             TRUCK DRIVER
                                  Gettin' hot early. It's gonna be a
                                  scorcher.
          
              The fry cook fills the driver's empty water glass from a pitcher,
              then move down the counter.

          9    ANGLE ON CAMERON
          
               He sits a few stools away. He's about 25, even-featured, bone-
               weary. His appealing face needs a shave. The cook fills his water
               glass. The ice cubes rattle as Cameron's hand trembles. His eyes
               are riveted on the policemen.
          
          10   CAMERON'S POV
          
               Two policemen take seats at a booth across from the counter; one
               policeman moves to a WALL TELEPHONE, another stands near the CASH
               REGISTER looking at a magazine. They seem nonchalant, but are
               placed to block all avenues of escape.
          
          11   ANGLE ON CAMERON
          
               Suddenly startled as someone slaps him on the arm.       He whirls to
               face the man beside him.
          
                                             MAN
                                  That's really a beaut...really a
                                  beaut!
          
               The MAN is staring at the TATOO which shows below the rolled-up
               sleeve of Cameron's shirt, a large American Eagle with elaborate
               scrollwork and a patriotic slogan. The man pulls up his own sleeve
               to show a small tatoo of an anchor.
          
                                             MAN (CONT'D)
                                  My wife still yells about this...but
                                  yours -- that's some eagle...like a
                                  billboard.

                                  Yeah, that's the grand old bird.
                                     (a half-smile)
                                  Right now I just wish the son-of-a-
                                  bitch could fly.
          
               Cameron rises and moves across the diner to the pinball machine.
          
          12   ANGLE ON PINBALL
          
               The PLAYER wiggles and contorts, using body English to influence the
               balls.
          
                                               -4-
          
          
          
                                           HECKLER
                                Hey Morton, you think your ass is
                                connected to the machine? You
                                wiggle, it's gonna make the ball go
                                where you want?
          
          12A   Cameron's eyes scan the room, passing the TV above the counter. On
                it, the commercial shows a beautiful girl (who we'll later know as
                NINA FRANKLIN) bending over a bowl of dog food. Her ass, too,
          12B   wiggles engagingly. The pinball player leaves the machine.
                Cameron, stalling for time, works the plunger while a cop stalks
                closer; like the cat to the mouse hole.
          
                                           POLICEMAN
                                Hey, you're lucky. Somebody left a
                                free ball.
          
                                            CAMERON
                                Uh huh.
          
                Cameron shoots. The ball bounces crazily inside the machine, lights
                and buzzers flashing. Another policeman approaches.

                                Win what?
          
                                           SECOND POLICEMAN

                                Terrific...
          
                He rests his hands on the machine, glancing about.    Escape seems
                hopeless.
          
                                           CAMERON (CONT'D)
                                ...that's just what I needed...one
                                more chance to lose.
          
                In a lightning-swift motion, the cop clamps his hands down over
                Cameron's wrists, snapping the HANDCUFFS on. The trap has sprung.
          13    CLOSE ON COP AND CAMERON
          
                Cameron nods his head in resignation. A big uncontrollable grin
                breaks and spreads over the cop's face.
          
                                              -5-
          
          
               Then suddenly, Cameron bolts, desperately springing full speed for
               the back door. He flings it open. The cops are moving toward him.
               One has almost got his gun out.
          
                                            POLICEMAN
                                Cameron!   Halt! I'll shoot!
          
               Cameron lunges through the doorway, not realizing in his frenzy the
               screen door still blocks his path. He tears through it, but gets
               stuck halfway.
          
                                           CAMERON
                                   (panicked)
                                No!...God, don't shoot!
          
               Swinging his manacled arms like a club against the tangled mesh, he
               breaks free and runs.
          
          14   EXT.   REAR OF DINER
          
               As Cameron flies down the back steps, a COP stationed at the rear
               door, caught off-guard, tries to stop him but is shoved flat on his
               back. Cameron weaves and scrambles across the yard, over fences,
               between the shed and the barn, rolling beneath a building, out the
               other side. Behind him, distant shouts and a gunshot.
          
          15   INT.   FOREST - MOVING SHOT ON CAMERON - DAY
          
               As Cameron runs, he moves with a skill that suggests forests are not
               alien to him. He crouches low, following tiny avenues in the maze
               of tree trunks, scrambling on all fours over needles and fallen
               cones. Sweat pours down his face. His breath rasps in his throat.
               He breaks into a clearing and FREEZES...suddenly face to face with a
               MAN who crouches, blocking his path. It is one of the telephone
               linemen we saw earlier.
          
          16   WIDER ANGLE
          
               The lineman, kneeling at his tool chest, is surprised by Cameron.
               The other lineman is halfway up the power pole. They both stare at
               Cameron's handcuffs. Cameron edges back, his escape route blocked.
               The man on the ground grabs a WRENCH and moves forward with the same
               gleam in his eye we saw when he scared that bird from the tree.
          
                                           LINEMAN
                                Stand right there like a good old
                                boy and do what I say. You wanna
                                try and mess with me, you've had
                                fair warning. I was a combat Marine
                                in Korea. Okay?
          
                                                 -6-
          
          
               The lineman advances on him as Cameron backs away.
          
                                             CAMERON
                                  Korea? No shit, so was my old
                                  man...
                                     (he suddenly stamps his
                                      foot and shrieks)
                                  Aaaaaaaargh!
          
               The lineman jumps in surprise. Then, enraged like a startled bull,
               he lunges forward with the wrench. Cameron uses the man's weight
               against him, his moves those of a trained fighter. A hard knee to
               his stomach doubles up the lineman. The handcuffed arms slam down
               like a club between his shoulder blades driving him to the ground.
               A kick thrown sideways to his head and the man is out. The other
               lineman who had started to descend the pole freezes and takes one
               step back up. Cameron grabs the lineman's toolbox in his handcuffed
               grasp and dashes off into the forest.
          
          17   MOVING SHOT - ON CAMERON
          
               He slides down a slope on a carpet of fallen leaves, tumbling to the
               bottom and falls face forward into a running stream where he holds
               his head and drinks. CAMERA MOVES ACROSS the terrain. There are no
               pursuers, the forest is silent.
          
          18   CLOSE UP - HANDCUFFS
          
               The jaws of a wire-cutter clamp down severing the chain connecting
               the cuffs around Cameron's wrists. He lifts his knee from the
               cutter handle. His arms are now free. He wedges a chisel against
               one bracelet and swings a sledgehammer against it. We hear his
               sharp outcry.
          
          19   ANGLE ON CAMERON
          
               Doubled up, holding his wrist in pain. The bracelet is still
               intact. He buttons his shirt cuffs over the metal bands and climbs
               the slope to the bright sunlight on the road above.
          20   EXT.   OLD ABANDONED ROAD - DAY
          
               Cameron is trudging along the old road winding down through the
               mountainous pass. He crosses a bridge. Through the arches of its
               low stone railing, he sees a BLACK RIVER twenty feet below rushing
               toward the sea. Then, glancing back, he is suddenly alert.
          
                                                 -7-
          
          21   CAMERON'S POV
          
               In the far distance, almost lost in the shimmering heat waves from
               the road, is a tiny speck moving toward him.
          
          22   ANGLE ON CAMERON
          
               He clambers down the embankment behind the railing, peering out from
               this hidden vantage.
          
          23   ANGLE ON ROAD
          
               The speck grows larger. The SOUND of the engine is faintly audible
               now. Sunlight flashes from metal and glass. Cameron's apprehension
               suddenly changes to wonderment, for the vehicle is not the police as
               he had feared, but something else. Moving in the shimmering heat
               wave is a splendid, high, humpbacked World War I vintage DUESENBERG
               SEDAN with gleaming brass headlights, roaring towards him.
          24   ANGLE ON CAMERON
          
               He scrambles up the embankment to thumb a ride. The Duesenberg
               roars past him, filling his eyes and mouth with dust. Suddenly
               there is a screech of brakes.
          
          25   ANGLE ON CAR
          
               The Duesenberg goes into a skid and then bounces to a stop.
               Running, Cameron reaches the car, pulls the front door open and
               climbs in beside the DRIVER.
          26   INT.   CAR
          
                                               CAMERON
                                  Thanks.    I thought you didn't see
                                  me.
          
               The driver, BURT, is a husky, red-haired man about Cameron's age and
               deeply agitated. Pounding his fist against the steering wheel, he
               talks half to Cameron, half to himself.
          
                                               BURT
                                  Damn it.    Screwed it up.   Lost my
                                  nerve.
          
               Fishing a Vick's inhaler from his pocket and shoving it in his
               nostril.
          
                                                -8-
          
          
                                           BURT (CONT'D)
                                Goddamn sinuses. Can't even see
                                straight.
          
               Cameron looks at him, puzzled.
          
                                           CAMERON
                                You want me to drive?
          
               Burt whirls on him, enraged.
          
                                           BURT
                                What the hell is that supposed to
                                mean?!
          
                                           CAMERON
                                   (confused)
                                No offense...thought you might...
          
                                           BURT
                                Every one of you jerks is a goddamn
                                hotshot expert! Thanks for the vote
                                of confidence. If you think you can
                                do any better, just come and try it!
          
               He puts his boot in Cameron's stomach and shoves hard.
          
          27   EXT.   CAR
          
               Cameron comes flying out and lands on his back in the road as the
               Duesenberg squeals forward, its open door slamming shut from the
               momentum.
          
               Stunned, the wind knocked out of him, Cameron rises to his elbows.
               Before the old relic has gone thirty yards, again the brakes
               screech, swinging the car into a sliding salute turn, one hundred-
               eighty degrees and it is suddenly screaming back toward Cameron.
          28
               INT.   CAR - ANGLE ON BURT
          
               Driving with one hand on the door handle, his head halfway out the
               window watching the bridge railing and the water beyond.
          
                                             -9-
          
          29   ANGLE ON ROAD - CAR AND CAMERON
          
               Cameron, sprawled on the road, is momentarily paralyzed at the sight
               of the Duesenberg's great brass grill bearing down. His hand closes
               over a rock and with the same illogical gesture that a soldier
               flings a Coke bottle at a tank, Cameron hurls the rock in the
               direction of the car and frantically rolls sideways. The big
               spinning tires brush him as they pass. We catch a momentary glimpse
               of the rock smashing against the gleam of the passing windshield.
          
               As he stops rolling, once more face down in the dust, eyes closed,
               expecting death, he becomes aware there is only silence. He opens
               his eyes, climbs to his feet. The road is empty. The Duesenberg is
               gone. Astonished, confused -- he walks to the side of the bridge
               where the railing ends and the car might have plunged off. There is
               nothing below but the rushing black water. Here and there bubbles
               swirl to the surface. They could be from a sinking car or could be
               caused by the current.
          
          30   ANGLE ON CAMERON
          
               His thoughts racing. Was it the sun, has he imagined the whole
               thing? Suddenly a HELICOPTER appears, hovering, almost at eye
               level. Sunlight flashes through the spinning blades like a strobe.
          
          31   WIDER ANGLE
          
               It is the same helicopter we saw in the opening sequence. It has
               swiftly descended beside the bridge just beyond the railing,
               catching Cameron with no chance to run or hide. FOUR MEN Can be
               seen inside the plastic cockpit barely a few feet away. The man
               beside the PILOT is ELI CROSS. He grabs the radio microphone and
               begins speaking into it. Cameron whirls, scrambles down a bank to a
               field. The helicopter drops to within a few feet of the water,
               hovers. Protected from sight, Cameron runs between the tall stalks,
               away from the road.
          
          32   CAMERON - MOVING SHOT
          
               Glancing back through the stalks as he runs, Cameron sees a STAKE
               TRUCK barreling toward the sight of the accident. In the back,
               THREE MEN are frantically putting on black wet-suits. They look,
               from this distance, like little black toys tumbling against each
               other. Cameron runs on.
          
                                              - 10 -
          
          33    EXT.   BLUFF - OVERLOOKING SEASHORE TOWN
          
                A few hotels, like a cluster of old Victorian gingerbread, surround
                a sandy cove beyond which is the sea. There is a fishing pier,
                boardwalk, hot dog stands, pizza parlors, all swarming with
                sunbathing TOURISTS. The town's bucolic, turn-of-the-century charm
                might even survive these, if not for a monstrous yellow CONSTRUCTION
                CRANE, which juts ten stories into the sky from the center of the
                sandy cove. Cameron appears on the bluff.
          
          34    ANGLE ON CAMERON
          
                Surveying the town -- expressionless, a jungle beast going to
                survive no matter what -- at least for a few more hours. He reaches
                down and rips off his trouser legs at the thigh, turning them into
                cutoffs a vacationing bather might wear. He pulls off his worn
                boots and flings them into the brush, his eyes never leaving the
                town below. There are crowds to get lost in down there. He
                unbuttons his sleeve and looks at the handcuff still encircling his
                wrist. Stopping beside a large rock, he smashes the bracelet
                against it. It won't open. Grimacing in pain, he re-buttons the
                sleeve, opens his shirt and begins descending the palisades toward
                the town.
          35    EXT.   BOARDWALK
          
                The SCREEN is yellow and on it are the words: 'HAVE A NICE DAY.'
                THE ANGLE WIDENS and we realize the words are on the back of a
                YELLOW HAT that jiggles as its wearer walks. It is Cameron. Beyond
                him we see the tide of tourists in oils and ointments flirting with
                the sun. Teenage girls at portable toilets adjusting their bikinis.
                The boardwalk cops in white shirts, looking like ice cream vendors,
                whom Cameron deftly avoids. Then, he looks up at the sky,
                perplexed: the helicopter from the bridge is overhead, circling.
                Cameron watches it warily as he walks.
          
          35A   ANGLE ON BOARDWALK
          
                A BIG CROWD has formed at the railing of the pier. Many of the
                people with CAMERAS CLICKING at the sand below. Cameron notices the
                helicopter is now sharing the sky with a brightly painted open
                cockpit BIPLANE. It is a WORLD WAR I FIGHTER with BRITISH INSIGNIA.
          
          35B   ANGLE ON BOARDWALK AND SKY
          
                Cameron works his way through the crowd. All eyes now look upward
                at the plane. A LOUD VOICE is HEARD coming through an electric
                BULLHORN.
          
                                             - 11 -
          
          
                                           VOICE
                                All right, people. Quiet! We're
                                losing the sun! This is a take!
                                You're welcome to watch, but please,
                                no flashbulbs. They'll spoil the
                                shot.
          
               Cameron's world has become more ordered again. It's a film company
               shooting on location -- this somehow must explain the Duesenberg.
               His eyes go to the scene below.
          36   ANGLE ON COVE
          
               A CAMERA RIG suspended from the end of the yellow construction crane
               is PHOTOGRAPHING the surf where EXTRAS in German WWI uniforms
               unload ashore. The bright little plane has started a lazy dive
               toward the soldiers, its engine whining. From here it looks as
               fearsome as Snoopy and the Red Baron.
          
          37   ANGLE ON THE BEACH
          
               As the British plane pulls out of the dive, there is a tremendous
               explosion. In the flash of smoke and flame, barge, rowboats,
               ammunition and people are blown sky-high. The smoke from the
               exploding ammunition momentarily obscures the scene.
          38   ANGLE ON CROWD
          
               The onlookers are very impressed and pleased and then abruptly their
               pleasure turns to horror and disbelief.
          39   ANGLE ON COVE
          
               As the smoke lifts, the Tom and Jerry violence has become a
               horrifying reality. Bodies are scattered about. One man has been
               severed in half, drenched in blood. Chunks of meat, arms and legs
               litter the beach.
          40   ANGLE ON CROWD
          
               Paralyzed by the sense of catastrophe.
          
                                           MAN
                                   (shouting)
                                Something went wrong.
          
               Then, people begin to moan and scream.
          
                                                 - 12 -
          
          41    CLOSE ON CAMERON
          
                Staring tensely at the carnage.      By reflex, a shout escapes his
                lips.
          
                                               CAMERON
                                   Medic!   Get the medics!
          41A   A WOMAN sags into a faint.      A small child in the crowd is crying and
                clutching Cameron's leg.
          
          42    ANGLE ON COVE
          
                As the scene continues we hear a voice on the Bullhorn.
          
                                               VOICE (O.S.)
                                   Cut!   I said CUT! That's a print.
          
                Suddenly the reality of the horror turns into an obscene, absurd
                farce as what appear to be the missing parts of bodies begin
                wriggling out of the sand where the extras were partially buried to
                create the macabre effect and now the extras become whole human
                beings before our eyes once again.
          
          43    ANOTHER ANGLE
          
                The crowd reacts in various ways. Sighs of relief, laughter, anger.
                The exhumed extras wipe sand from their eyes and shake it down their
                trouser legs.
          
                                              A.D.

                                   Beautiful, Harvey. You gave
                                   everybody a heart attack.
          
                HARVEY, the Second Unit Director, yells back.
          
                                              HARVEY
                                   Eli will hate it. He said he wanted
                                   the shot in one? Now watch, he'll
                                   do six hours of pick-ups.
          
                The crowd disperses.      A TOURIST turns to Cameron.
          
                                              TOURIST
                                   Great...but why do they always use
                                   so much blood? It ruins the
                                   realism, don't you think?
          
                                              - 13 -
          
          
                                          CAMERON
                                  (still shaken, quietly
                                   mutters)
                               ...asshole...
          
               The tourist stiffens as Cameron turns away, his attention now drawn
               by the beating sound of the helicopter. He glances up.
          44   CAMERON'S POV
          
               The helicopter is descending toward the beach while the FILM CREW
               rapidly moves equipment from the last scene into piles to clear a
               landing site.
          
          45   ANGLE ON FISHING PIER
          
               Wary of the men in the chopper, Cameron is moving down the pier away
               from the landing site. Suddenly he stops short, caught by something
               he sees O.S. Excitedly he points and begins to shout.
          
                                            CAMERON
                               Hey!    Hey you...!
          46   CAMERON'S POV
          
               Below him, walking away on the sand is one of the actors with the
               same red hair, the same old British army jacket as Burt -- the man
               in the Duesenberg. Hearing the shout, the actor stops and
               tentatively turns. It's a mistake. Clearly the features are
               different. It's not Burt.
          47   ANGLE TO INCLUDE CAMERON
          
               Cameron is puzzled. He watches as the red-haired actor looks about
               to see who called and finding no one, starts off, but is stopped by
               a LITTLE OLD LADY holding a parasol and offering her autograph book.
          
                                          LITTLE OLD LADY
                               Mr. Bailey! Aren't you Raymond
                               Bailey, the actor? Would you please
                               sign your autograph? Write 'to
                               Emily...for eternal peace.'
          
               Raymond signs the book with the easy charm of a man who's done it a
               million times. He has those special rugged good looks that belong
               to Marlboro men and movie stars.

                                          LITTLE OLD LADY (CONT'D)
                               I'm certainly glad you're all right.
                               I lost my husband and my son in the
                               wars...
          
               The sound of the chopper blades has become deafening as it hovers
               for a landing. The Old Lady snatches her autograph book and heads
               for the landing site.
          
          48   ANGLE ON HELICOPTER
          
               As it touches the ground and its doors fly open. Out step the
               CREWMEN and ELI CROSS. The ASSISTANT DIRECTOR rushes up and shouts
               over the hissing blades of the idling chopper.
          
                                          A.D.
                               What happened on the bridge?!

                               All the divers found in the car was
                               the goddamn camera.

                               No Burt! All gone...caught in the
                               current probably and...they're
                               diving downstream and searching the
                               riverbanks, but...don't say anything
                               to the crew yet...

                               Jesus Christ.
          
                                          ELI
                               Yeah, Jesus Christ.
          
                                          A.D.
                               What do you want to do?

                                           ELI
                                I don't know...call my mother and
                                have her tell me it wasn't my
                                fault...
                                   (desperately)
                                ...What the hell could have
                                happened?
          
               Their words are lost in the sound of the rotor as the chopper slowly
               rises. The sudden WIND from its blades blows some screening off a
               pile of equipment. It falls on the Little Old Lady who has been
               approaching Eli and topples her into the surf. She is trapped in a
               tangle of ancient skirts and petticoats. Before she can regain her
               balance, a wave tumbles her further into the sea.
          
          49   ANGLE INCLUDING CAMERON
          
               Cameron, sitting on the edge of the pier over the water, has watched
               this mini-disaster. The undertow from the wave has swept the Old
               Lady directly beneath him. Reaching down toward her, he yells:
          
                                            CAMERON
                                Hey!   Hey, give me your hand!
          
               He can't quite reach her. As a last resort, he drops off the edge
               into the water by her side.
          50   ANGLE ON WATER
          
               He grabs for the struggling Old Lady.
          
                                           CAMERON
                                Don't be afraid! You're gonna be
                                okay.
          
               Like groping through seaweed, he reaches past her tangled skirts,
               grasps her waist and lifts her to keep her head above water. She is
               choking, gasping for air. She turns her face toward him.
          
          51   CAMERON'S POV
          
               Her features are distorted; they seem to be melting away. She frees
               her hand and violently tears at her face, pulling away the RUBBER
               MASK on which is the melting putty and make up. With it goes her
               wig and what is left is a startlingly beautiful young girl.

          The sun glistens on the wet, wild young perfection of her face,
          ingenuously sparkling laughter and for an instant it's breathtaking
          - a universal boyhood fantasy to suddenly be thrown this close to
          that kind of "movie star" beauty. It's something Cameron feels in
          the pit of his stomach.

          As they are only in a few feet of water, there is no longer any
          reason to hold her. He starts to put her down.
          
                                     NINA

               Eli, surrounded by the crew and dozens of tourists, is standing at
               the water's edge as Cameron wades in and sets Nina down.
          
                                          ELI
                                Nina! You damned near scared me to

               At the sight of Eli, she becomes like a little girl who, having
               skinned her knee and run to daddy, now can allow herself to cry.
          
                                           NINA
                                Oh hell, it's all ruined now and I
                                wanted you to see the makeup, Eli.
                                Where were you?...I even got
                                Raymond's autograph and he didn't
                                know...You'd have been proud...
          
               Nina is surrounded by people who are rubbing her with towels, taking
               pictures, all shouting at once. The CROWD closes in, excluding
               Cameron to the outskirts.
          
                                           ELI
                                   (to the A.D.)
                                Get her into a tub, then bed...and I
                                want to see her in makeup and
                                costume again before dinner.
          
               THREE CREWMEN hustle her off, as she searches the crowd for
               Cameron...then spots him.
          
                                           NINA
                                Hey! Thank you! That was really
                                gallant...rescuing an old lady!
          
               Cameron waves and starts to wander off as they whisk Nina away.
          
          53   ANGLE ON ELI
          
               He moves toward Cameron.
          
                                           ELI
                                Wait a second!   I want to thank you,
                                too!
          
               As Eli trots up, Cameron tenses, finally facing this man who saw him
               from the helicopter.

                          Don't run away.   What is that, a
                          habit with you?
          
                                     CAMERON
                          Yeah, I also smoke too much.
          
                                     ELI
                          You and Burt on the bridge...how
                          about telling me what happened?
          
          Eli begins to stroll along the sand toward the pilings which support
          the pier. Cameron hesitates, but Eli's manner compels him to
          follow.
          
                                     CAMERON
                          I don't know. He must've gone
                          crazy. He tried to run me down.
          
                                     ELI
                          Oh?...Why would he do that?
          
                                     CAMERON
                             (flustered)
                          ...I didn't ask him why! All I know
                          is he was comin' at me very fast.
                             (quoting an axiom spouted
                              by top sergeants in a

                          you'...That's one thing I learned
                          from the gooks.

                          ring...
          
          They have reached the pier.   Eli stops, he is watching something
          O.S.
          
                                     ELI (CONT'D)
                          You guys really used to call them
                          gooks? I thought that was just Time
                          Magazine.

                               That was 'Nam. What should I call
                               'em, WOPS? Nobody'd known what I
                               was talkin' about.
          
               He turns to follow Eli's gaze.
          
          54   CAMERON'S POV - POLICE CAR
          
               A POLICE CAR has driven onto the beach. From it, THREE OFFICERS
               have emerged. They are armed and efficient looking. The PRODUCTION
               MANAGER moves to greet them. Eli takes Cameron's wrist and gently
               pulls him back into the shadow of the pilings, (privately reacting
               to the handcuff he feels beneath the shirt). JAKE, the Chief, is
               irate enough to be clearly heard from this distance.
          
                                          JAKE
                               All right, this time you've had it!
                               Where is he?!
          
                                          PRODUCTION MANAGER
                               Chief, I'm glad you dropped by. Eli
                               says you gotta do something about
                               all these people on the beach.
          
                                          JAKE
                                  (bellowing)
                               Thirty minutes is what you've got to
                               get your goddamn equipment off this
                               beach and out of town!...You tell
                               Eli Cross if your men are on the
                               streets after four o'clock, I'll
                               throw their ass in jail!
          55   ANGLE ON ELI AND CAMERON
          
               Eli squats down on his heels and leans back against a piling,
               smiling up at Cameron.
          
                                          ELI
                               Speaking of jail...would you get
                               upset if I asked how many cops were
                               after you?

                          Your I.D. bracelet...the look on
                          your face...the way you ran from the
                          bridge...
                             (with exaggerated delicacy)
                          I...don't suppose you want to tell
                          me what you did.
          
          Cameron studies Eli, not knowing what to make of him.
          
                                     CAMERON
                          No...I don't.
          
                                     ELI
                             (brightly, with humor)
                          ...Could I try categories?
          
          Cameron half laughs despite himself.
          
                                     ELI (CONT'D)
                             (glancing O.S.)
                          Ever done any stunt work?
          
                                    CAMERON
                          What?
          
                                     ELI
                          How'd you like to be a stunt man?
                          You look like you're in pretty good
                          shape, fast on your feet. You could
                          do it.

                          choice.
          
          WIDER ANGLE
          
          Jake has spotted them and is approaching with his men and the
          Production Manager. Eli puts his hand on Cameron's shoulder and
          steps out into the sunlight.
          
                                     ELI
                             (softly, to Cameron)
                          Now, don't get hasty. And, remember
                          your ass, it's just like mine...
                          maybe I can save them both.

                          ...but we've gotta have three days
                          to finish this picture...
          
                                     JAKE
                             (striding toward Eli)
                          You said you'd be gone four days
                          ago, before the season started. You
                          lie, break promises...
                             (he is now close enough
                              and shouting at Eli)
                          Cross, I've gone out of my way, but
                          this time...
          
          A TRAM beeps, clangs and passes between them, interrupting Jake and
          leaving him sputtering. As it departs, Eli seizes the moment.
          
                                     ELI
                          Jake, it's been a rotten morning.
                          You're hot and tired. Let's go in,
                          have us a drink and find out what's
                          eating you.
          
                                     JAKE
                             (turning beet red)
                          Don't treat me like these other
                          morons! You know goddamn well
                          what's eating me is that Duesenberg
                          on the bottom of the river with the
                          dead man in it!
          
          There is silence. Eli stands thoughtfully kicking the sand with his
          toe. Then Jake starts shouting again.
          
                                     JAKE (CONT'D)
                          I mean, that is a goddamn public
                          bridge and a public river! You go
                          there without permits, without any
                          precautions and get a man killed!

                          No more bullshit explanations. Just
                          go...before I figure out how to hang
                          you with a manslaughter charge!

                             (after a pause; quietly)
                          No explanations...don't have any.
                          But, maybe he does...
                             (staring at Cameron)
                          Go ahead, ask him, Jake.
          
          Eli's words are exploding in Cameron's mind -- that illusory event
          on the bridge has crystallized into hard reality.
          
                                     CAMERON
                             (wide-eyed)
                          ...Now wait!...You're not blaming me
                          for...
          
                                     ELI
                             (wheeling on Cameron)
                          Why not, Burt?! Because you're a
                          fake?! Because you're just a
                          goddamn daredevil with a head full
                          of marbles?!
          
          Cameron vaguely understands that Eli is trying to pass him off as
          Burt and that he, somehow, may be saved by going along with this
          madness. Eli, turning to Jake, continues passionately...
          
                                     ELI (CONT'D)
                          He grabs the bread, blows the shot,
                          screws you up...screws me up. He's
                          dumb, Jake, but thank God, he ain't
                          dead yet. So do me a favor, put
                          your handcuffs on this son-of-a-
                          bitch and put him some place where
                          he can't get hurt!
          
          The Chief is dazed. If this is Burt, the stunt man, he is obviously
          alive. Jake goes to Cameron.
          
                                     JAKE
                          How did you get out of the car?
          
                                     ELI
                          He didn't get out. Our divers got
                          him out...and brought him back in
                          the chopper.
          
          The Chief stares at Cameron. His clothes and hair are wet. There
          is a small bruise on his cheek from when he fell out of the
          Duesenberg. He looks the part. Jake turns to Eli with resignation.

                          Cross, when these three days are up,
                          I'm going to arm my men with
                          shotguns and tell them it's open
                          season on any fruit carrying a
                          camera.
          
          He walks to the waiting police car, surrounded by TOURISTS snapping
          pictures. He glares at them, angry at the world. Eli puts his arm
          on Cameron's shoulder and leads him through the dispersing crowd
          toward the hotel. Eli is now easygoing and friendly.
          
                                     ELI
                          You did that very well.
          
                                     CAMERON
                          I didn't get a chance to say a word.
                          I just listened.
          
                                     ELI
                          There are only a few actors in the
                          world who have mastered that art.
                          Anyway, it was a good audition. You
                          landed the part.
          
                                     CAMERON
                          How? What about the crew? They
                          going to look at me and say, 'Hi,
                          Burt?'
          
                                     ELI
                          Unless you prefer, 'Hi, Elizabeth.'
                          Don't worry about my crew, they'll
                          call you anything I want 'em to.
                          Look, I'm not being callous. Burt
                          is a fucking tragedy, but there's
                          nothing in the world I can do about
                          it...I've gotta have this location
                          for three more days...and you need a
                          place to hide.
          
          They have reached the steps of the HOTEL. A BUS has stopped in
          front. TOURISTS are piling out. The POLICE CAR pulls up and parks
          nearby. Jake and his men can be seen surveying the crowd.
          
                                     A.D.

                          Eli! The crew's waiting.   We need
                          the next setup!

          Eli turns back to Cameron as they mount the steps.
          
                                     CAMERON
                          By tomorrow the local cops'll know
                          what I look like. I can't hang
                          around.
          
                                     ELI
                             (expansively)
                          "Burt," stop worrying! Haven't you
                          heard of "movie magic?"
                             (pointing to the etched
                              glass doors of the hotel)
                          That door is "the looking glass,"
                          and inside...is Wonderland. You're
                          gonna pose as a stunt man, who's
                          posing as an actor, who's posing as
                          a character in a movie...who's
                          posing as an enemy soldier...In that
                          big a crowd, who's gonna notice you?
                          People like to believe in things and
                          cops are just people.
          
          The have reached the front door.   Eli holds it open for Cameron.

                          Frankly, your problem's so simple,
                          it's almost beneath me. Have faith,
                          'Alice.' Close your eyes and enjoy.
          
          In exhaustion and resignation, Cameron nods and wearily closes his
          eyes.

                His eyes open. He stares at his face in the mirror, pleased at the
                subtle transformation. His hair has been cut shorter and dyed red,
                somehow changing his whole aspect. He rubs the red mark on his
                wrists where the bracelet has been removed.
          
          56A   WIDE ANGLE
          
                Part of the laundry room is being used for the film's Hairdressing
                Department. Cameron sits in a barber chair wearing a plastic apron,
                surrounded by dryers, wigs, etc. In b.g., washing machines churn
                constantly. DENISE, the Hairdresser, an attractive earthy woman of
                thirty-two, stands over him. He is still wary and trying not to
                show it.

                                 ...Could be worse...could be
                                 green...I think I like it.
          
                                            DENISE
                                 Of course you like it...ask
                                 anybody... Denise gives great hair.

                                 Nope.
          
                She touches his hair to test the dryness, holding her hand there for
                a moment longer than seems necessary. He grins at her, rises and
                crosses to the wall mirror to get a better look.
          
                                            DENISE

                                 need?
          
                She moves to a basement window and gazes out.

                Through the window, the crew is setting up a shot while Eli
                rehearses with Nina and his red-haired male star, RAYMOND BAILEY,
                (who Cameron earlier saw on the beach). Bailey is dressed as a
                World War I British aviator and Nina as a young girl of that era.

                          You're too good looking. His idea
                          of a perfect stunt double is two-
                          hundreds pounds of hamburger in a
                          red wig...
          
          He studies the view, his attention focused on Nina.

                              interest in Nina)
                          At selling douche powder, she's
                          fabulous; dog food?...I'm not sure
                          she's sincere.

                          I'm not sore. Isn't that what you
                          wanted to know?
                             (with sarcasm)
                          ...Or did you mean, what's the real
                          Nina Franklin like--without the
                          greasepaint and tinsel...
          
          Moving to a pile of laundry heaped on the floor, she pokes around
          with the toe of her shoe.

                          underneath?
          
          Snaring a crumpled garment, she kicks it toward Cameron, who catches
          it instinctively, then holds it up for inspection -- a pair of
          (Nina's) lace panties. He grins, mildly embarrassed by the charade.

               She reaches for the panties, but instead takes his hand and yanks
               sharply, pulling him off balance, falling back on the laundry pile
               with Cameron on top of her, their faces inches apart; surprise on
               his, amusement on hers.

               Cameron is trying to remember: what was it Eli said? "Close your
               eyes, relax and enjoy." Across the room the washing machines churn,
               whirl and heave.
          
          59   EXT.   BEACH AREA
          
               Eli and his crew are shooting a scene: a "pick-up" shot for the
               explosion sequence we saw earlier. Eli and GABE, the cameraman, are
               lying beside the camera. Before them, the "severed" arm protrudes
               from the sand in which its owner is buried, out of sight.

                                       beneath the sand)
                                   Where's Raymond?
                                      (Raymond kneels beside
                                       him)
                                   Remember, you just crashed...you
                                   were wandering the beach behind the
                                   German lines looking for a place to
                                   hide when you saw the explosion.
                                   You're stunned by the carnage. That
                                   bomb was dropped by a guy in your
                                   squadron. Okay? Roll the film.
          60   POV THRU CAMERA
          
               Through the CAMERA, WE SEE the 'arm' protruding from the sand. We
               HEAR o.s. VOICES yelling: "Turning"... "speed"... "action." We see
               the fingers begin to move spasmodically. Eli's voice yells: "Okay,
               Raymond!"
          
               Suddenly the fingers on the hand start to swell, bigger and
               bigger...like a rubber glove filling with air...then BANG! BANG!
               BANG! The (balloon-covered) fingers EXPLODE.
          
                                             - 28 -
          
          
          61   ANGLE ON BEACH
          
               Everyone has broken up with laughter at the prank, including Eli.
               Gabe is patting Eli's face, Raymond squeezing his jaw affectionately
               as one would a pet dog's.
          
                                           RAYMOND
                                   (cackling)
                                Gotcha that time! Didn't we?
          
                                           ELI
                                   (through his laughter)
                                Yeah, you got me another half-hour
                                behind.
          
               Eli climbs to his feet as the laughter subsides. Cameron, now
               wearing a uniform exactly like Raymond's, watches from the
               sidelines.
          
                                           RAYMOND
                                   (gently, grinning)
                                Thought the chief could use a little
                                cheering up today.
          
                                           ELI
                                   (turning quiet and
                                    serious)
                                ...So you heard the news about
                                Burt...
          
                                           RAYMOND
                                   (nodding)
                                Any more word?
          
                                           ELI
                                   (bitterly)
                                Afraid not...there's no picture ever
                                made that's worth it.
          
                                           RAYMOND
                                   (shaking his head)
                                I'll never understand why these guys
                                do it -- take the chances.

                                Don't know. Trying to beat the
                                system, I guess...we all know that
                                some day we're gonna die of nothing
                                more important than wrinkles...and
                                that makes us so scared and crazy,
                                we'll do anything. Go off
                                bridges...fight windmills...wars...
                                anything.
          
               There is great sadness among them.     Eli breaks the mood lightly.
          
                                           ELI (CONT'D)
                                That's what our film's about -- or
                                didn't you know?
                                   (sees Cameron)
                                Hey, Burt, come over here.
          
               Cameron crosses to them. He and Raymond stand appraising each
               other, red-haired men in identical uniforms. As Raymond offers his
               hand:
          
                                           RAYMOND
                                   (to Eli)
                                My new cock and balls?
          
                                           ELI
                                   (quickly)
                                Not new...It's important not to let
                                that get around as yet. So, for the
                                time being, let's make like he's the
                                same guy.
                                   (adding a touch of color)
                                But no longer known as "Bad-assed
                                Burt." Ever since his 'fortunate
                                rescue,'...we call him "Lucky."
          
          62   EXT.   CHURCHYARD - ANGLE ON CHUCK - LATER THAT DAY
          
               CHUCK BARTON is a tall, rugged-looking man in his mid-thirties, the
               Stunt Gaffer on Eli's film. A MESSENGER trots up and presents a
               receipt book. Chuck sets down his stunt bag and signs it absently.
          
                                           MESSENGER
                                Your film from that camera in the
                                Duesenberg's on the way to the lab.
                                Put it on the plane with my own
                                little hands.
          
                                          CHUCK
          
                                       - 30 -
          
          
                          When do we get it back?
          
                                     MESSENGER
                          Don't know. Stamped it "rush."
          
                                     CHUCK
                          If I stamp "rush" on my mare's ass,
                          she'll still take eleven months to
                          foal. Call the lab and find out
                          when!
                             (quietly)
                          I lost a man today. I wanna see
                          that footage and find out why.
          
          As the Messenger leaves, Chuck strolls over to where Cameron stands
          waiting, circles around him, sizing him up. Cameron is no longer
          wearing the uniform, but now is in jeans and a work shirt.
          
                                     CHUCK
                          Done any stunt work?
          
                                     CAMERON
                          Not really.
          
                                     CHUCK
                          Not really?   You have or you
                          haven't?
          
                                     CAMERON
                             (good-naturedly)
                          I got out of Vietnam in one piece.
                          Let me tell you that wasn't a bad
                          stunt.
          
                                     CHUCK
                             (skeptically)
                          That's ancient history.
          
                                     CAMERON
                          Seems like yesterday.
          
                                     CHUCK
                             (pointing at church
                              steeple)
                          Could you jump from that tower to
                          the that roof?
          
                                              - 31 -
          
          63   ANGLE ON CAMERON (AND STEEPLE)
          
               Gauging the fifteen-foot gap between the CHURCH STEEPLE and the roof
               of the nearby MUNICIPAL BUILDING. He unconsciously grimaces at the
               four-story drop between them.
          
                                          CAMERON
                                  (being glib)
                               Once, to save my ass, I jumped out
                               of a banana tree into an oxcart full
                               of buffalo shit. Does that count?
          
                                            CHUCK
                               We'll see.    Put these on.
          
               He throws Cameron some knee pads from his stunt bag and begins
               marking off two lines on the bare earth between the gravestones in
               the churchyard.
          
                                          CAMERON
                                  (puzzled by the pads)
                               Where do they go?
          
                                          CHUCK
                                  (tapping his knee)
                               Under the pants.
                                  (pointing to lines he has
                                   drawn)
                               I want you to jump from here...to
                               there.
          
               Cameron hops up to the starting line, finishing with the knee pads
               clumsily, surveys the distance of not more than seven feet.
          
                                          CAMERON

               Makes a casual jump, landing on the line and looking at Chuck for
               approval.
          
                                          CHUCK
                               Very good. Except you're dead!!
                               Your brains are scattered all over
                               the goddamn pavement. You landed on
                               the edge and fell backwards four
                               stories. Where do we send the body?
          
                                       - 32 -

                             (returns to the starting
                              line)
                          Don't bury me yet.
          
          He takes a running start and leaps hard.    While he's still in mid-
          air, Chuck yells.
          
                                     CHUCK
                          You're still dead! You fell over
                          the other side of the building.
          
          Cameron has landed three beyond the mark and looks up at Chuck a bit
          shaken.
          
                                     CHUCK (CONT'D)
                          You wanna try it right, once? You
                          should land in a tuck-and-roll.
          
                                     CAMERON
                          Show me, sergeant.
          
          Chuck launches himself head-first. His hands touch the ground just
          beyond the second mark to break his fall, easing him into a shoulder
          roll, he somersaults to his feet.
          
                                     CAMERON
                          Very fancy.
          
          He takes a running start and does the same.   Not quite as well, but
          well enough. As he rolls to his feet:
          
                                    CAMERON
                          Okay?
          
                                    CHUCK
                          Better.

                          My speciality is Hopscotch.
          
          Chuck turns on him enraged, overreacting.

                                And Burt's specialty was drowning.
                                You know one goddamn daredevil on
                                this picture was enough! What the
                                hell was Eli thinking, giving me a
                                smart-ass, cocky, amateur kid when I
                                need a stunt man! It's a little
                                different running across that roof
                                when they're pumping tracer bullets
                                over your head.

                                I was running for twenty-six months
                                with guys shooting at me...not over
                                my head...at my head and I'm alive.
                                I knew daredevils. I got nothing
                                against them...it's just they're all
                                dead. So ease off and give me a
                                chance...
          
               Cameron is surprised to see that Chuck is grinning.

                                Hey, were you putting me on?
          
                                            CHUCK
                                Me?   I wouldn't know how to do that.
          
               Chuck starts to walk away, then stops and looks at Cameron.
          64   EXT.   ROOFTOP MUNICIPAL BUILDING - CLOSE ON CHUCK - MINUTES LATER
          
                                           CHUCK
                                   (pained)
                                Can you imaging Eli doing a World
                                War I picture without horses? Do
                                you know the gags I could do with
                                four runaway horses pulling a
                                caisson?
          
               Cameron sailing into the SHOT. Chuck ducks slightly, catching
               Cameron on his back and flipping him into a somersault. Cameron
               lands on the sharply slanted slate roof of the municipal building.
               Chuck stands beside him straddling the peak. The church steeple can
               be seen in b.g. (and we now realize time has passed and we are no
               longer in the graveyard of the previous sequence, but atop the
               building).

                                   (climbing to his feet)
                                What's Eli got against horses?    I
                                love horses.
          
                                           CHUCK
                                Don't butter me up.
          
                Cameron goes running at Chuck and once again flies over his
                shoulder. Sprawling on the slippery slate, he looks up to see Chuck
                strolling down the hazardous incline like a mountain goat. Cameron
                scrambles to follow.
          
                                           CHUCK
                                   (as he walks)
                                We'll draw a sight line for you to
                                follow down the roof here, while
                                you're rolling. Now there's nothing
                                very difficult. But this is where
                                you gotta think. Your mind can't be
                                on snatch. It's gotta be on
                                grabbing that gutter.
          
                They have reached the lower edge of the roof.    Cameron looks down at
                the drop.

                                You know a good falling horse makes
                                more money in four minutes than a
                                bank president does in a year?

                                still get your chance.
          
                Chuck has stopped and they peer down through a skylight to where the
                crew is setting up a shot in a room below.
          
                                          CHUCK

               They move to another edge of the roof overlooking a NARROW CENTRAL
               COURTYARD. They gaze down at a WINDOW AWNING two stories below that
               juts from the side of the building-wing across the court.

                                When the pipe breaks loose, you fall
                                and hit that awning. Then Eli yells
                                "cut" and old Raymond takes your
                                place for the close-ups and the
                                glory. That's where the German
                                soldiers catch him and throw him in
                                the nuthouse. They're shootin' that
                                scene downstairs now.

                                Probably doesn't hold rain.

          65   EXT.   MUNICIPAL BUILDING ROOF - CLOSE ON CAMERON - DAY
          
               Cameron's face is beginning to sweat and the veins are bulging from
               the growing strain of some physical effort.

               CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal Cameron dangling from a section of rain
               gutter, four stories above the ground.

          66   INT.   MUNICIPAL BUILDING - ASYLUM SET
          
               In a large vacant hall on the ground floor of the municipal
               building, a movie set has been erected representing the ward room in
               a World War I military asylum. In it, Eli's crew is filming a
               sequence -- a dozen enraged INMATES in tatters, heads shaven, wild-
               eyed, advance toward Raymond, shrieking (as though in echo of
               Cameron's exultant yell).
          
          67   CLOSER ANGLE
          
               Raymond, dressed as a British Flyer, his face bloodied, crouches and
               retreats in terror, a man caught in a nightmare, as these mutilated
               derelicts suddenly swarm over him. One, like a mad dog, goes fro
               his throat, another wields his own artificial limb as a club.
               Raymond (in character) breaks free and screams.
          
                                           RAYMOND
                                ...STOP!...Get away!!
          
               For an instant, the inmates stop in stunned silence -- broken only
               by a distant shout overhead.

          Eli stands amidst the camera crew photographing the scene.   He is
          waving for order.

                          that roof...
          
                                     ELI
                             (cutting him off)
                          ...Never mind. I didn't like it
                          anyway.
          
          As Eli steps down from the DOLLY, a solemn, quiet man approaches him
          from among the onlookers. It is SAM BAUM (the writer).
          
                                     SAM
                          What's wrong?

                          Call a break.
          
          The A.D. Calls "Five minutes" and the crew moves toward the coffee
          urn. Eli wanders toward the door, Sam pursuing.

                                the middle of the night when you
                                first read it, raving about the
                                magical madhouse scene, the upstairs
                                maid?
          
               Eli rips the page with the "madhouse scene" from his screenplay as
               they stride out of the building.

               There, beside the rear entrance on a pile of construction sand, sits
               Eli, cross-legged, staring morosely at some kids who play nearby.
               He is absently folding a torn script page into a paper airplane.
               Behind him, at a respectful distance, stand the Production Manager,
               A.D., half a dozen assorted crew chiefs and Sam Baum, all looking
               concerned. Sam looks at the others, shrugs and approaches Eli,
               squatting beside him on the sand pile.
          
                                           SAM
                                What do you wanna do, Eli?...
                                They're all waiting.
          
               While Sam talks, Eli takes a fistful of sand and pours it in Sam's
               shoe. Suddenly noticing, Sam yanks his foot away.
          
                                           SAM (CONT'D)
                                   (irritated)
                                Being childish isn't going to help
                                your movie...You know, there's
                                nothing wrong with the story.
                                   (removing his shoe and
                                    shaking the sand out)
                                The real problem is since I wrote
                                this thing two years ago, you've had
                                Watergate, the energy crisis,
                                Women's Lib, the economy is down the
                                tubes...You want to talk about
                                burning issues?...There's arsenic in
                                the glue on the back of food stamps!
                                That's why you don't like the
                                "madhouse scene." Your goddamn war
                                story has lost its relevance.
          
                                           ELI
                                Don't be negative, Sam. We can
                                start a new one in time for the
                                preview.
          
                                             - 39 -
          
          
               Sam has finished replacing his shoe and Eli pours a fistful of sand
               into Sam's other shoe.
          
                                           SAM
                                Cut it out, will ya?
          
          70   INT.   HOTEL DINING ROOM - THAT NIGHT
          
               Eli is at the head of a long table, CAMERA PULLING BACK TO REVEAL a
               dozen members of the company dining with him. Nina sits beside Eli
               listening with rapt attention to Sam's monologue, her dessert fork
               sensuously lingers at her lip.
          
                                           SAM
                                Two years ago you were all charged
                                up to make a great big anti-war
                                statement and they wouldn't let you.
                                Now they let you, but you haven't
                                got a war. What you've got is egg
                                on your face because Vietnam's long
                                gone and it's too late!
          
                                           ELI
                                Our picture's not about fighting
                                wars...
          
                                          SAM
                                Oh?
          
                                           ELI
                                ...It's about fighting windmills.
          
               The truth in Eli's statement registers on Sam. Cameron sits farther
               down the table, watching Nina watch Eli...and wishing she were
               watching him.
          
                                           ELI
                                War isn't the disease...It's only
                                one of the symptoms.
          
                                           SAM
                                   (hooked)
                                What's the disease?
          
                                       - 40 -
          
          
                                     ELI
                          That's the big question, Sam. Name
                          the disease and you've licked the
                          screenplay.
                             (indicating Cameron)
                          Ask him. 'Cause he knows what the
                          film is about. Right Lucky? Tell
                          'em...How'd you like Vietnam?
          
                                     CAMERON
                          How'd you like bubonic plague?
          
                                     ELI
                          You drafted?
          
                                    CAMERON
                          No.
          
                                     ELI
                          See, Sam? Here's another one who
                          hates war...but he enlisted.
                              (to Cameron)
                          You fought in Vietnam for two years?
                          ...I mean actually were out there
                          killing people...
          
                                     CAMERON
                          ...Hey, I didn't kill that many
                          people...
          
                                     ELI
                          Don't be modest, Lucky. Everybody
                          digs a little violence...What was
                          that you said on the beach?
          
          Cameron is starting to bristle at Eli's needling, particularly with
          Nina watching.
          
                                     CAMERON
                          About what?
          
                                     ELI
                          About getting home for Thanksgiving?
          
                                     CAMERON
                             (tentatively)
                          ...that you better figure the guy
                          coming at you is trying to kill
                          you...?
          
                                    ELI
          
                                         - 41 -
          
          
                            Yeah. See, Sam?...That's what the
                            disease is about...being scared
                            shitless. Inventing enemies.
                            Whistling in the dark. I wish you'd
                            talk to the kid, Sam, I mean it.
                            You know, really, you guys should
                            room together.
          
                                       SAM
                               (getting the last word)
                            Hey, Lucky, give me your cot by the
                            window and I'll let you read a great
                            madhouse sequence.
          
          They all laugh.
          
                                       SAM
                               (surrendering)
                            All right, Eli. I'll write you
                            another scene. What difference does
                            it make? The studio will cut it all
                            out anyway and what you got left is
                            a lot of swell battle scenes, which,
                            when I was back there they said were
                            "just terrific."
          
                                       ELI
                               (simply)
                            No, they won't.
          
                                       SAM
                            Yeah, what makes you different?
          
                                       ELI
                               (quietly)
                            Because they know if they cut my
                            picture, I'll kill 'em.
          
          The deadly in Eli's voice was more than intended and there is
          suddenly an awkward silence at the table. Cameron eyes Eli with a
          wry smile.
          
                                       CAMERON
                            You mean, bang? Kill 'em, just like
                            that?
          
                                          - 42 -
          
          
                                        ELI
                                (matter of fact)
                             No. I'll kill 'em and eat 'em...I
                             hate to waste anything.
          
                                        SAM
                                (laughs)
                             They call him "Eli the Terrible..."
          
                                        ELI
                             Sam, my picture is the only kid I've
                             got! If the studio said your
                             daughter, Jennifer, would look
                             better with her fingers chopped off,
                             what would you do?
          
                                        SAM
                             Being an insecure writer, I'd call
                             my agent...and get another opinion.
          
          Everyone laughs.
          
          Jake, the Chief of Police, is seen in the background approaching the
          table. Cameron spots him and starts to rise.
          
                                        CAMERON
                             ...If you'll excuse me...

                             Don't go away, Burt.   I want you.

                             Jake! Long time, no see. You taken
                             care of my problem with the beach?
          
                                        JAKE
                             I'm not talking to you.
                                (to Production Manager)
                             I understand you got that film out
                             of the Duesenberg...

                                (cutting in)
                             It's at the lab, Jake.

                                          JAKE
                               I'm talking to this gentleman.
                                  (to Production Manager)
                               We want to see it.
          
               Cameron, realizing the film might disclose his presence on the
               bridge, reacts with alarm, which increases as Eli says...
          
                                          ELI
                               Tell the Chief it's our pleasure.
                               Soon as it gets back...but ask him
                               why.
          
                                           JAKE
                                  (choked up with its
                                    importance)
                               You can tell your Mr. Cross this
                               inquiry comes from a source so high
                               it is not his to question...
                                  (now at a loss for proper

                               Someone they're looking for may have
                               been on that road when the car went
                               off.
                                  (to Cameron)
                               Burt, you see anybody?
          
               Then, suddenly noticing something different about Cameron's
               appearance...
          
                                          JAKE (CONT'D)
                               Hey, did you have red hair
                               before?...

                               like Raymond...I didn't see a soul.

                               Tell the Chief that Burt was so busy
                               being brilliant, he wouldn't have
                               noticed Jesus Christ walking on the
                               water.
          
               Jake pulls a PHOTOGRAPH from a manila envelope and hands it to
               Cameron.

               A wire photo, front and side views of Cameron, taken at his military
               induction. War ages a man...he looks younger and quite different in
               his GI Haircut.
          
                                          ELI (V.O.)

                               The eyes go on top.
          
          72   ANOTHER ANGLE
          
               Cameron hands the photo back to the Chief, who passes it around the
               table. Denise receives the photograph, studies it and glances up at
               Cameron, expressionless. He returns her gaze.

                               they saw him headed this way.
          
               Eli takes the photograph.

                               I don't know about those fifty guys,
                               but I know one weary guy who's gonna
                               crawl upstairs and hit the sack.
          
               Eli looks at Cameron with grudging admiration.

               They mince off (the fag act all the more amusing because of
               Raymond's strictly masculine looks). Eli shouts after them.
          
                                           ELI
                                So long as you're back in ninety
                                minutes. It's a work night for some

                                   (loftily)
                                ...Those who give a shit.
          
               Raymond "gathers" Nina along the way, wrapping his arm about her
               shoulders -- Cameron watching silently. Then, charging from across
               the dining room like a tanker steaming in their wake, comes a
               gushing, overwrought, blue-rinsed MATRON.
          
                                           MATRON
                                Miss Franklin! Miss Franklin! Your

          73   INT.   CAMERON'S HOTEL ROOM - CLOSE ON DRESSER - NIGHT
          
               Drawers are slamming open and shut as Cameron hurriedly stuffs his
               few belongings into his pockets.
          
               WIDER ANGLE
          
               It's a mean little bedroom, with Sam's clothes, typewriter, etc., in
               evidence. Seeing Sam's wallet, Cameron pulls a wad of money from
               it, at the same time accidentally knocking Sam's false teeth off the
               dresser. He hesitates, then stuffs back all the bills but a twenty.
               He strides to Sam's closet, pulls out shirt and slacks, stuffs them
               in a cloth beach bag, also belonging to Sam and starts out the door.
               Then he stops, gets on his hands and knees, looking for the false
               teeth, which he finally finds. Now, annoyed at himself for being a
               "nice guy," he throws them carelessly on the dresser and quickly
               exits.

          74    EXT.   HOTEL - LATER THAT NIGHT
          
                As Cameron moves down the steps, the returning company STATION WAGON
                pulls to a stop in the driveway. Nina, Raymond and a few others
                emerge from the car. Cameron turns away so as not to be seen as
                they pass him on the steps heading for the entrance.
          
                                              DENISE
                                   Bet they're looking for that nut who
                                   killed all those campers in Montana...
          
                                             RAYMOND
                                      (drunk)
                                   ...Too many campers, weed 'em out!
                                   ...Imagine, sitting an hour at a
                                   roadblock.

                                   We should have waited, it wouldn't
                                   have been an hour.
          74A   They've entered the hotel. Cameron continues to the bottom of the
                stairs, hesitates, looking back at Nina.
          75    CAMERON'S POV
          
                Silhouetted through the etched glass doors (on the other side of
                "The Looking Glass") he sees the lithe, gay, exquisitely beautiful
                figure of Nina -- light sparkling from the cut glass dances about
                her face -- a hauntingly romantic image.
          76    ANGLE ON CAMERON
          
                He watches for a moment with hopeless longing. Finally, turning
                from her, he looks about at the dark water and deserted boardwalk.
                There come some of Eli's crew, laughing, joking, cutting a swatch
                through the stillness, pushing their heavy brutes toward some nearby
                spot to light a night shot. There's the CHURCH TOWER. He stares at
                it, wavering in his resolve to leave, wondering what would happen
                if...
          
                                              NINA'S VOICE
                                   What next? Do you rescue the maiden
                                   from the tower?
          
                She has come up behind him, unnoticed.    He turns, startled, and
                there she stands.

                                (smiles)
                          Hi.
          
          For a moment they search each other's eyes -- for intentions.   Then
          she glances at the tower.
          
                                     NINA
                          Yes. It does look pretty high.
                             (with concern)
                          Are you worried about tomorrow?
          
          Cameron's mind is racing over all the things he'd like to say so she
          would know him instantly. But his answer is simple and sounds
          sincere.
          
                                     CAMERON
                          Not much. I guess if there were any
                          real danger, Eli wouldn't let me do
                          it, would he?
          
                                    NINA
                             (quickly, reassuring)
                          No. I'm sure it's safe.

                             (abruptly, with a boyish
                              grin)
                          Good. Then you jump.
          
                                    NINA
                             (laughing)
                          Okay.
          
          She understands the slightly jealous rebuke for her blind faith in
          Eli. Her laughing answer hangs like a challenge.
          
                                     CAMERON
                          Well, come on.

                          What, right now?
          
          For a moment he weighs it: whether to "run" or stay. Then acts on
          his decision. Starting to laugh, he takes her hand and pulls her
          toward the tower. She holds back, struggling playfully.

          77   INT.   BELL TOWER - NIGHT
          
               It is crowded with bells, a small walkway and railing surrounded
               them. The city lights are seen beyond. Below are the sheds where
               crewmen are preparing the next day's shooting. Just beyond is the
               overwhelming silhouette of the huge CRANE. Nina and Cameron reach
               the top of the stairs winded and laughing, as they rush to the
               railing and lean over. Nina gasps, clutching Cameron in genuine
               fright.

                                can't jump from this...you'll get
                                killed! It's crazy!...

                                ...It's not that bad. It looks
                                worse at night... Chuck says it's
                                like robbing a candy store.

                                Now stop that! ...I'm going back.
          
               She whirls to go.   He stops her, taking her by the shoulders.
          
                                           CAMERON

               Her concern for him has turned to anger, like a mother slapping her
               child for running in the street.

               His arm still restrains her. She takes hold of it, then suddenly
               softens with a look of slight surprise.

               After a moment, he answers quietly.

                                So are you...and you're not even
                                gonna jump.
          
               It's true. She is trembling and so is he -- not from fear. He
               slowly draws her toward him, her mouth reaching up to his. And then
               they are devouring each other. Abruptly, they're illuminated by a
               fierce blast of white light. They separate and stare, blinking in
               shock and confusion.

               They are pinned in the crossbeams of two more giant arcs. Quickly
               she yanks him down with her out of sight behind the railing.

               Eli is lounging in the bucket suspended from the crane.   Beside him
               Gabe adjusts one of the giant brutes.

                                I could kill this brute and fill
                                with juniors. You'd get a halo

               Gabe smiles, scurries off. Eli glances at the tower, grins, having
               toyed with them long enough, he yells.

          Privately, she gives Cameron's arm an affectionate squeeze, then
          disappears around the corner of the building. He is left holding
          the beach bag, pursued by the Peter Pan in the basket. It has now
          dropped to ground level so Eli is looking up at Cameron.

          Eli's basket now moves up a few feet so he's looking down at
          Cameron, riding beside him while he walks.

                          promise to show that cop the film?

                He pulls Cameron into the basket beside him so unexpectedly that
                Cameron drops Sam's bag. Eli picks it up and plops it into
                Cameron's lap. Suddenly Cameron finds himself soaring skyward at a
                stomach-churning rate -- while Eli rattles on...probing, disarming,
                quixotic...

                                feet tall? He came up to Fay Wray's

          84   IN BELL TOWER
          
               Near Cameron, the SECOND A.D., crouched out of sight with a walkie-
               talkie, stabs a finger at him.
          
                                            SECOND A.D.
                                Go!...Go!
          
               A burst of tracer bullets streak past Cameron. Sparks fly, as stray
               bullets seem to bounce and ricochet off the bells.
          85   MACHINE GUN
          
               A 50-calibre MACHINE GUN, a SPECIAL EFFECTS MAN in Levi's and sport
               shirt, pumping tracers past the bell tower.
          86   TWO SHOT - BELL TOWER
          
               The Second A.D. slams his hand down on a PLUNGER, setting off a
               series of explosive squibs. Like machine gun bullets, they start
               shattering the railing, moving toward Cameron, forcing him to the
               edge of the tower.
          
               Vaulting over the rail, he clings to the side of the bell tower.
               Explosive bursts disintegrate the railing in his hand. He shoves
               out, launching himself into space. Twisting, hurtling across the
               gap between the buildings, falling, crashing to the slate roof,
               crawling and scrambling for a hand hold. The relentless tracer
               bullets chip the slate beside him. Crouching low, Cameron, like an
               animal, moves across the roof to the safety of a water tower.
               Squibs burst over his head and spouts of water stream from the
               tower.

               Moving around the tower, suddenly there are TWO GERMAN SOLDIERS
               running at him with bayoneted rifles. He wheels and there stands
               ANOTHER GERMAN (Chuck), who leaps toward him, slamming down his
               rifle butt. The blow glances off Cameron. They grapple, kicking,
               clawing, rolling down the steep slope, picking up momentum.
          87   RAIN GUTTER
          
               The roof's edge rushes toward them, below it a fearsome drop.
               Cameron's hands reach out desperately grabbing for the railing as
               Chuck, screaming, hurtles off the edge, writhing as his body tumbles
               in space toward the ground.
          88   CAMERON
          
               Sweat pouring from his face, a gash on his cheek gushes blood, his
               eyes glazed, he pulls himself back on the roof.
          89
               CATCHER
          
               Chuck, lying relaxed on the straw and mattress safety pad which
               caught him on the ground, looks up, cups his hands and shouts at
               Cameron.
          
                                           CHUCK
                               Go!...Go!
          
          90   ROOF
          
               Cameron, running for his life along the edge of the roof, the
               soldiers shooting down at him from the roof's peak. He reaches the
               far end, looks down. There is the awning jutting from an adjacent
               wall two stories below. He scrambles off the roof. Clinging to the
               down spout, he starts descending it.
          91   SPECIAL EFFECTS MAN
          
               Looking up from the ground, he yanks a control rope.
          
          92   CAMERON
          
               The bracket holding the down spout breaks loose. The spout starts
               to fall away from the side of the building. Cameron clings to it,
               riding its downward arc as though it were a falling tree.
          
                                               - 56 -
          
          93   AWNING
          
               At the end of the arc, Cameron throws himself free for a safe
               landing and smashes against the awning. Instead of holding, it rips
               apart like paper and, in that unexpected instant, Cameron's eyes
               widen in genuine terror as he plummets through the shredded canvas
               toward a skylight one floor below.
          94   SKYLIGHT
          
               Exploding in a shower of glass and wood as it is struck by Cameron's
               body. He hurtles downward toward a blur of images.
          95   ANGLE ON COT
          
               Collapsing from the impact of Cameron's fall. The MAN and WOMAN who
               were making love on the cot have been flung to the ground and roll
               entwined with him. Cameron is dazed. Like a drowning man, he rages
               to free himself from the tangle of naked limbs and smothering flesh.
               A painted face shrieks in laughter -- as the door to the room he is
               in is thrown open, revealing:
          
          96   BROTHEL SET ­ INT. MUNICIPAL BUILDING
          
               Cameron has fallen into a cubicle in what appears to be a World War
               I German army brothel. In the high-ceilinged room, there is a row
               of cots separated by makeshift screens. COUPLES jump up from the
               cots startled. A line of partly naked GERMAN SOLDIERS waiting their
               turn at the whores have broken into shouts and laughter at Cameron's
               unorthodox entrance. They crowd around the cubicle where Cameron
               fell and now struggles with the couple.

               The men tear him free from the couple shouting playfully.

                                     (dialect)

                          Wait your turn like the rest!
          
          Cameron's confusion changes to helpless fury as he kicks and
          struggles against a forest of grasping hands ripping his clothes
          away, passing him back toward the rear of the line.
          
                                     THIRD MAN
                             (dialect)

                             (dialect)
                          This is a whorehouse, not a stable.
          
          Whores have left their cots to join in the assault, screeching in
          glee. As he maniacally lashes out at his good-natured molesters,
          the blood from Cameron's face smears a whore's body.
          
                                    ELI'S VOICE
                          Cut!
          
          Instantly everything stops. Cameron is sprawled half-naked on his
          knees at the end of the line. Enraged, he whirls toward Eli who has
          caused this humiliation. Then the CLAPPING begins, the CAST and
          CREW applauding his stunt. People slap him on the back admiringly.
          A robe is thrown around him. He is helped to his feet. Suddenly
          Nina is there flinging her arms about him and kissing him on the
          mouth.
          
                                     NINA
                          I'm so proud of you...I could just
                          die!
          
          He is pulled away from her by the backslappers. Now Cameron is
          responding to this strange new sensation -- the warmth of public
          acclaim. He regains his poise, hoping his embarrassing anger wasn't
          noticed. Chuck is now beside him, reaching up to the wound on
          Cameron's face and pulling away the plastic makeup patch with fake
          blood inside; the "wound" is gone. He starts feeling Cameron's
          shoulders, arms and ribs for possible damage.

                              wincing in pain)
                          Why didn't you tell me about the
                          awning? I could have been killed.

                               mother's arms from the time you hit
                               the sugarglass skylight. Those
                               stunt men you fell on would have got
                               you out of anything.

                                  you, lookin' for the nearest
                                  whorehouse.
                                     (putting his arm around
                                      Cameron)
                                  How about that, Lucky? When that
                                  stunt man's boob hit you in the
                                  mouth, was it just another boob...or
                                  did it taste like kraut?
          
                 The crew laughs and so does Nina.    Cameron feels humiliated by Eli's
                 patronizing tone.
          
                                             CAMERON
                                  It tasted lousy. But what do I
                                  know? You try it, Eli. You're the
                                  expert in bad taste.
          
                                             ELI
                                     (for the group)
                                  Uh-oh, sounds like the soldier's got
                                  his feelings hurt.
          
                                            CAMERON
                                  Naw, naw. I just don't know about
                                  Germans. Where I was we only raped
                                  gooks.
          
          100    INT.   HOTEL GARAGE - CLOSE ON ELI
          
                 As though continuing previous dialogue.

          100A   WIDER ANGLE
          
                 Revealing Eli and Cameron walking through the hotel GARAGE toward a
                 replica of the lost Duesenberg which a MECHANIC works on.

                                  ...Really? Rape? No. I think
                                  you're putting me on. Come on, now,
                                  no more hints.
                                     (he thinks)
                                  Let's see...Christ, could be
                                  anything. I know a guy in this
                                  state got 20 years for having
                                  cunnilingus with his wife.
                                     (studies Cameron)
                                  No...I guess you're not the type.
                                  More likely some hideous crime of
                                  violence...
          
                 Eli is getting under Cameron's skin.     They stop at car.
          
                                             ELI
                                     (to mechanic)
                                  Have you seen Harvey?
          
                                             MECHANIC
                                  I think he's in there.
          
                 Mechanic nods toward a door at the rear of the garage. Eli pats the
                 fender of the Duesenberg. Cameron views it with a strange sense of
                 unease. Putting his arm around Cameron's shoulder, Eli leads him
                 toward the back door yelling to mechanic.
          
                                             ELI
                                  You'll have it ready on time?
          
                                             MECHANIC
                                  Yeah, but don't look under the hood
                                  or you'll find a Chevy.
          
          100B   At the door, Eli can barely open it to squeeze through.
          
          101    INT.   STORAGE ROOM
          
                 An incredible number of people have wedged themselves into this tiny
                 smoke-filled room, peering over each other's heads toward a lighted
                 area at the far end.
          
                                             ELI
                                     (shouting)
                                  Harvey in here?

                                Quiet. We're shooting.
                                   (then back to business)
                                Come on...let me have a little more
                                face...a little more face!
          
                Eli squats on his haunches peering between the legs of the onlookers
                and tugs on Cameron's sleeve to join him.
          
          102   POV
          
                Hazily, through the restless shifting limbs, male and female, like
                the first rays of morning sun breaking through to the depths of the
                forest, we glimpse Raymond and Gabe shooting their eight millimeter
                epic: Two people screwing in a rowboat. Raymond suddenly throws
                his hands up in despair.
          
                                           RAYMOND
                                   (screaming)
                                Cut!
                                   (indignantly)
                                Jesus, Kenneth. Great control. All
                                right, who's doubling for Kenny on
                                the inserts?
          
          103   ANGLE ON ELI AND CAMERON
          
                Cameron and Eli rise to their feet.
          
                                           ELI
                                Can you believe this? They spend
                                the whole day working in a
                                whorehouse and look how they relax?
                                That's dedication. You think sex
                                can save the world?
                                   (grins at Cameron)
          
                                           CAMERON
                                That's not my bag, Eli.
          
                                           ELI
                                Sex, or saving the world?
          
                                           CAMERON
                                ...The world, that's your special
                                job. And Jesus, are we all lucky to
                                have you around...
          
                Suddenly Cameron is shoved backwards by the door as someone pushes
                against it to get in.
          
                                              - 63 -
          
          
          104   ANOTHER ANGLE
          
                It is Harvey standing in the doorway with Nina.
          
                                            HARVEY
                                    (to Eli)
                                 Hey Chief, ya lookin' for me?
          
                Nina tries to peer over the heads of the crowd, pushing into the
                room. Cameron steps toward her without thinking. He wants her out
                of there.
          
                                            NINA
                                 What's happening?   What's going on?
          
                                            GABE
                                    (joking)
                                 Look who's here! Nina, we need you.
                                 Still got your makeup on?
          
                Nina, who by now has seen what's happening, laughs.
          
                                            NINA
                                 That's a daring touch, Raymond!    The
                                 rowboat. Terribly symbolic.
          
                There is general laughter, but not shared by Cameron. He
                surprisingly finds himself angry at Nina's presence here and
                everyone's easy familiarity toward her. She sees Cameron and Eli
                through the smokey dimness and works her way toward them smiling.
                Eli puts his arms about her shouting over the din.
          
                                            ELI
                                    (kidding her)
                                 Just like the old days, huh kid?
                                 Remember the sunglasses and garter
                                 belts back when we got our start?
                                 Make you nostalgic?
          
                More laughter.   Nina turns to Cameron.
          
                                            NINA
                                 Hi Lancelot. What's a nice boy like
                                 you doing in a place like this?
                                 Going to rescue the maiden from the
                                 boat?
          
                                            ELI
                                 He just asked if he could do the
                                 rowing. Didn't you, kid?
          
                                       - 64 -
          
          
          
                                     CAMERON
                          Having fun with me, aren't you?
                          It's Eli's potty training class.
                          Show little Lucky the pretty lady.
                          Make dirt on the pretty lady. Watch
                          little Lucky puke. Trouble with you
                          is you think the whole world is your
                          own personal crapper.
                             (Cameron starts to exit)
                          Have yourself a time...Just wallow
                          around in it, man. Watching you
                          makes me feel like Mr. Clean.
          
          Cameron storms out in a rage. Eli watches with a thoughtful smile.
          Sam, who has witnessed the outburst, turns to Eli, furious:
          
                                     SAM
                          ...Goddamn little prudish bastard!
          
                                     ELI
                          No more than you and me...it's the
                          human condition. We just hide it
                          better.
          
                                     SAM
                          ...Are you kidding?...If That guy in
                          the rowboat was a Marine sticking a
                          bayonet in her instead of a cock,
                          that uptight son-of-a-bitch would
                          have saluted.
          
          Eli starts laughing.
          
                                     SAM (CONT'D)
                          Fucking Fascist. What are you
                          laughing at?
          
                                     ELI
                          It's just...that girl in the
                          rowboat, she looks exactly like your
                          daughter, Jennifer.
          
                                     SAM
                             (outraged)
                          Goddamn you, Eli.   That's not funny!
          
          He grabs Eli by the shirt front, cocking his fist.

                Sam's anger fades to a sheepish grin, realizing he's fallen into
                Eli's trap. Where his daughter is concerned, he's just as prudish
                as Cameron. Eli snaps an affectionate headlock around Sam's neck.

                On the folding chairs facing the PORTABLE SCREEN, a dozen people are
                silhouetted against the light from the projected dailies. Cameron
                enters, pausing so his eyes can adjust to the dark.

                In the dimness, Nina sits separated from Eli, Sam and a few others.
                On the screen, a World War I British biplane in steady flight is
                interrupted by a couple of subliminal cuts. Another subliminal
                flash holds and replaces the scene on the portable screen. It's a
                "NUDIE" SHOT -- a rear view of the lady taken in the rowboat the
                night before.

                The watchers all break up, recognizing the work of Raymond and Gabe.
          
                                              GABE

                As Nina laughs good-naturedly, the airplane is back on the portable
                screen.

                Involuntarily smiling to himself and now less uptight about last
                night, he walks over and sits down beside her.

                Without even glancing at him, Nina gets up and moves to a chair some
                distance away. He is stunned, then angry. Then confounded. Then
                resigned to the ways of women, he goes over and sits beside her.

                                   you as an equal go to your head.

                 child for talking.

                 Nina, close to tears, quickly gets up and hurries out of the
                 theater, as Cameron sits there numbly staring at the screen.

                 On the portable screen, Raymond in helmet and goggles is in the
                 cockpit of an airplane. He stuffs a bottle of champagne into a
                 leather flying boot, dangles the package over the side and lets it
                 go. Raymond looks down and salutes (like that famous scene in
                 "WINGS").

                 Eli's voice yells 'cut' on the sound track. The angle on the
                 portable screen widens and we see that the airplane sits on the
                 ground with an electric fan blowing wind in Raymond's face.

                 Now the scene on the portable screen changes: from the ground, we
                 see the same biplane flying low. An object drops from the cockpit
                 (the boot). Then there is a burst of flame in the engine. Trailing
                 smoke, the plane wobbles, crash-lands (sliding alarmingly close to
                 CAMERA). It ground-loops, goes up on one wing and, as it crashes
                 down, we see that the pilot who we assumed was Raymond, is really a
                 dummy that is flapping absurdly and falling to pieces before our
                 eyes during the crash. There are groans, laughter and raspberries
                 O.S.

          Look at soldier boy there, jumping
          off fucking buildings, risking his
          ass every day, doing stuff way over
          his head!...What would you do in
          that plane, Lucky, if you were about
          to die?
          
                     CAMERON
             (off guard, embarrassed)
          What else? I'd dance for joy...I'd
          probably do a jig.
          
                      ELI
          Great!   That's what we'll do.

          Eli...
          
                     ELI
          All right, not a jig...a
          Charleston...
          
                     SAM
          A Charleston?
          
                     ELI
          ...On the wing of the airplane!
          
                     SAM
             (contempt)
          ...That's ridiculous.
          
                     ELI
          You're damn right...
          
                     SAM
          The Charleston is silly...They won't
          believe it.
          
                     ELI
             (excited)
          I'll do it so they'll believe it!
          
                     SAM
             (smugly)
          You'll get a laugh, Eli.

                                   (toward rear of the room)
                                Right, Lucky?
          
          109   (SHOCK CUT TO SKY) - CLOSE ON GERMAN FIGHTER PLANE - DAY
          
                It screams down vertically, full power, machine guns blazing, then
                smashes into the earth, shredding to fragments hurled in every
                direction. The dead German pilot is flung crumpled to the ground.
                The plane's carcass explodes, filling the screen with fire and black
                smoke through which we see a brightly colored PARACHUTE descending.
                The FIGURE dangling beneath it passes through the smoke and flames
                and tumbles to the ground, rolling, his parachute now ablaze. It is
                Cameron dressed in a British flyer's uniform.
          110   ANGLE WIDENS
          
                To show the hand-held Arriflex at Gabe's eye, Eli behind him,
                steering Gabe by the back of his belt and carrying the battery pack
                as they photograph Cameron shedding the harness. With the camera,
                they crouch and move together like a three-headed, four-armed, four-
                legged creature.
          
                Banking steeply, a British fighter roars past Cameron, its wingtip
                almost brushing the ground, machine guns rattling, driving some
                advancing German soldiers back toward the woods.
          
                The plane touches down to rescue Cameron, the pilot beckoning.
                Cameron has pulled off the dead German pilot's boots and helmet.
                Stray bullets strike about him as he sprints to the idling British
                plane. It is a single-seater. It starts to pick up speed. He
                grabs a strut and scrambles up onto the lower wing.
          
          111   ANGLE ON CONSTRUCTION CRANE
          
                The bucket hanging from the giant CRANE descends. Smoothly Eli
                guides Gabe backward, seating him in the bucket. The bucket rises,
                lifting Gabe while he photographs the scene, as the plane with
                Cameron on the wing becomes airborne.
          112   ANGLE ON PICKET FENCE
          
                Behind it is a CROWD OF SPECTATORS who jump up and down shrieking.
                CAMERA PANS to show Nina among them, her excitement hardly more
                controlled.

          113   ANGLE ON CRANE BUCKET AND BRITISH AIRPLANE
          
                The giant arm of the crane swings and rises with the plane,
                completing Gabe's spectacular shot. Now we see a HELICOPTER drop
                into frame, photographing the plane from the other side. The
                chopper and the vintage British plane bank together in perfect tight
                formation with Cameron standing spread-eagled between the wing
                struts like a flying Christ, as they soar into the sun.
          114   ANGLE ON CAMERON
          
                Seated on the wing, his back against he fuselage, legs firmly
                against the struts. His white silk scarf streams into the tearing
                wind. Jamming a champagne bottle into the German's boot, he holds
                it up. The pilot grins approval, popping the cork on a second
                bottle which spouts foam into the slipstream. Laughing, he passes a
                glass to Cameron and pours from above. The liquid is lost in the
                wind. Shrugging, he swigs from the bottle and hands it to Cameron.
                Cameron drinks. The champagne pours down his throat and face and,
                holding the strut with one hand, he rises to his feet.
          
                The pilot waggles his wings, giving Cameron a seesaw ride to get his
                bottle back. Cameron now seems drunk. He lets go of the strut and
                stands leaning against the wind. As the pilot toasts his courage,
                Cameron's balance falters and he grabs the strut.
          
                Now, Cameron picks his way through the guywires toward the end of
                the wing. Then he bounces up and down, rocking the plane. The
                pilot starts to sing to Cameron's rhythm, "How ya gonna keep 'em
                down on the farm..." And Cameron dances the Charleston.
          115   INT.   HELICOPTER
          
                Gabe at the eyepiece of the Mitchell, slowly tilting up and down to
                follow the action.

                Through the plastic bubble, the biplane can be seen in the distance
                going through its antic maneuvers.

                CLOSE ON BIPLANE
          
                Cameron holds the boot poised, lets go. Then, the pilot is struck
                by a bursting shell. As he slumps over, the plane skids and slips
                and drops off into a spin. Cameron clings for his life as the
                sickening momentum grows, until his feet are flung out from under
                him and he dangles from the wing, whipping in space.
          117   WIDE ANGLE
          
                Suddenly it becomes clear how what we are seeing is possible -- the
                airplane is no longer in flight, but is dangling a few feet above
                the ground, suspended from the cable of the huge crane. The crewmen
                shove at its tail and wingtips to keep it revolving. Cameron is,
                indeed, clinging to the wing strut, his feet held in space by the
                centrifugal force. But, if his hands slip, he will fall ten feet
                instead of to certain death.

          120   POV THROUGH LENS
          
                As the spin slows down and the plane appears to level out, Cameron
                regains his footing, perches on the wing and looks forward in
                growing horror.

                We see the rapidly approaching trees. Closer and closer, until with
                a horrendous crash, the plane sails between two trunks, shearing off
                the wingtips, the nose smashing into another, hurling Cameron off
                the wing like a crumb flicked from the table.
          123   EXTREME CLOSE UP - CAMERON
          
                Apparently hurtling through the air, his eyes widen at the impending
                impact. A gasp and then a sharp cry. But instead of the
                crash...the ANGLE WIDENS and we see it is Cameron reaching orgasm.
                With extreme contentment on his face, he rolls over revealing Nina,
                who, it is clear, has also had a lovely time.
          
          124   WIDER ANGLE - INT.   NINA'S HOTEL BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
                They are in bed in a pleasant large room (the Queen Anne Suite),
                untidy, with script pages, wigs, costumes, fresh flowers, the
                leftovers of a room service dinner. Nina caresses his back,
                noticing bruises. She kisses them gently and starts to giggle. He
                looks at her quizzically.

                The ALARM CLOCK on the dresser BEGINS RINGING.   He sits up, puzzled.
          
                                           NINA (CONT'D)
                                I have to study my scene for
                                tomorrow. The Old Lady at the
                                cemetery. It's brutal. I set the
                                clock in case we dozed off.
          
                Cameron gets up, moving toward the dresser to turn off the clock,
                but instead stops at the stand holding the Old Lady wig. He runs
                his fingers through it as the clock continues to ring.
          
                                           CAMERON
                                How come they cast you as an old
                                lady?

                                Will ya turn off the clock?
          
                Subtly, we sense something is bothering Cameron.    He ignores the
                still-ringing clock.

                          Anyway, his patriotism is stronger
                          than his love and he leaves me with
                          another little patriot in my belly.
          
          During this he has taken the wig and puts it over his head, glancing
          in the mirror.
          
                                     CAMERON

                          I could use the money and I don't
                          look half bad.

                          Honey, you'll ruin it.    Take it off.
          
          He does.

                          The clock's electric. It'll ring
                          forever.
          
          Instead of turning off the clock, he crosses to the Old Lady's dress
          on a hanger. He looks at the dress appraisingly.

                          Eli might really go for that, the
                          big soldier as a little old lady.
          
          Disturbed, Nina leaves the bed, turns off the alarm clock and
          adjusts the wig properly on its stand.

          They embrace and cling to each other. She starts back for the bed,
          but he detours for the clock and pulls out the alarm again, and
          again it BEGINS RINGING.
          
                                     NINA

                          get shot out of a cannon.
          
          With the alarm still ringing, he starts toward the bed.

                          Why?
          
                                     CAMERON
                          For me, that's why. That's Eli
                          yelling for you to work on your
                          scene and us saying, "Up yours,
                          Eli," and I like that.
          
                                     NINA
                          Do you want to leave?
          
                                     CAMERON
                          I want to make love to you while Eli
                          is screaming his head off.
          
          The whole idea is so incongruous that she starts laughing. He gets
          on the bed with her. THE ALARM CONTINUES TO RING. They struggle
          about, giggling at the absurdity.
          
                                     NINA
                          I can't make love with the clock
                          ringing.

                          Betcha can.
          
          While he moves over her body, she grabs a pillow and hurtles it at
          the clock. It falls over, but keeps on ringing. By now, Cameron
          has entered Nina and she is rapidly becoming more involved in that,
          than in the clock.

                 CLOSE ON MOVIOLA
          
                 In the darkness, the machine is like an ominous hunchback,
                 splattering shards of light against Chuck's intensely watching face.
                 He is highly disturbed at the unseen image.
          
                                               CHUCK
                                       (to himself)
                                    Crazy bastard!
          
                 ANGLE WIDENS, showing a small STORAGE ROOM has been converted to a
                 makeshift EDITING ROOM, where Chuck sits working the MOVIOLA.
                 Slowly becoming aware of someone, he glances up through the spinning
                 reels and dimly sees Cameron leaning in the doorway.
          
                                               CHUCK
                                    There was no way it could go
                                    wrong...unless he just went ape.
          
                 Cameron ambles over as Chuck reverses the film to see it one more
                 time. Even as he catches a glimpse of the film whirring backward,
                 he realizes he's seeing BURT'S DEATH SCENE in the water. Now Chuck
                 has reached the beginning of the film and is moving it forward
                 again.
          125A   CLOSE UP - VIEWER OF MOVIOLA
          
                 The film whirs as we see through the windshield over Burt's
                 shoulder, the car flying through the air, hitting the water and
                 sinking beneath the surface. Burt goes through the motions of a man
                 trying to free himself.
          
                                               CHUCK
                                    The harness is okay...the roof is
                                    holding...it all seems fine.

                                    ...Badly. Eli wouldn't use a foot
                                    of it...poor slob died for nothin'.
          
          126    ANOTHER ANGLE
          
                 Sweat is running down Cameron's face.    Finally, with dread...
          
                                               CAMERON
                                    That crack...in the windshield...

                                 What about it? Probably from the
                                 impact. No water coming in.
          
                Cameron's face reflects immense relief. At least he's not guilty of
                that. The flung stone was not the cause. Now, abruptly, Burt's
                body begins to move more violently.
          
                                            CHUCK'S VOICE
                                 There! Look at that. He's starting
                                 to panic. Will you, for Christ's
                                 sake, tell me why?
          
                As Chuck slows the film, we see Burt's head duck beneath the view of
                the underwater camera, leaving only the steering wheel and
                windshield. For an instant, the current changes the light and the
                crack glows brightly, like a spider web. Burt reappears, his face
                now toward camera, wild with terror. The slow motion lends a
                bizarre elegance to his agony. Abruptly, the FILM GOES BLACK.
          
                                            CHUCK
                                 Shit. That's where it stops. That

                                 his finger off the remote button.

                                 to end, with the flyer dying in the
                                 water?

          127   INT.   REHEARSAL HALL - DAY
          
                In one of the private DINING ROOMS off the lobby, tables and chairs
                are pushed against the wall to make room for a rehearsal now in
                progress. Some early morning TOURISTS have gathered outside the
                entrance, watching. A few members of the kitchen staff peer through
                an inside doorway. Sam and key crewmen stand on the sidelines as
                Eli rehearses with Nina.

                             (gesturing)
                          The graveyard's over here...
                             (he takes a few steps)
                          ...Her car's parked here.
                             (sets down a folding
                              chair)
                          ...Lots of these little graveyards
                          along the roadside...most of the
                          stones are unmarked...
          
          He takes Nina by the hand and pulls her down beside him, kneeling on
          the floor.
          
                                     ELI (CONT'D)
                          You're tired...you're broke...all
                          things which meant so much are gone.
                          What's left is a single memory...
                          that brief bright love.
          
          Nina's listening intensely but something catches her eye. Among the
          tourists at the doorway stands Cameron, who has paused to watch, his
          costume slung over his shoulder. He nods to her with a small tender
          smile. Subtly, so Eli won't notice, she smiles back, then renews
          her concentration.
          
                                     ELI (CONT'D)
                          ...You spent your month's pension in
                          hiring the car. You just can't look
                          for his grave any longer...so you
                          pick one...any one. You kneel...
                          then lay the flowers down.
                             (yells to the prop man)
                          What have we got for her?

                          No...something she picked herself...
                          wildflowers or something.
          
          Sam crosses over to them and kneels beside Eli and Nina.

                                 Eli. An idea, maybe. Instead of
                                 flowers, what if she brought him the
                                 things of their life together...of
                                 their sexuality...like her
                                 nightgown, her underclothes...
          
                Eli looks at him thoughtfully.

                From a paper bag, he takes a SMALL BRONZE CASTING of a BEAR and A
                GIRL on a SWING beneath a tree. He sets it down.
          
          128   INSERT ON THE BRONZE
          
                Sam's hand presses a lever on the side of the bronze. There is a
                whirring of the clockwork and a music box melody plays. The girl
                begins to swing. The bear slides toward her. She mechanically
                lifts her bronze dress until they meet, performing their clockwork
                love rite. Nina giggles.

                                 Mechanical bronzes were quite a
                                 thing.

                Eli begins to beam. Sam, realizing he has again fallen into the
                trap, winces, chagrined. Eli grabs him in a bear hug.

                in joy.

                                Hey Denise, for Christ's sake! We
                                got a set call in forty minutes.
          131   ANOTHER ANGLE
          
                To include a MAKEUP TABLE against the far basement wall with THREE
                ACTORS sitting at it, wearing plastic aprons to shield their
                uniforms.
          
                                           DENISE
                                   (to Cameron)
                                You just sit here...dry...and
                                repent.
          
                She crosses to the men at the makeup table.
          
                                           ACTOR
                                Glad ya could tear yourself away.
          
                                          DENISE
          
                                              - 82 -
          
          
                                 Don't panic. He's still got that
                                 whole big emotional thing to do with
                                 the dog food lady before they even
                                 get to you. You may not work 'til
                                 midnight.
          
                                            ACTOR
                                 You wait. Eli'll wave his wand and
                                 get it out of her in five minutes.
          
                                            DENISE'S VOICE
                                    (trimming his hair)
                                 You're confused...He got it into her
                                 in five minutes. To get it out of
                                 her...it takes longer.
          
                There is general knowing laughter as Denise crosses back to Cameron
                and sees by the look on his face she has hit her target. The
                thought of Nina and Eli as lovers had never occurred to Cameron.
          
                                            DENISE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                                 Oops...somebody didn't know...
          
                The effect is stronger than she had expected.     Now compassion sets
                in.
          
                                            DENISE (CONT'D)
                                    (softly)
                                 Hey. C'mon, Red...I'm a woman
                                 scorned...I'll say anything.
          
                Cameron just sinks back in the chair, slowly dying.
          
                EXT.   GRAVEYARD - CLOSE ON "MECHANICAL BRONZE"
          132
                Over the tinkling sound of the music box, the BEAR and MAIDEN
                perform their ritual as the CAMERA PULLS BACK revealing the
                GRAVESTONE decorated with the worn filmy lace undergarments of
                another era. They flutter in the soft wind and amber light of a
                summer afternoon, strangely beautiful against the mossy granite
                marked "UNKNOWN." Somehow these rotting women's underthings have
                the dignity of a sacred tapestry draping an altar.
          
                                            OLD LADY'S VOICE
                                 ...You terrible bear... so
                                 impatient... tearing something so
                                 beautiful...
          
                The ANGLE WIDENS and we see Nina, now made up to look wrinkled and
                gray, tragically old, her eyes moist as she kneels beside the grave.
          
                                       - 83 -
          
          
                                     OLD LADY (NINA)
                             (sudden deep sincerity)
                          Why do I lie? I couldn't wait
                          either. I think both of us are
                          bears.
                             (a soft nostalgic smile)
                          Go, young maiden, you'll be late for
                          your piano lesson.
          
          An elegantly-dressed CARIBINERRI (ITALIAN POLICEMAN) appears.
          
                                     CARIBINERRI
                          Signora...signora...
          
                                     OLD LADY (NINA)
                          I'm almost finished.
          
                                     CARIBINERRI
                          Signora. This desecration... some
                          flowers perhaps...would be
                          permitted.
          
                                     OLD LADY (NINA)
                          But, we want these.
          
                                     CARIBINERRI
                          Please, signora. It's not right.
                          The grave is unmarked.
          
                                     OLD LADY (NINA)
                          Ask the driver how many graves we
                          visited today. I could have chosen
                          five hours ago. I came here and my
                          soul said, "Oh yes." I know that is
                          hard to believe...
          
                                     CARIBINERRI
                             (shrugging)
                          Anything is possible, signora.
                             (tries urging her to her
                              feet)
                          Now, you must permit me to escort
                          you to your car.
          
                                     OLD LADY (NINA)
                          As soon as I am gone, you will take
                          everything away.
          
                                    CARIBINERRI
                          No...
          
                                       - 84 -
          
          
                                     OLD LADY (NINA)
                             (tears streaming down her
                              face)
                          You will, and I can't stop you, and
                          it's wrong. We loved each other...
                          Where else should these go?
          
          The unexpected sound of laughter makes her turn to see a SMALL GROUP
          OF PEOPLE who've gathered beside their PARKED CARS watching.
          
                                     OLD LADY (NINA)
                          Yes, I know I'm ridiculous, but you
                          laugh without knowing anything. You
                          would buy a plastic wreath for a man
                          of such importance.
          
          She pulls free of the Caribinerri and, trying to kneel down,
          stumbles and falls. Now, like some confused child, she searches
          among the garments. Taking a SCROLL from a wooden box, she shakes
          it at them like a schoolteacher would a ruler.
          
                                     OLD LADY (NINA)
                          President Wilson...from the
                          President of the United States...for
                          heroism. To me for sheltering
                          him...
                             (smiling to herself)
                          How silly. I 'sheltered' him to be
                          with him. He was my beloved...Where
                          is it?...Oh, here, did you see this?
          
          She now holds up a fist from which dangles a swastika on a sash.
          
                                     OLD LADY (NINA)
                          Given to me by Adolf Hitler...for
                          our son. Our son...
          
          Her voice suddenly fierce with the pain of that memory.
          
                                     OLD LADY (NINA)
                          ...Our son!!!
                             (then, with simple
                              reverence)
                          ...A thousand years of peace...is
                          what he said. That would be very
                          nice.
          
          The Caribinerri, spellbound, has taken a backward step, bumping into
          a REFLECTOR, which now teeters and falls into the scene, knocking
          off his hat, barely missing the Old Lady and crashing across the
          grave and shattering all illusion. The Caribinerri stands there
          
                                             - 85 -
          
          
                with his eyes closed and his fists clenched, wishing he were in the
                grave. Nina stands in speechless horror.

                                ...and print.
          
                It's deadly silent as Eli walks over to Nina.    They stare at each
                other for a moment.
          
                                           ELI
                                   (eyes brimming over)
                                Thank you, baby.
          
                They fall into each others arms like lovers never do.

                Everybody is applauding, wild with joy over Nina's great
                performance. Tears of happiness run unabashedly down Sam's nose.
                Only Cameron is sullen, seething with anger and jealousy as he views
                them in the light of his recent information.

                Cameron is standing aside, while Nina vainly looks around for him.
                Denise is unpinning her wig. Chuck approaches Cameron.

          admirers, doesn't answer.

                          Milk brothers, sucking from the same
                          tit.
          
                                                 - 87 -
          
          135   ANGLE - EXT.   FARMHOUSE - DAY
          
                As it explodes, Cameron is BLOWN THROUGH THE WALL -- ON FIRE. He
                tumbles to the ground, frantically writhes, rolls, trying to smother
                the flames, finally collapsing in some wagon tracks filled with
                muddy water. Cameron lifts his head at the approach of a THUNDERING
                SOUND...an ENGLISH CAISSON hurtles toward him, the driver dead and
                mangled over the barrel of the gun, the horses insane with terror.
                Before Cameron can move, the charging horses are on top of him. He
                rolls between their hooves, the giant steel wheel of the caisson
                barely missing him. Shells from a cannon barrage are bursting all
                about. Cameron staggers to his feet and scrambles over a low stone
                wall for protection, drops to the other side and then hurtles into
                the air as the wall is shattered by an exploding shell.
          136   CLOSE ON TRAMPOLINE
          
                As Cameron falls into the shot, landing on a hidden TRAMPOLINE near
                the stone wall, bouncing up and down 'til he finally comes to rest.
          
                                           OFFSTAGE VOICE
                                 CUT!!
          137   ANGLE TO INCLUDE ELI AND CREW
          
                                            ELI
                                 Who said that?
          
                Cameron stares over the edge of the trampoline as Henry, the
                assistant cameraman, uneasily faces Eli.
          
                                            HENRY
                                 We had a film run-out.
          
                                            ELI
                                    (to Gabe)
                                 How many feet are left in that
                                 camera?
          
                                            GABE
                                    (checking the Mitchell)
                                 Thirty-six feet.
          
                Eli advances murderously on the assistant cameraman, building to a
                rage we have not seen in him before.
          
                                            ELI
                                 Goddamn you! How many times are you
                                 going to do this to me? How dare
                                 you yell cut on my set?
          
                                              - 88 -
          
          
                                           HENRY
                                   (defensively)
                                Thirty-six feet is nothing...
          
                                           ELI
                                It's twenty-two seconds! In twenty-
                                two seconds, I could break your
                                spine...I could pinch your fucking
                                head off like an insect and smear it
                                on the pavement...I could put
                                twenty-two bullets in that fat gut
                                of yours! The only thing I can't
                                seem to do in twenty-two seconds is
                                keep you from fucking up my film!
          
                Cameron is so intrigued that he hasn't realized an EMBER is burning
                through his asbestos protector, until suddenly he feels the flame
                and frantically begins beating it out and thus, is even denied the
                pleasure of savoring Eli's anguish.
          138   EXTREME CLOSE UP - NINA (INT. SAM'S AND CAMERON'S ROOM - NIGHT)
          
                Rosy-faced and dewy-eyed and wearing a big floppy hat. Sensing
                trouble with Cameron and that she might be at fault, she has decided
                to do a campy, cutesy Blanche Dubois stepping off "THE STREETCAR
                NAMED DESIRE" number, ten years too soon.

                                was with your conduct. When you
                                congratulated me after my scene this
                                afternoon, all the other glowing
                                tributes faded to nothing...
          139   WIDER ANGLE - INT.   CAMERON'S AND SAM'S ROOM
          
                Sam has stopped typing and sits silently, waiting for the storm.
          
                Cameron lies on his bed in a T-shirt and shorts, an elastic bandage
                around his knee and an ice bag at his neck, coldly watching Nina's
                performance as she grandly moves through the doorway into the room.
          
                                       - 89 -

                          ...Nevertheless, I'm cancelling your
                          invitation to an intimate party
                          given by my parents, who arrived
                          unexpectedly to honor me on the
                          occasion of my birthday...but don't
                          feel too badly. As consolation for
                          a lovely evening missed, I'm
                          presenting you with the "good-sport-
                          of-the-month" award.
          
          From behind her back, she takes an APPLE with a tiny cocktail
          parasol stuck in it and holds it out to Cameron. Cameron lies
          glaring at her with mounting rage.
          
                                     NINA (CONT'D)
                          Mr. Baum, will you notify this young
                          savage that it's customary to cover
                          one's privates when accepting an
                          award? It's one of the common
                          courtesies, like...congratulating
                          people.
          
                                     CAMERON
                             (coldly)
                          What should I congratulate you for?
                          The fucking scene or for fucking the
                          director?
          
          Nina stands there shaken, looking at him sadly.
          
                                     NINA
                          For fucking the director, honey.
                             (biting into apple)
                          Didn't you know that's how little
                          girls get into the movies?
          
          She leaves. Cameron lies there seething, then abruptly leaps up and
          storms into the bathroom. Sam sits rubbing his head, resumes
          typing. Cameron rages out of the bathroom, flings himself onto the
          bed. Unwinding the elastic bandage, he sprays ethyl chloride on his
          knee. Sam's typing stops.
          
                                     SAM
                             (quietly)
                          Young man, taking my life in my
                          hands, I must inform you that you
                          are an asshole.
          
          Cameron ignores Sam.

                          He met her three years ago. Two
                          lonely people rattling around New
                          York. A brutal winter. Eli's
                          marriage had just broken up...

                             (interrupting in anger)
                          ...All she had to do was tell me!

                          She could have done that in four
                          seconds. They went to bed once and
                          they were lousy as lovers. But they
                          had a problem. They liked each
                          other. They recognized some area of
                          mutual sensitivity. I'm boring you.
          
                                     CAMERON
                          You telling me he banged her once
                          three years ago?

                             (disgusted)
                          I'm going to see if they can put me
                          up in the employees' toilet.
          
          He begins to type again, then philosophically...
          
                                     SAM'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                          I think he 'banged' her twice to
                          confirm the awful truth...Was she
                          supposed to be a virgin?
          
                                    CAMERON
                          Yeah...
          
          But he says this so sadly and looks so miserable that Sam knows he
          has reached him and it touched.

                                    I had a virgin once. Had to go to
                                    Guatemala for it. She was blind in
                                    one eye and had a stuffed alligator
                                    that said, "Welcome to Miami Beach!"
          
                Cameron sits there feeling dumb and full of regrets. Then he gets
                up, goes to Sam's closet and begins rummaging through the clothes.
                Sam watches him curiously.

                                    pounds and changes his name to

                The pleasant SEAFOOD RESTAURANT is on the pier over the water.
                Cameron, now wearing Sam's sweater after all, is searching about the
                crowded room trying to find Nina and what might be her family. He
                is about to leave when he sees a group at a window table, a MAN and
                WOMAN in their early fifties and a FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD GIRL,
                attractive despite the baby fat. Something about the composite of
                all their features is familiar enough to give them a second look.
                In doing so, he sees a half-eaten BIRTHDAY CAKE on their table, in
                front of an empty place. He goes to the table.

                                party...
          
                The FATHER, a hearty, bluff, good-natured man, looks at Cameron
                amiably and with a father's intuition.

                                A birthday party is a birthday
                                party...sit down.
                                   (Cameron does)
                                Who was this birthday party for...
                                animal, vegetable or mineral?
          
                NANCY, the fourteen-year-old, giggles.
          
                                           NANCY
                                ...Mineral.

                                Will you stop teasing this young
                                man?
          
                                           CAMERON
                                She's really worth finding, ma'am.
                                She's a very rare mineral.
          
                                           FATHER
                                   (pleased with Cameron)
                                How old is this mineral?
          
                                           CAMERON
                                This morning she was acting about
                                ninety, but she might be lying a
                                year or two.
          
                The father now really comfortable, recognizing a fellow humorist.
          
                                           FATHER
                                No, you got the wrong table...this
                                one's acting like she's six...but
                                the missus tells me birthdays are
                                very emotional for the ladies.
          
                At this moment Cameron can tell from their faces that they've seen
                Nina behind him. He turns.

                Nina has emerged from the ladies' room looking miserable and is
                walking toward them. At the shock of seeing Cameron, her hand flies
                to her mouth in such embarrassment and joy and confusion at the way
                she feels, that she starts back to the refuge of the ladies' room.
                Catching herself, she turns back to face him, her eyes now glowing
                with tears of happiness.

                He moves forward and kisses Nina. We now realize we are at her
                HOTEL ROOM DOOR. She on the inside, he on the outside, kissing
                through the doorway, which stands slightly ajar. With their mouths
                barely parting:
          
                                            NINA
                                 I'm sorry it got so late...that damn
                                 five o'clock makeup call...I feel as

                                 Will you take a raincheck?
                                    (slipping her room key in
                                     his pocket)
                                 ...A permanent one?
          
                He puts his hand on the pocket and grins at her.

          143   INT.   HOTEL BAR - LATE NIGHT
          
                On HENRY (the ASSISTANT CAMERAMAN who Eli screamed at), his luggage
                beside him, his elbows, empties, loose change scattered before him
                on the bar top.
          
                                            HENRY
                                    (looking up)
                                 Lucky...hey Lucky, come over here!

          ANGLE shifts to include Cameron a few stools down.    He looks up from
          his beer and crosses to henry.
          
                                     HENRY (CONT'D)
                          Guess who tole 'em to take their job
                          and stuff it?
          
                                     CAMERON
                          Ya quittin'?
          
                                     HENRY
                          Fuckin' A. Gettin' out tonight.
                          But not without splittin' a Schlitz
                          with the one guy, 'cept me, who
                          wouldn't take shit from that
                          screwball.
          
          As the BARTENDER is taking away the empties, Henry puts his finger
          down on a DIME.
          
                                     HENRY (CONT'D)
                          Change is for you, except that.
                          That's a very special dime.
                             (holds it up for Cameron
                              to see)
                          Know what this is? Ask me!
          
                                     CAMERON
                          It's a dime...am I close?
          
                                     HENRY
                          It's Eli Cross' ass. People think
                          'cause you're easygoin' they can
                          walk all over you. Bull-shit...I'm
                          blowin' the whistle with this dime
                          in that phone...killin' a man and
                          hiding it from the police...are you
                          kiddin'...? Who is he think he is?
          
          Cameron pales, knowing that drunken Henry's desire for revenge can
          expose him to the police. He grabs the dime from Henry's fingers
          and drops it into a PEANUT VENDING MACHINE.
          
                                     HENRY
                          What the hell you doin'?
          
          Cameron stuffs the bag of peanuts in Henry's shirt pocket, grabs his
          suitcase and hustles him out of the bar toward the FRONT DOOR.
          
                                    CAMERON
          
                                       - 95 -
          
          
                          I'm putting you in a cab for your
                          own good and sending you to the
                          airport. He's mine, Henry, all
                          mine. Just leave that son-of-a-
                          bitch to me!
          
          They have reached the HOTEL DOORWAY.   By now, Henry is convinced
          Cameron means business. He stops.
          
                                     HENRY
                          Do whatever you wanna do, but I
                          better do it with ya! You'll need
                          help 'cause that goddamn looney is
                          dangerous.

                             (blustering)
                          Not to me, he ain't. I'm going to
                          the cops. You gotta earn your
                          living in pictures, but I don't give
                          a shit. He can't hurt me.
          
                                     HENRY
                          Don't be too sure. Damned psycho
                          nearly strangled me! Don't believe
                          me? Wanna see marks...?
                             (tears open shirt collar
                              to show bruises)
                          ...Lucky to be alive!

                             (confused)
                          Henry, what are you talking about?
                          I watched that whole thing today, he
                          didn't even touch you.

                                              HENRY
                                   Not today. When Burt went into the
                                   water.
                                      (Cameron is wide-eyed)
                                   I could tell from up there in the
                                   chopper something' was wrong. So, I
                                   stopped shootin' and that crazy man
                                   gets me by the throat and starts
                                   screamin' to roll the film...I mean
                                   that guy's down there dying and he's
                                   screamin', "Keep shooting! Keep
                                   shooting!" Then, he starts fighting
                                   me for the switch and it falls
                                   down...like a crazy house up there,
                                   with him thrashin' on the floor...He
                                   didn't care about Burt. All he
                                   cared about was to get that man
                                   dyin' on film! Sickest thing I ever
                                   seen!
          
                As Henry's last words sink in, Cameron stands pale and shaken.
          
                                              HENRY (CONT'D)
                                   I better grab that cab.
          
                Henry takes the suitcase from Cameron's numb hand and pushes through
                the door, looks back for a parting shot.
          
                                              HENRY (CONT'D)
                                   You tell 'em everything...don't
                                   mince words...
          
                As he goes towards cab, some MERRYMAKERS push their way into the
                lobby.
          144   CLOSE ON CAMERON
          
                Staring ahead, Henry's words echo like his own death warrant. The
                merrymakers jostle past him, discussing suntan ointments. Cameron
                turns and walks across the HOTEL LOBBY and UP the STAIRS...his pace
                increasing until he is taking them three at a time.
          
          145   CLOSE ON DOOR LOCK
          
                Cameron's hand thrusts KEY into the hole, flings open the DOOR TO
                NINA'S BEDROOM and barges in.
          
                                              CAMERON

                 He FREEZES. Over his shoulder, we see Nina, naked, lying on the
                 bed. Raymond, also naked, sits slumped on the edge of the bed,
                 utterly disconsolate. The three stare at each other, an absurd
                 tableau. Cameron whirls and leaves, slamming the door behind him,
                 almost off its hinges.
          
          146    INT.   HOTEL LOBBY
          
                 He comes down the steps like a madman. Raging, Cameron stomps
                 across the lobby toward the glass doors that will take him out of
                 Eli's grotesque wonderland. He collides with a group of returning
                 night FISHERMEN still in their slickers, carrying their equipment,
                 their catch wrapped in newspapers. For a moment he is tangled in
                 their tackle, FISH TUMBLING AND SLIDING along the marble floor.
          
                                             FISHERMAN
                                  Jesus...don't step on 'em.
          
                 Cameron stares at them, whirls and rushes back across the lobby and

                 As Cameron bursts in.   She stands in her robe in the center of the
                 room, glaring at him.
          
                                             NINA

                 Hearing WATER running in the bathtub, he dashes in, but finds the
                 bathroom empty. He moves to the closet and slides the door so
                 violently that it almost falls off: No Raymond.

          147A   In the HALLWAY, a little group of PASSING TOURISTS turn in
                 wonderment at the tumult through the open doorway. Nina leaves the
                 phone, crosses to the door and kicks it shut in the people's faces
                 with all her strength.

                 and SISTER. Nina is not present. On the PORTABLE SCREEN is a shot
                 of Nina as a wild, radiant eighteen-year old Austrian girl running
                 pell-mell along a willow-lined VILLAGE STREET, dodging children and
          148A   bicycles. She collides with an OLD MAN, her basket falls, its
                 contents scattering; his momentary anger vanishing as he is infected
                 with her joy of life. He helps her refill the basket and she
                 rewards him with a sausage and a kiss. The old man watches her
                 wistfully as she runs away.

                The room dims and the film starts. We see a slate board reading
                "150A Take 1." The clapper claps and the board is removed,
                revealing an ATTIC. Nina sprawled on her stomach, stark naked, atop
                Raymond's naked body, her breasts resting on his chest, her legs
                apart, interlocked with his. They look directly at the CAMERA
                awaiting their cue with the calm resignation of two people waiting
                for the Wilshire bus. The MAKEUP GIRL appears in the shot spraying
                Nina's back and ass with glycerin sweat from an aerosol can. She
                disappears as Eli's voice on the sound track calls, "ACTION." The

                She's now made up to look like a woman in her forties. Everything
                about her tells us these have been brutal years, filled with pain
                and loss. She is reacting in anguish to something O.S. But, even
                though she manages a few tears, it doesn't quite ring true. Eli
                steps into the shot.

                her, brims over and the statue's blind eyes flow tears.

                As she falls apart before our eyes, and an O.S. VOICE on a PLAYBACK
                TAPE insinuates into our consciousness, echoing as though heard
                through many loudspeakers.

                Hands reach in and drape a sash around Nina's throat. From it
                dangles a SWASTIKA. For Nina, there is still no voice, no camera,
                only the obliterating shame for that image of her naked body burned
                into her father's memory. And yet, that shame is so similar to the
                shame she should be feeling as the woman in Eli's film at this
                mockery of her son's death.

                The THUNDEROUS SOUND of ten thousand voices shouting: "Sieg Heil!
                Sieg Heil!" has shattered Nina's isolation. She is now aware that
                her personal despair has been used to accomplish an acting trick,
                and it only adds to her degradation and sense of shame, ironically
                making her performance even more poignant. The crowd on the
                playback roars with fanatic zeal.

          PIECE OF CHEWING GUM.

                Immediately the lights snap off and the film is projected on the

                On the projection screen we see a helicopter SHOT OF THE DUESENBERG

                beast who's just heard the trap slam shut behind him. His eyes dart
                around at the official-looking faces staring at the O.S. film. One
                face looks disturbingly familiar, but in the dark he can't place it.

                The MAN Cameron couldn't recognize speaks out.
          
                                           OTHER MAN
                                My buddy and I saw that son-of-a-
                                bitch break out of the woods and
                                head that way, down the road.
          
                The lights go on and Cameron looks at the speaker, recognizing him
                as one of the TELEPHONE LINEMEN. Apparently, the lineman doesn't
                recognize Cameron in his new identity.

                Cameron follows Eli as the lights go out and the film begins again.

                the stairs, still blithely chewing his gum.

                 Cameron understands the implied threat and Eli, knowing he has made
                 his point, continues good-humoredly.

                 He holds the booklet out to him and it is very hard for Cameron to
                 reach out and take it. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees the
                 FBI MEN leaving the building, heading off in another direction. He
                 stares at the booklet.

                Eli has been watching him thoughtfully.

                Eli blows a BUBBLE with his gum that POPS on cue as though it were
                the explosion of the bouncing Betty. Grinning, he sticks the
                booklet in Cameron's shirt pocket, turns and walks off.

                Scattered about the room are suitcases, a wardrobe trunk, the almost
                completed packing for tomorrow's departure. Nina lies in bed
                staring into nothing, Cameron beside her. Each is talking aloud to
                himself, adrift in his private world, unaware they have lost contact
                with the other. The room is semi-dark, except for the nightstand
                light on Cameron's side, by which he studies the BOOKLET Eli gave
                him.

                          ...And I saw Eli that night when he
                          had to tell Burt's brother on the
                          phone...I saw the tears.

                          She saw the tears! Did you ask him
                          what he was crying about?! 'Cause
                          you can bet your sweet tits, it
                          wasn't over Burt. He was crying
                          over losing his fucking shot!
          
          To keep from exploding, Nina opens her luggage and furiously starts
          repacking.

                          Didn't they give I.Q. tests in the
                          army? What did you get...minus
                          twelve? Haven't you figured out yet
                          why he's working himself to death?
                          What his film is all about? He's
                          trying to tell people not to kill
                          each other!

                          shock of your life...? I understand
                          what the son-of-a-bitch is saying,
                          and he may be right...which makes me
                          what? Minus twelve, the dumb
                          schmuck with a gun. That doesn't
                          change the fact that he's crazy. If
                          he had his way, there wouldn't be a
                          soldier left alive by morning. But

                          all he's got on hand is me. I don't
                          know if he is doing it consciously,
                          but it's a hell of an idea. If he
                          can really get it on film, a genuine
                          dumb fuck grunt cashing in, before
                          your very eyes, I mean the real
                          McCoy...that's gotta help his
                          picture...Then he's killed two birds
                          with one stone. It's got a nice
                          logic. Trouble is, both birds are
                          me.
          
          Against her instincts, Nina is emotionally affected by what Cameron
          says.

                          secrets around here.
          
          He walks over to the still-stricken Nina and tenderly embraces her.
          She leans against him, the trembling subsiding.

                          get out of here tonight...and that I

          When he doesn't answer, Nina resorts to her last defense, irrational
          anger.

                          believe Eli's a killer, call the

          By now she is stalking about the room throwing things from one
          suitcase to another as Cameron silently watches her.

                Which stands alone like Moby Dick awaiting its victim. Chuck and
                Cameron appear from behind the car, stalking it like it were the
                Sunday Special on a used car lot, Chuck the "hearty" salesman,
                Cameron the reluctant customer.

                                 Why not?   You built a stunt man out
                                 of one.
          
                                            CHUCK
                                 Stunt man? Three days and you've
                                 already grown those big brass balls?
                                 Jump up and down and let me hear 'em
                                 clang, and then do me a favor and
                                 leave 'em home for this gag.
                                    (yanks open the door)
                                 There's just enough room in that
                                 Duesenberg for a normal guy...who
                                 thinks!
                                    (Cameron slides in)
                                 Show me how long you can hold your
                                 breath.
          
                Cameron inhales deeply and Chuck clicks his stopwatch.
          
                                       - 117 -
          
          
                                     CHUCK
                          Now, look around. Whaddya see?...No
                          roll bar in the roof. That's
                          because the roof caving in really
                          looks gassy on film. You got your
                          protection in the back of the
                          seat...steel sheeting. If the roof
                          goes too far, you get your goddamn
                          head down quick! You listening to
                          me?!...Nod Your head.
                             (slapping Cameron on
                              back)
                          You got good lungs.
                             (buckles Cameron's
                              seatbelt)
                          You got no shoulder harness because
                          it would show on camera. So when
                          you hit the water, you brace
                          yourself against the steering wheel.
                          It's reinforced. You couldn't break
                          it loose with dynamite...you gettin'
                          light-headed yet?
          
          Cameron shakes his head, "No."
          
                                     CHUCK
                          Keep your hands off the doors...
                          You're leaving through the window.
                          You lower them slowly as you sink to
                          equalize the pressure. What are you
                          waitin' for? I'm not gonna be down
                          there holding your hand.
                             (Cameron lowering
                              windows)
                          Slower. When you hit bottom, the
                          windows are open and you're gonna
                          make like a minnow. But first, a
                          little fresh air wouldn't hurt. You
                          reach down under the seat and, what
                          do you know, a respirator...Make
                          like you're reaching for it.
                          There'll be one there tomorrow.
          
          Cameron reaches for the non-existent respirator.

                          No, keep your face forward, the
                          camera is behind you and it's still
                          running.
          
                                              - 118 -
          
          
                 By this time, Cameron's breath is giving out and he's struggling to
                 hold it.
          
                                            CHUCK (CONT'D)
                                 You feel like your lungs are gonna
                                 burst? Good. That's the way you're
                                 supposed to act like you feel. The
                                 moment that water gets above your
                                 nose, you gotta look like you're
                                 drowning. Remember? Burt wasn't so
                                 good at that.
          
                 That knocks the wind out of Cameron.

                The POLICE STATION comes into view, seen through the window of the
                company car, which slows as it moves toward the curb. Eli, sitting
                on the front stoop, leans wearily against the stone lion. As he
                sees the car approach, he moves toward it quickly, opening the door
                almost before it stops.

                Cameron and Chuck.

                                Let's say you owe it to him. Until
                                two or three days ago, I had a
                                pretty good actor on my hands. Next

                                fly every time he fluffed a line?

                As the three enter. The station is old with a high sergeant's desk
                and wooden benches against the walls. Raymond, beyond tears,
                destroyed, sits among the other refuse of the night: derelicts,
                stoned kids, etc. On one bench is a SAILOR, with that adenoidal
                look that betrays the weakness he tries to hide with his "butch"
                arrogance. Jake, in the doorway of his office, savors the fact that
                he has finally nailed Eli Cross. Eli captures the setup in a
                glance...then, instant theater. He strides across the police
                station to Raymond, takes his head in his hands and kisses him smack
                on the mouth.

                Gabe has come up behind a PATROLMAN, grabs him by the hips and
                starts humping like a dog in heat. The policeman shrieks in dismay
                and tries to escape, but Gabe trots along as if they were locked.

                Gabe is now distracted by the sight of the sailor, who is agape with
                growing disbelief. Gabe ogles him.
          
                                            GABE

                                 mercury poisoning.
          
                The sailor leaps to his feet in horror, screaming.
          
                                            SAILOR

                                 anything about that in their

                She is snuggled against him tenderly, her open mouth kissing his
                neck and cheek. Raymond, although aware of his desperate situation,
                is too sick with self-loathing to respond.

                                 the ground. Raymond makes bad
                                 jokes, but they're not illegal.
                                 Christ, you've seen us all on the

                Cameron stands, peering in through the big front window, feeling
                once again betrayed. It's like watching TV with the sound shut off.
                From here, Nina and Raymond are very convincing. Chuck leans
                against a lamppost, smoking a cigarette, as the charade goes on.

                toward Nina embracing Raymond.

                                 would like to spend some time with
                                 her boyfriend before she makes

                                 get 'em outta here before they
                                 really do something illegal...and in

                It's three o'clock in the morning. The corridors are empty as the
                elevator door swings open and Nina and Eli step out and move down
                the hallway, functioning on their last ounce of nervous energy.

                Partly crated props and costumes, luggage belonging to the departing
                film crew is piled against the wall and on shelves. In the
                cavernous half-lit room, Cameron, once again the coiled, stealthy
                animal, moves through the shadows among the racks of suitcases,
                pulling them aside, searching. Discovering one, he sets it on the
                floor. It's locked. With a metal bar, he breaks the lock and
                eagerly rifles the contents. Then, sensing a presence, he turns.
                There stands Nina at the base of the steps watching him. With only
                a glance to her, he goes on with his search.

                 contents on the floor. Now with the open bag on his arm, he goes
                 along the row of costumes and props like a man in the supermarket,
                 stuffing in things he will need: a pair of hiking boots, a couple
                 of work shirts, a heavy jacket. Passing a shelf of bayonets, he
                 picks one out and throws it in the bag.

                          SCOOP THAT UP YOUR ROYAL BAVARIAN
                          STRAWBERRY SNATCH!
          
          With the effort, Cameron's feet fly out from under him as if he had
          stepped in oil. In fact, he has stepped in paint, and lands flat on
          his ass in the green goo. Nina "bracks" out an uncontrollable
          guffaw.

                          It's not funny!
          
          Shamed, Nina runs to him.
          
                                     NINA
                          Oh, baby...
          
          But, as she reaches him, her feet too are caught in the paint and
          she slides forward like an ice skater, spraddling him, landing on
          her ass. His rage vanishes as he points at her, breaking into a
          fiendish, uncontrollable cackle. These pratfalls are a catharsis
          that has released the pressure and the madness. They attempt to
          gain their feet, skidding and sliding in the paint. He succeeds,
          but Nina fails.

                             (through laughter)
                          Let me go to the bathroom.   I'm
                          gonna have an accident.

                          You'll miss the main part! Killer
                          Cameron's ghastly crime! I was
                          freaked out of my head! And,
                          suddenly there's this big flashlight
                          shining in my face. I just grabbed
                          that goddamn ice cream bucket and
                          slopped it...right over the guy's
                          head!
          
          Although Cameron's got nothing in his hands, he pantomimes swinging
          that fifty-pound ice cream bucket around in the air, losing his
          balance and landing on his back in the paint beside Nina. Her
          hysteria is renewed, but Cameron stops laughing.

                          was a cop. I got out of there like
                          a shot. I didn't know he was
                          knocked out. How the hell did I
                          know he was gonna lay there all
                          night with his head in the ice
                          cream?

                          froze, see...and...
          
          Despite the horror of it, Nina starts giggling.   She can't help it.

          179H   Then, Cameron, realizing the absurdity, starts giggling too. Out of
                 control, Nina scrambles to her feet and dashes for the ladies room.
                 Cameron follows her to the door, still talking as it closes behind
                 her.
          
                                             CAMERON (CONT'D)
                                  I'll tell ya, it's a bad year to
                                  mess with cops. You get the FBI

                 Abruptly, Cameron's energy is gone. The hilarity is over.   He leans
                 his forehead against the door in exhaustion and despair.

          180    INT.   GARAGE - PRE-DAWN
          
                 The DUESENBERG STANDS silhouetted in the darkness, light glinting
                 dimly off it like the gleam from fine wood of a splendid coffin
                 waiting in the slumber room before services begin. Behind it, a
                 side door of the garage opens. But it is not visitors coming to pay
                 their last respects, it is Cameron and Nina. He is wearing Burt's
                 clothes.
          
                 Nina moves quickly to a WHITE CONVERTIBLE as Cameron crosses to the
                 big overhead garage doors and hits the electric SWITCH. NOTHING
                 HAPPENS. He flips another switch and harsh overhead lights
                 illuminate the reality of the garage. Nina has started the
                 convertible, as Cameron tries to lift the garage door handles.

                 Nina gasps. Cameron whirls towards the voice. A COP with a big
                 flashlight stands in the open doorway peering in at them.

          I'm sure Mr. Cross will understand
          when you tell him that Miss Franklin
          had a sudden desire for Swedish
          pancakes for breakfast and this
          gentleman had a sudden desire to

          181   EXT.   THE OLD ABANDONED ROAD - EARLY MORNING
          
                In the stillness, as the morning sun crests the trees, their shadows
                move like a parting curtain, leaving sunlight to warm the old stones
                of the abandoned road. The ancient bridge spans the black river,
                idling toward the sea. It is a perfect day, tranquil except for the
                faint distant "rumbling" intruding into our consciousness. As it
                grows louder and LOUDER, a flock of birds is frightened from the
                trees, a rusty beer can by the roadside begins to tremble and roll
                from the vibration.
          
                Rounding the bend of the road into view are a half-dozen kids on
                bicycles, peddling furiously, laughing and yelling and looking back
                at what now appears behind them: the first vehicle of an incredible
                carnival parade -- or is it a funeral procession? Long, short,
                tall, fat vehicles; the stretch-out car, the cab towing portable
                toilets, the tractor pulling a generator rig, the Cortez Camper
                dressing rooms, the stake-bed loaded with reflectors rattling like
                radar screens, panel trucks with studio emblems, a vintage German
                army truck filled with soldiers, patrol cars and motorcycles, the
                huge, bright yellow construction crane on its Caterpillar treads,
                its pneumatic snout jutting forward thirty yards like a morning
                hard-on sniffing around for some tunnel to hump -- a few technicians
                straddle it having their morning Danish and coffee. In the midst of
                these, on a low-slung flatbed trailer rides the Duesenberg -- the
                coffin on its caisson.
          
                The caravan grinds, hisses, wheezes to a halt and the A.D., astride
                the hood of the first vehicle, dismounts and raises his electric
                bullhorn to begin what will be an incessant squawking of
                instructions, reprimands, coaxings and complaints.

                                is over. Another fifteen minutes
                                and we start losing sun. Come on,
                                let's get the equipment off those
                                trucks.
          
                The Second A.D.'s run around like sheepdogs herding the laborers,
                snapping at their flanks, barking their instructions over electric

                into the hills.

                Being rolled up to a mark in the center of the road. Crewmen swarm;
                in and under it, tuning, polishing, testing, installing camera,
                sound, electrical equipment, as Chuck hovers over them.

                As motors rev, the two sheepdogs squawk: "Out of sight..." "Behind

          184   ANOTHER ANGLE
          
                Cables are being strung out of sight along the side of the road,
                snapped into junction boxes that spread their electrified tentacles,
                strangling the landscape.

                Gabe, Chuck, the A.D. and a Technician move down the road toward us,
                shoulder to shoulder, halting on the bridge. Chuck and Gabe move to
                the stone railing. Chuck taps on it, producing a hollow sound.

                Cameron walks around it, testing and checking, but moving
                relentlessly toward the humpback trunk. A horn honks and a police
                car slides up. Jake leans out the window, waves at Cameron

                several soldiers. Chuck approaches Cameron.
          
                                           CHUCK
                                You're lookin' real strong, kid. Is
                                that loose change I hear jinglin' or
                                are they beginnin' to grow?

                                Wanna check?

                They walk towards the German truck.

                                I'm sending it on ahead. During the

                                bridge.
          
                Cameron tenses at this information.

                                 off into space when you see 'em.
                                 They'll be shooting at you and
                                 that's what's supposed to make you
                                 go into the river.
          
          190A   They've reached the truck where Jake stands proudly. The Property
                 Man is handing out rifles and boxes of bullets to the German
                 soldiers, whom we now recognize as police officers from the town.
                 One cop, tying his shoe, lifts his head and grins at Cameron like an
                 old buddy -- the officer from the garage last night.
          
                                            COP

                                 These guns are kinda modern for
                                 World War I.

                                 the old ones.

                 If Cameron was upset by the change in the stunt, he is now really
                 unnerved by the sight of those cops with guns. The second cop is
                 loading cartridges.

                As Cameron arrives and casually leans against the trunk and then
                gently taps. He must get Nina out of there. With determination, he
                reaches for the trunk handle. Arms wearing the same costume as his
                own reach in, holding the trunk closed. It is Raymond.
          
                                               RAYMOND

                How can he know?     -- Everything is out of control -- a voice calls.

                                    Look straight ahead, can you see
                                    that red light out of the corner of
                                    your eye?
          
                A tiny red light is mounted in the corner over the windshield.

          The technician tightens a final screw on the red light then, leaning
          back out of the car, yells O.S.

                          Does it work?
          
          Cameron, barely hearing, looks straight ahead without response.
          Jake lounges at the driver's window, kibitzing the operation.

                          What?
          
          The words "CAMERA ON" sound exactly like "CAMERON." It sounded as
          though his real name was called and he automatically answered. Has
          his identity been exposed? His eyes widen. The technician, getting
          no response, calls to Jake.
          
                                     TECHNICIAN

          He whirls to see Jake staring at him. His hand darts to the
          ignition key, the engine roars to life.

          Cameron realizes his error, but it's too late, he's in a panic. In
          his mind, he's given himself away. The road ahead is clear -- GO!
          He jams the car in gear and slams the accelerator to the floor. The
          Duesenberg leaps forward, screeching wildly. In its wake -- chaos.
          Everyone running, yelling...

                Speed. The needle hits sixty-five -- seventy -- climbing fast.
                Cameron grips the wheel, looking at that empty road. An involuntary
                shout swells up and escapes his mouth.

                The needle hits eighty -- eighty-five. Ahead, the bridge is rushing
                toward us. Now the arches of the stone railing are strobing past.
                Through them, he sees the black river which he has escaped.
                Triumphantly, his hand rises, middle finger extended. Suddenly the
                red camera light goes on, the underwater camera behind him begins
                whirring. He moves his finger behind him for a perfect close-up,
                (recalling that moment in the tower):

                The center of the bridge is an instant away, an approaching blur.

                Blam! The whole front wheel of the car is blown off by an explosive
                charge.
          196   ANOTHER ANGLE
          
                The Duesenberg drops on one axle. Metal screams against stone, as
                though it were Cameron himself, screaming. Skidding, spinning,
                tearing through the papier-mache railing, plunging out of control
                into space, where it hovers for a brief instant and arcs downward
                like a dying bird.

                The river rushes up and the car smashes into it with a deafening,
                shattering roar, plunging beneath the surface to a dark and
                soundless world -- except for a tiny red light, the whir of a camera
                and Cameron's desperate cries. Tearing his seatbelt off he flings
                himself toward the rear of the car, clawing at the back seat to
                reach Nina. Incredibly, there is sunlight again as the car is
                buoyed to the surface. There, again, is the living world - the
                road, the trees. In that brief instant, through the rear window,
                Cameron has a wild, tilted glimpse of a pink pinafore -- Nina,
                standing by the rail looking down, Eli beside her. The car noses
                downward, water rising swiftly over the rear window. The last image
                on Cameron's retina is that wild, eager, little-girl excitement on
                Nina's face. Then he's alone again, entombed in the darkening water
                as the car plunges toward the bottom.
          
                Cameron sits, immobilized at the realization that his betrayal is
                total. Everyone, even Nina, has conspired to bring him to this --
                red light glowing, camera whirring, to capture the moment of his
                death.

                Outrage galvanizes him to action. He reaches for the door handles,
                to rip them open -- they snap off in his hands. Now there is a
                rumbling and rending of metal as the roof begins to implode,
                crushing down toward him. Under the immense pressure, the rear
                window bursts inward, the river rushing in a wild torrent. The
                memory of Chuck's voice..."the windows." He lowers the front window
                slowly. The water now pours in faster. The level has risen to his
                chin. He gasps a final breath and the water rises over his head.
                Still the red light burns. He reaches beneath the seat for the
                oxygen cylinder and tries to pull it loose. It won't move. The
                impact of the car hitting the water has bent the seat frame. His
                groping hand finds the hose, the oxygen mask. A hope. Though every
                second is robbing his chance for life, his movements under water are
                as in slow motion. Pulling the mask to his face, he takes an eager
                breath and chokes as water fills his mouth. The rubber tube has
                broken loose from the cylinder and is floating free -- as it must
                have with Burt. Pressure of the onrushing water has stopped as the
                water reaches the roof. For a moment there is a strange stillness
                which Cameron, his lungs bursting, swims through, out the window and
                toward the surface.

                Moving upward through river slime, in a world that grows lighter, in
                a desperate race to reach air.
          
                Daylight! Gasping, half unconscious, barely able to move his arms
                to stay afloat. Adrift in the current, he touches land, clawing at
                the rocks and pulling himself onto the shore. His muscles, still
                moving by motor reflex, driven by survival instinct, take him
                crawling from the river bank through the tall grass -- still the
                fugitive, the "man on the run." Then, he lifts his head and stops
                at what he sees before him:

                Fanned out across the field is a row of men, guns held ready.
                Policemen from the truck in their German uniforms moving forward
                slowly -- carefully searching the terrain in an arch which, as it
                closes, must irrevocably reach Cameron.
          201   ANOTHER ANGLE
          
                It's over. Without strength or will, he lies waiting for them as
                though his eyes were made of glass. They see him now, but their
                pace doesn't change. As they take the last few steps toward him, he
                sees their shoulders, waists, knees and then only a circle of feet
                around him.
          
                Their hands roughly grab him, pulling him to his feet, shoving him
                brutally about. Angry cop faced growling: "Kill the son-of-a-

                bitch," "Shoot 'im," "Cut it," "Hang 'im," and then loudly, "Cut
                it!" He feels a blow on the back, then another. They seem too
                gentle. Why is that cop smiling? Some of them are walking away.
                Where are the handcuffs? Why is he shaking my hand instead? Then
                the jumble of voices is becoming clearer..."No matter what they pay
                you, make 'em give you a raise!"..."Fantastic, my wife thinks being
                a cop is dangerous -- you guys are terrific!" It finally sinks in,
                the insane, absurd, devastating, humiliating realization that it was
                all just another scene in a movie that came off as planned.
          
                He is alive and free. Is that gurgle we hear in Cameron's throat
                the water that he swallowed or an unseemly giggle? Then it chokes
                into laughter.

                Here comes Chuck, running across the field with his silly stunt bag
                filled with elastic bandages. How funny. Here's the helicopter
                hovering with Gabe descending the rope ladder bearing film for Eli,
                who runs to meet him. How hilarious. There's the pink
                pinafore...Nina holding the skirt up to her waist as she wades
                through the tall grass towards him. How sweetly absurd.

                Chuck has reached Cameron, throwing a blanket over him.   He pulls a
                pint from his back pocket.

                As Cameron tilts his head back, the bottle to his mouth, he sees
                skin divers setting down their rescue equipment and stripping out of
                their dripping wet-suits.

                restore his circulation, replies with the highest compliment he can
                pay?

                Suddenly she turns, running headlong, pell-mell across the swamp and
                through the mud holes, drenching her pink pinafore into a muddy rag,
                losing a shoe, ripping her hose -- and then wildly into the arms of
                Cameron, smearing him with love and mud! And then, just as quickly,
                she is gone, racing back across the field, hopping like a rabbit
                without her shoe, toward the road.

                He walks off, leaving Cameron draped in the blanket like an Indian.
                Eli steps up to him looking very serious, lifts his hand in the
                Indian sign of greeting and says:

                          I hope you find an easier cure.
                          That was the hardest thousand bucks
                          I ever made.
          
          A horn honks. It is Jake who, in his enthusiasm, has driven the
          police car bumping over the marshes to Eli and Cameron.
          
                                     JAKE
                          You guys want a ride back?
          
                                     ELI
                             (moving toward the
                              helicopter)
                          No, we're goin' in the chopper.
          
                                     CAMERON
                             (considers it)
                          Thanks, Eli, but that looks too
                          dangerous. I think I'll ride with
                          Jake. Good luck with the picture.
          
          He moves toward police car.
          
                                     ELI
                             (yelling to Cameron)
                          Don't miss that plane, Burt!
          
                                     JAKE
                             (leaning across Cameron
                              to yell at Eli)
                          He better not! Any member of your
                          company found within city limits
                          after five o'clock tonight, gets
                          shot on sight!
          
          Eli stops, suddenly registering what Cameron had said.
          
                                     ELI
                          ...What thousand bucks?   That stunt
                          paid six-fifty.
          
                                     CAMERON
                             (surprised)
                          Chuck told me a thousand...
          
                                    ELI
          
                                        - 156 -
          
          
                             (firmly)
                          Six-fifty!
          
                                     CAMERON
                             (getting upset)
                          A thousand!
          
                                     ELI
                             (relenting)
                          Okay, seven-fifty.      Split the
                          difference...
          
                                      CAMERON
                          Bullshit!   You're trying to screw
                          me!!
          
                                     ELI
                             (exasperated)
                          Christ! You're doing it again!
                             (striding toward the
                              chopper, shouting)
                          Sam! This paranoid little bastard
                          still doesn't understand your damn
                          screenplay!
          
          Eli is climbing into the helicopter.
          
                                     CAMERON
                             (shrieking)
                          That's your big problem, Eli! You
                          use people! I want my money, a
                          thousand bucks!
          
                                     ELI
                             (to Cameron)
                          Six-fifty!!
                             (to Sam)
                          Rewrite the battle scene and let the
                          tank run him over! The stunt pays
                          six-fifty!
          
          The helicopter takes off, zooms under the bridge, up into a
          hammerhead and soars back, while Cameron continues to scream at it.
          
                                     CAMERON
                          Come back here. I'm tired of being
                          your goddamn clown! Pay me my
                          thousand bucks!
          
          Eli's voice on the helicopter's P.A. speaker echoes through the
          canyon, as the chopper cavorts overhead and skims away.
          
                       - 157 -

EXT. SPACE	

THE CAMERA PULLS BACK. . . 

INT. ARGO CITY

AND REVEALS THE inside of a domed city honeycombed with fantastic arches. The city is inhabited by young beautiful people in luxurious but simple costumes.

THE CAMERA ROAMS through the City, observing some people seated at a kind of cafe sipping drinks and relaxing; other people are in some kind of exercise class doing beautiful graceful movement; and finally a class of five year old children listen intently to a teacher who is demonstrating a molecular model.

					TEACHER
				And now, who can give me the electron 
				wave functions for Kryptonian covalent 
				bonding?

The five year olds eagerly raise their hands. The teacher points to one.

CHILD
				The cube root of the wavelength over the 
natural log of the integral of the speed of 
light squared.

The teacher smiles.

TEACHER
				Well, maybe that was a bit too easy...

THE CAMERA ROAMS ON through the city, following the sound of a strange, ethereally beautiful singing. The CAMERA discovers the source of the sound: an ARTIST sculpting a beautiful crystalline object with a MATTERWAND. The wand makes the singing noise as it creates matter out of energy. The Artist, whose name is ZALTAR, sometimes whistles along in counterpoint. .

A small girl is watching him with fascination. Her name is Kara, and she is seven.

Behind her, the dome, which encloses the City, marks the edge of the limbo outside.

KARA
What are you making:

	ZALTAR
It's going to be a tree, I think.




KARA 
What's a tree?

	ZALTAR
It's something they have on Earth. You know,
 where your cousin went.

	KARA 
Where is Earth?

	ZALTAR
Didn't you study six-dimensional geometry in 
school?

	KARA
Yes, I know the equations---I just can't see it in 
my head.

Zaltar laughs.

					ZALTAR
				Even I have trouble with that sometimes. Earth is in 
outer space. And we're in inner space. 

	KARA
I don't understand.

	ZALTAR
Wait till you're older. Here -- watch this. 

Zaltar takes a small OMEGAHEDRON out of his pocket and holds it in his hand.

					ZALTAR.
				This is one of the four Power Sources of the City. 
I borrowed it from the Guardians. Look what I 
can do with it. 

Zaltar touches his MATTER.WAND to the OMEGAHEDRON and the wand instantly becomes charged with flickering light. He touches his wand to the tree sculpture---and the 
sculpture comes alive with dancing lights and shadows. Kara claps her hands with delight 
at the spectacle. Zaltar steps back and admires his handiwork. He carefully puts down the
OMEGAHEDRON at his feet, takes a small flask from his belt, and drinks.

				ZALTAR
			You see, a tree is a living thing.

				KARA
			Can you create life?

	
ZALTAR
				No, no, just the illusion of life. A kind of 
half-life, maybe. A pale shadow of the real 
thing. But it is lovely, the way the light plays 
over the surface. . . 

A woman's voice can be heard calling in the distance.

WOMAN'S VOICE 
Kara. Kara.

Kara calls out in reply.

					KARA 
I'm here, mother.

Kara's mother ALURA appears through the lacey architecture of the city.

ALURA
				Kara, you shouldn't be so near the Edge 
without a grown-up.

	KARA
I'm sorry, Mother.

	ZALTAR
I was keeping an eye on her.


Alura puts her arm around her daughter affectionately, showing she's not really angry. Together they watch Zaltar's latest sculpture, flickering with the play of inner light and shadow.

ALURA
				Thank you, Zaltar, but she has to obey the rules.

Zaltar takes another swig from his flask. and lowers his voice confidentially.

ZALTAR
				You and your husband have been kind to me, 
Alura. I have something to tell you: I'm going 
away. Soon.

	ALURA 
But where?


Zaltar bends down to Kara and hands her his matterwand.

ZALTAR
				Put your fingers there, Kara. And press hard.

She does, and the wand makes a horrible squawk. Kara laughs with delight.

ZALTAR
				Good. Now, go make something pretty.

Kara scampers away, hardly able to believe her good fortune, and starts to make all kinds of 
surprising sounds with the wand on the plaza nearby. Zaltar speaks to Alura in a low, confidential voice.

ZALTAR
I've discovered a new way into the Phantom 
Zone.

	ALURA
But the phantom Zone is for criminals.

	ZALTAR
It's big. And empty. I'm tired of limiting myself 
to  Argo City. I want to do something new. I'm 
starting to repeat myself here with this airy, 
glittery stuff....

Zaltar waves a hand deprecatingly at the city around him.

ALURA
				But Zaltar---you founded the city! It's yours. We 
were all just refugees from Krypton when you gathered 
us together and brought us here, to the inner dimension. 
You can't abandon us now. You have a responsibility to us!

In the background, Kara has been modeling a spiky insect-like CREATURE. Now she suddenly finds the OMEGAHEDRON on the ground beside her. She doesn't stop to wonder how it got there from beside Zaltar's feet. She simply picks up the OMEGAHEDRON and touches it to the spiky creature. The creature suddenly flicks its wings and COMES TO LIFE, unnoticed by the adults. Kara drops the wand and laughs out loud with delight as the magical creature takes off from the ground and starts flying in circles around her head, glittering as if it were made of diamonds.

ZALTAR
I'm an artist, Alura. My work comes first. Other 
people come second.

	ALURA
How can you create beauty...with a selfish heart?
The spiky insect-creature flies closer and closer around the little girl's head, buzzing angrily. Her look of delight turns to fear. She tries to shoo the creature away. It flies off toward the thin membrane that encloses the city.

The spiky creature flies into the membrane and tears a ragged hole in it. With a giant WHOOSH all the air in the city starts to rush out the hole. Kara is swept along toward the hole by the wind. She cries out and stretches pleading hands toward her mother. THE OMEGAHEDRON is swept toward the hole as well. Kara grabs onto the ragged edge of the membrane.

ZALTAR 
Kara---the Power Source!

Kara reaches for it, but it is too far from her, and the OMEGAHEDRON is sucked out into infinity by the wind. Zaltar picks up the matterwand from where Kara dropped it and touches her with the wand. She is instantly held fast. Zaltar pulls her back inside. He gives her to her mother Alura. Then Zaltar touches his wand to the membrane and seals the hole with masterful chords like a brass choir. 

The wind dies down and all is silent, except for the quiet sobbing of Kara in her mother's arms. Zaltar kneels down beside her and strokes her golden hair  tenderly.

KARA
				I'm sorry... I didn't know.

					ZALTAR
				It was my fault. You aren't old enough to use 
the wand. I shouldn't have given it to you.

	ALURA
But the Power Source, Zaltar.

	ZALTAR
It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do 
with three.

	ALURA
But what will happen?

	ZALTAR 
The Guardians will be angry. They may even 
send me to the Phantom Zone. You see, I didn't 
really have permission to borrow it. I must go 
explain to them...

Zaltar hurries off nervously. THE CAMERA HOLDS ON KARA'S FACE as she senses this may be her last sight of Zaltar.

DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. A SPRINGTIME MEADOW - U.S.A. - DAY. UNDER TITLES

A beautiful blonde in jeans and a frilly blouse is walking across a field of wildflowers. Butterflies flitter and dart from flower to flower. The blonde's name is SELENA. She is our ideal image of the girl next door, who grew up into a dynamite lady.

Her current boyfriend follows along behind her, lugging a big wicker hamper from their pickup truck parked at the edge of the road. Selena finds a grassy spot under an old oak. and spreads out a red and white checked gingham cloth..

SELENA 
Over here George. It's the perfect spot. Nice view.

George sets down the wicker basket and Selena starts to unpack a scrumptious picnic of home cooked food. She unpacks fried chicken, hard-boiled eggs, potato salad, cold beer and a big rich creamy-frosted devils food cake.

					GEORGE
				You sure are a good cook, Selena. Man, that looks 
too pretty to eat.

	SELENA
Better eat it quick. It won't look too pretty when it's 
all covered with ants.

She hands him a chicken drumstick and a hard-boiled egg.

					GEORGE
				Selena, I've been thinking. It's time I settled 
down---and I don't know a nicer lady to settle
down with than you.

SELENA
				Why George, are you proposing?

					GEORGE
Marry me, Selena. The hardware store doesn't bring 
in much now, but...

SELENA
				George---I thought you'd never ask.

A shrill whistling sound from above makes them look up. With a loud plop and a spatter of icing the OMEGAHEDRON falls into the middle of the chocolate cake.

GEORGE
				What the heck is that?

They look up in the boughs of the tree overhead, and then down at the chocolate cake splashed all over the checked cloth.

SELENA
A squirrel Frisbee?

Selena reaches out and picks up the OMEGAHEDRON. It comes away from the cake without a trace of the chocolate icing sticking to its surface, as if made of some substance, which repels other kinds of matter.

Selena holds the shining Omegahedron in her hand and examines it, turning it around and around as if hypnotized. Her face takes on a new expression. Almost as if the simple, wholesome innocence of her nature had been blasted away by some profound new knowledge of the universe.

SELENA
				That's funny. I'd swear I know just what this is, 
but I've never seen it before.

She stands up and walks across the checkered cloth, in a beeline for the pickup truck.

GEORGE
				Hey, where you going?

					SELENA
				     (calling over her shoulder) 
I've got things to do.

	GEORGE 
What about my proposal?

	SELENA 
         (dismissively) 
Call me next week. Maybe we can have lunch.

She gets in the pickup and. drives away.

GEORGE 
Hey! My truck!

DISSOLVE TO:








 KARA' S FACE

She is ten years older now, a young lady. Almost ready to assume the long flowing gown of an adult, but still in the tunic worn by those under eighteen.

ALURA
				      (voice over)
				But Kara, you are too young to go.

ANOTHER ANGLE. ARGO CITY. DIMMED

They are in the assembly amphitheater of the city, where the kindergarten nuclear physics class was seen. Kara is in the centre of the ring, with adults seated in scattered rows around her. Her parents Zor-El and Alura are standing in front of her.

KARA
				I am almost an adult. This is what I want.

ZOR-EL
				But Kara, no one has ever gone from here to 
Earth. The journey is dangerous.

	KARA
It was my fault we lost the Power Source.

	ZOR-EL
Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.

	KARA
I allowed it to escape the City.

	ALURA
Ever since we told you how your cousin Superman 
was sent there as an infant, all you have wanted to do 
was visit this place.

	KARA
Yes, I do want to go. But someone must go. Our 
scanning shows the Power Source has finally 
reached the Earth. It could destroy everything unless 
someone brings it back.

	ZOR-EL 
Superman will return it.

	KARA
Why haven't you been able to contact him? He should 
have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago. He 
may be dead.
ZOR-EL
But what can you, a mere girl-

	KARA
I'll have super powers there. Like him. We can't wait. 
Our lights are fading. Look around you. When I was a 
child the City was bright and shining. Look at it now.

Zor-El and Alura sigh. There is no denying that the brilliance of Argo City has been much dimmed since Kara was a little girl.

					ALURA
				What do your teachers think?

Zor-El looks around the circle. A beautiful woman speaks.

					TEACHER
				It would be sad to lose one of our finest young ones 
to the dimension barrier-- but the City cannot last much 
longer without the Power Source. It is her future she's 
fighting for, Zor-El.

	ZOR-EL
Very well, let it be done.

Alura embraces Kara emotionally, fighting back the tears. Kara too is struggling to control her own emotions.

KARA
				Don't worry, Mother, I'll be all right. I've studied 
the transmissions from Earth. I know their customs.

Kara walks out of the amphitheater with her parents.

ALURA
				But they are such strange, unstable people.

					KARA
				Then I will learn to act strange like them.

Kara holds up a small handbag. Inside we glimpse red and blue material.

					KARA
				I have made clothing and copies of their money, I 
will be fine.




Her father puts his hand on her shoulder .

					ZOR-EL
				Be brave, my .daughter. Be wise.

					KARA
				As brave as my father. As wise.

They embrace, briefly. Kara then steps onto a circular platform set into the pavement of the city.

 Instantly transparent bubble forms around her.

Her parents watch as she floats away.

She passes into an air lock through the membrane that surrounds the City, and off into an infinity of space.

MONTAGE: THE JOURNEY OF KARA INSIDE "HER SPHERE FROM THE INNER DIMENSION TO OUR WORLD.

Her sphere moves from blackness, to a dark green limbo. The atmosphere thickens around her. Soon it is unmistakably water, and she is heading toward the light above. A fish darts past with a flash of silver. The sphere rushes upward faster and faster. It breaks the surface of the , water. Kara springs free of the bubble, which disappears. She is now wearing a blue and red costume like her cousin Superman.

She lands on a nearby beach.
 
EXT. EARTH.  BEACH BESIDE THE SEA. SUNRISE

She looks around her, feasting with her eyes on the details of this new exciting world.

Kara bends down and picks up a stone from the ground at her feet. To her astonishment, she 
crushes it to powder in her hand, and blows the fine dust away with a blast of superbreath.

She looks down at her feet, so firmly planted on the ground. She rises a few inches into the air, and reacts with amazement. Then she looks up into the blue sky overhead and her expression of astonishment is replaced by a look of joyous longing. With a sudden impulse she shoots straight upward.

EXT. HIGH ABOVE THE EARTH.  DAY

Kara loops and rolls, swoops and circles, laughing with sheer delight.





EXT. HIGH ABOVE MOUNTAIN MEADOWS.  HORSES.  DAY

Kara swoops down at a herd of horses. The herd parts and gallops off in all directions as she pulls out of her dive and flies away.

CUT TO:
 EXT. MOUNTAINTOP.  DAY

Kara lands on a mountaintop and admires the view. The she bends down and scoops up a handful of snow. She stares at it with awe.

INSERT. MICROSCOPIC SHOT OF SNOW CRYSTALS IN ALL THEIR INFINITE VARIETY AND BEAUTY.

BACK TO SCENE.  DAY

Kara stands up, smiling. She flies into the air again.

EXT. FOREST.  DAY

She lands and walks among the huge trunks of a primeval forest. Shafts of sunlight pierce the gloom. These trees are much more impressive than Zaltar's imitation back in Argo City. She hears a mournful sound and pulls back a spray of brambles. She sees a BABY DEER hopelessly tangled in the long canes. She shoots RAYS OF HEAT VISION from her eyes and slices through the tough stems. The fawn scrambles free, and scampers off into the forest. Kara watches it with a benevolent smile. She removes a brunette wig and some street clothing from a secret pocket in her cape.

EXT. MANSION --- GARDEN PARTY

A big impressive house somewhere in the Middle West. People mill about on the neatly manicured lawn sipping drinks and snagging hors d'oeuvres off silver trays from. passing waiters. All the quests have a name tag on, like at some kind of conference.

SELENA, the blonde who discovered the Power Source, is circulating among the quests. She has changed since we saw her last. No longer the girl next door, she now wears a fabulous designer dress dripping with jewels. She walks with the regal air of someone used to being obeyed, and graciously accepts the homage of the quests. A smile, a nod, a kind word from her leaves them all basking in the warm afterglow of her attention. But we notice odd details of the party: the decorations are all based on mystic occult symbols. At the refreshment table, there is a big ten-foot WICKER SCULPTURE OF A FEMALE GOAT covered with paper flowers. And the quests all have an indefinable air of strangeness about them. BIANCA, a tall cold-eyed brunette in black silk dress, whispers in Selena's ear .

BIANCA
				Be careful. Nigel is going to try something.



					SELENA
				Don't worry about old Nigel, I can take care of him. 
He's just a sore loser.

An ELDERLY MAN in a three-piece pin-stripe suit grabs her elbow.

ELDERLY MAN
				I don't want much, Selena. I have simple tastes.

SELENA 
What do you want?

	ELDERLY MAN 
Western Europe.

	SELENA
I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could 
have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski.

	ELDERLY MAN
No problem. She can have it. I hate mountains.

Selena leaves him negotiating boundary lines with Bianca and strolls over to a sour-faced man in suede who has been scowling at her over his cigarette.

SELENA 
Cheer up, Nigel. It's not the end of the world.

NIGEL
				It may well be. I know how you won that election 
Selena. You can't fool me.

	SELENA
I have plans Nigel. You could come with me...
I'm going places.

					NIGEL
				You're not going anywhere. Except back to nowheresville.
You're too impatient, Selena. Look around you--all 
these people have served years and years of apprenticeship.
Some of their families have been in the Craft for generations. 
You can't join and take over our whole organization in a few months.

Selena smirks at him, self-confidently.

SELENA
				I just did. Because I have the Power.

					NIGEL
				You're going to pay a terrible price. The power of Shadow 
is tricky. Use it too much and it takes over. 

Nigel drops his cigarette, stubs it out on the lawn, and takes out his platinum cigarette case.

SELENA
Bianca's taught me all! need to know. I'll be safe, as 
long as I don't go too far. 

	NIGEL
Cigarette?

He holds the shiny mirror-like cigarette case in front of her so she can see her reflection.

INSERT. SURFACE OF THE CIGARETTE CASE. Selena's reflection. She is still the glamorous beauty, but looming behind her...invisible to ordinary eyes...is a DARK EERIE SHAPE OF SOMETHING HIDEOUS.

BACK TO SCENE.

Quick as a cat, Selena bats the cigarette case out of his hand and sends it spinning into the shrubbery. All traces of the Shadow behind her have disappeared.

					NIGEL
				Sorry. Forgot you were trying to quit.


Nigel snags a glass of champagne off the tray of a nearby waiter and sips it insolently.

SELENA
				Nigel, get out of here. And don't come slithering 
back.
Nigel shakes his head.

NIGEL
				You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save 
you from a terrible fate.

	SELENA
I need you like an Eskimo needs a lawnmower. Now 
burn rubber.

Nigel locks eyes with her.

NIGEL
				Make me.

He takes another insolent sip of champagne...arid discovers a scorpion perched on the rim of his glass.

Nigel spits out the champagne and, drops the glass. Everyone laughs at him.


NIGEL
				Balefire on you, Selena!

					SELENA
				    (grinning)
				You Scorpios can never take a joke.

All quests have fallen silent, staring at the altercation between the two of them. 

					NIGEL
				You think you are on top now. Well there is someone 
coming to challenge you. I saw it in the cards this morning.

	SELENA 
Throw him out.

Two burly waiters seize Nigel and drag him off toward the valet parking.

NIGEL
				You won't last a year, Selena. The cards don't lie!

The crowd breaks into a buzz of conversation. 

Bianca stands up on a chair. The crowd falls silent.
	
					BIANCA
				Let's not let one rotten apple spoil the party. I give you 
the first woman in eight hundred years to head 
the Circle: Selena!

Applause. Selena steps up onto a raised dais. And holds up her hands in an invocational gesture.

SELENA
				Thank you, sisters and brothers of the Craft. It is a 
great honor you have given me, and I will try to be
worthy. And when my secret plans are revealed --
you will learn that we are on the threshold of 
power and influence undreamed of when Nigel was 
our leader.

More applause. One of the cooks applauding at the refreshment table knocks over a fuel-pot under a chafing dish. The fuel-pot falls on the ground at the base of the wicker goat statue.  

					SELENA
				And now, ,I call upon the Great Mother--the spirit 
of Nature --- to bless all our endeavors in the 
coming year...

A woman in the .audience screams. Everyone looks where, she is pointing. The huge ten-foot tall wicker statue ,bursts into flames.

Panic and pandemonium. Some of the quests run for safety. Others try to throw water onto the blazing, torch-like statue, but in vain. Selena frowns at the spectacle, and, without a word, turns and stalks into her house.

INT. SELENA'S HOUSE.  LIVING ROOM

THE CAMERA FOLLOWS Selena through the French doors and into her large living room. On one wall is a huge, ornate gold-framed MIRROR, covered with a thick veil.

Selena sits down in front of a large hearth, and opens a secret compartment in the floor. She reaches inside and removes a finely wrought METAL BOX IN THE SHAPE OF A GARGOYLE and a pack of cards. She puts the gargoyle box on her lap, and begins to cast tarot cards onto the floor in mystic patterns.

The Elderly Man in the pinstripe suit enters from the garden. Outside the excited shouts and sounds of firefighting can still be heard. Someone runs by in the b.g. with a coil of garden hose. The Elderly Man walks over to Selena, timidly.

ELDERLY MAN 
Is this Nigel's doing?

SELENA
				It's a warning, that's for sure.

					ELDERLY MAN
				Maybe it was just an accident.

					SELENA
				     (mysteriously)
				There's no such thing as an accident. Everything has 
meaning, if you can read the signs.

The elderly man looks down at the pattern of tarot cards Selena has cast on the floor.

ELDERLY MAN
				Then what does it mean???




Selena shrugs and puts aside her cards.

SELENA
				Don't ask me. I can't read the signs worth spit.

EXT. MIDVALE SCHOOL. DAY

 A bus stops in front of the school. Kara, disguised in a brunette wig and unfashionable clothing gets out of the bus. (From now on we shall refer to her in human guise by the name of her secret identity LINDA LEE.) Linda walks up the driveway toward the main building. Around her the campus is full of girls all in the school uniform of skirt, blazer, and white knee socks. Many of them stare frankly at the new girl in the slightly dowdy dress, carrying a battered old suitcase.

In front of the school, LUCY LANE, one of the older girls, is batting in a softball game. She swings and hits one over the fence for a homer. Linda watches the excited, deliriously happy girls---wondering if she will ever be able to share such strong group emotions. Linda walks up the steps to the main building.

INT. MAIN BUILDING. MIDVALE SCHOOL. STAIRWAY

Linda walks up the long stairway in the entrance hall.

MYRA, the school bully, passes with her spy and toady the loathsome MUFFY. As they pass MYRA speaks in a loud voice.

MYRA
				Geeze, another barfy new student. They're really 
scraping the bottom of the barrel these days.

Linda walks on up to the next f1oor.

INT. MAIN BUILDING . MIDVALE SCHOOL. HALL

Linda walks along the deserted hall and stops at the office of the registrar, MR. Danvers. She enters.

INT. REGISTRAR'S OFFICE

MR. Danvers turns from his desk and glares at her.

 MR. DANVERS
				Don't you believe in knocking?

LINDA
Oh, yes. Knocking. The pre-entry signal. I forgot.

She knocks on the open door. Her manner is so open and guileless that MR. Danvers, though
he gives her a strange look, does not put it down to smart-aleckyness, as he normally would.

MR. DANVERS 
What can I do for you?

	LINDA 
I'm Linda Lee.

My cousin wrote you.

MR. Danvers stares at her blankly. He's a bit absent-minded.


MR . DANVERS 
Cousin? Wrote me?

Linda looks at the metal filing cabinet behind his desk.

Two beams of X-RAY VISION are faintly visible for an instant from her eyes.

LINDA
				The letter's in your files. Under K, for Kent.

MR. Danvers opens his file and searches through it.

					LINDA
				I mean, it would probably be there, if you received it.

					MR. DANVERS
				Here it is. Oh...of course. You're the orphan. I'm so sorry 
about your parents. We'll try to make you happy here.

He rises and walks around the desk toward her. He puts his hand on her shoulder in a fatherly fashion.

CUT TO:

EXT. CAMPUS. DORM

MR. Danvers is carrying her suitcase as he shows her around the campus.

MR DANVERS
				...since your school records were lost in the fire, we'11 
start you out easy first. You'll have English, Latin, 
French, History, Art, Chemistry, Math, Biology 
and Computing. Later on, you can add some electives. 
I think we'll put you in "G" dorm.

He opens the door and ushers her into the dorm.

INT. DORM. CORRIDOR

MR. Danvers leads Linda down the corridor. 

A girl dorm monitor sees him and yells out the traditional signal.

STUDENT MONITOR
				Man on the floor!

Immediately, several of the room doors along the corridor slam shut. MR. Danvers smiles indulgently and leads Linda along to one of the rooms with an open door.

INT. DORM ROOM

LUCY LANE, still in her softball flannels, is digging mud out of her cleats with a Swiss Army Knife held over a wastebasket. MR. Danvers knocks on the open door, in the pre-entry signal of Earth. Lucy looks up.

LUCY
				Oh, MR. Danvers, come in and park it.

					MR. DANVERS
				Lucy, your roommate still home with anorexia?

LUCY
				It wasn't anorexia. It was the food.

					MR DANVERS
				Linda, this is Lucy Lane. You can room with her. 
Show her around, Lucy; I believe you know her 
cousin, MR., uh, Kent. Lucy turns into a bundle of 
enthusiasm. She grabs Linda's suitcase and leads 
her into the room chattering away excitedly.

LUCY
				Wow, you're Clark's cousin?? Fabuloso! Clark's a 
hunk. My sister Lois was a real nerd to let that one 
get away. You'll love it here, we have a great dorm, 
some really insane characters, I mean radical craziness...
 
MR. Danvers slips away, leaving the two new roommates to get acquainted.








Lucy puts Linda's suitcase on the bare mattress of the empty bed and opens the dresser drawers to help her unpack.

LINDA 
I can do that.

	LUCY
No sweat. When's the rest of your stuff arriving?

She looks down at the nearly empty suitcase.
	
LINDA 
There isn't any.

LUCY
This is all your clothes?

Lucy involuntarily glances over her shoulder at the bulging closet beside. her own bed. Lucy's bed is smothered with teddy bears, and the walls around it are covered with photos and posters of male rock singers, movie stars, and tennis players. Also a large painted poster of SUPERMAN.

LINDA
				I have money to buy more, but I haven't had a 
chance since...

	LUCY
Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or 
something?

	LINDA
I'd rather not talk about it.

	LUCY
You're not...an orphan are you?

	LINDA
My cousin Clark is my only relative on Earth.

	LUCY
Oh wow, I should've known. Me and my big mouth. Listen, 
you can borrow any of my clothes you want. Any time.

LINDA
				Thank you. You're very kind.




LUCY
				I'm real sorry, Linda, I should've known it was 
something tragic if you show up without a 
wardrobe. Here, try on this. And this.

Lucy starts pulling clothes out of her closet and tossing to Linda.

											CUT TO:

EXT. SCHOOL PLAYING FIELDS. DAY

Girls in their adorable school gym outfits run around playing field hockey. Linda hangs back on the outskirts of the mob. She sees Myra put her stick between Lucy's legs and trip her. Linda stops to help Lucy up.

LINDA
She did that deliberately.

	LUCY
She's a beast.

The pack turns and heads back toward them, the lead. Myra slaps the puck directly at. steps in front of it to protect Lucy. The and shatters. .Play stops. The girls mill confusion, picking up the little pieces of with Myra in Lucy. Linda puck hits Linda around in puck.

					LUCY 
How'd you do that?

LINDA
				Must've been a defective puck.

INT. LOCKER ROOM. DAY

Girls pile in and start to take off their uniforms. Showers are running in the background. Linda unlaces her shoes. Lucy is unlacing beside her.

					LUCY
				Keep an eye peeled for Myra. She's out to get you.
				
LINDA 
But what for?

LUCY
				She just hates anybody who isn't afraid of her.





INT. SHOWER. LATER. DAY

Linda and Lucy (seen from the shoulders up) are enjoying a nice warm shower.

Linda looks through the tile wall (with her x-ray vision) and sees Myra next door, fooling with the plumbing.

INT. PLUMBING ROOM

MYRA
				      (whispering)
Are they in?

Muffy (Myra's spy) nods yes from her look-out position.

MYRA
				Listen to the screams when I shut off the cold water.

She takes a huge wrench and starts to shut off a valve. Her spy looks worriedly at the valve.

MUFFY
				But, Myra, why don't you shut off the hot water and 
give them an ice bath? If you shut off the cold it, 
could scald them.

MYRA
				So they lose a little skin. Serve 'em right.

Myra pulls on the wrench.

INT. SHOWER

Linda shoots a beam of her heat vision through the wall.

INT. PLUMBING ROOM

Myra pulls on the valve, but the wrench glows red hot in her hand. She lets go with a cry of pain. A pipe springs a leak, drenching her in her school uniform. Myra heads for the door, to get out. More pipes spring leaks. Myra is soaked, her hair all bedraggled, her uniform a mess.

CUT TO:

INT. COMPUTING CLASS

MR. Danvers is putting a fairly complicated equation on the blackboard. All the students sit at the consoles of little personal computers staring at their blank monitor screens. Except for Linda, who is staring intently at the wall on one side of the classroom.


MR DANVERS
				Now, this is the kind of problem that used to take 
weeks before the computer. It still takes a long 
time without certain algorithms.

Linda stares out through the solid wall with her X-RAY vision.

EXT. CAMPUS

A cat is stalking along a branch of a tree toward a nest of little baby birds. The nest is wedged on top of a window cornice on one of the buildings, but the tree branch passes just close enough by it for the cat to grab the baby birds when he gets there.

Slowly the cat inches along the branch. Suddenly a beam of light hits the branch. It bursts into flame, and falls down to the ground, saving the birds from any future danger. The cat turns around like a felon caught in the act, runs down the tree trunk, and scampers away.

INT. CLASS

Linda smiles to herself.

MR. DANVERS (O.S.) 
Linda? Are you with us?

She turns to look at MR. Danvers and finds everyone in class staring at her.

LINDA
				Uh, yes, MR. Danvers.

She looks at the board.

LINDA
				The answer is 5,271,009,010.

Linda smiles, proud that she got the right answer. The other girls in the class laugh at her. Even her friend Lucy snickers. Linda realizes she has made a mistake, but is not sure how serious it is. The class bell rings and the girls dash for the exit. Linda stays in her seat staring at Mr. Danvers as he goes around the room switching off the computers.

MR. DANVERS
				You may go, Linda. But try not to clown around in 
the future.

She meekly heads for the door. He turns to erase the blackboard. Something stays his hand, and he looks at the problem. Then he puts down the eraser and starts to copy the problem on a piece of paper.



EXT. ROAD OUTSIDE SCHOOL. DAY

Selena's Cadillac drives past the school. softball in front. Girls are playing softball in front.

INT. CADILLAC

Bianca is driving. Selena sits in the back brooding. Her tarot cards and the metal gargoyle box are beside her on the open counter of a  built-in bar. She suddenly calls out to Bianca.

SELENA 
Stop the car!

Bianca jams on the brakes and the car screeches to a halt.

EXT. ROAD OUTSIDE SCHOOL

The girls stop their softball game and turn to stare at the Cadillac.

INT. CADILLAC

Selena is gathering up her scattered things from the floor of the car.

SELENA
				I said stop, I didn't say run into a brick wall.

					BIANCA 
What is it?

		SELENA
The Coffer of Shadow. Look at it.

The metal gargoyle box is glowing with an inner radiance.

					SELENA 
What does it mean?

BIANCA
				The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near .

They stare out the car window at the girls' softball game, which was resumed.

SELENA
Oh, fiddlesticks. What could be dangerous about a 
baseball game?

	BIANCA
Softball.

	
SELENA
				It must be the girls. One of the girls.

					BIANCA 
But which one?

SELENA
				Drive on. We have already attracted enough 
attention.

Bianca starts up the car again and drives smoothly away.

SELENA
				We'll bide our time and keep watch. Young girls 
just can't keep a secret. If one of them's up to 
something--we'll find out.

	BIANCA
And then, like great cats---we pounce! And destroy!

The car swerves slightly.

SELENA
				Bianca, try not to be so bloodthirsty when you're at 
the wheel. OK?

	BIANCA 
Sorry, mistress.

CUT TO:

EXT. DORM. DAY

Linda is standing at the bathroom' window of her dorm room, looking outside with a melancholy expression. She slides the curtain across the window, so no one can see in.

INT. LINDA AND LUCY'S ROOM. DAY

Lucy runs in, fresh from her softball game, and sits down on the bed as usual to dig the mud out of her cleats. Lucy's bed is still a riot of stuffed animals and frilly lace pillows. Linda's bed' across the room is austere and almost monastic, with no family photos, posters, or toys.

LUCY
				Hey, Linda, you in there?

LINDA (o.s.)
				Uh-huh.

Linda answers from inside the shut bathroom door.
LUCY
				How much longer you gonna be?

LINDA (o.s.)
				Not long. I'm cutting my hair.

Lucy crosses to the bathroom door. 

LUCY
				You're a maniac! Let me do it for you. You'll look awful.

INT. BATHROOM OFF DORM ROOM. DAY

Linda is in her Supergirl costume and her blonde hair. Her brunette wig is hanging on a hook beside the mirror.

SUPERGIRL
				I can manage, thanks.

Supergirl holds out a lock of her blonde hair. She looks into the mirror and SHOOTS A BEAM OF ENERGY FROM HER EYE, which reflects off the mirror and strikes her hair, cutting off one inch of the blonde strand.

INT. DORM

LUCY
				I cut my own hair once. I looked so awful the only 
thing was to go totally punk!

Linda opens the door and steps out of the bathroom. She is wearing her brunette wig and her Linda clothing. Lucy is puzzled.

LUCY
				Your hair looks the same.

LINDA
				It was just a trim.

The student hall monitor sticks her head in the door and yells excitedly.

JODY
				Hey guys, Gloria just got a package from home.

					LUCY 
What's in it?

JODY
				A hair dryer that makes popcorn!

					LUCY 
Wow! Pig-out time. Come on Linda.

Lucy hurries to the door. Linda holds back.

LINDA
No thanks. You go on.

	LUCY
You sure?

Linda nods bravely, and Lucy dashes off down the hall toward the lounge. Linda stands alone in the room.

A beam of light from the setting sun shines through the room, and casts a pool of light on the opposite wall. Linda looks at the beam of light with nostalgia.

 INT. DORM LOUNGE

Lucy and the other girls are stuffing themselves with popcorn turned out in bowlfulls by Gloria's new hair dryer. The package it came from lies torn open on the table beside the hair-dryer. Some of the girls start a playful popcorn-throwing fight in the b.g. One of the girls is strumming her guitar, and starts to sing "There's No Place Like Home". One by one the other girls join in. It's a scene of high spirits and camaraderie, in contrast to Linda's loneliness.

INT. LINDA'S DORM ROOM

Linda, still staring at the sunbeam shining through her room, and at the tiny dust motes dancing in the beam. From down the hall comes the sound of the girls singing, in improvised six-part harmony.

GIRLS .o.s.)
"Be it ever so humble, There's no place like 
home..."

A tear of self-pity and homesickness wells up in Linda's eyes and runs down her cheek. She steps into the beam of sunlight and it shines full on her face. She suddenly hears Alura's voice in her mind.

ALURA (o.s.) 
Kara, my darling...

	LINDA
Mother! Is it you? Where are you???

	ALURA (o.s.)
In Argo City. Have you found the Power Source?


	LINDA
Mother, this world is so big. I don't know where 
to begin to look.

ALURA (o.s.)
				Kara, be careful. There is some terrible evil force coming 
near you. I can feel it. Keep to your disguise. Let no one
know who you are.

LINDA
				But why? I have super powers. Nothing can hurt me.

ALURA (o.s.)
				There are more powers in the universe than we know. 
And more than we can imagine. Be careful, Kara. And
come home safely.

The sun sets and the beam of light disappears as if a switch had been snapped off, leaving Linda alone in the warm afterglow of twilight.

The soft strains of girls harmonizing float down the hall.

GIRLS (o.s.) 
"...mid pleasures and palaces Where'ere I roam, Be 
it ever so humble, There's no place like home."

CUT TO:

EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS. BENCH. DAY

Linda sits by herself reading on a stone bench: She is wearing the school uniform now. All around her girls are running out of the dorm with overnight cases and climbing into cars driven by middle-aged couples. There is a frantic bustle of activity. 

CUT TO:

INT. OFFICE IN THE MATH DEPARTMENT

Mr. Danvers sits at his computer, which is spewing out page after page of a complicated printout. Finally the printer stops. He reads out the bottom line.

MR . DANVERS
				Five billion, two hundred and seventy-one million, 
nine thousand, and ten.

He sits back in his chair and puffs thoughtfully on his pipe.



EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS. BENCH. DAY. LATER

The campus is deserted. Linda still pretends to read, but her sense of loneliness is palpable. Suddenly Mr. Danvers is beside her, looking down.

MR. DANVERS
				No plans for the weekend, Linda?

LINDA 
No, MR. Danvers.

MR. DANVERS
				Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't 
you come home with us for dinner?

LINDA 
I'd love to.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. BACKYARD OF DANVERS'S HOUSE. DAY

Mr. & Mrs. Danvers and Linda sit outside under the trees at a table piled high with delicious home cooked food. ,The dog begs for scraps. As the scene progresses (MOS) the Danvers bring Linda out of her shyness until they all laugh together sharing food, jokes and happiness. A. dreamlike moment of nostalgia from everyone's childhood.

INT. SELENA'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. DAY

Selena, at her most glamorous, in silk hostess pajamas and scads of pearls, stands looking out the French, doors of her mansion. She is staring shamelessly at ETHAN, a handsome young landscape gardener. Bianca is standing beside Selena.

BIANCA
				Is he your entertainment for tonight?

					SELENA
				He will be. In about five minutes.

					BIANCA
				Have fun.

Bianca exits, and Selena waves to Ethan from the French doors.

EXT. SELENA'S HOUSE. GARDEN. DAY.

Ethan is sketching the house, adding new trees and shrubs in his drawing. He sees Selena waving, and walks over to her. 

INT. SELENA'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. DAY

SELENA 
Finished your estimate?

	ETHAN
Well, there's several ways to go .

SELENA
				Come in, have a drink, we'll talk.

She ushers him inside and sits him down in front of the vast hearth.

SELENA
				You must be very popular in the neighborhood. I always 
see your truck parked around.

	ETHAN
I have a lot of repeat business. People seem to like my 
service.

	SELENA
I bet they do.

	ETHAN
What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire.

	SELENA
Oh, you know how parties are. Always some damage.

Ethan spreads his drawings out on his knees.

					ETHAN
				Now we could put in rhododendrons or lilacs...depending 
on how alkaline your soil is. 

Selena gives a cursory glance at the sketch, and then turns to a silver tray beside her. She picks up a frosty pitcher and pours an iced fruit drink into two tall glasses.

					SELENA 
				I just love plants and growing things. It must be 
wonderful to have green thumbs. Cheers!

Ethan looks at the drink with misgiving.

ETHAN
				Uh, no thanks, I don't drink during the day.


Selena gestures outside.
	
SELENA
				But look, it's almost sundown!

Ethan glances outside. Selena pours some poisonous looking red liquid into his glass from a tiny bottle hidden in her hand while his attention is distracted.

ETHAN
				Really, I'm not thirsty. Now I could put in some 
honeysuckle there and there...

Selena pouts exaggeratedly.

SELENA
Just take a sip or .I'll be hurt. It's an old family 
recipe, I'm famous for them.

Ethan pauses. He doesn't want to offend his rich new customer over such a trifle.

ETHAN 
What is it?

	SELENA
A passionfruit smoothee.

		ETHAN
Well, just one.

He takes his glass (with the extra ingredient) and clinks it against hers in a toast.

SELENA
				To us. And to the seeds we'll plant together.

ETHAN 
I'll drink to that.

He takes a careful sip of his drink, tastes, and smiles.


ETHAN 
Hmmm. Delicious!

He tosses off the rest of it in one gulp. Selena watches him triumphantly.

ETHAN
Now, about my fee...

He suddenly clutches his throat with a gasp and collapses unconscious on the couch. She leans over him and strokes his cheek delicately with her long red-nailed fingers.

SELENA
				Sleep well. And when you wake, drown in my eyes 
and be all mine.

The DOORBELL RINGS.  Selena looks up with annoyance.

SELENA
				If that's the Jehovah's Witnesses again...

She angrily walks toward the hall, casting a fond look back at Ethan.

SELENA
				Don't go away, gorgeous. I'll be right back.

EXT. FRONT DOOR OF MANSION

Nigel in a skin-tight vinyl jumpsuit with multidirectional chrome zippers is leaning on the bell. Behind him his Porsche is parked in the driveway, and beyond at the curb is a truck with ETHAN'S NURSERY AND LANDSCAPING painted on it. Selena opens the door, sees Nigel, and tries to close it. But Nigel puts his foot in and keeps it open.

SELENA 
Nigel, get lost.

NIGEL
				I have to talk to you.

					SELENA
				You're wasting your breath.

					NIGEL
				You used to listen to me. When you asked me to 
teach you something of the Craft.

	SELENA
I could teach you a thing or two now.

INT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM

Ethan opens his eyes. He rises from the couch and stands there swaying deliriously.

INSERT. P.O.V. OF ETHAN

The room swirls and distorts around him in garish nightmare colours.


BACK TO SCENE

Ethan clutches his head as though it were splitting apart, and lurches out of the French doors into the terrace.

EXT. FRONT DOOR OF MANSION

Selena is listening impatiently to Nigel, and staring oddly at him.

NIGEL
				...trust the wisdom of the ancients, trust the Great 
Mother to protect us... Why. are you staring at me 
like that?

SELENA
				I was just thinking, if I had your skin problems, I'd use a 
good tannisroot ointment. Every night.

Nigel is rather vain about his smooth olive complexion, so he is completely thrown off his stride.

NIGEL
				Nothing's wrong with my skin.

					SELENA
				Such a shame. You ought to take better care of 
yourself.

Selena closes the door while he's off his guard. Nigel takes a pocket mirror out of his shoulder bag and stares with horror at his reflection. His face is erupting all over in ugly red blotches.

NIGEL 
Nasty bitch!

EXT. GROUNDS OF SELENA'S MANSION. SUNSET

Ethan staggers across the lawn, still clutching his head, obviously very ill. As he disappears through the shrubbery on the far side of the lawn, he mutters drunkenly to himself.

ETHAN 
Rhododendron.. . .honeysuckle. . .

INT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM

Selena enters and finds Ethan gone. She is furious. She walks to the French doors.

					SELENA 
Ethan. Come back. You'll spoil everything!
INT. THE DANVERS' LIVING ROOM. NIGHT

Linda is playing chess with MR. Danvers, while his wife knits on the sofa.

MRS. DANVERS
				I think you'd better be getting back to the dorm, Linda. 
The housemother'll expect you to sign in by eight.

Linda stands up from the chessboard.

LINDA
				Thank you both so much. It was a lovely lunch, Mrs. 
Danvers. I had a wonderful time. And you're a 
terrific chess player MR. Danvers.

	MR. DANVERS 
What? Me?

LINDA
				Sure. Mate in five moves.

She moves the pieces chonk, chonk, chonk, chonk, chonk...

LINDA
				...and there goes my king. Got to hand it to you, I didn't 
see it coming. Well, bye.

She walks out the door into the night.

MRS . DANVERS
				What a lovely child. Such nice manners. We must 
have her back, don't you think?

MR. Danvers 'grunts absent-mindedly, bemused at his loss.

INT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM. NIGHT

Selena paces agitatedly in her living room. Finally she stops in front of the ornate mirror hanging on the wall. She puts her hand on the heavy veil covering it.

SELENA
				Show me Ethan.

She rips aside the veil. The IMAGE IN THE MIRROR SHOWS ETHAN STAGGERING DRUNKENLY THROUGH THE NIGHT COWN THE CENTRE WHITE LINE OF A HIGHWAY. CARS WHIZZ PAST HIM IN BOTH DIRECTIONS.

SELENA 
The silly fool! 
EXT. HAMBURGER HEAVEN. NIGHT

Lucy is in front of the local hamburger drive-in in her Thunderbird convertible, talking to the foxiest dude at Rindge Tech. Other teens are hanging out and listening to rock music outside the drive-in. Lucy catches sight of Linda walking along the side of the road.

LUCY 
Hey, Linda!
     (to the boy) 
It's my roommate. You'll love her. She's really off 
the wall!

Lucy jumps out of her car, runs over to Linda, and whispers urgently in her ear.

LUCY
				Linda babes! There's this all-night party at Eddie's...
his folks are away...

LINDA 
Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out
for an overnight.

	LUCY
Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom 
window. McCloskey's always zonked out: 
she'll never hear you.

	LINDA
It doesn't seem right.

	LUCY
Please, as a favour to me? So I won't  be the only girl?

Linda catches sight of a figure teetering down the centre, white line of the highway. Cars honk and zoom past him.

LINDA 
Look at that guy!

Lucy whirls around and looks. 

					LUCY
				What a space cadet. 
      (yelling and waving) 
Hey, you dingleberry! Get outta the street!

Ethan ignores them, and continues to teeter deliriously.


INSERT.  ETHAN'S P.O.V.

He sees the night as a fairyland of dancing, blurred lights: the neon of the hamburger stand; the garish pumps of the gas station across the street, the streaking head and taillights of the cars on either side. All sound is similarly distorted and far away.

BACK TO SCENE

LINDA	
				Why is he acting so strangely?

					LUCY
				I dunno, but he's gonna get creamed.

INT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM. NIGHT

Selena holds the metal box shaped like a gargoyle. She looks at the IMAGE OF ETHAN in 
her mirror.

SELENA
				Power of Shadows...bring him to me. 


The box in her hand glows with an inner light.

EXT. STREET OPPOSITE H]1..MBUP.GER RESTAURANT. NIGHT

There is a construction site next to the Hamburger Place.  A giant BULLDOZER suddenly ROARS TO LIFE and bursts through the chain link fence surrounding the construction site. With no one at the controls, the bulldozer drives out onto the street. Ethan sees its GAPING JAWS and runs clumsily away. They snap at him with the clash of steel. He stumbles and the bulldozer scoops him up. It wheels around and starts to carry him away, with one of his legs protruding through the teeth of its giant mouth. The onlookers are stunned and horrified.

LUCY
				Omigod, it's a runaway!

Lucy sprints out into the street, running after the driverless bulldozer.

LINDA 
Lucy; come back!

	LUCY
Somebody's gotta do something!!

Lucy dodges through the cars and alongside the bulldozer. She climbs bravely up into the driver's seat and tries to tug at the controls. They are frozen. In desperation Lucy yanks on the steering wheel. The bulldozer turns ninety degrees into the gas station.

EXT. GAS STATION. NIGHT

A TOURIST is filling his station wagon at one of the self-service pumps. His WIFE is bringing their TODDLER back from the rest rooms. The bulldozer suddenly smashes into the gas pumps and through the gas station. The tourist dives out of its path. The bulldozer circles behind the gas station toward a small motel next door, leaving in its wake a totaled station wagon, and gasoline leaking on the ground from the smashed pumps.

EXT. HAMBURGER RESTAURANT. NIGHT

Linda watches with mounting horror. And yet she remembers the warning from Alura, and stands frozen, unable to intervene.

EXT. MOTEL/GAS STATION. NIGHT

Lucy fights the wheel in vain. The bulldozer circles through the motel, smashing the individual cabins into matchsticks. The bulldozer drives under the MOTEL SIGN which HITS LUCY ON THE HEAD, KNOCKING HER UNCONSCIOUS. Finally, the bulldozer comes full circle and halts against a utility pole next to the gas station. The utility pole leans at a crazy angle. Its ELECTRIC WIRES break and dangle down, flashing blue arcs of electricity where they touch the pavement. The RIVER OF GASOLINE from the broken pump flows inexorably toward the arcing power lines. The mother kneels beside her dazed husband and looks over at her toddler running toward the arcing wires, his arms held out eagerly.

MOTHER
My baby!!!!!

Instead of helping, the onlookers turn and flee the inevitable fire.

EXT. HAMBURGER RESTAURANT. NIGHT

Linda can't take it any longer. She ducks into the deserted hamburger restaurant. An instant later, she emerges through a skylight in the roof in red and blue costume as SUPERGIRL! She stands on-the roof in front of a big illuminated advertising sign, which hides her from the fleeing crowd. Supergirl takes a deep breath and blows with her super lungs:. The toddler is blown safely 1nto his mother's arms.

MOTHER
				My baby.

She grasps the child in her arms and helps her husband hobble to safety just as the river of gasoline reaches the sparking wires and BURSTS INTO FLAMES .

The bulldozer, with Lucy Lane unconscious at the controls and Ethan imprisoned in the scoop, is surrounded by an IMPENETRABLE RING OF FIRE . 



Supergirl dashes through the ring of fire so fast that if there were any spectators who weren't running for their lives she would only be visible as a red and blue streak.

EXT. ACCIDENT SCENE/GAS STATION. NIGHT INSIDE THE RING OF FIRE.

Supergirl takes the unconscious Lucy from the driver's seat and carries her in her arms to the front of the bulldozer.

Supergirl pulls open the massive metal jaws with one hand like they were sheet rubber.

INT. SCOOP OF BULLDOZER

Ethan looks up as Supergirl slides Lucy Lane in beside him. He sees Supergirl's face backlit by the raging inferno outside.

SUPERGIRL
				Everything's going to be all right. She's just 
unconscious. No broken bones.

INSERT ETHAN'S P.O.V. LOOKING AT SUPERGIRL FROM INSIDE THE SCOOP

Ethan's swirling distorted vision suddenly focuses with , absolute clarity. A moment outside of time. The most romantic glamorous image imaginable: the blonde, backlit, looking at him with concern, her lips slightly parted.

BACK TO SCENE

There is something about Ethan's ecstasy, which holds Supergirl for a moment.

ETHAN 
God...you're beautiful.

INT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM

Selena watches the image of Ethan and Supergirl in her mirror. Her face is a study in jealousy and dismay.


ETHAN (in the mirror) 
God...you're beautiful.

	SELENA
That was meant for me!

EXT. ACCIDENT SCENE/GAS STATION. BULLDOZER. RING OF FIRE

SUPERGIRL
Thank you. I'm going to close this up again.

ETHAN
Wait...don't leave me in here...

SUPERGIRL
				It's for your own protection.

She pulls the massive steel jaws shut and tears the scoop off the bulldozer with a sound of rending metal. Immediately afterwards, the flames reach the underground storage tank and the bulldozer is enveloped in a FIERY EXPLOSION.

EXT. ACCIDENT SCENE. OUTSIDE RING OF FIRE. NIGHT

The entire gas station is a column of flame and black smoke reaching up into the night sky. A fire truck and a police car arrive on the scene, sirens screaming. The tourist family watch from a safe distance, their toddler clapping his hands excitedly at the spectacle.

EXT. IN THE SKY. HIGH ABOVE THE ACCIDENT. NIGHT

Supergirl flies out of the column of black smoke, carrying the sealed bulldozer scoop with Ethan and Lucy safely inside.

ETHAN 
       (calling from inside) 
What's happening?

	SUPERGIRL
        (shouting over the wind) 
I'm taking you to the hospital.

	ETHAN
           (within)
Let me out. I have to talk to you.

SUPERGIRL
				Later.

EXT. ACCIDENT SCENE. POST FIRE. NIGHT

The firemen have smothered the fire with a blanket of foam. The blackened bulldozer minus its front scoop stands next to the smashed station wagon. A bewildered policeman is searching for victims.

POLICEMAN
				Where's the casualties? You can't tell me there's 
no casualties.

INT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM. NIGHT

Bianca enters and sees Selena staring raptly at the mirror.
BIANCA
				I came as quickly as I could. What is the danger?

SELENA
				It's what we were warned about.

Selena points to the mirror, which shows the IMAGE OF SUPERGIRL FLYING THROUGH THE AIR CARRYING THE BULLDOZER SCOOP. Bianca can't quite make out what it is at first.

BIANCA 
A Storm Dragon?

	SELENA 
No, a super girl.

EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE. NIGHT

Supergirl lands with the bulldozer scoop in front of the emergency entrance. There is no one around. Supergirl rips open the sealed scoop with a loud noise of rending metal.

INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM. NIGHT

TWO INTERNS are chatting in the corridor near the doors. They jump at the sound of bending steel outside.

FIRST INTERN 
What was that?

	SECOND INTERN 
Maybe we better take a look.

EXT . HOSPITAL ENTRANCE. NIGHT

Supergirl has strapped Ethan and the semi-conscious Lucy onto wheeled gurneys.

					ETHAN 
Don't leave me.

	SUPERGIRL 
I have to.

	ETHAN
When can I see, you again ?

	SUPERGIRL
Relax. Tomorrow this will all seem like a bad dream. 
Goodbye.


She gives the gurneys a shove.

INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM. NIGHT

The automatic doors open and Ethan and Lucy roll inside on the gurneys.

FIRST INTERN
				Did we use the laughing gas tonight?

					SECOND INTERN 
That was last night.

 					FIRST INTERN
				Then this is really happening.

The two interns catch the gurneys, and start examining Ethan and Lucy.

SECOND INTERN
Hey fella, can you talk???

Ethan begins to babble deliriously.

ETHAN
				The girl. Where is she? It never hit me like this 
before. I love her. My angel.

He sits up, tears brimming in his eyes, and grasps the , intern by the lapels.

ETHAN
				Where is she? I love her, don't you understand? I'll die 
if I can't have her.

The intern pulls away and points to Lucy, who is beginning to come to.

FIRST INTERN 
She's right here fella.

	ETHAN
No, not her. The blonde, the one who carried us 
through the air:. She can fly. She's an angel.

The two interns exchange a glance. One of them steps to a wall intercom.

SECOND INTERN
				This is Stenzl in Emergency. We got
				a 412. Send down the boys from psycho.


ETHAN
				No! She's real ! I saw her !

CUT TO:

 INT. SELENA' S MANSION.  NIGHT

Selena, is brooding in front of her mirror, which shows ETHAN IN THE HOSPITAL STRUGGLING WITH THE TWO INTERNS . Selena covers the mirror with its heavy veil. She speaks to Bianca standing beside her.

SELENA
				Why did she have to show up now?

BIANCA 
Eliminate her.

	SELENA
That's easy for you to say, Bianca.

	BIANCA
You can do it. You're the most powerful woman 
on Earth.

SELENA 
Am I? Still?

There is a pause as the implications reverberate.

BIANCA
				Yes! You own the Coffer of Shadow. Nothing can 
withstand its power.

SELENA 
I've been saving it. For the right moment.

BIANCA
				That moment is now! What good is a sword unless 
it be unsheathed? Use it, and no one will dare 
oppose you again. No one.

Selena toys with the idea in her mind, turning over the various arguments. A smile creeps across her face.

SELENA 
Not even Nigel.

Selena goes to the secret compartment, opens it and takes out the metal gargoyle box. She looks at it with a dreamy, far-away expression on her face.
SELENA
				What do I do?  I don't know her name.

					BIANCA
				The Naming of Names is not necessary. Just concentrate 
on her face. Your Shadow will do the rest.

Selena holds the gargoyle box out in front of her and opens the lid. Inside is the OMEGAHEDRON power source from Argo City, spinning around a strange dark region in its centre. Selena closes her eyes and whispers to the spinning ring.

SELENA
				Power of Shadow hear me. Find her wherever she be. 
Find her and destroy her.

A BLACK CLOUD OF SHADOW bursts out of the centre of the OMEGAHEDRON, filling the room. Selena drops the gargoyle box and shrinks back with sudden misgivings at what she has unleashed. Even Bianca's face has gone white. The two women huddle together as a HUGE INVISIBLE PRESENCE fills the room with darkness. Then the unseen presence suddenly SMASHES ITS WAY OUTSIDE THROUGH THE SOLID WALL OF SELENA'S LIVING ROOM, leaving a big hole and a trail of crushed furniture behind it. Light returns to the room as the shadow departs. And from outside the sound of crackling shrubbery dies away. Selena regains her composure and looks around at the mess of her once splendid living room.

SELENA
				Next time, remind me to do this out in the yard.

BIANCA
				Yes, of course, it was foolish of me.

Bianca reaches down to the floor for the gargoyle box with the OMEGAHEDRON, which is still lying right where Selena dropped it. But Selena quickly picks it up herself before Bianca can touch it.

SELENA
				I think I'd better keep it.

					BIANCA
Whatever you say.

SELENA 
Yes. Whatever I say.  From now on.

She shuts the lid of the gargoyle box, sealing the spinning OMEGAHEDRON safely inside.

INT. DANVERS ' LIVING ROOM. NIGHT

Mrs. Danvers is on the phone.

MRS. DANVERS
				The housemother still doesn't answer.

Mrs. Danvers hangs up the phone with a worried expression.

MR. DANVERS
				Probably drunk again. I'm sure Linda got back all right.
 
MRS. DANVERS
				We should have driven her.

Mr. Danvers stands up and puts on his jacket.

MR. DANVERS
				I'll just drop by the school and. make sure she's all right.

EXT. MIDVALE SCHOOL. DESERTED CAMPUS. OUTSIDE THE DORM. NIGHT

Linda drives up in Lucy's car, the one left behind at the scene of the accident outside the hamburger place. She drives past the paddle tennis court and parks in front of the dorm. Linda gets out of the car, and lets herself into the dorm with a key. Inside, she signs her name in the book. ,

INT. DORM CORRIDOR. NIGHT

Linda walks down the long dormitory corridor past room after empty room. The place is kind of spooky.

INT. LINDA'S ROOM. NIGHT

Linda enters the room she shares with Lucy. She puts Lucy's car keys on her bedside table next to the snapshots of  Lucy's family and of her half-dozen current boyfriends. Linda turns and crosses the room to her own monastic bed in its drab, undecorated corner. She lies down on her bed with a sigh, staring at the ceiling in a melancholy mood.

Suddenly, she senses that something is not right. She gets up from the bed, walks to the window, and gazes out a-t the deserted campus.

EXT. OUTSIDE DORM. TENNIS COURT. NIGHT.

The dorm is set apart from other school buildings and surrounded by tall trees. The tennis court is visible from Linda's window, and a city park adjoining the school property. The UNSEEN MONSTER is heard approaching through the park with a thud of heavy footfalls and the crack of snapping tree trunks and branches. A bolt of lightning flashes, followed by a crash of thunder. The wind howls. A storm is brewing.

Far away across the campus something huge and powerful forces itself between the two big oaks, snapping them like matchsticks. The unseen monster hauls its enormous bulk toward the dormitory, crushing everything in its path, its footsteps making the ground tremble like an earthquake.

 INT. LINDA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT

Linda watches with uncomprehending eyes the approaching swath of destruction heading straight for her. Nothing she has learned about this strange alien world has prepared" her for this. For the first time since she left Argo City, her eyes show fear. And yet there's a deeper streak of defiance in her that impels her to stand her ground and face the horrible juggernaut.

EXT. FORM. TENNIS COURT. CAMPUS. NIGHT

HUGE FOOTPRINTS sink into the damp grass of the campus. A bicycle rack full of Schwinns is flattened into the dirt with a metallic screech. The monster proceeds inexorably toward the wooden rain shelter on one side of the tennis court. The shelter is crushed to kindling wood. The monster drags its enormous unseen bulk across the smooth clay surface of the tennis court, crunching , deep cracked depressions in the clay. The net stretches and groans toward Linda as the' invisible enormity comes closer, and finally snaps with a loud twanging sound as the steel cables part. The tall cyclone fence bulges outward toward Linda and momentarily outlines the form of" the monster before it crumples and falls with the screech of twisted steel. The only thing between Linda and the monster is Lucy.' s parked car. The monster stomps the car flat with a noise like colliding express trains and heads for Linda.

INT. LINDA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT

LINDA
				Hey, that's my roommate's car!

Determination floods her face. She whips off her brunette wig and her civilian clothing to reveal the blonde hair and red blue tunic of SUPERGIRL!

EXT. OUTSIDE THE DORM. NIGHT

Supergirl flies out the dorm window and lands in front of the unseen monster. She raises her hand in challenge and calls out in a commanding voice.

SUPERGIRL
				Leave this place and do no harm.

Something picks Supergirl up and flings her against the wall of the dorm, crushing the soft drink dispenser under her and squirting cola in every direction. Lightning flashes and thunder booms overhead. Supergirl picks herself up, shaken.




She launches herself directly at the space in mid-air ten feet above the monster's footprints. She crashes into something hard and invisible with the sound of a tremendous impact. Supergirl falls to the ground, staggered by the concussion. The irresistible force has met the immovable object. Supergirl looks up, and---altering the wavelength of her X-Ray vision to a transcendental frequency---paints this beam over the monster and just for an instant makes it visible: a HUGE NIGHTMARE SHAPE LOOMING OVER HER, AND REACHING OUT TO CRUSH HER WITH MASSIVE TALONS. Then the image fades.

Supergirl is seized again and flung against the school flagpole, breaking it off at the base. Supergirl stands up and seizes the flagpole. She looks up at the flickering lightning in the sky. She flies straight upward into the storm with the bare flagpole held in front of her.

EXT. THUNDER STORM. LIGHTNING

Again and again huge bolts of lightning strike the flagpole. Supergirl's face is contorted with agony as her body absorbs enough electricity to run Las Vegas for a year. She looks down and sees through a break in the clouds the campus far below.

EXT. CAMPUS

Suddenly Supergirl dives down from the sky, glowing with accumulated electricity. She embraces the monster with a tremendous crackle of energy. The two of them are bathed in brilliant arc light. The monster is briefly made visible again by the energy. But this time it is shrinking, shriveling up into a shapeless lump. The light fades as the energy is discharged. A dark, shapeless lump detaches itself from Supergirl's grasp and flies shrieking away into the night. Supergirl stands alone and exhausted, her muscles trembling with fatigue. 

She turns and walks unsteadily back toward the dorm.

CUT TO:


EXT. CAMPUS. NIGHT

MR. Danvers drives up the long driveway toward Linda's dorm. He parks his car behind the flattened remains of Lucy's car, and gets out, staring with amazement at the destruction wrought by the titanic struggle.

He walks toward the dorm, fear and confusion on his face.

INT. DORM. ENTRY. NIGHT

Mr. Danvers pushes through the unlocked front door. He glances in the sign-out book for Linda's name. Then he knocks on the door labeled HOUSEMOTHER MRS. MCCLOSKEY. No reply. He opens that door and peeks in.




INT. HOUSEMOTHER'S ROOM. NIGHT

A slovenly, overweight woman in a housecoat is curled up on her sofa, a bottle of whiskey clutched to her breast. She snores heroically.

INT. DORM. HALLWAY.  NIGHT

Mr. Danvers walks quickly down the long line of empty rooms to Linda and Lucy's room.

INT. LINDA'S ROOM. NIGHT

Mr. Danvers pauses at the door and looks in. Supergirl, in her blonde hair and red and blue 
tunic, is lying asleep on Linda's bed.

MR. DANVERS
				A Supergirl...
				         (to her)
				Linda...is it Linda?

Supergirl looks up at him and smiles, weakly.

SUPERGIRL
				I didn't want anyone to know... but I was so 
tired...forgot...

M. Danvers sits on the side of her bed.

MR. DANVERS
				Are you all right?

SUPERGIRL
				Just need rest, that's all. Sorry about all the damage 
outside. I had to fight some terrible thing...


					MR. DANVERS
				But why?

SUPERGIRL
				An evil force. Trying to destroy me.

She sits up and looks anxiously at him.

Not even my wife. And, if there's anything I can do to 
help---I'd be honoured.

INT. DORM. LINDA'S ROOM

Supergirl sinks back down and closes her eyes.

SUPERGIRL
				Thank you, Mr. Danvers.

She lapses into a deep sleep. Mr. Danvers stands up, and pulls the covers up over her in a fatherly gesture. He stands beside the bed for a long time looking down at her, and then walks out of the room, closing the door shut behind him.

EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE. DAY

Linda gets off a bus and enters the hospital. 

INT. HOSPITAL. DAY

Lucy Lane is sitting up in bed with a white bandage around her head. Superman's pal JIMMY OLSEN is standing awkwardly beside the bed holding a small bunch of daffodils. Lucy is talking animatedly on her bedside telephone, when Linda enters.

LUCY
				...come see me. And smuggle in a pint, they won't 
let me have anything, but make sure it's Jamocha 
Almond Fudge . . Listen, I got to run, my 
roommate just walked in. Bye.

Lucy hangs up and turns to Linda.

LUCY
				Hey, Linda-babes! I've got so much to tell you, I 
don't know where to begin! Oh -- this is Jimmy 
Olsen, he works with Clark and my sister at the 
newspaper.




					JIMMY
				Nice to meet you. Lucy's told me all about you. Your 
cousin Clark taught me everything I know about
the newspaper business.

	LINDA 
Nice to meet you.

She shakes hands shyly with Jimmy, then turns to Lucy.

LINDA
				I'm afraid I have some bad news about your car.

					LUCY
				Mr. Danvers called. I'll get a new one with the 
insurance money. B.F.D. 

Jimmy keeps looking at Linda.

JIMMY
				Do you have any theories about last night?

					LINDA
				Theories?

					JIMMY
				How Lucy and that guy got to the hospital. And all 
that damage at the school. The police are calling it 
a freak tornado. I'd like to interview you for the Daily- -

LUCY 
      (overlapping) 
Oh, Jimmy, can't you forget about your career for one 
second?

JIMMY
				-- Planet. I mean, you were there. Do you think it was natural,
				 or like some people are claiming, supernatural?

					LINDA
				I believe there's a rational explanation for everything. But 
I don't know what it is.

	JIMMY
Can I quote you?




Lucy hands Jimmy a stainless steel urinal.

LUCY
				Jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers 
in water before they die?

JIMMY
				Oh, sure.

He steps into Lucy's bathroom with the urinal and fills it with water from her shower. Lucy grabs Linda's arm and whispers urgently in her ear.

LUCY
				Listen, I know I've been saying you ought party 
more, but keep your hands off this one, will yak? 
He's private property. I've been waiting years 
for him to develop.

	LINDA 
He's nice.

LUCY
				Nice? He's cute enough to melt lead!

Jimmy emerges from the bathroom with his daffodils neatly arranged in the stainless steel jug.

JIMMY
				Where is your cousin Clark, by the way?

 EXT. HOSPITAL. ENTRANCE. LATE AFTERNOON

Bianca drives Selena's Cadillac up to the emergency entrance and parks in the ambulance zone. Selena get out of the back seat in a dramatic opera cape of raw silk with opal trim.

SELENA 
				      (to Bianca)
				This won't take long. Keep the motor running.



INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR. LATE AFTERNOON

Selena strides down the hospital corridor almost as if she is floating an inch above the floor. Her huge silk cape billows around her, making her seem larger-than-life. Nurses, orderlies, patients scatter to get out of her way. Her presence is so formidable and she moves so fast and inexorably that no one has a chance to stop her and inquire what she's doing there. She knows exactly where she's going to. She turns a corner, and steps inside an open door and closes it behind her.

INT. ETHAN'S ROOM. DAY

He is sitting in bed, an ice bag on his head, drawing a picture of Supergirl on a piece of cardboard. He is in pajamas and robe.

Selena steps beside the bed. He looks up.

					ETHAN
				Oh no, not you again.

					SELENA
				What an adorable hat.

					ETHAN 
				They think I have a concussion.

					SELENA
				And you think you're in love.

					ETHAN 
I know it.

	SELENA
This "love" of yours will soon wear off. I gave you 
a temporary love potion.

ETHAN
				Why should I believe you?

					SELENA 
				It's the truth. In twenty-four hours you'll forget all 
about that girl.

Ethan. reaches out and grabs her cloak with a grip of such urgency that she is pulled slightly off balance.

					ETHAN
				Then I'm not the only one who saw her. You did too!

Selena pulls his hand away from her cloak.
SELENA
				Yes, yes I saw the whole thing. How could you be 
interested in that puny little girl?

	ETHAN
But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.

	SELENA
Forget her, you're mine. I saw you first.

Selena sits on the side of the bed. She removes a vial of liquid from her bodice.
I saw you

SELENA 
                (continuing)
	Here. Drink this. It's an antidote to the love drug I 
gave you.

Ethan sweeps it on the floor, where it shatters. He starts frantically ringing the buzzer pinned to his bed.

ETHAN 
Nurse! Nurse!

SELENA
You can't escape from me that easily. I'm afraid 
you don't know who I am.

	ETHAN
Nurse!

	SELENA
Don't think I'm weak, just because I'm a woman. I have 
Power. Give in, stop fighting me, Ethan. I always get 
what I want.

ETHAN 
Nurse! Help !

The door opens and a NURSE walks in.

					NURSE
				Would you stop screaming. There are sick people trying 
to sleep.

ETHAN
				Get her away from me.  She's crazy.


					NURSE 
                   (to Selena) 
Are you family? Visiting hours are over.

SELENA
				They're over for you sweetheart.

Selena removes the gargoyle-shaped box from her sleeve and opens the lid. The OMEGAHEDRON inside spins and sends out a powerful force, which slides the nurse backwards out the door and pins her to the wall of the corridor outside. The door slams shut. Selena closes the lid of the Coffer and turns to Ethan.

SELENA
				Now you see who you're dealing with.

Ethan scrambles out of the bed and away from her, backing toward the window.

ETHAN 
Leave me alone.

Selena, at the bed, discovers his sketch of Supergirl on the piece of cardboard.

					SELENA
				This is your problem, right here. This girl's driving 
you insane, Ethan. Let me help you.

	ETHAN
I don't want your help.

	SELENA
Come back to my house. My car's outside.

Selena reaches out a hand to Ethan.

					ETHAN
				No!

					SELENA
				I never met a man I couldn't have--and you're no 
different from the rest!

The door opens behind her and TWO SECURITY OFFICERS push  inside, with guns drawn.


SECURITY OFFICER
				Okay, what's going on in h--



Selena gestures with the gargoyle box at the men and their guns fly out of their hands and up to the ceiling. The men stare at the ce1ling, astonished. Ethan takes advantage of the distraction to dash out through the open door. Selena turns to look at Ethan escaping and the
guns fall to the floor and discharge. The security men run into Ethan's bathroom, slamming the door behind them.

Selena ducks out into the corridor.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

Ethan is running away down the corridor. Frightened patients peek out of their rooms. The nurse who was ejected from the room cringes in fear as Selena emerges into the corridor.

Ethan dodges past two orderlies who are pushing a HEART-LUNG MACHINE down from the surgery. Selena raises the gargoyle box and points it at the HEART-LUNG MACHINE.

SELENA
				Power of Shadow---seize him.

The HEART-LUNG MACHINE comes to life---its lights flash, its array of tubes tipped with needle probes writhe like Medusa's hair, its wheels turn around, and it chases  Ethan down the corridor. Selena laughs her deep throaty chuckle of triumph. Ethan looks behind, sees the machine chasing him and cries out with alarm. A CART OF SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS rolls out of a closet in front of him, its scalpels standing up and pointing at him, quivering eagerly, blocking his path.

Ethan dives through a swinging door to his left.

INT. OPERATING THEATRE

A team of surgeons and nurses are bent over a patient on the table. Ethan runs through in the background. The surgeons continue with their work. The heart-lung machine wheels through after him, followed by the scalpels flying through the air like a swarm of hornets.

The surgical team doesn't look up from their work.

Several cylinders of anesthetic gas tear themselves loose from the wall and trundle away out of the room after Ethan and the other apparatus. One of the nurses finally looks up.

NURSE
				Doctor, I think you' re going to have a gas 
problem.

	DOCTOR
I shouldn't have had the cabbage at lunch.




INT. X-RAY ROOM

Ethan bursts into an empty surgical X-Ray room---the pursuing apparatus visible a few yards behind. He slams the heavy lead-lined door and bolts it shut.

He hears the thud of the apparatus beating impotently against the door. He leans against the door panting, his cotton hospital gown and robe soaked with cold sweat. Suddenly, with a whir of motors, the giant multi-armed C.A.T. SCANNER behind him comes to life, its lights glowing, and reaches out its chrome steel arms toward him.

Ethan yells, runs across the room, climbs on a gurney, rips a metal grill off the wall, and dives into the air conditioning duct.

INT. DUCT

Ethan scrambles noisily along inside the metal duct as if all the fiends of hell were after him.

INT. LUCY'S HOSPITAL ROOM

Lucy is showing off the controls of her bed. The door opens. Lucy, Jimmy and Linda look with amazement at what's outside in the corridor.

A DELIVERY BOY enters with A SPECTACULAR FLORAL ARRANGEMENT.

DELIVERY BOY 
Where you want this?

	LUCY
Over by the window. It must be from my sister. Give him 
a tip, Jimmy.

Jimmy is acutely aware how pathetic his daffodils look as he fumbles in his pocket for a dollar for the delivery boy. Suddenly overhead there is a loud banging and clattering from the air-conditioning duct. Everyone looks up at the ceiling with alarm. But Linda's X-RAY VISION lets her alone recognize Ethan.

					JIMMY
				Gosh, what do you suppose .that is?

					LINDA
				Well, Lucy, it's nice to see you're feeling better. Nice to 
meet you, Jimmy.

	LUCY
You're not gonna stay for the ice cream?

	LINDA
I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers.

	LUCY
Again? You're getting real tight with them. You're gonna 
be a straight-A student---just kidding, thanks for coming.

Her phone rings and she picks it up.

LUCY
				Phillip! When are you gonna come see me?

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

Linda walks out of Lucy's room and quickly down the corridor. Jimmy hurries to catch up with her.

JIMMY
				Can I give you a lift?

LINDA 
Oh, no thanks.

	JIMMY
It's no trouble. I'd like to ask you some more questions.

Linda's heart sinks as she realises she doesn't know how to get rid of him politely.

CUT TO:

EXT. ROOF OF HOSPITAL SUNSET

Ethan batters the top off a ventilator and crawls out onto the roof. He turns and quickly replaces the aluminum top, bashing it firmly closed with his fist. He straightens up, sweat-soaked, bedraggled, haggard and exhausted, looking like an escaped lunatic with his disheveled hair and his torn hospital robe. He heaves a sigh of relief, and turns to see Selena standing behind him, her silk cape billowing in the breeze.

SELENA
				Give up?

Ethan  takes a beat to make sure he's not hallucinating, then he summons new reserves of strength and runs over to the TALL BRICK SMOKESTACK from the hospital's incinerator.

ETHAN
				Never! 

He starts to climb up the steel ladder on the side of the chimney.

					SELENA
				What goes up must come down.

EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE. SUNSET

Jimmy opens the door of his car for Linda. It's parked in the ambulance zone, right behind 
Selena's Cadillac.

JIMMY
I probably would've got a ticket without this press pass 
on the windshield. Does Clark get many tickets?

Linda pauses, looking up at the sky.

LINDA 
      (distractedly)
I wouldn't know. Look. Up in the sky.

Jimmy follows the direction of her gaze.

INSERT. THEIR P. O . V. OF THE ROOF

Ethan clings to the iron ladder on the side of the chimney, his robe fluttering in the wind.

BACK TO SCENE

JIMMY 
An escaped wacko! What a picture!

Jimmy opens the trunk of his car, takes out his camera bag, removes his Nikon, and starts fumbling around trying to change his 50mm lens for a telephoto. Linda watches Ethan with an expression of growing concern on her face.

EXT. ROOF OF HOSPITAL 

SELENA
				Come down from there, you foo1...

EXT. LADDER ON.THE SIDE OF THE CHIMNEY

Although she is forty feet below him, Ethan hears her voice as though it were inches away from his ear.

SELENA
      (continuing)
...before you get blown off and kill yourself.

Ethan is so surprised at hearing her voice so close that he looks around with a start, misses his footing, and nearly falls off the ladder.

EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRY.  JIMMY'S CAR

Jimmy gasps with anguish, as he struggles to mount his telephoto lens, dropping lens caps, film boxes, and filters all over the place.

LINDA 
Someone's chasing him.

	JIMMY
Say---you think that's the same guy who was in the 
accident with Lucy?

LINDA
				Yes.

					JIMMY
				The scoop of the year!

He starts shooting film. His motor drive whirrs.

EXT. HOSPITAL ROOF

SELENA
				It'll be dark soon. And cold. Come down while you've 
got the chance.

EXT. TOP OF CHIMNEY

Ethan reaches the top of the chimney. He climbs over the lip of the brickwork and stands up, half hidden in the thick white smoke belching from the chimney.

ETHAN
				No. She'll come for me. Like she did the last time. 
My angel. 

He starts to cough from the smoke and nearly loses his balance.

EXT. ROOF OF HOSPITAL

SELENA
				She's not coming for you. I killed her. She's dead.

EXT. TOP OF CHIMNEY

Ethan is staggered by this news. He reacts as though he had been punched in the gut.

ETHAN
				No. I don't believe you. It's not true. She's alive 
somewhere. My angel. My love--


He falls off the chimney, and catches himself on the lip of the brickwork. He hangs there by 
one hand.

SELENA'S VOICE 
You idiot!

EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE. JIMMY'S CAR

Jimmy runs out of film. He frantically rips off the magazine and tries to load a fresh one, while Ethan dangles.

					JIMMY
				There goes my Pulitzer Prize.

Linda steps around to the other side of his car. Bianca is staring up at the chimney from the driver's seat of the Cadillac. She doesn't see Linda lift up a sewer grating with her toe and drop noiselessly and suddenly out of sight into the storm drain below.

EXT. ALLEY BEHIND HOSPITAL

A red and blue streak bursts upwards out of another storm drain. The iron cover flips off and lands with a clang as Supergirl flies skyward toward the roof.

EXT. TOP OF CHIMNEY

Ethan's grip fails and he falls.

EXT. CHIMNEY. SKY

Supergirl appears, snatches Ethan in mid-air, and flies off with him into the clouds above.

EXT. ROOF OF HOSPITAL

Selena reacts with relief---then, realizing who has saved him, her face clouds with resentment.

EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRY

Jimmy Olsen's magazine pops open and film unspools out of his camera as his motor drive whirrs.

JIMMY
Darn!

He turns to Bianca, who is looking up in the sky from beside the Cadillac.

JIMMY
				Hey lady, did you see that?

Bianca gives him a glance of contempt.

BIANCA
				See what?

					JIMMY
				The girl---dressed like Superman--caught that guy in 
mid-air.

	BIANCA
Really? Maybe you should check into the hospital and 
have your head examined.

EXT. HIGH IN THE AIR ABOVE THE HOSPITAL. SUNSET

Supergirl carries Ethan beside her, her arm tight around his upper chest, his arm over her shoulders. They are above the clouds bathed in the rich warm glow of sunset. He looks at her ecstatically, his eyes drunk with love.

ETHAN
				You're alive! She didn't kill you! 

					SUPERGIRL 
Who didn't?

	ETHAN
That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because 
she knows I love you.

	SUPERGIRL 
You love me?

	ETHAN
My angel. My goddess. I feel I've always loved you all my 
life. I'll die if I can't spend the rest of my life just looking 
at you, holding you in my arms... 

	SUPERGIRL
We have to have a long talk about all this.

	ETHAN
I know just the place. Hang a left at the Amalgamated Tower.

 EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRY. TWILIGHT

Selena comes striding out 'of the hospital, scowling. Jimmy Olsen notices her, and senses her 
aura of power. He drops his useless Nikon into his camera bag and starts rummaging for another camera.

BIANCA
				Home?

					SELENA
				No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a 
				monkey out of me.

					BIANCA
				      (shrewdly)
				Is it her that's bothering you--or your gardener?

Selena looks at Bianca with wounded dignity.

					SELENA
				I use men, but I'm not addicted to them. I can quit 
whenever I want.

She gets in the back seat of the car, just as Jimmy Olsen snaps a photo of her with a Polaroid. Selena slams the car door and Bianca drives off. Jimmy examines the instant photo he just took. His eyes widen with wonder and the hair prickles on the back of his neck as he sees the image.

INSERT: THE POLAROID IN JIMMY'S HAND. THE PICTURE OF SELENA ENTERING HER CAR, BUT BEHIND HER THERE IS A HIDEOUS LOOMING SHADOW---MUCH LARGER THAN WHEN NIGEL SHOWED IT TO HER.

CUT TO:

EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK. NIGHT

The park is deserted, in darkness. One by one the lights come on, outlining a1l the structures in jewel-like, fairyland colours. It looks strangely familiar. On some deep level there is a resemblance to Argo City.

THE CAMERA PANS over to reveal Ethan standing beside the huge fairground switch boxes, turning on the lights. Supergirl stands beside him.

ETHAN
				This is my favourite place in the city.

					SUPERGIRL
				Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?

					ETHAN
				They don't care, they're tearing it down for a 
shopping centre.

He flips the last switch, which starts the Ferris wheel revolving slowly, like a great spiral galaxy in space. Soft music plays.

ETHAN
				Like it?

					SUPERGIRL
				Yes. It reminds me of home.

					ETHAN
Where Superman's from? Krypton?

	SUPERGIRL
No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of 
Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.

	ETHAN
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

	SUPERGIRL
It's not important. The important thing is I'm here to 
find something and I think you can he1p me.

	ETHAN
Come on, let's ride.

They walk to the slowly revolving Ferris wheel and hop aboard one of the gondola cars.

ETHAN
				I used to work here summers when I was a kid.
				
SUPERGIRL
				Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.

					ETHAN
				Let's talk about us, not her.

					SUPERGIRL
				Tell me where I can find her.

					ETHAN
				I don't want you to go near her. She's bad news.
			


Ethan puts his arm around her shoulders, casually, no big deal.

SUPERGIRL
				But be reasonable. If I don't do something to stop her 
she'll try again. And maybe hurt you.

	ETHAN
I'll be safe with you. We can stay together the rest of 
our lives.

	SUPERGIRL
We can't do that.

	ETHAN
Why not ?

	SUPERGIRL
We're from different worlds.

	ETHAN
Just give me a chance to show how much I love 
you. Love changes everything. Love makes 
everything possib1e.

EXT. ENTRANCE TO AMUSEMENT PARK. NIGHT

Selena gets out of her Cadillac and walks to the chained and locked gate. A big sign says KEEP OUT. CONDEMMED PROPERTY. FUTURE SITE OF FUNFAIR MALL SHOPPING PLAZA. She mutters something under her breath and the chains fall away, the locks click open, and the gate glides noiselessly ajar. Se1ena strides in imperiously.

EXT. TOP OF FERRIS WHEEL

SUPERGIRL
				All this talk about love, it's silly.

					ETHAN
				You don't like me? You hate me?

There is such a look of tragedy on Ethan's face, that Supergirl is afraid he might instantly fling himself to his death if she said yes. 

SUPERGIRL
				Of Course I don't hate you. I  don't hate anyone.

ETHAN
				What do you feel about me?


					SUPERGIRL
				I...I don't know. This is all so sudden.

THE CAMERA RACKS FOCUS FOR A MOMENT TO DISCOVER :

Selena, lurking.be1ow them in the shadows of the Spine Snapper Ride.

ETHAN 
				There's one sure way to find out how you feel.

SUPERGIRL 
What's that?

	ETHAN 
Let me kiss you.

SUPERGIRL
				No.

					ETHAN
				You're not afraid are you?

					SUPERGIRL
				Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.

ETHAN
				If we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead.
Come on. You can learn more from one kiss than from 
years in school.

	SUPERGIRL
Well...I guess one is all right.

She closes her eyes, parts her lips, and leans forward.

SUPERGIRL 
Is this how?

	ETHAN
Terrific.

Their lips meet. Zowie.

					SELENA
				What a touching scene!

Her voice is like having a bucket of ice water dashed over you. Ethan and Supergirl pull apart. The Ferris wheel has carried them all the way around and back down again. Selena is standing beside them. Supergirl stands up and steps boldly out of the gondola to confront her.

SUPERGIRL
				Who are you ?

					SELENA
				I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both 
be sorry.

					SUPERGIRL
				I don't scare that easily.

Selena rummages down deep in her handbag and pulls out the gargoyle box.

SELENA
				All right, Miss Know-it-all. If I can't have him, 
nobody can.

She holds the gargoyle box out toward the Ferris wheel.

SELENA
				Coffer of Shadow, show your Power!

INSERT C.U. OF THE BOLTS HOLDING ETHAN'S GONDOLA TO THE FERRIS WHEEL: THE BOLTS UNSCREW AND FALL OUT.

BACK TO SCENE

Ethan yells as his gondola falls off the Ferris wheel and down onto the tent, which covers the DODGEM CARS.

INT. DODGEM CARS TENT

He falls through the tent and onto the electrified floor below. The wooden gondola shatters on impact. Ethan sits up, dazed by the fall, and sees a dodgem car painted like the face of a vicious football player heading toward him. Ethan scrambles away on his hands and knees. Another hideously painted car attacks him, and another, and another. He dodges and scuttles around desperately. Finally he manages to climb aboard one of the cars.

EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK

Supergirl reaches out to seize Selena. But Selena holds up the gargoyle box and is surrounded by an impenetrable, glowing shield of force. Supergirl tries to push through, the shield in vain.

Supergirl flies to the little fence made out of steel spikes surrounding the Haunted House. At super speed she rips up the entire line of fence posts and hurls them like javelins at Selena.



Selena dissolves her force field and tries to run away, ducking and dodging the rain of javelins. She turns too quickly and the GARGOYLE BOX slips out of her hand and rolls underneath the deck of the carousel. Selena moans with despair, and pauses, reluctant to leave without the box. This is the opportunity Supergirl needs. The fence posts bury themselves in the ground in a perfect circle around Selena---effectively imprisoning her.

SUPERGIRL
				That ought to keep you out of my hair for a while.

SELENA 
A cheap trick.

	SUPERGIRL 
Cheap but effective.

INT. DODGEM CAR TENT

Ethan is holding on to his car desperately as all the other cars viciously ram into it. Suddenly his car is lifted up, carried through a hole in the tent roof, and off into the night sky.

ETHAN
Supergirl'?

He looks under the car. There she is, carrying him to safety. She smiles reassuringly.

EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK

Selena is trapped inside the ring of posts, fumbling in her bag. One by one she takes out dried herbs, feathers, dusts, and flings them at the bars while she shouts magic word. Nothing works.

SELENA
				Yookoohoo! No, that's not it. Sis-o-reb! Nope. 
Ka-ma-hoochie!

Bianca appears out of the shadows. Selena looks up, embarrassed.

					BIANCA
				Sure glad you didn't let make a monkey of you.

					SELENA
				Shut up, and get me a hacksaw.

Bianca pauses uncertainly.

BIANCA
				Why don't you use the Coffer of Shadow?


					SELENA
                  (evasively)
I don't feel like it right now.

					BIANCA
				She didn't take it from you, did she?

					SELENA
				That little girl? Ha.  Now go on, get me some tools.

BIANCA
				There's no need. I learned the Craft from my 						grandmother.

Bianca takes out a bundle of twigs from her pocket and strokes the bars of the fence with it.

BIANCA 
Sycoraka f'kah s'koo...

The bars fall down like boiled spaghetti. Selena steps out of the circle of confinement with queenly dignity.

SELENA
				Good. Now bring the car. We must call a meeting of 
the seven.

Bianca bows.

BIANCA 
Yes, mistress.

Bianca hurries off toward the parking lot. Selena watches her until she turns the corner of the Haunted House. Then Selena kneels down and carefully reaches under the deck of the carousel for the GARGOYLE BOX.

					SELENA
				There you are. Come to mama.

She takes out the box, s1ips it inside her cloak, and stands up. She casts a last glance around the scene of her defeat, and strides off after Bianca.

CUT TO:







EXT. TROPICAL BEACH. DAY

Supergirl lands Ethan in his battered dodgem car on a beautiful, deserted tropical beach. Palm trees wave over a white sand beach. The blue ca1m of a lagoon mirrors huge white clouds that hang motipn1ess on the horizon like colossal snowy mountains. Gaily-coloured parrots screech in the branches of blooming hibiscus and jacaranda. Ethan gets out of his carnival ride and gazes around w1th awe at the beautiful scene.

SUPERGIRL
				I thought I'd show you one of my favourite places.

					ETHAN 
It's paradise . We could be very happy here.

SUPERGIRL
				But I have to go back. I brought you here so 
you'd be safe. From her.

	ETHAN
You can't just abandon me.  Alone.

His words strike a sensitive nerve in her. She relents.

SUPERGIRL 
I'll stay for a while.

Ethan is filled with enthusiasm.

ETHAN
				Great! I'II build a house-- right over there, with 
a veranda looking out to sea. And I'll plant a 
garden! Papayas, pineapples, bananas, mangoes---
anything'll grow here. And I'II fish in the lagoon, 
and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and---

	SUPERGIRL 
Ethan---when I said 'a while' I meant a couple of hours.

Ethan's face falls. He looks at her beseechingly.

SUPERGIRL
				Well, maybe a little longer than that.

She smiles and takes his hand. Together they walk along the beach.

CUT TO:



EXT. SELENA'S MANSION. NIGHT 

Rolls Royces, limos, and Maserattis parked in the driveway. It looks like a meeting of the ostentatious car club. A helicopter lands on the front lawn. The ELDERLY MAN from the garden party gets out and walks across the lawn toward the house with the aid of a cane. Behind him the helicopter takes off again. Selena opens her front door and confronts him angrily.

SELENA 
You're late.

	ELD ERL Y MAN
The President was giving a speech. I couldn't just 
walk out.

	SELENA
You're more afraid of the President than me???

	ELDERLY MAN 
No, of course not.

INT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM. CANDLELIT. NIGHT

Waiting for her are an extraordinary group of people, all of whom we met or glimpsed briefly at the garden party. Bianca is talking to ERICA, a red-haired female dwarf. A proud, barefoot AMERICAN INDIAN WOMAN in fringed doeskin is talking to a muscular, young BLACK MAN in a cashmere suit with lots of gold and diamond jewelry. NIGEL is sulking in the bar, his face covered with tannisroot ointment.

Selena enters with the Elderly Man in the banker pinstripe. They all form a circle in the centre of the room.

					SELENA
				Let us begin. I invoke the rule of seven.

OTHERS IN UNISON 
The Circle is complete.

	NIGEL
You better have a pretty good explanation for 
this, Selena.

	SELENA
We are in great danger. A being has come to Earth 
with powers far beyond those of anyone member of 
the Craft.

	INDIAN WOMAN
But Superman has been away.

	SELENA
It is not Superman I speak of, but his cousin Kara. She 
knows we exist..

	ELDERLY MAN
Then she must be destroyed.

	NIGEL 
How did she find out about us?

	ELDERLY MAN
That is unimportant. Now that she knows, she will 
become curious and learn more. When she learns 
we plan to restore the ancient religion of this planet 
and avenge the centuries of persecution---she will 
try to stop us.

	BIANCA
We must destroy her first.

	ERICA
But how can we destroy her?

SELENA
				By the Rite of Ultimate Power. One person must 
volunteer  to take on the combined power of us all.

Nigel stands up and points an accusing finger at Selena.

NIGEL
You! You want to take our power for yourself!

Selena reacts calmly, speaking in low, modulated tones, as if to an overstimulated child.

					SELENA
				Nige1, you know the one who takes on Ultimate 
Power must sacrifice the last sparks of her own spirit.

Selena takes hold of a golden chain hanging around her neck and draws out a little glass vial attached to it. Inside the glass vial a tiny spark glows brightly.

					SELENA
	 			      (continuing)
				Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?

					NIGEL
				You would! You revealed our existence so you could 
have all of our power.

	SELENA
Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, 
Nigel?

	NIGEL
Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer 
of Shadow too much.  It is beginning to rule your heart.

	SELENA
Nonsense.

Nigel pulls aside the heavy veil covering her mirror.

FOR AN INSTANT SELENA SEES HER REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR. BEHIND HER LOOMS THE DARK, EVIL PRESENCE, INVISIBLE TO THE OTHERS IN THE ROOM, AND MUCH LARGER THAN WHEN SHE GLIMPSED IT AT HER GARDEN PARTY.

Then Bianca leaps to the mirror and pulls the veil back across it. Bianca stands challenging Nigel, daring him to try again. Selena looks at the gargoyle-shaped Coffer of Shadow, sitting beside her hearth. It too seems much larger than when we last saw it at the hospital. Selena wonders for a beat if maybe Nigel is right. Can the Shadow be ruling her?

BIANCA 
Enough quibbling. Let us vote.

They all draw their sacred white-handled knives out of concealment in their clothing. Nigel defiantly places his on the floor with its blade pointing inward. Then one by one, the others put down their knives with the blades pointing outward. They all look at Nigel. His shoulders sag with dejection.

 					SELENA
				I invoke the rule of seven. Do you agree?

Nigel speaks with the voice of someone pronouncing his own death sentence. 

NIGEL
I have no choice.

His knife turns by itself on the floor until its blade points outward. Everyone joins hands in the circle. A fire springs to life on the hearth. Someone starts to chant in a strange ancient tongue. Slowly the heavy, opulent living room begins to change: the carpet becomes the floor of an ancient stone temple with dark brown stains splattered across its massive granite blocks, the walls start to melt away. Outside the windows the dark night is replaced by hot, brutal sunlight pounding down on an endless desert stretching away to the horizon.



The house completely dissolves and is replaced by monumental stone ruins. The smoky fire crackles and sends its dark plumes boiling skyward. The only thing remaining of Selena's house is the hearth and the Coffer of Shadow. Selena stands up And walks out of the centre of the circle toward the Coffer. She opens the lid. She pulls the glass vial off the golden chain 
around her neck and drops it into the Coffer.

CUT TO:

EXT. TROPICAL BEACH. DAY

Ethan wanders along the beach with Supergirl, holding hands. She stops to pick up a seashell. Ethan clutches his head as if he has a sudden violent headache, moans, and collapses on the sand. Supergirl kneels beside him.

					SUPERGIRL
				Ethan, what IS wrong?

Ethan opens his eyes and looks at her. He speaks in a voice of bleak despair.

					ETHAN
				She said it wouldn't last.

SUPERGIRL
				What wouldn't last? What's the matter with you?

Ethan sits up, wincing like someone with a bad hangover.

					ETHAN
				I don't love you any more.

SUPERGIRL 
Just like that?

	ETHAN
Like turning off a light.

He struggles to his feet and stands there unsteadily.
					
					ETHAN
				I feel awful. All that romantic garbage. All that 
mushy talk.

He lurches off into the undergrowth, toward the interior of the island. She plunges into the vegetation keeping pace with him.

SUPERGIRL 
Where are you going?


ETHAN 
Away. From you. 

	SUPERGIRL
But why?

ETHAN
				Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said.

					SUPERGIRL
				I sort of like what you said.

					ETHAN
				That makes it worse.

					SUPERGIRL
				But I don't understand.

He stops and stares at her for a moment.

					ETHAN
				Of course you don't. We're from two different 
worlds, remember?

He stalks off into the jungle, leaving her behind, hurt and bewildered.

CUT TO:

INT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM/PAGAN TEMPLE. NIGHT

A barbaric ritual. Selena's companions sway and gyrate to the sound of gongs and drums. The floor is covered with a red mist. In the middle of a column of fire a figure like Selena seems to float. The ritual reaches its climax and everything pauses for a moment of sti11ness.

Selena steps forth from the column of fire. She is clothed in a shimmering garment---white with flashing highlights of rainbow iridescence. The six other members of her group fall to their knees in awe. Selena seems to glow with an inner radiance. She laughs, and the pagan temple around her changes back to the living room of her house in Midvale. In her shining gossamer gown and her new aura of majesty, she seems too large, too powerful to be contained in the familiar surroundings of her house.

SELENA
				At last. Ultimate Power.

					BIANCA
				And the first thing we do is get rid of Supergirl!

					SELENA
				What do you mean we?

She turns on the kneeling six. They cringe from her. Selena raises her hands and the kneeling six cry out in fear.

CUT TO:

EXT. BESIDE A STREAM. TROPICAL PARADISE. DAY

Ethan is sitting beside a stream on a gravelly bank idly tossing pebbles into the water. Supergirl steps out of the jungle and watches for a moment. Then she comes and sits down beside him.

ETHAN
				Hi.

					SUPERGIRL
				Hello. Are you still mad at me?

					ETHAN
				I'm not mad at you.

					SUPERGIRL
				It seemed that way to me.

					ETHAN
				I know I was acting funny---I'm sorry. It's just...I miss it.

					SUPERGIRL 
Miss what?

ETHAN
				What I had before. What's not there now. It's like I 
woke up and found part of me wasn't there any more:
something that made me feel really alive and aware of 
things. It was like, for the first time in my life, everything 
fitted together perfectly---you and me and the world 
around us--like we were a wonderful song...

He falls silent, and tosses a few pebbles into the stream.

SUPERGIRL
				And now?

					ETHAN
				And now...the guitars are out of tune, and the words 
don't make sense, and somebody unplugged the mike...



	SUPERGIRL
Well...I don It know much about these things, but maybe 
if you had that feeling once...it can, come back. 

He turns to her hopefully.

					ETHAN 
You think so?

	SUPERGIRL 
I don't see why not.

	ETHAN
But what if---it wasn't real? 

SUPERGIRL
				Feelings are real. Once you've had them, they're yours 
forever.

Ethan's face lights up. The future begins to exist for him again.

					ETHAN
				Hey, listen, when all this blows over, maybe we 
could get together every now and then and see each 
other. And maybe something might. happen again. 
What do you think?

	SUPERGIRL
Are you asking me for a "date"?

ETHAN
				Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm---
available.

	SUPERGIRL
Aren't you forgetting about Selena?

	ETHAN
She'll forget about us eventually.

							CUT TO:

INT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM

In the polished surface of her mirror, Selena makes a scene appear: Ethan and Supergirl on the tropical island.



SUPERGIRL
      (image)
There's something very dangerous about her. Something evil...

	ETHAN
        (image)
I know what it is. She has this lead container shaped 
like a gargoyle. Inside there's a silvery ring...

CUT TO:

EXT. TROPIAL ISLAND

Supergirl becomes very excited.

					SUPERGIRL
				That's the Power Source that was lost from Argo 
City! That's what I came: to find! Where does she live? 

	ETHAN
In this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better 
stay away from there.

	SUPERGIRL
I can see through walls. I could surprise her. The only 
thing I can't see through is lead, that's why I didn't 
see the Power Source at the amusement park.

She stands up.

					ETHAN
				Wait. Don't leave me.

SUPERGIRL
				You'll be safe here. I'll come back as soon as I have 
the Power Source.

He stands up and takes her hand.

ETHAN 
Before you go...

	SUPERGIRL
What?

	ETHAN 
Just one kiss. For old times' sake.


	SUPERGIRL
And you can see how you feel about me, right?

	ETHAN
Yes.

She closes her eyes and parts her lips. Slowly their lips come together and touch. Then a sudden rush of sheer desire flows through them and the simple experimental kiss become an ecstatic prelude to the heights of lovemaking. But before either one of them can go one step further, ETHAN DISAPPEARS WITH A FLASH OF BLINDING WHITE LIGHT. A cloud darkens the sun, and the trees are lashed into a frenzy by gale-force winds. Selena's laughter can be heard from somewhere far away.

					SUPERGIRL
				Ethan!

Supergirl flies into the air.

EXT. TROPICAL ISLAND. SUNSET. SKY ABOVE ISLAND. DAY

Supergirl flies around the island very fast at high speed, searching for Ethan and Selena. She hovers like an eagle for a moment, then speeds straight upwards.

EXT. ABOVE THE OCEAN. DAY

Supergirl flies back to North America, faster than she has ever flown before.

EXT. ABOVE MIDVALE. DAY

Supergirl zeros in on Selena's house like an exocet.

EXT. SELENA'S FRONT LAWN

Supergirl lands and walks cautiously up to the front door, ready for anything but what she finds: the front door is ajar. She pushes it open with a creak of its massive hinges. She walks slowly inside.

INT. SELENA'S MANSION. FRONT HALL/LIVING ROOM

Supergirl looks around. The house seems deserted and drastically neglected. Cobwebs hang over everything. The dust has the thickness of a hundred years. Moths have eaten away all the splendid tapestries. Rats cavort along the baseboards. Bats sleep in the chandeliers. In the living room Supergirl finds Bianca crouched in A Corner, gibbering mindlessly. Bianca too has changed: she is dressed in rags, and her wild staring eyes are rimmed with dark circles. When she sees Supergirl she cries with fright.

SUPERGIRL
				Hey take it easy. I won't hurt you.

BIANCA
				I thought .it was her, coming back. Spared me. 
But I thought. . . maybe changed her mind. 
Nigel warned us. Wouldn't listen to him.

	SUPERGIRL
What are you talking about? Where's Selena?

BIANCA
				No. Don't want to know. She's bad. Don't go near her.
				Hurt you.

SUPERGIRL 
I have to find her. Tell me.

Supergirl looks into Bianca's eyes with her calm, heroic gaze, and Bianca comes somewhat to her senses. Bianca points to the adjoining bar. Supergirl walks over warily and sees FIVE GOLDEN CAGES suspended among the bottles. Nigel and the four remaining members of the Circle are imprisoned in them, shrunken but alive. Nige1 is in a perpetually turning squirrel wheel. He sees her and calls out.

NIGEL
				Supergirl! She's waiting for you. On Taliesen Mountain. 
Stop her before it's too late!

Supergirl gets a look of determination on her face. She turns and flies out through the French doors and heads straight up into the air.

INT. SELENA'S NEW HOUSE (A MOUNTAIN-TOP PALACE) 

Ethan is in a dark, shadowy place, bound to a stake with stout cords. Sticks of wood are piled all around his feet. Selena stands beside him in her shining gown of power. She looks even more gorgeous and cruel than before. She offers him a glass of water to drink, but he turns his head away violently.

					ETHAN
				I'm wise to your tricks, lady.

					SELENA
				I could force you.

					ETHAN
				If that worked, you would've done it already. No, 
you want me to drink it of my own free will. Well 
let me tell you, sweetheart, it'll be a cold day in hell 
before I fall for that one again.

	SELENA
Go on,  talk big! I'll soon have you purring like a kitten.


She puts the glass of water in a, basket at the end of an iron chain hanging down from above. There is a straw in the glass at such an angle that Ethan can just reach it with his lips if he stretches as far as possible.

SELENA
				You've been without water for a whole day. Let's 
see how thirsty you get in a week.

	ETHAN 
You vicious--

	SELENA
Careful, don't make me angry. I start fires when I'm angry.


She glances meaningfully at the faggots piled around his feet and walks away.

THE CAMERA FOLLOWS HER revealing that she has been talking to Ethan inside the mammoth fireplace of her living room. Her new house is enormous. Where before she lived in a mansion, now she dwells in a palace. The fireplace is seven feet high, the living room floor is wide as a football field, and. the French windows into the garden now tower like the windows in the North transept of Chartres Cathedral. Selena disappears out the imposing portals which lead to the wet bar and butler's pantry--each now the size of a basketball court.

Back in the fireplace, Ethan cranes his neck to make sure she has gone, then reaches out toward the glass hanging nearby. He pokes the straw with his forehead. The glass swings slightly. The glass swings close enough for him to bump it with his forehead and set up a rhythm. He gauges the swing of the glass and, at the precise moment, grabs for it with his mouth. He catches hold of the rim of the glass with his teeth and holds it there for a moment as he summons his courage to do what must be done. He bites hard on the rim of the glass with his teeth.

The glass shatters and falls to the floor with a crash, leaving Ethan with a small fragment of the rim in his mouth and a trickle of blood down his chin. He leans his head over until it is directly above his left hand tied to the stake two and a half feet below his shoulders. A droplet of blood falls into his hand. He drops the glass fragment down to his hand and catches it. He grins, and sighs with relief. Then spits to clear his mouth. Slowly he saws. at the ropes that hold him with the sliver of glass in his left hand. One by one the strands part.

Ethan strains against his bonds and the weakened rope snaps. He quickly disentangles himself from the coils and steps out of the fireplace. He looks around the mammoth room. The coast is clear. He spits a few bits of glass out of his mouth, and dashes out of the doors
to the garden.




EXT. SELENA'S HOUSE. GARDEN.  CONSERVATORY

Ethan sees a green plastic garden hose, which the gardener has left running in a trickle to irrigate the hydrangeas. Ethan remembers that he is very thirsty. He picks up the hose, rinses out his mouth hurriedly, and then takes long, desperate gulps of the water. Behind him he hears Selena's laughter. He drops the hose as if stung by an electric eel and turns to see her emerge from behind a large strangler fig.

INSERT ETHAN'S P.O.V.

The same effect as when he drank the love potion the first time. The plants of the conservatory swirl and distort in garish nightmare colours. At the centre of his vision is an area of crystal clarity surrounding Selena. She approaches him seductively, fully confident of her power. As she comes nearer, the clear area expands and drives out the visual chaos. Selena speaks, and her voice is a close-miked throaty purr.

SELENA
				I told you I'd win.

BACK TO SCENE

Ethan is held by the spell of her magic. And yet there is part of him that still resists. You can see him try to turn his head away from the vision of ideal beauty before him, and then give in as she comes closer and I touches him with her hand. A zap of energy passes between them at her touch.

SELENA
				Kiss me.
	
He embraces her roughly and crushes her lips with a kiss. He is filled with a tigerish lust that thrills her deeply. She rakes her long red fingernails across his back and moans with pleasure.

EXT. ABOVE THE MOUNTAINS. DAY

Supergirl flies over the Rockies toward Selena's house.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. TALIESEN MOUNTAIN. SELENA'S NEW HOUSE. DAY

Supergirl flies over Selena's new house. For the first time we can see the enormousness of it: 
a grotesque, towering monstrosity, that seems to brood threateningly over the landscape.

EXT. GARDEN BEHIND SELENA'S NEW HOUSE. DAY

Supergirl lands and walks toward the towering French doors of the living room. But something distracts her. She turns and enters the gigantic conservatory to her right.


INT. CONSERVATORY

Supergirl looks around and sees in the middle of the conservatory a reflecting pool surrounded by exotic plants. She walks closer and looks down into the reflecting pool. In the bottom of the shallow pool she sees Ethan securely bound. His eyes stare wildly. Dead or drowning.

SUPERGIRL
				Ethan!

She leaps into the shallow pool, and sinks over her head. A polygonal section of the surface of the reflecting pool detaches itself from the water and rises up perpendicularly. It is a door to the Phantom Zone. Supergirl is trapped behind an impenetrable force field, looking out in despair. Ethan is not there with her. His image has disappeared. 

The real flesh and blood Ethan appears with Selena from behind the strangler fig. They look in at Supergirl trapped behind the shimmering polygon that la ads to the Phantom Zone. Selena laughs at her, but Ethan stares as if at a long forgotten acquaintance whose name he is trying to recall.

Selena notices Ethan's wandering attention and she puts her arms possessively around him.

SELENA
				Enjoy your prison, Supergirl. It's forever.

Supergirl calls out to Ethan, her hands and face pressed against the transparent wall of her prison, but no sound can escape the impenetrable force field.

INT. PHANTOM ZONE DOOR

Supergirl is seen in reverse, beating on the hard crystalline surface of the prison.

SUPERGIRL
				Ethan! Don't let her do this!

Beyond the threshold of the zone, Selena in her conservatory kisses Ethan with fierce lust. He returns her , emotion, forgetting all about Supergirl.

SUPERGIRL
No. No. It isn't true.

The image of Selena and Ethan begins to recede, getting smaller and smaller, until it vanishes entirely in infinite blackness.

EXT. SPACE

The flat two-dimensional polygon that is Supergirl's prison whirls away through space. Behind the transparent surface we can see Supergirl's face stained with tears.

EXT. PHANTOM ZONE 

Another kind of reality. Unlike anything we have ever seen. The crystal prison lands on the ground of the Phantom Zone and shatters. Supergirl picks herself up from among the fragments of her prison and looks around. The landscape is utterly strange and alien, with a feel of stark, oppressive sterility. As far as the eye can see there is no sign of life. Supergirl stands up and raises her arms to fly. She hops into the air about eight inches and lands flat-footedly on the sand. With a shock she realises SHE CAN'T FLY.

She hops a few more times, with no more success.

She picks up a small rock from the ground. She tries to crush it in her hand. She can't. Angrily she hurls it from her as far as she can. Instead of disappearing into infinity it drops at her feet a few yards away. She scoops up some sand from the ground and holds it cupped in her hand. She takes a deep breath and tries to blow it away. She is barely able to disturb a few grains. She drops the sand and sits down on a rock, forlorn and dejected.

Suddenly she hears Alura's voice, very faint and coming from a long distance away.

 ALURA'S VOICE 
Kara, where are you?

	KARA
Mother? I can hardly hear you.

	ALURA. S VOICE
Kara! You're alive. We were so worried. You disappeared 
from the scanners...

KARA
				I'm lost, Mother. In some awful place. I can't fly anymore. 
And I'm weak.

	ALURA'S VOICE
Kara, you must not give up. We must retrieve the 
Power Source. The City is dying.

					KARA
				Then send someone else. I failed.

					ALURA'S VOICE
				We can't. The' dimension barrier is stronger. We no 
longer have the power to push through.

KARA
				But Mother, I'm lost. 

					ALURA' S VOICE 
You must try. . . it's cold. And dark. . .

The rest of her sentence fades out, and is lost. 

KARA 
Mother---I tried. I really tried.

Kara puts her face in her hands and starts to sob hopelessly.

CUT TO:

EXT. UNITED NATIONS, NEW YORK. DAY

Establishing shot. 

INT. GENERAL ASSEMBLY

The DELEGATE FROM URITANIA is going on (in Esperanto) denouncing the latest outrage against his peace-loving country. A few bored DELEGATES of various nationalities
are sprawled in their seats listening to the simultaneous translation over earphones. The dign1fied PRESIDENT of the General Assembly is sitting on the dais behind the ranting delegate. With a FLASH OF LIGHT and a chok1ng cloud of sulfur fumes, Selena appears beside the podium. She is in her shimmering white robe. The dozing delegates wake up with amazement. The URITANIAN delegate stares at her with his mouth open as she slides him away from the microphone. 

INT.  TRANSLATOR"S BOOTH . GENERAL ASSEMBLY

Inside the translator's booth, the entire panorama of the enormous hall is visible through the glass window. The eight TRANSLATORS stop translating and stare at the scene below.

BACK TO GENERAL ASSEMBLY

Selena is about to speak in the microphone, when two SECURITY GQUARDS attempt to step onto the podium. Selena reaches out toward them. A field of force from her hands stops them in their tracks, knocking them backwards off the steps to land on their butts. The delegates gasp at this act of magical violence.

SELENA
				Nations of the world! I bring you tidings of a new age!

The President of the General Assembly starts to shout at her and bang on the podium with his gavel. Selena looks over her shoulder with mild annoyance. Instantly the President's gavel turns into a live eel. The President drops it with horror. Selena continues her speech.

SELENA
				I bring you a return to the ancient true worship of 
Nature, our Sovereign Queen and Mother. And 
I bring you myself as her representative here 
on Earth.

The URITANIAN suddenly recovers his wits and tries to place a hand on Selena's shoulder. A whirlwind hurls him off the podium into the desks of the front row delegates. The delegates babble in consternation but keep to their seats. Selena raises her voice to be heard over the uproar.

SELENA
				From this moment forth, all science, religion and other
				unnatural beliefs are forbidden. And in their place I 
will teach the One True Way of our ancient 
grandmothers.

The President of the General Assembly has recovered enough from the surprise of the eel to 
interrupt Selena.

					PRESIDENT
				You are talking about the end of Civilisation as we 
know it.

	SELENA
And it's about time too.

	PRESIDENT
I do not know who you are, or what evil force 
you represent, but it will take more than a
few threats from you to make mankind turn back 
the clock and abandon thousands of years of progress.

Selena has listened with a mocking smile as he speaks. He finishes to a smattering of applause from some of the delegates.

SELENA
				Threats? I don't need threats to destroy civilisation. 
I have something better.

She snaps her fingers in the air. Immediately a RAIN OF MONEY BEGINS TO FALL ALL OVER THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY. PAPER MONEY AND COINS OF ALL NATIONS. Selena looks at her work with pleasure. Then she disappears in a FLASH OF LIGHT.

The delegates blink with astonishment. The only trace of her presence is the tang of sulfur in the air---and the money. One delegate forgets his dignity and starts scooping up money from his desk and stuffing it into his pockets. Suddenly all the delegates are doing the same thing. The only exception is the delegate from the United Kingdom who thinks it might be beneath his dignity, and looks about with mild disapproval.

CUT TO:



EXT. THE PHANTOM ZONE

Supergirl walks across the rolling monotony of the Phantom Zone. We have never seen her like this before: sweating, her hair unkempt, streaks of dirt and grit on her face, exhausted and full of despair. She stumbles at the crest of a low ridge and falls down to the bottom of the slope, banging her head on a rock. She sits there, a big rip in her ,uniform, rubbing her bruised forehead. It is hard to imagine her any worse off.

She hears a sound, vaguely familiar. She looks around for its source. She follows the sound, crawling slowly along the base of the ridge. The sound gets louder and as she, approaches. It is a sound of celestial, spiritual beauty: the music of the spheres.

Suddenly she comes out into a tiny valley in the Phantom Zone and sees before her the most beautiful sight she could imagine. The harsh monochromatic sterility of the Phantom Zone gives way to a riot of bright colours. A dome-like building protrudes from the ground. All around it are gorgeous singing sculptures in the style of Argo City. A sculptor. in the clothing of Argo City is modeling a glassy statue with a matterwand. He turns and catches sight of Supergirl. It is Zaltar.

SUPERGIRL
				Zaltar.

Zaltar drops his wand and comes running over to Supergirl. He kneels beside her on the sandy ground.

ZALTAR
				Kara? Is it you?

Supergirl nods. She is obviously exhausted. Zaltar takes the bulb full of liquid off his belt and offers her a drink. She drinks thirstily of the refreshing green liquid, and feels strength returning to her body.

SUPERGIRL 
What is this place?

	ZALTAR
This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you 
come here from Argo City?

	SUPERGIRL 
I was on Earth...

	ZALTAR
Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?

	SUPERGIRL
Yes. I went there to find the lost Power Source...


	ZALTAR 
Shouldnt've done that.

	SUPERGIRL
...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me 
to the Phantom Zone.

	ZALTAR
It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can 
unleash all sorts of terrible forces---

	SUPERGIRL
I know.

	ZALTAR
Well, nothing we can do about it. Come into my house. 
You can stay with me, until I build you your own 
place. I expect you won't want to mix with the others--
not our type of people.

He helps her to her feet and over to his house, a sort of Argonian gothic cathedral half-buried in the sand. The curves of the arches and the materials are strongly reminiscent of Zaltar's work on Argo City.

					SUPERGIRL
				Others?

					ZALTAR
				Criminals.

Zaltar gestures vaguely to the horizon on his right.

					ZALTAR
				A few hundred parasangs that way. I avoid 
them. And you should too.

Zaltar leads Supergirl past the singing sculptures. She smiles as she passes them, and remembers his "tree" in Argo City.

SUPERGIRL 
...mid pleasures and palaces though I may roam..."

	ZALTAR 
What? Palace? Hardly.

	SUPERGIRL
Just feels, a little, like a tiny bit of Argo City...


ZALTAR
				Yes. Can't seem to get away from that style. 
Must try something new.

INT. ZALTAR'S HOUSE

He helps her down a long spiraling staircase to the floor of a high domed room. In the centre of the room is a huge round table cluttered with tools, models and unfinished projects.

SUPERGIRL 
It's lovely. . .

	ZALTAR
No, no. Not lovely. 'Perfect'. Did everything 
just right. Nobody telling you to change this, 
move that around. Please yourself. That's 
the secret of happiness.

	SUPERGIRL
Are you happy, Zaltar?

ZALTAR
				What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do 
whatever I want. All the time.

	SUPERGIRL
But what about other people? Don't you miss them?

They have reached the ground floor. Zaltar plucks one of the liquid filled bulbs from the stem of a large plant growing in a niche in the wall. He squirts some of the green liquid in his mouth with great satisfaction.

					ZALTAR
				I look at them all the time. Every planet in the galaxy. 
It's quite boring. Here, rub some of this onto that bruise.

He carefully applies some of the green liquid to the wound on her scalp.

SUPERGIRL
				You look at them? How?

					ZALTAR
				The Phantom Zone overlooks everywhere.. If you 
have the right tools.

Zaltar sweeps the clutter off the table and onto the floor.



He passes his hand over the table and instantly the table turns into a WINDOW INTO ANOTHER WORLD, showing an image of a herdboy riding on the back of a water buffalo in a rice paddy.

ZALTAR
				There you see? What could be more boring than that?

He waves his hand, and the image disappears.

SUPERGIRL
				Wait. Could...could I see the place I just came from?

Zaltar sighs with great martyrdom, and starts to fiddle with his controls.

					ZALTAR
				It'll only make you sad. 

He shows her the proper hand gestures to control the image.

					ZALTAR
				This goes closer. This moves it around. And 
this begins.

He gestures with his hand and the WINDOW OPENS again. Supergirl ZOOMS THE IMAGE IN as fast as she can, trembling with desperate urgency. The IMAGE ON THE TABLE DISSOLVES FROM HIGH ABOVE A CITY DOWN TO :

EXT. WALL STREET.  DAY

The financial district. Bank clerks are shoveling money out the windows of several large, imposing banks. Passersby ignore the bonanza, and trudge dejectedly on.

INT. STOCK EXCHANGE. DAY

Chaos and pandemonium on the floor. Not the everyday chaos and pandemonium you always see. Brokers are trying to strangle one another. Fist fights. Bloody noses. The crunch of breaking knuckles.

EXT. SUPERMARKET.  DAY

People are waiting in line with wheelbarrows full of money. The store manager shakes his head and sends them away. The only people he lets in the store are a man with a live turkey under his arm, a little old lady carrying a Rembrandt in a nice gold frame, a woman who gives him her fur coat and a man with an antique clock.





EXT. HIGH ABOVE SELENA'S NEW HOUSE. TALIESEN MOUNTAIN.  DAY

The CAMERA ZOOMS DOWN and DISSOLVES THROUGH THE ROOF TO:

INT. ANTE ROOM IN SELENA'S NEW HOUSE

A mob of dignitaries and petitioners is waiting anxiously outside the large imposing doors to Selena's reception room. Generals in uniform, diplomats wearing their medals pinned ,on their formal suits, bankers in pin stripes, and the robed ecclesiastics and holy men of various faiths. A secretary opens the door to the reception room, and the dignitaries all surge forward.

					SECRETARY
				No more audiences today. Go home. All 
of you.

Through the open door Selena can be glimpsed sitting .on her throne-like chair, with Ethan kneeling at her feet, resting his head in her lap like  a pet animal.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. SELENA'S SITTING ROOM

The secretary closes the doors leaving Ethan and Selena alone. She strokes his head. Outside crowds can be heard chanting her name: "Selena! Selena!"

SELENA
				They want me. Doesn't it make you proud?

					ETHAN
				Yeah.

Selena gets up and walks over to the door leading out to her balcony.

SELENA
				Coming?

Ethan follows her sullenly.

EXT. BALCONY

They walk out onto the balcony. The crowds scream her name. She waves smiling. Ethan stands a step behind her with a moody expression on his face.

					SELENA
				Smile, lunk-head. You're not a gardener any more, 
you're Prince Ethan now.

Ethan lifts his hand and waves half-heartedly.

EXT. GROUNDS OF SELENA'S NEW HOUSE.  BENEATH THE BALCONY

The crowd is enormous, held back behind police barricades. Guards in the special livery of Selena's service hold back the surging tide of humanity: people .praying, chanting, walking on their knees, cripples on crutches, the ailing on stretchers carried by relatives. And in front a disciplined youth group in a distinctive costume perform chants and fanatic cheers. Huge banners display Selena's portrait. Images of her are everywhere.

INT. ZALTAR'S HOUSE. PHANTOM ZONE

Supergirl reels with shock at the scene 

SUPERGIRL 
That horrible woman!

	ZALTAR
Told you. Wouldn't listen to me. Knew it would 
make you sad.

He starts to gesture the image away, but she puts her hand on his arm, stopping him.

SUPERGIRL
				No. I have to see this.

Zaltar shrugs.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. HAMBURGER HEAVEN. MIDVALE. DAY

The roadside complex where Lucy's traffic accident occurred. The Hamburger Place is boarded up. The area is almost deserted and no cars pass on the street. All of the huge advertising billboards along the way are now covered with pictures of Selena. The only writing is in mystic symbols. A lone figure walks furtively along the street. It is LUCY LANE, her face disguised with dark glasses. She goes to the rear of the abandoned Hamburger Place and knocks four times. The door opens quickly and she ducks inside.

INT. HAMBURGER HEAVEN. DAY

The restaurant has been converted into a clandestine print shop. A few serious teenagers are working the press and turning out seditious handbills. Freshly printed pages are hung on clothes-lines so the ink can dry. "THE TRUTH ABOUT SELENA" is the headline over JIMMY'S PHOTO of her getting into the Cadillac with her huge shadow looming behind. Lucy crosses to Jimmy Olsen, who is tying up bundles of handbills.

LUCY
				I had to dump the papers in a trashcan. The Danvers 
have been arrested!

					JIMMY
				How do you know?

					LUCY
				I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.

					JIMMY 
Did anybody notice you?

	LUCY
I can't help it if men notice me.

	JIMMY
Lucy! Be serious. We could be executed for  treason!

She kisses him on the nose.

LUCY 
Just kidding. Nobody saw me.

Jimmy gives her another bundle of handbills. HELMETED GUARDS in the livery of Selena's service kick down the door. and rush in, weapons drawn. They smash up the print shop and arrest everybody. Jimmy and Lucy are handcuffed and dragged away.

INT. PRISON

The Danvers and all the teenagers from the print shop are crowded into tiers of barred cells set into the walls of a dark, enormous cavern. Jimmy and Lucy huddle together for warmth in one of the tiny cells.

JIMMY
				I sure wish Superman was around. He wouldn't 
let any of this go on. Not for one minute.

	LUCY
I wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.

JIMMY
				I heard stories.  I don't think you wanna know.

There is the clank of an iron door, and Ethan enters the prison with several of the guards in Selena's livery. He walks past the cells, glancing now and then with compassion at the poor wretches inside. Lucy calls out as he passes.

LUCY 
Hey! Ethan!

	ETHAN
Hmmm?

LUCY
				Remember me? We were in a disaster together.

					ETHAN .
				Oh yeah, the girl in the hospital, on the other stretcher.

					LUCY
				Right! Say, do you swing any weight around here?

					ETHAN
				A little.

					LUCY
				Can you get us out? It's all a misunderstanding. We 
thought they were selling hamburgers in that place.

	ETHAN
I'll mention it upstairs.

He turns to go, but Jimmy reaches out and grabs his sleeve.

					JIMMY
				The blonde girl who saved your life---where 
is she now?

Ethan pauses. Buried memories rise to the surface of his mind, bringing pain.

ETHAN
				She's gone. No one will ever see her again.

CUT TO:

INT. ZALTAR'S HOUSE IN THE ZONE

Supergirl waves her hand over the table angrily, decisively. The WINDOW of the Zone closes, and the image of Ethan disappears. She crosses to Zaltar, who is reclining on a couch in an adjoining room, getting drunk on the green liquid from the plant bladders.

SUPERGIRL 
Zaltar, please help me.

	ZALTAR
Of course, my dear. What can I do?

	SUPERGIRL
Help me to get back to Earth. Where my friends are. 
They need me.

Zaltar looks pained, and takes several deep drinks of green plant sap before he answers.

					ZALTAR
				There's no way out of the Zone. No one's ever escaped. 
That's why they send the criminals here.

SUPERGIRL
				If there's a way in, there must be a way out.

					ZALTAR
				No, that's not true---there's well...no--

He suddenly has an idea, vaguely forming at the back of his drink-sodden brain. He toys with it, while Supergirl leans forward eagerly, waiting. He changes his mind several times about whether it's possible or not, each time changing his facial expression. Supergirl has the feeling she's watching a debate conducted by squints and grimaces.

ZALTAR 
There is a way.

	SUPERGIRL 
I knew it!

	ZALTAR
But it's impossible.

	SUPERGIRL
Why?

	ZALTAR
No, it wouldn't work, you couldn't, it's too---
if it didn't work you'd be swept into a singularity---
no, you'd never make it. Forget I mentioned it.

Supergirl's heart sinks. She rocks back, clutching her knees, trying not to show her sadness.

					ZALTAR
				I could do it.

She is suddenly all excitement and hopefulness again.

SUPERGIRL 
Then teach me how.

	ZALTAR
No, it's no good---you can't practice--- you only get 
one go. A thing like that. No. Sure you don't want a 
sip of this? It's delicious, I think.


He takes another sip of his drink.

SUPERGIRL 
Tell me how. to do it. If you could do it, I can.

He looks at her shrewdly, appraising her abilities with a suddenly lucid glance.

ZALTAR
				Takes a long time, you know, learning the wand. 
Just begun to understand it myse1f. Give things a 
kind of life--can also take away life; works backwards 
too. Besides I can't let you take my wand. Only have 
the one, what would I do? I'd be helpless. It's 
out of the question.

	SUPERGIRL
Then come with me.

					ZALTAR
				Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?

					SUPERGIRL
				You could do anything. You could sculpt 
mountain ranges...draw with rainbows! 
You'd have superpowers.

	ZALTAR
 Superpowers. Got you in a lot of trouble, didn't they?

	SUPERGIRL
Please. I have to get back to Earth. My friends are 
in trouble. And unless I bring back the Power 
Source, Argo City will die.

He looks at her kneeling beside his couch, tears streaming down her cheeks, pleading with him.

ZALTAR
Oh, all right. Stop crying. Let's go.

He stands up, takes his matterwand, and heads for the stairs up to the surface. Supergirl can hardly believe her plea has been granted. She runs after him, up the stairs.

SUPERGIRL
				You're going to take me back?

					ZALTAR
				Going to try. Didn't say I could.

EXT. ZALTAR' S HOUSE. PHANTOM ZONE

They emerge from the circular doorway out onto the flat monotonous terrain of the zone. Zaltar pauses for a moment to get his bearings, then strikes out with long energetic strides. Supergirl hurries to keep up with him.

SUPERGIRL
				I heard my mother ask you once "how could a 
man with such a selfish heart create beauty?" 
She was wrong, Zaltar, you have a generous 
heart.

	ZALTAR
Not doing this for you. Just sick of this place, 
that's all. Wretched singing sculptures, always yowling 
at you. Boring!

Supergirl scampers along beside him, smiling. Zaltar never looks back at his abandoned house, but keeps his gaze fixed on the horizon straight ahead.

INT. SELENA'S NEW HOUSE. HALLWAY

Ethan is walking down the hall and sees guards dragging Lucy Lane and Jimmy Olsen in chains. Lucy calls out to him.

LUCY
				Hey, I thought you were gonna mention us upstairs.

ETHAN
				I did.

					LUCY
				     (bitterly)
				Well thanks a pile, fella.

Ethan watches them dragged away. He has a puzzled expression on his face.

INT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM. DAY

Ethan enters. Selena is staring into her magic mirror. Her face is white with fear.

ETHAN 
What's going on?

Selena snaps irritably at him.

SELENA 
Guess! Go on.

ETHAN
				I don't know. You seem afraid.

					SELENA
				You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?

					ETHAN
				     (the truth dawns on him)
				Supergirl?

Selena doesn't answer, but looks back at the mirror. Ethan moves to her side and watches with her the IMAGE OF THE PHANTOM ZONE.

INT. PHANTOM ZONE/QUANTUM VORTEX

Zaltar leads the way, firming their path with the matterwand, and then hauling himself and Supergirl forward over an upward sloping, undulating surface. Behind them luminescent waves of energy can be seen, like the ocean at the base of a steep cliff, constantly sweeping backwards and downwards, away from their goal.

INT. SELENA'S NEW LIVING ROOM

Selena looks up and realises Ethan is behind her, looking intently at the image.

SELENA
				Quit staring so hard. You'll strain your eyes.

She puts her hand on his cheek. He turns away from the image of Supergirl and looks deep in 
Selena's eyes.

					ETHAN
				You're not going to hurt her, are you?

Selena is furious. Her eyes get that dangerous look.

SELENA
				You can't put her out of your mind, is that it?

					ETHAN
				Well...I guess I can't.

					SELENA
				I'm ready for her. I'll show you.

Selena walks out the French doors followed by the dazed Ethan.



EXT. CONSERVATORY. DAY

MR. & Mrs. Danvers, Lucy Lane, and Jimmy Olsen are imprisoned in four metal cages hanging over the reflecting pool in the conservatory. The ropes that keep the cages from falling into the pool are GIGANTIC GOLDEN SERPENTS, their tails around an overhead beam, and the jaws tightly locked on the tops of the cages. A fifth cage hangs there empty. The water in the reflecting pool has changed colour to an opaque yellow. Selena shows the arrangements to Ethan.

SELENA
				Unless Supergirl agrees to go away forever, the 
serpents will drop them one by one. 

Selena puts a small silver whistle to her lips and blows a high, melodious note. The fifth serpent opens his jaws and releases the empty cage into the pool.

INSERT: REFLECTING POOL

The empty cage lands in the water and is instantly eaten up by the most powerful acid imaginable, leaving nothing but froth and acrid fumes. Ethan looks down into the cool at his reflection distorted by the spreading ripples. 

BACK TO SCENE

ETHAN
				Why the empty cage?

SELENA
That one was for you. But I thought I'd wait and 
see how you behave when Supergirl gets here. I'd 
hate to lose you, Ethan.

Selena steps beside him and puts her hand on his shoulder. Ethan cries out with terror. Selena looks down at what he sees.

INSERT: REFLECTING POOL

Behind Selena, distorted almost beyond recognition by the ripples on the surface, is a GIANT MONSTROUS SHADOW-BEING, ITS ARMS OUTSTRETCHED, ALMOST ENVELOPING HER, but invisible except in reflections.

BACK TO SCENE

Selena steps away from the pool, shaken by the sight.

ETHAN
				What...?


					SELENA
				You don't get this far without paying...a 
certain price.

She turns and walks quickly out of the conservatory, followed by Ethan.

MR. DANVERS
				If only I hadn't made that speech denouncing her.

MRS . DANVERS
I'm not afraid to die. I'm proud of you.

She stretches out her hand through the bars and clasps his bravely. Lucy turns her face away to give them some privacy in their. final moments. Jimmy is looking at her.

					JIMMY 
       (shyly)
I've been in love with you for years. Remember 
how you used to visit your sister in the newsroom? 
And put your fingerprints on my lens.

LUCY
				Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're 
attention.

	JIMMY
You were? You mean we could've been... you-know-what...
all this time?

	LUCY 
You bet your ass.

	JIMMY
Why didn't you tell me?

	LUCY
You're supposed to guess.

She reaches out her hand through the bars and clasps his bravely, like the Danvers.

INT. THE PHANTOM ZONE/QUANTUM VORTEX

Zaltar is continuing his climb, but the way is getting steeper, and he is tired and short of breath. He pauses.

					SUPERGIRL
				Why are you stopping?


					ZALTAR
				Stopping? Was I? Silly. One thing you 
musn't do.

He continues forward, and upward, firming their path with the matterwand. The wand creates a warm circle of white light around them in contrast to the monochromatic energy field of the Phantom Zone. Because of the inherent curvature of the Phantom Zone vortex, they seem to be scrambling up a sheer vertical wall now. Supergirl is close beside Zaltar helping him along, not merely following as she had before. The throbbing sound of energy waves surging down the vortex is growing louder as they proceed. Zaltar stumbles, and drops the matterwand.

ZALTAR
				Oh dear!

The vortex starts to sweep the wand backwards, down to where they have just climbed from.  Supergirl makes a desperate lunge and retrieves the wand as it sweeps past. But now she is being swept backwards.

ZALTAR 
The wand. Use it.

Supergirl somehow finds the right grip on the controls and points the wand at the undulating surface beneath her. She stills the moving surface and stops her backwards motion.

					ZALTAR
				Good girl! That's the way!

But now Zaltar is being swept backwards toward her. She points the wand at his feet and halts his downhill slide.

					ZALTAR
				You can use the wand.

					SUPERGIRL
				Better than when I was a child.

She hands it back to him and they resume their slow upward progress.

ZALTAR
				I remember you then. Cute thing you were. Like 
your mother.

CUT TO:





INT. SELENA'S NEW LIVING ROOM

Selena stands watching the image of Zaltar and Supergirl in her mirror. Beside her on the floor is the Coffer of Shadow, now swollen to the size of a large pumpkin. It pulses and glows with inner light. The lid of the Coffer of Shadow starts to rattle as if something inside is attempting to get out.

INT. THE PHANTOM ZONE/QUANTUM VORTEX

Flaming spheres of BALL LIGHTNING begin to whizz past Zaltar and Supergirl. Zaltar is startled, and he stops his forward progress.

ZALTAR
				What's that? Never saw anything like that.

					SUPERGIRL
				Don't stop. Keep moving.

					ZALTAR 
Yes, mustn't stop.

	SUPERGIRL
       (grimly) 
 It's Selena. I'm getting so I can recognise her work.

Another flaming sphere whizzes toward them. It hits Zaltar on the shoulder and knocks him off the safe path. He starts to roll backwards down the vortex.


SUPERGIRL 
Zaltar. Use the wand!

ZALTAR
				Too late. Too late. Save yourself.

He is being swept faster and .faster away from her, receding like the image of Ethan when she was trapped in the zone. Zaltar throws the wand to her, and then is swept away, out of sight, downward to his death. He calls out after he disappears.

ZALTAR 
  				       (voice over) 
Goodbye...

	SUPERGIRL
Zaltar!

She begins to be swept backwards, but she uses the wand, and stops her slide. Gripping the wand fiercely, she starts to forge ahead. All the while she has to dodge the flaming spheres that Selena sends down the vortex.

SUPERGIRL
				You're not going to win, Selena. I won't let you.

Suddenly Supergirl enters another area of the vortex. She begins to move forward, upward, without clawing her way. She accelerates, moving faster and faster.

EXT. GRASSY MEADOW BESIDE A POND

Supergirl lands, in a deserted sunny meadow. She collapses sobbing on the grass. The matterwand lies beside her.

SUPERGIRL
				Zaltar, Zaltar. You never had a selfish heart.

She looks up at the sun shining down serenely, bathing the Earth in its life-giving rays---and returning her superpowers to her.

SUPERGIRL
				Wherever you are, Zaltar, thank 'you.  

She stands up and flexes her muscles. She no longer looks tired or disheveled. Her red and blue costume shines in the bright sunlight. She picks up the matterwand and leaps into the air, flying faster than a speeding bullet.

EXT. ABOVE SELENA'S NEW HOUSE. TALIESEN MOUNTAIN

Supergirl swoops down from the sky and dives through the roof.

INT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM

Supergirl smashes through the ceiling and lands next to the French doors. Ethan and Selena are standing against the opposite wall, next to the veiled mirror.

SUPERGIRL
				You've had your fun, Selena, the game is over.

					ETHAN 
She has hostages.

	SELENA
The Danvers. And two of your little friends.

	SUPERGIRL
It's just one more crime you'll have to pay for.

Ethan points to the conservatory and mimes the words 'out there'. Selena blows on the silver whistle on the chain around her neck.

INSERT: THE SERPENT HOLDING JIMMY OLSEN'S CAGE OPENS ITS MOUTH AND THE CAGE DROPS AWAY.

BACK TO SCENE

Supergirl blows an enormous blast of superbreath out the French doors.

INT. CONSERVATORY

Jimmy Olsen's cage is blown away from the acid bath and he lands in a bank of ferns.

JIMMY
				Hey, what gives?

The blast of superbreath blows the cages of Lucy and the Danvers away from the pool as well. The serpents loose their grip, arid the Danvers and Lucy land beside Jimmy in the fern bank.

INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY

Selena witnesses the destruction of her hostage scheme.

SELENA
				All right, Supergirl. The game's not over till 
the last card's dealt.

Selena opens the lid of the grotesquely swollen Coffer of Shadow sitting beside her on the floor. The OMEGAHEDRON inside spins.

All the FURNITURE in the room suddenly launches itself at Supergirl. Huge oak refectory tables, alabaster thrones, marble urns, iron firegrates, shie1ds and armour, bronze statuary, and razor sharp panes of glass from the windows all shatter themselves against her invulnerable body. Ethan stands in the corner, ducking the stray fragments that come his way.

SUPERGIRL
				You've run out of things to throw, Selena.
	
					SELENA
				Not yet.

Selena points her hand at Supergirl with a gesture of attack. The COFFER OF SHADOW emits a dense black mist that darkens the room. A giant invisible hand seizes Supergirl and hurls her into the alchemical bar with a crash of bottles. Supergirl stands up with the wand held in front of her to ward off another attack.

ETHAN
				It's her shadow-self! Her dark side!

SUPERGIRL
				How do I fight it?

					ETHAN
				Turn it against her.

Supergirl raises the wand and APPLIES IT TO HER OWN BODY. THERE IS A FLASH OF BLINDING LIGHT, and Supergirl is transformed into a perfect image of Selena---as she was at the fairgrounds.

There are now two Selenas in the room---the real one beside the Coffer of shadow, and the one holding the matterwand in the alchemical bar. The Real Selena is first astonished, and then furious.

REAL SELENA
				Power of Shadow, kill her!!

The Second Selena calls out to the SHADOW-SELF in Selena's own unmistakable voice.

SECOND SELENA 
No. I am your mistress. Do not harm me.

REAL SELENA 
Don't listen to her! Kill her! She's lying.

	SECOND SELENA
You are my shadow, you must obey me.

The Real Selena is distracted by the duel of willpower with her double and doesn't notice Ethan creeping along the wall toward the Coffer of Shadow.

Ethan lunges for the shining OMEGAHEDRON inside, and snatches it out just as the heavy lid slams shut with a clang of metal. Ethan rolls over and over on the floor, away from Selena, clutching the, shining ring to him like a football in the end zone after a quarterback sneak on a fourth down trailing seven to six with three seconds on the clock.

ETHAN
				I've got it! The Power Source!

The Real Se1ena cries out with despair.

And then the SHADOW attacks her. The Real Selena cries out as she is surrounded by a black mist that starts slowly choking the life out of her.

REAL SELENA
        (terrified)
No! Stop! Please!


Ethan hands the Power Source to the Second Selena in the bar. 

					SECOND SELENA
				Thank you. I'll take this back to Argo City.

					ETHAN
				It is you, then, really?

Without a word, the Second Selena kisses him on the lips.

SECOND SELENA
				Well?

ETHAN
				It's you all right.

					SECOND SELENA
				I'll make it easy for you.

She again APPLIES THE WAND TO HER OWN BODY. There is a flash of light, and once more Supergirl stands before him, clutching both the Power Source and the wand.

					ETHAN
				I couldn't help what I did, before. She drugged me.


					SUPERGIRL
				I never doubted you for a moment.

					REAL SELENA
				Supergirl. Please! Help! I'm dying...

Supergirl steps toward the corner of the room beside the mirror where the Real Selena is imprisoned in the cloud of blackness. Supergirl touches the SHADOW with her wand. There is a cosmic musical chord, and the SHADOW is destroyed; it falls to the floor in a rain of hard, dark cinders.

The Real Selena rises from the corner of the room where she was released from the grip of the shadow. She looks at herself in the mirror. She is changed into the softer, more innocent person she was at the picnic before she found the Omegahedron. THERE IS NO MORE EVIL SHADOW LOOMING BEHIND HER IN THE MIRROR REFLECTION. She turns to Supergirl and Ethan.

SELENA
				I'm free. I can never thank you enough.

SUPERGIRL
				For what?

				
Selena points to the glittering OMEGAHEDRON Supergirl holds.

SELENA
				Ever since I found that thing I've been like 
a prisoner in a terrible nightmare. You have 
no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time.

SUPERGIRL
				Your nightmares are over. I'm taking this back to 
Argo City where it won't be misused.
         (to Ethan)
You could come too. It might be safer for you.

ETHAN
				No thanks. I have friends in the resistance. They'll 
vouch for me. I figure I might get a million bucks 
for my memoirs.

					SUPERGIRL
				I'll come back as soon as I can.

					SELENA
				What about me? They'll make, hash out of me around 
here.

Supergirl and Ethan exchange a glance. Selena's innocence is the one problem they have not foreseen.

ETHAN
				She's right. They'll string her up.

SUPERGIRL
				Do you want to come to Argo City?

SELENA 
				What's it like?

SUPERGIRL
				It's the most beautiful place in the universe.

SELENA 
				Sounds O.K. to me. Let's go.

Supergirl holds out the matterwand to Selena.

SUPERGIRL
				Grab hold of this. It forms a force field for the 
journey through inner space.

Selena grasps the matterwand and the two of them fly together out the French doors.

CUT TO:

INT. PRISON. DAY

Supergirl and Selena fly through the prison. Supergirl melts open the locks with BEAMS OF HEAT VISION.

The prisoners climb out of their cells cheering and rejoicing.

EXT . HAMBURGER HEAVEN. GAS STATION. DAY

All the people of Midvale are enthusiastically chopping up the billboard portraits of Selena and throwing them into a bonfire in the middle of the street. Statues, banners, mystic symbols, giant tarot cards, old uniforms of her palace guards and youth group --every last remnant of her regime joins the blaze. People are smiling, dancing, holding hands, drinking: the atmosphere is like a block party on the first week in spring.

CUT TO:

EXT. HIGH ABOVE THE SEA.

SUNSET

Selena and Supergirl fly over the ocean toward the setting sun.

SELENA 
Where is inner space?

SUPERGIRL
				It's everywhere. But water is always 
the door.

They plunge down into the sun's reflection on the sea surface.

EXT. INNER SPACE

Supergirl and Selena fly together through the dark reaches of inner space. Supergirl is tired but triumphant. The OMEGAHEDRON glows brightly in her hand. Selena looks around her with awe and wonder.

SELENA
				Will they be angry with me for 
stealing the Power Source?



	SUPERGIRL
They'll be grateful. If you hadn't found 
it, it would still be lost. Look, up ahead.

SELENA
				Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel.

					SUPERGIRL 
				That's home.

P.O.V. OF SUPERGIRL AND SELENA

Argo City floats ahead, seeming to welcome them, its lights, growing brighter and brighter as they return with the lost Source


FADE OUT:



THE END
